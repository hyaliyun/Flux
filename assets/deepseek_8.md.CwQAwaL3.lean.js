However, one name consistently appears in this context: Lope de Vega, a Spanish playwright, poet, and novelist who was immensely prolific during his lifetime. Lope de Vega, full name Félix Lope de Vega y Carpio (born November 25, 1562, Madrid, Spain—died August 27, 1635, Madrid), is considered one of the most significant figures in Spanish Golden Age literature and one of the most productive authors in the history of world literature. He is best known for his contributions to Spanish theater, which were instrumental in defining the structure and form of plays during the Golden Age. While precise figures are difficult to provide, it is estimated that Lope de Vega wrote more than 1,500 plays, with roughly 470 of them having survived to this day. Many of these theatrical works were both popular and influential throughout Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries, making him an undeniable force in the world of literature. He is particularly noted for his creation of the Spanish comedia, a distinctive genre of theater that combined elements of comedy, tragedy, and historical drama. Aside from his theatrical works, Lope de Vega also wrote a large number of poems, which further contribute to his impressive tally of literary works. His poetic opus contains more than 3,000 sonnets, several epic poems, and numerous ballads, elegies, and other lyrical works. He also authored several prose works, such as the pastoral novel \\"La Arcadia\\" and the Byzantine novel \\"El peregrino en su patria.\\" While there are other writers who have produced a substantial quantity of works, such as Ryuho Okawa (a Japanese spiritual leader and author with more than 2,500 books) or Isaac Asimov (a prolific science fiction writer with over 500 books), Lope de Vega's prodigious output places him at the forefront of the most prolific authors in global literary history. His substantial influence on Spanish theater, poetry, and prose has solidified his status as one of the most significant literary figures in the world."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - The stomach churns the food - With the aid of stomach acids - The food becomes a thick liquid - Is then passed to the small intestine.

In a deserted cabin on the way, she gives birth to a stillborn baby. She buries it and continues her journey to Addisford. She arrives there late in the evening and meets Ben Wainwright, the lamplighter at Addisford. He asks her about herself and if she has any relatives in Addisford. Bella replies that she does not have any and she came looking for a man by the name of Arch Wilson. Ben does not know him and seeing her plight, takes her to his house.

Question: If you need to turn a screw more times that requires less force or more force? Text: The trade-off when the threads are closer together, is that more turns of the screw or bolt are needed to do the job because the distance over which the input force must be applied is greater.","output":"Based on the given text, if you need to turn a screw more times, it requires less force to do the job. This is due to the fact that the threads are closer together in this case, resulting in a greater distance over which the input force must be applied. The trade-off described in the text highlights the relationship between the spacing of the threads and the force required to turn a screw. When the threads are closer together, the screw's pitch (the distance between the threads) is smaller. This means that the screw will advance a smaller distance in the linear direction for each complete rotation. As a result, it takes more turns to achieve the same amount of linear movement as compared to a screw with a larger pitch. The advantage of this trade-off is that it requires less force to turn the screw, as the energy is spread over a greater distance and more turns. This can be beneficial in situations where precise adjustments or fine control over the force applied is necessary. In contrast, if the threads are further apart, the pitch is larger, and fewer turns would be needed to achieve the same linear motion. However, this would require greater force to be applied, as the energy is compressed into fewer turns. In conclusion, if you need to turn a screw more times, it requires less force, as the threads are closer together, and the input force is applied over a greater distance. This trade-off is often useful when precision and control over the applied force are important factors."},{"instruction":"Sentence 1: Is there any way I can split the title?

True antique is a collectable at least a century old, according to the majority of antique dealers. This is based on tradition and the customs laws of various countries, though some societies define it as anytime before 1930. True antiques are considered desirable because of their age, beauty, rarity, condition, or personal connection. Near antique is an item between 75 to 99 years old. Vintage is a broad definition that means 'of a certain time'. It is the description used for a range of collectibles, and especially those from the 40s, 50s and 60s. Collectables are any items valued or sought at by collectors. These can be from any era and vary in price depending on rarity and condition. The best antique buys are ones that match your personal interests. Suppose you're an art lover, for example. What would you like to obtain? A certain kind of object, such as antique sculptures? A piece from a certain artist? Artwork from a certain period (ie: post-impressionism)? Think about your personal interests and use that to narrow your search. Read guides about your special interests to determine what exactly you want to collect. Within a certain era or type of item, there are many different brands or styles to consider. The value of your item will vary greatly depending on age, brand, and condition. Keep these three criteria in mind as you research. If you're collecting as a hobby, buy what you love, not what is most valuable. You'll want to collect what you enjoy, not what costs most. If you want to make money buying and selling antiques, research valuable antique items within a certain era or subset. You will work much more efficiently if you can narrow your focus. Choose a focus with high value among antique hobbyists and current trending interest. Whether you collect or sell, have your items appraised. This is to make sure your insurance covers the value of all your antiques in the event of theft, damage or loss. Appraisal will also give you a good idea of what your items are worth. Before you begin shopping, decide beforehand how much you want to spend on antiques. Even the most seasoned antique buyers can get carried away and buy more than they can afford. Keep a close eye on your funds and promise yourself not to exceed them, even if you want to later. If you are selling your items, think about how quickly you will be able to sell the item and for how much (in as accurate an estimate as you can). When you find a valuable item that you think will sell quickly, you may justify going over your budget a little. Use your best judgment, and don't buy anything that will put you in serious debt. Learn from your mistakes. If you overpay on an item or bought something worth less than you thought, that's just part of antique collecting. Like other hobbies, you'll get better as you go along. Summary:","output":"This article educates us about different categories of old items - true antiques (at least 100 years old), near antiques (75 to 99 years old), vintage items (from a specific time like the 40s, 50s and 60s), and collectables (items that people like to collect). The article also gives advice on collecting these items, suggesting that you should collect things you love, unless you plan to sell them. If you're selling, you should try and find items from a specific period or type that are valuable and popular. It's also important to get your items valued, so you know how much they're worth, and always keep an eye on your budget.

It is essential to look at these two sentences as separate instances without making assumptions about a potential connection between them. The first sentence describes an action undertaken by a man, which is cutting giant blocks of ice. This could suggest numerous possible scenarios; it might be his profession, or he could be cutting ice for a specific purpose, like an ice sculpture or to provide ice for an event. The second sentence, on the other hand, creates a completely different scenario. While it is true that the presence of ice often implies that a cold drink might be involved, the provided information does not make any direct reference to the man using the ice he is cutting for a drink. He could be sitting down and enjoying a cold beverage unrelated to the activity of ice-cutting, or he could even be taking a break after cutting the ice. Both sentences can stand independently, and there is no clear correlation between them. In conclusion, the sentence \\"A man is sitting down with a cold drink\\" cannot be considered true based solely on the details given in the sentence \\"a man cutting giant blocks of ice.\\" Without more information or context, it is impossible to determine a definite connection between the two situations described. The man might end up using the ice for a cold drink at some point, but that is not directly implied or stated in the original sentence."},{"instruction":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

The body contains marks of many needle insertions and burns from sulfuric acid, which appear to have been inflicted while the child was still alive. Five years later, Claudia is still unable to get over the death of her child and she is addicted to tranquiliizers. Inexplicably, the presumed dead daughter Angela calls her mother, saying that she is still alive and needs her help.

Forth: 'Spatial', the knowledge about spatial position (e.g., object at the back can be blocked). Fifth: 'Quantity', the knowledge about numbers (e.g., 2 is smaller than 10). Sixth: all other knowledge if above ones are not suitable. You should answer 'Correct' if the reasoning made sense, otherwise, you should answer 'Wrong'.

Well, there's surreal, and there's surreal. There was really only one part of the film that seemed surreal to me, but frankly, it was more confusing than surreal. The other unusual imagery, particularly the lunchroom scene where everybody is on the floor, were so nonsensical they had no meaning. I don't mind imagery that doesn't mean anything, but these scenes just seemed irrelevant. My impression is that the director was trying to convey Logan's inner monologue. I don't know what else would explain what was going on. Unfortunately, nothing I saw gave me any clue what Logan was thinking about, what his perspective was, or even his emotional state. All I could tell was that he wasn't particularly happy with his physical appearance, and that he had a crush on an older boy. I thought the ending signaled what the relationship between the boys had become, but not much else did. Purposely juxtaposing ambiguous scenes with those that were more straightforward seemed more like a cop out than an artistic decision. Still, as tiresome and as content-free the movie was for me, it was a definite change of pace.

How to change your transmission oil Have your materials ready before propping up the car. Drive the vehicle until it's at normal operating temperature. This allows any built-up sediment to be removed.","output":"Once your vehicle has reached its normal operating temperature, safely park it in a level area and turn off the engine. Allow the car to cool down for at least 20-30 minutes to avoid any potential injury due to hot surfaces and components. Next, locate the transmission oil drain plug and place a waste oil container beneath it. Carefully remove the drain plug and let the old transmission oil flow out into the container. Make sure to wear gloves and safety goggles to protect your hands and eyes from hot oil and debris. After the oil has completely drained, clean the drain plug and remove any debris or metal shavings from the plug's magnet. Subsequently, reinstall the drain plug and tighten it to the manufacturer's specifications. Locate the transmission oil fill hole, which is usually on the side of the transmission case, and fill it with the recommended type and quantity of transmission oil as per your vehicle's owner manual. Utilize a funnel or a manual pump to minimize spills. Once you've added the proper amount of new transmission oil, replace the fill hole cap or plug, ensuring it is tightened securely. Start the engine and let it idle for a few minutes to circulate the new oil throughout the transmission's components. Finally, check for any leaks and take the vehicle for a test drive to ensure that the transmission is functioning smoothly and efficiently. Remember to responsibly dispose of the used transmission oil at a designated waste oil collection facility. With the completion of these steps, you have successfully changed your transmission oil, contributing to the longevity and optimal performance of your vehicle's transmission system."},{"instruction":"Le Centre a reçu un budget de 5 millions de dollars par année (2000-2005) pour renforcer le rôle des victimes et faciliter la participation de celles-ci au système de justice pénale, y compris les victimes de violence dans la famille et de violence sexuelle.

This statement informs us that the Center received funding in the amount of five million dollars annually from 2000 to 2005. The purpose of this funding was to enhance the role of victims in the criminal justice system and make it easier for them to participate in it. The inclusion of victims of family violence and sexual violence indicates that the Center took special care to address the unique needs and circumstances surrounding these specific types of crimes. It is crucial to develop strategies and allocate resources to support victims of crime effectively. By doing so, the Center seeks to empower them and ensure they can actively be part of the criminal justice process. This can include providing emotional support, financial assistance, or legal representation to help them understand and navigate the complexities of the justice system. Supporting victims of family violence and sexual violence is particularly important due to the unique characteristics of these crimes. For example, the perpetrators are often known to the victims, making it difficult for them to come forward and participate in the criminal justice process. There may also be a variety of psychological and emotional factors at play, requiring specialized resources and support. In conclusion, between 2000 and 2005, the Center prioritized the needs of crime victims, particularly those of family violence and sexual violence, by investing five million dollars every year to improve their role in and access to the criminal justice system.

Article:","output":"Title: Memories of Tornado Tragedies Reawakened: Past Disasters Continue to Haunt Victims and Communities Introduction: The recent tornado that tore through the once-devastated area has brought back harrowing memories for residents who had already experienced a tragic tornado 14 years ago. In addition to the 2007 disaster that claimed 44 lives, the destruction also evokes memories of the horrific 2011 twister in Joplin, Missouri, and the deadliest tornado in US history, which occurred in 1925. As the community struggles to recover and rebuild, these catastrophic events serve as a sobering reminder of nature's power and the importance of preparedness and community support. The 2007 Tornado: A Deadly Reminder of Nature's Fury Fourteen years ago, a devastating tornado ripped through the same area, leaving 44 people dead in its wake. As the community was still coming to terms with the loss of life and property, the recent tornado has rekindled the trauma for many residents. It's a chilling reminder that nature can strike without mercy and that even as humans work to adapt and respond to such occurrences, there's still the potential for devastating loss. Joplin, Missouri: Where a Twister Turned a Town Upside Down The destruction caused by the recent tornado also harkened back to the 2011 catastrophe that struck Joplin, Missouri. The EF5 tornado, with winds in excess of 200 miles per hour, killed 161 people and injured over 1,000. It was one of the deadliest and most destructive tornadoes in the United States history, leaving a path of rubble and despair where a thriving community once stood. The Joplin twister served as a stark reminder of the unpredictability of tornadoes and the devastation they can leave behind. The Deadliest Tornado on Record: A Tragic and Unforgettable Event As the recent tornado unearthed memories of past disasters, it's worth noting the deadliest tornado in US history, which struck in March 1925. Known as the Tri-State Tornado, this devastating event killed 695 people across Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana, leaving a path of destruction and grief that spanned over 200 miles. The tornado's harrowing impact on communities and families across the three states serves as a potent reminder of the destructive power wielded by these meteorological events. Recovery, Resilience, and Hope: The Path Forward for Tornado-Affected Communities As the community comes together to heal and rebuild in the wake of the recent devastation, it's crucial to remember the lessons learned from past tornado tragedies. Preparedness and communication can directly save lives, and the support provided by a community has a significant impact on recovery and healing. Moreover, acknowledging the pain and trauma brought on by these natural disasters goes a long way in fostering resilience and hope in the face of adversity. In conclusion, the recent tornado touching down in an area previously struck by disaster 14 years ago has reawakened memories of past tragedies, notably the 2011 Joplin tornado and the deadliest tornado in US history, which took place in 1925. As the community recovers and rebuilds, these events underscore the importance of preparedness, communication, and community support in the face of nature's unforgiving and unpredictable wrath. By remembering these harrowing occurrences, communities can work together to overcome adversity and build a stronger, more resilient future."},{"instruction":"Write a question about the article I had to wait in the waiting area with the kids while Jason helped to get the car and trailer off of the truck .

However, I can offer a few insights on how to properly evaluate a review and the factors that might contribute to a proper rating. 1. Clarity and Completeness: A good review should be clear and provide enough information about the product or service being reviewed, including the features or key aspects that the reviewer found important. Based on this criterion, the review \\"Darkweb Security is my Priority\\" lacks sufficient context and details to be considered informative. 2. Perspective and Balance: A helpful review should offer a balanced perspective that acknowledges both the positive and negative aspects, if any, of the product or service being discussed. It might include any limitations or drawbacks that the reviewer encountered. In this case, the review doesn't share any specific experiences, positive or negative, making it challenging to evaluate its balance. 3. Relevance and usefulness: When analyzing a review, it should be relevant to the product or service being reviewed and offer valuable information to potential users or customers. The review \\"Darkweb Security is my Priority\\" seems to convey that the individual prioritizes security in browsing the dark web. However, it does not mention how the specific product or service addressed this need, undermining its usefulness. 4. Credibility and authenticity: Trustworthy reviews often come from verified sources or include information that supports the reviewer's claims.

She seeks shelter there, only to find another pack of zombies. Shortly after, a man named Ben arrives, and the two clear the house of the dead and begin the process of barricading the doors and windows.

Article: A new plan for getting children to and from school is being started by the education authorities in part of Eastern England. This could end the worries of many parents fearful for their children's safety on the roads. Until now the Country Council has only been prepared to provide bus services for children living more than three miles from their school, or sometimes less if special reasons existed. Now it has been decided that if a group of parents ask for help in organizing transport they will be prepared to go ahead, provided the arrangement will not lose money and that children taking part will be attending their nearest school. The new scheme is to be tried out this term for children living at Milton who attend Impington school. The children live just within the three-mile limit and the Council has said in the past it will not undertake to provide free transport to the school. But now they have agreed to organize a bus service from Milton to Impington and back, a plan which has the support of the school's headmaster. Between 50 and 60 parents have said they would like their children to take part. Final calculations have still to be carried out, but a council official has said the cost to parents should be less than PS6. 50 a term. They have been able to arrange the service at a low cost because there is already an agreement with the bus company for a bus to take children who live further away to Impington. The same bus would now just make an extra journey to pick up the Milton children. The official said they would get in touch with other groups of parents who in the past had asked if transport could be provided for their children, to see if they would like to take part in the new scheme.

Elina also contracted tuberculosis, but recovered. Because she was ill for so long, Elina is obliged to repeat a whole year at school. However, since she missed so much schooling as a result, she has been put in a new class with a different teacher, the strict Tora Holm.

Jeremy had always been an advocate for glass cups, claiming that they were far superior to their plastic counterparts. His friends often rolled their eyes whenever he proclaimed this, but he was undeterred. In Jeremy's mind, the conclusion was clear: glass cups had a certain elegance and durability that could not be matched by plastic. One afternoon, Jeremy hosted a small gathering of friends at his apartment. Each guest was immediately handed a glass cup as they walked through the door, much to their bemusement. Sensing their skepticism, Jeremy used this as an opportunity to demonstrate the superiority of glass over plastic. \\"You see,\\" he began, \\"glass cups are simply better than plastic cups because plastic cups are weaker and flimsier.\\" He quickly took out a plastic cup from his cupboard to illustrate his point. Placing both a glass cup and the plastic cup on the table, he encouraged his friends to closely inspect them. As his friends eagerly inspected both cups, Jeremy continued to explain his reasoning. \\"Firstly, glass cups maintain their shape and integrity better than plastic cups. Over time, plastic cups can warp and bend, leading to spills and an unpleasant drinking experience. Moreover, plastic cups are more prone to leaks, as they can crack or develop small holes under stress.\\" He also pointed out the environmental benefits of using glass cups. \\"Glass is a more sustainable option in the long run. It can be endlessly recycled without losing its quality, whereas plastic can only be recycled a limited number of times, eventually ending up in landfills or polluting our oceans.\\" Finally, Jeremy addressed the aesthetic appeal of glass cups, emphasizing that they simply look more elegant and sophisticated. \\"Glass cups provide a sense of refinement and class that can elevate any occasion - be it a formal dinner or a casual get-together.\\" By the end of his impassioned speech, Jeremy's friends were convinced of the merits of glass over plastic cups, and they spent the rest of the evening clinking their glasses together in toasts to the environment, durability, and elegance. Jeremy knew that his preference for glass cups might not change the world overnight, but he could at least start by changing the minds of those closest to him. Through small actions such as using and promoting glass cups over plastic ones, he believed positive change could begin, one glass at a time."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Q: Mammals can feed at various levels of food chains, as herbivores, insectivores, carnivores and what else?

Now, let's think step by step:","output":"A: It is important to note that as an AI, I cannot predict the future actions of a company. However, based on Chick-fil-A's past actions and statements, we can make an informed analysis. Here's a step-by-step explanation: 1. History of Chick-fil-A: Chick-fil-A is a fast-food company founded in the United States by S. Truett Cathy in 1967. It is known for its chicken sandwiches and strong Christian values. The company has historically been closed on Sundays to ensure its employees can attend worship services and spend time with their families. 2. Controversies regarding LGBTQ+ issues: Chick-fil-A faced criticism in the past due to the company's support for organizations that advocated against LGBTQ+ rights. In 2012, Chick-fil-A's President, Dan Cathy, openly opposed same-sex marriage, sparking widespread backlash and boycotts. Additionally, the Chick-fil-A Foundation has made donations to organizations with anti-LGBTQ+ stances, such as the Family Research Council and Salvation Army. 3. Changes in the company's approach: In response to the backlash, Chick-fil-A announced in 2019 that it would stop donating to organizations with histories of anti-LGBTQ+ advocacy. Instead, it would focus its charitable giving on organizations dedicated to education, homelessness, and hunger. The company has not publicly changed its stance on same-sex marriage. 4. Hypothetical sponsorship of a Pride parade: Given Chick-fil-A's past controversies and its decision to stop donating to anti-LGBTQ+ organizations, it is unclear whether the company would sponsor a Pride parade. Pride parades are events that celebrate LGBTQ+ rights, diversity, and acceptance, which may conflict with the company's conservative religious values and its founder's beliefs. However, as the company has made changes in its charitable giving, there might be a possibility that they would consider such sponsorship to foster goodwill and public relations. In conclusion, while it's uncertain if Chick-fil-A would sponsor a Pride parade, their previous actions, values, and controversies would make it less likely. However, the company's more recent changes in charitable giving might point towards a gradual shift in their approach to LGBTQ+ issues."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task you will be given a list of integers.

Iterate through a range starting from 2 up to the square root of the input number (inclusive), and for each number in this range, check if the input number is divisible by this number. c. If the input number is divisible by any number in the range, return False, else return True. Step 3: Filter prime numbers from the input list Use the 'is_prime' function to filter out non-prime numbers from the input list. Create an empty list called 'prime_numbers'. Iterate through the input list, and for each number, check if the 'is_prime' function returns True. If true, append the number to the 'prime_numbers' list. Step 4: Return the resulting list of prime numbers At the end of the iteration, return the 'prime_numbers' list. If there are no prime numbers in the input list, the 'prime_numbers' list will be empty. For the given input: [883, 535] Applying the above steps: Step 1: [883, 535] Step 2: Define the 'is_prime' function Step 3: - Check if 883 is prime using the 'is_prime' function, which returns True (883 is prime) - Add 883 to the 'prime_numbers' list - Check if 535 is prime using the 'is_prime' function, which returns False (535 is not prime) Step 4: Return the 'prime_numbers' list The resulting list of prime numbers is [883]."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"Sure, I'll write a sentence in Spanish as this language is widely spoken.

In the year 2001, the organization KPAK (possibly an abbreviation or acronym for a group or association) extended its support to the Union of Cinematographers of Kyrgyzstan. This union represents the interests and promotes the development of the Kyrgyz film industry, which is an essential component of the nation's culture and identity. During this time, KPAK actively engaged in climbing expeditions to previously unnamed mountain peaks located within Kyrgyzstan. Kyrgyzstan, a Central Asian country, is known for its breathtaking and diverse landscape that includes vast mountain ranges, such as the Tien Shan and Pamir ranges. These mountainous terrains provide ample opportunities for mountaineering, hiking, and outdoor adventure activities. KPAK's involvement in these ascents not only showcased their enthusiasm and commitment to exploring the natural beauty of Kyrgyzstan but also served a symbolic purpose. In recognition of the 60th anniversary of Kyrgyz cinema, the unnamed peaks scaled during these expeditions were later named in honor of this significant milestone in the country's film history. This collaboration between KPAK and the Union of Cinematographers of Kyrgyzstan highlights the importance of fostering a sense of unity and shared pride among the citizens of Kyrgyzstan and the various domains of the country's culture and heritage. The naming of these peaks served as a testament to the endurance and progress of Kyrgyz cinema, celebrating six decades of storytelling, art, and the creative spirit that drives the industry. In conclusion, the events of 2001 involving KPAK's support of the Union of Cinematographers of Kyrgyzstan and their participation in these symbolic mountain climbing expeditions demonstrates the significance of honoring one's cultural achievements.

Scary Monsters and Super Creeps (1980) produced the number-one hit \\"Ashes to Ashes\\", featuring the textural work of guitar-synthesist Chuck Hammer and revisiting the character of Major Tom from \\"Space Oddity\\". The song gave international exposure to the underground New Romantic movement when Bowie visited the London club \\"Blitz\\"—the main New Romantic hangout—to recruit several of the regulars (including Steve Strange of the band Visage) to act in the accompanying video, renowned as one of the most innovative of all time. While Scary Monsters used principles established by the Berlin albums, it was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically. The album's hard rock edge included conspicuous guitar contributions from Robert Fripp, Chuck Hammer, and Pete Townshend. As \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" hit number one on the UK charts, Bowie opened a three-month run on Broadway on 24 September, starring as John Merrick in The Elephant Man.Bowie paired with Queen in 1981 for a one-off single release, \\"Under Pressure\\". The duet was a hit, becoming Bowie's third UK number-one single. Bowie was given the lead role in the BBC's 1982 televised adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's play Baal. Coinciding with its transmission, a five-track EP of songs from the play, recorded earlier in Berlin, was released as David Bowie in Bertolt Brecht's Baal.

Estimates vary for when the last time the Arctic was ice free: 65 million years ago when fossils indicate that plants existed there to as few as 5,500 years ago; ice and ocean cores going back 8000 years to the last warm period or 125,000 during the last intraglacial period.Warming temperatures in the Arctic may cause large amounts of fresh meltwater to enter the north Atlantic, possibly disrupting global ocean current patterns. Potentially severe changes in the Earth's climate might then ensue.As the extent of sea ice diminishes and sea level rises, the effect of storms such as the Great Arctic Cyclone of 2012 on open water increases, as does possible salt-water damage to vegetation on shore at locations such as the Mackenzie's river delta as stronger storm surges become more likely.Global warming has increased encounters between polar bears and humans. Reduced sea ice due to melting is causing polar bears to search for new sources of food.

Context: I will never own a Chanel suit. It is unlikely that I will ever own a (genuine) Chanel handbag. However, a Chanel nail polish was definitely attainable. Whilst they are ridiculously expensive compared with most other nail polishes (AU39), they are still much more affordable than the AU1,000,000,000 a handbag costs (or so I estimate as I have never actually priced one). After seeing swatches of Peridot online, I knew that baby would one day be mine. The other two polishes in the collection - Quartz and Graphite - did not excite me the way Peridot did. That was until I read this review of Graphite on the Polish Police. Suddenly, Graphite was on my radar. It was stuck in my head like an ear worm; another baby, soon to be adopted. I argued with myself for about a month on whether to get these polishes or not. Could I really spend nearly 80 on nail polish. It did seem rather excessive to me. Then, Myers sent me a 10 voucher for my birthday and I got a 30 voucher for doing a survey so the decision was made. For 38 of my own money (less than the cost of two OPI's!) I became the proud owner of Peridot and Graphite. Here is my review of Graphite. Graphite is the most stunningly intriguing nail polish I have ever owned. In the bottle it looks a little bit dull and boring - grey and bland. But on the nail it is completely different. In some lights it is silvery, others a more gun metal grey, and in others it has almost a goldish tone to it. It is super sparkly, yet is not a glitter polish - though in saying that it appears more glitter than shimmer. It is quite opaque. Two coats and you can't see the nail line.

Context: The frenetic lifestyle that many people live today is very harmful. Rushing here and there, being constantly on call, balancing multiple layers of responsibility may give you a sense of accomplishment – even make you feel important, but it takes a huge toll on every aspect of life. When you constantly push yourself to take on more and more challenges, it is easy to lose sight of why you wanted to be successful in the first place. For many, the reason was to be able to spend less time working and enjoy life more. A frenetic, high-pressure lifestyle creates exactly the opposite. There is a very dark side to constantly pushing yourself to produce more and more. Unfortunately, it creeps up on you and becomes a serious case of self-negligence. When you are busy and driven every minute of every day and well into the evening, it is easy to neglect important things in life that keep you healthy, happy, and create quality of life. A continual stream of urgent tasks that must be completed will overshadow the not-so-urgent, but important activities that make life worth living. It is not just physical well-being that is neglected – mental and emotional well-being also suffer when there is no time for self-care. When your daily schedule is crammed to overflowing one of the first areas of neglect is your diet. Eating regular, nutritious meals become a thing of the past. You are not only too busy to sleep or even take a deep breath now and then, there is no time to prepare decent meals Convenience foods, frozen dinners, take out and fast foods become the norm.

For this reason, hamsters make great pets for night owls. Be aware that if you try to pick up your hamster during the day, it will be more likely to bite you. To help keep your hamster happy and healthy, you will need to keep his cage nice and clean. Once per week you should also perform a deep cleaning on your hamster’s cage. Remove everything from your hamster’s cage (including your hamster) and scrub the sides and bottom with warm, soapy water. Then rinse and dry the cage before putting in new bedding, your hamster’s accessories, and your hamster. In addition to a weekly deep clean, you should also do the following every day: Remove and replace any soiled or damp bedding. Remove and dispose of droppings. Check the corners of your hamster’s cage for hidden food. Hamsters have a tendency to stash food for later. It will take some time and patience before your hamster is ready to let you hold him. Build up his trust in you by allowing him to sniff your hand and even give you a little nibble. You can also offer your hamster a treat from your hand to build up his trust in you. Once your hamster is comfortable with you, you can try to pick him up. To pick up your hamster, gently cup both hands around him and lift him slowly out of his cage. Do not swoop in and grab him or you will startle him and cause him to hide from you. Hamsters also need time outside of their cages to be happy. Once you have established trust with your hamster, take him out of his cage once per day for a little supervised playtime outside of his cage. Make sure to keep him in a room where you can monitor his movement. Otherwise he might hide somewhere and make it difficult for you to find him. Make sure that there are no hazards in the area, such as electrical cords, that your hamster might gnaw on. A healthy hamster will be much happier than an unhealthy hamster. If a hamster is well cared for, it may live to be 1-2 years old. Take your hamster for regular check-ups with the veterinarian to make sure that he stays healthy and happy. An unhealthy hamster may have a variety of symptoms, such as dull-looking eyes, matted fur, weight loss, shaking, runny nose and diarrhea. If your hamster is sick, take him to see a veterinarian right away. Hamsters can catch the common cold from humans. If you are sick, avoid holding your hamster until you are well again so that you don’t make him sick. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article is about how to take care of a hamster. It explains that hamsters are awake at night and need a clean cage.

The college gives Asriel a grant to fund a northern expedition. At dinner, Lyra meets Mrs. Coulter, who insists on taking Lyra north as her assistant. Before Lyra leaves, the Master of the college entrusts her with the only remaining alethiometer, a compass-like artifact that reveals the truth. The Magisterium has destroyed all the others. He instructs her to keep it secret, especially from Mrs. Coulter. At Mrs. Coulter's house in a city that resembles a futuristic London, Lyra mentions 'dust', a type of mysterious particle.

This is what prisoners are supposed to do, so it doesn't add more trouble than what they're already facing. 4. \\"Fast for days\\" refers to abstaining from eating for a certain period. While this may impact the prisoner's health, it doesn't threaten the prison's order or security, as it's not an act of defiance or a means of escape. Thus, it doesn't fit the criteria of causing more trouble. 5. \\"Scape jail\\" appears to be a typo. However, if it was intended to be \\"escape jail,\\" it would essentially be the same as \\"attempt to escape.\\" 6. \\"Attempt to escape\\" directly undermines the main objective of the prison system. Escaping or attempting to escape is a serious offense. It compromises the order, security, and control of the prison. This act is typically met with harsh punishment to deter other inmates from trying the same. So, \\"attempt to escape\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it involves a conduct that actively disrupts the established system and is typically met with harsh punishment, hence putting the prisoner in more trouble."},{"instruction":"BackupallimportantcontentsfromUSBdrivebeforeperformingformatoperation What's a sentence that uses these characters?","output":"Be sure to carefully remove all of your special items from your memory stick and put them in a safe place first, then you can make it like new by cleaning it completely."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Information: - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea. - Strømmens Værksted A/S was an industrial company based in Skedsmo, Norway, specializing in the production of rolling stock. Founded in 1873, it remains as a part of Bombardier Transportation. The plant is located just off Hovedbanen west of Strømmen Station. - The term rolling stock originally referred to any vehicles that move on a railway. It has since expanded to include the wheeled vehicles used by businesses on roadways. It usually includes both powered and unpowered vehicles, for example locomotives, railroad cars, coaches, and wagons. - A tram (also known as tramcar; and in North America known as streetcar, trolley or trolley car) is a rail vehicle which runs on tracks along public urban streets, and also sometimes on a segregated right of way. The lines or networks operated by tramcars are called tramways. Tramways powered by electricity, the most common type historically, were once called electric street railways (mainly in the USA). However, trams were widely used in urban areas before the universal adoption of electrification; other methods of powering trams are listed below under \\"History\\". - Skedsmo is a municipality in Akershus county, Norway. It is part of the traditional region of Romerike. The administrative centre of the municipality is the town of Lillestrøm. About one third of the municipal population lives in Lillestrøm. Other important towns are Skedsmokorset, Skjetten and Strømmen. A smaller settlement adjoining Lillestrøm is Kjeller. - Strømmen Station is a railway station on the Trunk Line in Skedsmo, Norway. It is served by the Oslo Commuter Rail line 400 operated by Norwegian State Railways running from Lillestrøm via Oslo S to Asker. The station was opened in 1854 along with the rest of the Trunk Line. - Trondheim Bilruter or TBR was a municipally owned bus company in Trondheim, Norway between 1951 and 1974. It was merged with the tram operators Trondheim Sporvei and A/S Graakalbanen in 1974 to form Trondheim Trafikkselskap. It is now part of Team Trafikk, a subsidiary of Nettbuss. - Bombardier Transportation is the rail equipment division of the Canadian firm Bombardier Inc. Bombardier Transportation is one of the world's largest companies in the rail vehicle and equipment manufacturing and servicing industry. The division is headquartered in Berlin, Germany, and has regional offices and major development facilities in Canada (Montreal and Toronto) and the United States (Plattsburgh, New York). Bombardier Transportation has many minor production and development facilities worldwide. - Nettbuss AS is the largest bus company in Norway, owned by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB). It was established on 10 February 2000 as the continuation of the bus operations from former NSB Biltrafikk. In addition to bus services in major parts of Norway, it also operates buses in Sweden through subsidiaries. - Trondheim Sporvei was a municipally owned tram operator in Trondheim, Norway that existed between 1936 and 1974. The company operated the municipal parts of the Trondheim Tramway until it was merged with A/S Graakalbanen and Trondheim Bilruter to create Trondheim Trafikkselskap. That company has become part of Nettbuss, the largest Norwegian bus company in Norway which is owned by Norwegian State Railways (\\"Norges Statsbaner AS\\"). - The Trondheim Tramway in Trondheim, Norway, is the world's most northerly tramway system, following the closure and dismantling of the Arkhangelsk tramways in Russia. It consists of one 8.8-km-long line, the Gråkallen Line, running from St. Olav's Gate in the city centre through Byåsen to Lian Station in Bymarka. - TS Class 6 was a series of 28 trams and 15 trailers built by Strømmens Værksted for Trondheim Sporvei . They were delivered in two slightly different batches ; ten in 1948 -- 49 and six in 1955 . On 10 October 1956 , almost all operative trams used by the company were lost to the flames . Subsequently , Trondheim Sporvei ordered the Class 6 from Strømmen . Five engines were salvaged from the fire , and were reused in trams 1 through 5 . The remaining deliveries were numbered 10 -- 32 . The trams delivered with new motors , had four NEBB motors with a power output of 43 kW ( 58 hp ) . The Class 6 remained in service until 1984 , when the Class 8 was delivered . Until then , the Class 7 served as the only tram on the Trondheim Tramway . Four trams and one trailer have been preserved by the Trondheim Tramway Museum . - Trondheim Trafikkselskap or TT was the city public transport company for Trondheim, Norway between 1974 and 2001. It operated both the city buses, and the Trondheim Tramway until 1988. The company was owned by the city council. - Electrification is the process of powering by electricity and is usually associated with changing over from another power source. The broad meaning of the term, such as in the history of technology and economic history, usually applies to a region or national economy. Broadly speaking, electrification was the build out of the electrical generating and distribution systems which occurred in Britain, the United States, and other countries from the mid-1880s until around 1950 and is in progress in rural areas in some developing countries. This included the change over from line shaft and belt drive using steam engines and water power to electric motors. - Norges Statsbaner AS, trading as NSB AS and known in English as the Norwegian State Railways, is a government-owned railway company which operates most passenger train services in Norway. Owned by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications, it is also engaged in real estate through Rom Eiendom, bus transport through Nettbuss, cargo trains through CargoNet and Swedish train transport through Tågkompaniet. NSB transported 52 million train passengers and 104 million bus passengers in 2009. The current company was established on 1 December 1996, when the former Norwegian State Railways (18831996) was split into the new NSB, the infrastructure company the Norwegian National Rail Administration and the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate. In 2002 the freight operations were split to the subsidiary CargoNet, and the maintenance department became Mantena. - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - Trondheim, historically Kaupangen, Nidaros and Trondhjem, is a city and municipality in Sør-Trøndelag county, Norway. It has a population of 187,353 (January 1, 2016), and is the third most populous municipality in Norway, although the fourth largest urban area. It is the third largest city in the country, with a population (2013) of 169,972 inhabitants within the city borders. The city functions as the administrative centre of Sør-Trøndelag county. Trondheim lies on the south shore of Trondheim Fjord at the mouth of the river Nidelva. The city is dominated by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), the Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research (SINTEF), St. Olavs University Hospital and other technology-oriented institutions. What is the relationship between 'ts class 7' and 'train'? Answer:","output":"The TS Class 7 refers to a series of trams (also known as streetcars or trolley cars) built for the Trondheim Sporvei, a Norwegian tram operator. Trains and trams are related in that they are both rail vehicles that operate on tracks. However, while trains generally run on separate, dedicated railway lines and can travel long distances, trams typically run on tracks in urban settings along public streets or on segregated rights-of-way for transportation within cities. In this context, the TS Class 7 represents a specific model of trams used in Trondheim's public transportation system, whereas the term \\"train\\" more broadly refers to the rail-based vehicles operating on railways."},{"instruction":"This is some data: Turkmenistan Airlines, hubAirport, Turkmenabat Airport.

We eventually had a technician from John Moore come out to fix this problem. He was nice enough and took the time to explain to me why it had stopped working and how he would fix this. After about 30 minutes he had completed this and then offered as a free service to inspect the electrical parts of the house. He went out back to the fuse box to look and then after inspection offered to show me what he had found. It was mid to late afternoon in the back yard and that’s when the sun is aiming straight to my back yard. I should mention we live in Texas. He went over ever single fuse and wire that we had and explained about the piping and all the other things that go with it and that what we have isn’t what is recommended anymore.

Will they , whose candidate is elected President think all of their problems will vanish , and never to reappear ? Nothing is further from the truth . History shows that power remains in the hands of a chosen few , no matter who is President . What is the narrator so focused on and ranting about ?","output":"The narrator is primarily focused on and ranting about the political promises and expectations that citizens often place upon their elected candidates, particularly the President, and the potential disillusionment that they may experience when those promises do not come to pass. This sense of disillusionment revolves around issues such as job creation, national debt, and overseas job migration, which are often key topics during election campaigns. The narrator highlights the tendency of people to expect a radical turnaround or improvement in their living conditions once their preferred candidate is elected President. This belief that all of their problems will instantly vanish is critiqued, as the narrator states, \\"nothing is further from the truth.\\" The narrator emphasizes that historical patterns demonstrate how real power continues to be concentrated in the hands of a select few, regardless of who occupies the Presidential office. In this context, the narrator seems to be raising awareness about the limitations of political power and the importance of managing expectations in a democratic society. Moreover, the comment on the concentration of power within a \\"chosen few\\" could potentially hint at the influence of special interests or powerful entities, emphasizing the need for increased political awareness and vigilance among the populace. In summary, the narrator's focus and rant revolves around the political promises made during election campaigns, the expectations people place on their elected leaders, the often-unrealistic belief that the President will magically address all issues, and the concentration of real power in the hands of a select few, regardless of the person occupying the Presidential office.

The blaze in Palo Pinto County scorched 6,200 acres by Thursday, according to the Texas Forest Service. The fire is burning near the resort of Possum Kingdom Lake, near the town of Brad, about 100 miles west of Dallas. \\"We feel much better about this fire today,\\" as the blaze is now 50% contained, said John Nichols, a spokesman for the Forest Service. He said evacuations were lifted for some residents forced to evacuate the fire, which was driven by high temperatures and dry winds. The wildfire has destroyed 40 homes and nine RVs since it began Tuesday, the Forest Service said Thursday. Firefighters were receiving support from aerial tankers and helicopters. Authorities are mapping out plans to allow residents to return to their homes, said Palo Pinto County Sheriff Ira Mercer.

Norfolk Island, located in the South Pacific Ocean about 1,400 km east of the Australian mainland, is a small and isolated island, which is characterized by its rich history and strong cultural significance. The island, with its subtropical climate, lush vegetation, and stunning coastline, has a deep-rooted Polynesian and British cultural influence that is evidenced by the diverse heritage sites, customs, and traditions that have shaped its identity over time. The unique location of Norfolk Island has shaped its dynamic history and has contributed to its development as a strategic and economically viable locale. The island was first inhabited by East Polynesian seafarers in the 14th or 15th century. It remained relatively isolated and vibrant in Polynesian traditions until European exploration brought new settlers to the island. Captain James Cook discovered Norfolk Island in 1774, during his second voyage, and upon observing its tall and straight pine trees and fertile soil, he believed it would be ideal for British settlement. Cook named the island after the Duchess of Norfolk, and soon after, it became a part of the British crown. In 1788, Norfolk Island was established as a penal colony, primarily because of its strategic location as a South Pacific base for the British Empire, as well as for its natural resources, such as flax and pine for naval purposes. The first convicts were brought to the island to work in the penal settlement and their tasks involved forced labor in agricultural and construction projects. As a penal colony, the island developed a reputation for its harsh conditions and brutal treatment of prisoners. Even though the population fluctuated with the arrival of new convicts and the departure of others, the settlement on Norfolk Island featured a mix of cultures, as convicts hailed from various parts of the British Empire. The penal colony was closed in 1855, due at least in part to the appalling conditions and lack of financial viability. However, the island's population was given a new breath of life with the resettlement of some of the descendants of the HMAV Bounty mutineers, who were transferred from the overcrowded Pitcairn Island to Norfolk Island in 1856. The two main populations that existed on Norfolk Island at the time were the Polynesian settlers and the newly arrived Pitcairn Islanders. The Pitcairn Islanders brought with them their own unique cultural heritage, which further enriched the island's diversity. Along with their customs, they introduced the Norfolk Island language, which is a blend of old English and Tahitian, highlighting the diverse ancestry of the Norfolk Island community. Today, the islanders celebrate their connection to the Bounty mutineers' descendants with events like Bounty Day, a public holiday celebrated annually on June 8th. In 1901, Norfolk Island was placed under Australian administration but remained a separate possession of the British Crown. In 1935, the Norfolk Island Act introduced the present system of local administration, turning Norfolk Island into a self-governing territory with its own legislative assembly, although Australia maintained the responsibility for defense, police, and customs. In recent years, the government of Norfolk Island faced economic challenges leading to Australian intervention and changes in its administration. In 2016, Norfolk Island became an Australian Territory, which led to the closure of the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly and the creation of a Regional Council responsible for local governance. The unique history, isolation, and maritime significance have shaped Norfolk Island's identity and made it a site of great cultural and historical interest. Today, visitors to Norfolk Island can explore various heritage sites, such as the Kingston and Arthur's Vale Historic Area, which preserves the rich history of the penal settlement era, or immerse themselves in the vibrant customs and traditions that showcase the island's pride in its Polynesian, British, and Pitcairn Islander roots."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence that contains a fact.","output":"The sun is a big, bright ball of fire in the sky that gives us light and warmth every day."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer: speaker from the sub for the following movie plot: The USS Charleston (SSN-704) is equipped with a caterpillar drive and is on station following a nuclear exchange, under the command of Dwight Towers. The nuclear war which contaminated the northern hemisphere was preceded by a standoff between the United States and China after the latter blockaded and later invaded Taiwan. Both countries are destroyed, as is most of the world. The submarine crew finds refuge in Melbourne, Australia, which the radioactive fallout has not yet reached (though radio communications with several radio operators farther north than Australia indicate that radiation has reached their countries and will be in Australia in a few months). Towers places his vessel under the command of the Royal Australian Navy and is summoned to attend a briefing. When Towers (Armand Assante), Australian scientist Julian Osborne (Bryan Brown) and Australian liaison officer Peter Holmes (Grant Bowler) find out there is an automated digital broadcast coming from Alaska in the Northern Hemisphere, the submarine is sent to investigate. En route, the submarine surfaces in San Francisco, where the Golden Gate Bridge has collapsed and the city shoreline is in ruins. A crew member who is from San Francisco abandons ship, planning on dying in his home city, and is left by his shipmates after it is argued that the length of time he has spent outside has already made him sick with radiation sickness. Upon reaching Alaska, Towers and his executive officer go ashore to find no survivors. Entering a house and seeing a dead family huddled on a bed, Towers thinks of his own family and what they must have gone through. The source of the automated digital broadcast is traced to a television station whose broadcast, Towers and his executive officer discover, comes from a solar powered laptop trying to broadcast a documentary via satellite. Towers returns to Melbourne, where Moira Davidson (Rachel Ward) is waiting for him. Realizing the inevitable nuclear cloud will reach Australia, their impending doom begins to unravel the...

Answer:","output":"What did Ash do when he realized they were criminals?"},{"instruction":"evidence consistent or inconsistent with the hunches. Does it follow that \\"The evidence is consistent with proof.\\"? Select from: A). yes B). it is not possible to tell C). no","output":"C). No To fully address this question, it is important to first understand the terminology being used. In the context of this question, \\"hunches\\" refer to intuitive guesses or suspicions. \\"Evidence\\" refers to the information that supports or refutes a claim, while \\"consistent\\" and \\"inconsistent\\" refer to the compatibility of this information with the hunches. Now, let's analyze the statement in the question: \\"The evidence is consistent with the hunches.\\" This statement means that the available information supports the intuitive guesses or suspicions. It means that there is a degree of alignment between the hunches and the evidence. However, this does not necessarily imply that the evidence amounts to \\"proof.\\" Proof is a term that holds different meanings and standards in various fields. In mathematical or logical contexts, for example, proof refers to a conclusive demonstration that establishes the truth of a statement. In scientific or legal areas, proof might represent an overwhelming degree of evidence that confirms the validity of a hypothesis or accusation. The distinction between \\"consistent evidence\\" and \\"proof\\" lies in the strength and conclusiveness of the support provided by the evidence. While consistent evidence aligns with a specific hunch, it may not actually prove the claim to be true. The evidence must meet a higher standard of rigor, quality, and completeness before it can be considered definitive proof. For example, imagine a situation where a detective has a hunch that a particular suspect committed a crime. If the detective uncovers evidence such as the suspect's motive and opportunity, the evidence is consistent with their hunches. However, it doesn't yet provide definitive proof that the suspect carried out the crime; additional evidence, like definitive forensic evidence, may be required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the suspect is indeed the perpetrator. In conclusion, the statement \\"The evidence is consistent with the hunches\\" does not automatically translate to \\"The evidence is consistent with proof.\\" Therefore, the correct answer is C). No, as merely having consistent evidence does not necessarily amount to reliable or conclusive proof."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you will be shown a short story with a beginning, two potential middles, and an ending.

Now, let's understand the hypothesis: \\"A gymnast is doing a routine.\\" This statement suggests that a gymnast is performing a series of movements or exercises as part of a performance or competition. 3. To determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we need to analyze whether the information provided in the premise is enough to conclude that the gymnast is indeed performing a routine. 4.

Vice Minister of Health Gao Qiang told reporters in Beijing that the \\"public health care system in China is insufficient.\\" The Vice Minister of Health also suggested that the government would pick up the costs of care to earthquake victims, many of whom have little or no insurance: \\"The government should be responsible for providing medical treatment to them,\\" he said.\\" Answer: The answer is:","output":"Gao Qiang is of Chinese nationality. The context provided offers significant information to deduce the nationality of Gao Qiang. The discussion primarily revolves around the earthquake that struck an area in China, which has been mostly overlooked in terms of the country's economic growth. It mentions the province of Sichuan, an inland region in China, indicating that the topic concerns Chinese matters. Furthermore, the quote provided is from Gao Qiang, who holds the position of Vice Minister of Health, addressing reporters in Beijing – the capital city of China. Another crucial piece of information from the context is the statement made by Gao Qiang, which reveals the challenges related to public health care in China and the government's responsibility to provide medical treatment to earthquake victims. Therefore, it is highly likely that Gao Qiang's role pertains specifically to the Chinese government, making it reasonable to conclude that his nationality is indeed Chinese. In summary, considering the contextual information revolving around the earthquake in China, the mention of Sichuan province, Gao Qiang's position as Vice Minister of Health, and his address to reporters in Beijing, it can be confidently inferred that Gao Qiang is of Chinese nationality."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence that includes all the following words: architect, build, design, founder","output":"As the founder and lead architect, I meticulously design and supervise the build of every unique project for our clients."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

It was a weeknight and rather dead . Plus Mikel and Darren who took us out do n't go out very often . They explained that the city is so gay that one does n't really have to go into the old gay district . Based on the preceding passage, answer the following question Why would Mikel and Darren not be adventurous hosts for their friends ?","output":"In order to answer the question, I will break down the passage and analyze the given information: 1. The passage is set in San Francisco, which has a reputation for being a hub of LGBTQ+ culture and community; however, the protagonist didn't experience a grand gay adventure. 2. It's mentioned that it was a weeknight and the city was \\"rather dead\\"; this could mean that there were fewer people out and about, and fewer events happening. 3. Mikel and Darren, who hosted the protagonist, don't go out very often. 4. Mikel and Darren explain that the city itself is so diverse and inclusive (\\"so gay\\") that there is no need to visit a specific area or district to experience LGBTQ+ culture and community. Based on these points, I can conclude that Mikel and Darren might not be adventurous hosts for their friends due to the following reasons: 1. They don't go out very often: Since they are not frequent social explorers, Mikel and Darren might not be familiar with the latest events and spots to visit, resulting in a less adventurous experience for their friends. 2. No need to visit a specific district: According to Mikel and Darren, there is no need to visit the old gay district to appreciate the LGBTQ+ culture in San Francisco. This might imply that they do not seek out unique and adventurous experiences specifically related to LGBTQ+ culture. 3. It was a weeknight: The fact that the night was \\"rather dead\\" could indicate that Mikel and Darren might not be aware of, or might not be interested in, offbeat or underground activities that could provide a more adventurous experience on a weeknight. Thus, considering the given information, Mikel and Darren would not be adventurous hosts for their friends due to their infrequent outings, their belief that the city's inclusiveness negates the need to explore specific areas or events, and the timing of the visit on a weeknight."},{"instruction":"If you choose to fly in an airplane, it normally means you have to?

This church, besides being a beacon of faith, is also anticipated to draw tourists and foster good fortune for the village. The atmosphere is full of hope and joy. Andrei, a talented yet introverted artist, is selected to create beautiful frescoes of religious scenes and adorn the church's whitewashed walls. During the initial stages of the project, Andrei finds inspiration in biblical stories and begins to execute his vision on the church walls. He takes immense care and pours his passion into each stroke, as the villagers marvel at his talent. The council of elders, the organizers of the project, have particular expectations regarding the most important painting Andrei must create – the Last Judgement. They believe this piece holds the key to the village's spiritual awakening and success. Act II: As Andrei dives deeper into the creative process, he suffers from unsettling and vivid nightmares depicting frightening images of judgement, sin, and redemption. It seems as if the weight of the villagers' expectations has thrown Andrei into a state of artistic paralysis. This manifestation of stress and anxiety impedes his ability to envision and bring to life the Last Judgement on the pristine church walls. Concerned about this unusual turn of events, the council of elders seek advice from Father Pavel, the village's priest, who suggests that they may need to confront a dark presence causing turmoil within Andrei's soul. Simultaneously, a mysterious, enigmatic figure, Nikolai, arrives in the village claiming to be an art historian who can help Andrei overcome his creative block. Act III: As Nikolai spends time with Andrei, Andrei is reminded of an old legend that involves a similar incident, depicting how an artist struggled to paint the Last Judgement due to his own unresolved guilt and sins. With the support of Nikolai, Andrei examines the truth behind the myth and embarks on a journey of self-discovery to uncover the root of his paralysis. In this introspective journey, Andrei confronts his own fears, moral dilemmas, and shame, which he realizes, are mirrored in the lives of the villagers themselves. As Andrei shares his discoveries with the community, the villagers gradually understand that they must also confront their own imperfections, struggles, and sins in order to find redemption. Act IV: With newfound clarity and courage, Andrei, the council of elders, and the villagers, join in an act of communal confession and forgiveness, purging the village from its collective guilt. Andrei slowly regains his inspiration and finally envisions the Last Judgement in a way that reflects the fragility and strength of humanity. As the church's opening day approaches, Andrei unveils his finished rendition of the Last Judgement—a breathtaking fresco that captures not only the biblical scenes of judgement but also includes subtle touches depicting the villagers' collective journey. At the sight of this masterpiece, the villagers are visibly moved and humbled. In the end, the village becomes a symbol of redemption and spiritual transformation for all, as the frescoes created by Andrei continue to inspire self-reflection and unity among the villagers and visitors alike. Andrei finally finds peace within himself, while the church stands as a reminder of the powerful connection between art, belief, and the human struggle to find meaning."},{"instruction":"Read this: It is also possible to use multiple active elements and combine them together with transmission lines to produce a similar system where the phases add up to reinforce the output.

Justification: Choosing a specific topic will guide us on the development of a context and hypothesis related to it. Topic: Climate change Step 2: Create a context based on the chosen topic. Justification: A context provides the necessary background information that sets the foundation for the hypothesis. Context: Climate change has become a major global concern, with many experts and scientists agreeing that human activities, such as deforestation and burning of fossil fuels, contribute significantly to the increase in greenhouse gases. The release of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO₂), traps heat in the Earth's atmosphere, which leads to global warming. Natural disasters, rising sea levels, and changing ecosystems have been observed as some of the consequences of global warming. Governments, industries, and individuals are implementing various mitigation strategies in an attempt to combat climate change. Step 3: Create a hypothesis based on the context. Justification: A hypothesis is a specific, testable claim that can be supported or refuted through experimentation, observation, or other forms of scientific inquiry. Hypothesis: If the global community adopts more aggressive strategies to reduce CO₂ emissions and promotes sustainable practices, such as afforestation and renewable energy use, then the rate of climate change will decrease, leading to a reduction in the frequency and intensity of natural disasters and lower overall risks associated with rising sea levels."},{"instruction":"Select your answer from the options.

Context: I am always one to at least finish my shift if that happens then talking to my agency if it is agency work or some higher up boss if not. Never mind employers can ask you to leave at any time. After all, job hunting is a huge inconvenience. There is ONE exception to this rule: NOT GETTING PAID. I am not talking about if accounting messes up and you have to wait an extra day or two to get paid. If you are a good employer, I won’t be happy, but I am understanding. I am talking refusing to pay or being even rumored to be not paying. I am not in the volunteer business for business owners. Only happened once… I thought I had a part timer gig being a waiter at an over-priced tourist trap restaurant in the New Orleans French Quarter. As typical for these type of jobs, you do not get to actually wait tables and get tips till a training period is over. Somehow, I did not get the memo that this place did not have “training” but “auditions”, meaning all that silverware I rolled and floors I mopped and food I ran to tables I was not getting paid for! Add to that, if somehow they did not like me, after a week I would not have a job! Now, I understand actors and actresses go to auditions and not get paid all the time. I’ve known a few amateur actors. But, those auditions do not include showing up for a week to work unpaid so maybe you might get hired from talking to them… And waiters don’t do auditions! I left immediately. I think they owed me 30 bucks for half a day’s work at the minimum wage. Tried to go back threatening labor board and all that, but they would not be intimidated.

Reasonable punishment is one of the ways human beings have always learned. Children must understand what punishment is for and know that its source is parental love. As a parent, you will need cognitive tools if you are to adjust unwanted behaviours. Instead of making up a confusing, non-related punishment like, \\"If you ride your tricycle into the street, you will have to balance this book on your head,\\" withdraw a privilege. The child must naturally connect the privilege withdrawal with the behavior: \\"If you ride your tricycle into the street, you lose the use of your tricycle for the rest of the day.\\" Children who are spanked, hit, or slapped are more prone to fighting with other children. They are more likely to use aggression to solve disputes with others. Children exposed to family violence are also more likely to develop Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. . Rewarding your child for good behavior is even more important than punishing your child for bad behavior. Letting your child know when he or she is doing something right will encourage the behavior in the future. If your child behaved well, from sharing his toys at a play date to being patient during a car ride, then let him know you noticed his good behavior; don't just say nothing when your child behaves well and punish him when he does not. Don't underestimate the importance of praising your child for good behavior. Saying, \\"I'm so proud of you for...\\" can make your child feel that his good behavior is really appreciated. You can give your child toys or treats from time to time, but don't make your child think that he deserves a toy any time he does something good. If you want to discipline your child effectively, then you have to be consistent. You can't punish your child for doing something one day, and then give him candy to stop doing it another day, or even say nothing because you're too tired to put up a fight. And if your child does something good, like using the bathroom correctly during potty training, make sure you praise your child every time. Consistency is what reinforces good and bad behavior. If you and a spouse are raising your child together, then you should be a united front against your children, using the same disciplinary methods. There should be no \\"good cop, bad cop\\" routine in your home. If you really want your child to recognize your disciplinary methods, then you have to be able to explain why your child can't do certain things. Do not just tell him not to be mean to other children, or to clean up his toys; tell him why this behavior will be good for him, for you, and for society at large. Making a connection between your child's actions and what they mean will help your child understand your decision-making process. This is an important part of disciplining your child and building his character. If he does something wrong, like throwing his food on the ground, make sure he owns up to the behavior and explains why he did it, instead of blaming it on someone else or even denying it. After your child does something naughty, have a conversation about why it happened. It's important for your child to know that everyone makes mistakes. The mistake isn't as important as the way your child reacts to it. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article is about teaching kids how to behave well and understand right from wrong. It says that parents should use punishments that make sense, like taking away a toy if a child misbehaves with it. It also reminds parents to praise their kids for good behavior and to be consistent with their rules.

When Towers (Armand Assante), Australian scientist Julian Osborne (Bryan Brown) and Australian liaison officer Peter Holmes (Grant Bowler) find out there is an automated digital broadcast coming from Alaska in the Northern Hemisphere, the submarine is sent to investigate. En route, the submarine surfaces in San Francisco, where the Golden Gate Bridge has collapsed and the city shoreline is in ruins.

Scores of civilians were killed at markets and gas stations in Anbar province Tuesday, local leaders told CNN. A militant group called ISIS, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, has been pushing into Iraq, shaking the country, its leadership and, in turn, threatening the region. But what does it mean that Syria reportedly is now attacking its neighbor? Here are some answers to get you up to speed:. What does ISIS want, and how is that related to Iraq and Syria? ISIS includes mostly Sunni militants who want to create an Islamic state across Sunni areas of Iraq and Syria. In the towns it controls in Syria, it has imposed Sharia law. Women must be covered, music is prohibited, girls and boys must not mingle at school. The group's tactics are so ruthless even al Qaeda has distanced itself. For example, ISIS kidnapped more than 140 Kurdish schoolboys in Syria last month and forced them to take daily lessons in radical Islamic theory, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based monitoring group. The militant group was born in Iraq, initially called the Islamic State of Iraq, an umbrella organization headed by al Qaeda. The group's leader, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, served four years in a U.S. prison camp for insurgents, at Bucca in southern Iraq. He was released in 2009. The Islamic State in Iraq relocated to Syria and eventually became known by its new name, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Is ISIS capable of getting what it wants? Regrouping and strengthening in Syria, ISIS became well-financed and highly organized. Today, the group has grown large enough to divide the entire region along sectarian lines, experts say. ISIS has produced and attracted more jihadists and foreign fighters than the war in Iraq ever did. It has more suicide bombers at its disposal, more heavy weaponry and vehicles and more money than any other terrorist organization in the world. It also has launched an intensive and sophisticated media campaign with flashy videos directed at Westerners, enticing them to join the fight. ISIS has also employed a classic guerilla warfare tactic -- the militants live among civilians. It would be difficult to target these militants in general strikes without injuring or killing innocent people. Why would Syria reportedly bomb Iraq now? Bashar al-Assad's regime knows where ISIS bases are inside Syria, but its response to ISIS has been fairly muted for months. The existence of ISIS has helped to justify the Syrian government's often-used line that it is fighting \\"terrorists,\\" and opposition activists have long accused the regime of allowing the group to operate and grow, pointing to the government's constant barrel bombing of civilian neighborhoods in places such as Aleppo, while ISIS positions remain largely untargeted. But since the militant group has taken over large parts of northern Iraq recently, Syria has intensified its targeted campaign of ISIS positions, particularly in Raqqa, Syria, where ISIS has operated its headquarters for some time. Damascus denies bombing positions in Iraq, but several sources, including an eyewitness and the head of the Anbar provincial council, said Syrian warplanes launched this week's strikes. CNN is seeking a response from the Syrian government. It's unlikely al-Assad anticipated that ISIS would achieve such impressive and significant victories in Iraq. The only weapon Syrians have in the border area is air power; Syrian ground forces pulled out long ago. Bombing Iraq now serves to clip ISIS' wings a little. Map: Where ISIS has taken control in Iraq. How are the Iraqi and Syrian conflicts linked? Under Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, the Iraqi government has gradually become closer to the Syrian regime. They share allies such as Iran and Hezbollah and enemies such as al Qaeda, ISIS, Sunni extremists and Saudi Arabia, too. The old colonial borders in the region are disappearing, and a conflict is emerging that is more Sunni versus Shiite. Al-Maliki, some experts said, stoked that sectarian tension even more in a speech Wednesday in which the Shiite leader slammed Sunnis. He blamed his political rivals for \\"coordinating\\" the crisis in Iraq and accused Sunnis of collaborating with militants. See: Al-Maliki changes tune on unity government. What are the Iraq military's shortcomings? Iraq is using its air force -- what's left of it -- to fight back against ISIS. Iraq has initiated airstrikes, but targeting the group means putting a scope on constantly moving targets. ISIS uses pickups, not tanks. Without precise intelligence from the ground, battling ISIS is tough. And it's critical to remember that Iraq lost virtually all its air power with the 2003 U.S. invasion. The Iraqi army crumbled in the face of ISIS' advances. The governor of Kirkuk told CNN that the Iraq force is a \\"checkpoint army,\\" meaning that it is able to set up and run checkpoints but isn't sophisticated enough to fight ISIS cells. The Iraqi army also tends to use a counterproductive strategy of rounding up individuals as a method of control, aggravating the local population. Finally, the Iraqi military is up against a terror organization more powerful than anything that the U.S. military was battling and struggled to overcome. Why has U.S. air power not been used against ISIS in Iraq? Many experts believe that U.S. airstrikes in Iraq are far too risky and might not deliver the results the United States wants. Again, consider that ISIS is mixed among the civilian population. Airstrikes may kill innocent people. And there are logistical questions that have to be answered. Where would the air power come from? Bases in Turkey perhaps? Would Turkey give its green light? Also, some in Iraq perceive that the United States put al-Maliki in power and supported his regime for years, and U.S. interference with air power might not be welcomed. The United States has to worry about Iran, too. U.S. strikes in Iraq could undermine progress Iran and the United States have made on the issue of nuclear weapons. Also, ISIS is not the only group fighting to gain control of Iraq. Sunni insurgent groups that were active during the U.S.-led invasion have also joined in the battle. Sunni tribal leaders all oppose al-Maliki and view him and his Shiite-dominated government as a bigger threat to the country than ISIS. Members of insurgent groups not aligned with ISIS could be killed, possibly creating a new set of enemies. Any U.S. airstrikes in Iraq could further deepen the divide if there's a perception the action was done to bolster al-Maliki's government. It could also further alienate Sunni groups whose support eventually will be needed for any sort of political process to succeed in the country. Op-ed: How ISIS threatens the wider world.

To be precise, this process occurs in the following way: 1. The gravity of the Sun pulls its mass inward, causing it to condense and giving rise to a tremendous amount of pressure. 2. This immense pressure forces atoms of hydrogen to combine (or fuse) in nuclear reactions, creating a helium atom and releasing energy in the process. This is also known as nuclear fusion. 3. The energy generated by these nuclear reactions is transmitted outward in the form of different kinds of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, ultraviolet light, X-rays, and gamma rays, as well as other particles such as neutrinos and solar wind. 4. Most of this energy is released across the electromagnetic spectrum. The visible light emitted by the Sun, along with other forms of electromagnetic radiation, reaches the Earth, warming our planet, providing energy for photosynthesis, and enabling a wide range of critical natural and technological processes to occur.

How many followers will he have if 20000 people unfollowed him in a year? If the answer is '445000'; explain the reasoning:","output":"Let's break down the question step-by-step: 1. Denny has 100,000 followers initially. 2. He gains 1,000 new followers every day. 3. After a year, 20,000 people unfollow him. First, let's calculate how many new followers Denny gains in a year: A year has 365 days, so: New followers in a year = (1,000 new followers/day) x (365 days) = 365,000 new followers Now, let's add the new followers to his initial followers count: Total followers after a year without considering unfollows = (100,000 initial followers) + (365,000 new followers) = 465,000 followers Now we need to account for the 20,000 unfollows: Final Followers count = (465,000 followers) - (20,000 unfollows) = 445,000 followers Answer: In a year, if 20,000 people unfollow Denny, he will have 445,000 followers. The reasoning behind this answer is that we first calculated the number of new followers he gains in a year (365,000) and added that to his initial 100,000 followers. Then we subtracted the 20,000 unfollows to get the final number of followers."},{"instruction":"Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below: Nuclear weapons will clean the air and do good things for the world. Nuclear weapons produce lethal levels of heat and blast, produce radiation and radioactive fallout, exterminate civilian populations, produce social disintegration, contaminate and destroy the food chain, and continue for decades after their use to induce health-related problems.","output":"Based on the text provided, the sentence \\"Nuclear weapons will clean the air and do good things for the world\\" is incorrect and misleading. The text explicitly outlines several highly detrimental and disastrous consequences of using nuclear weapons, which are in stark contrast to the suggestion that they could have positive effects on the world. Here are the key points from the text that refute the given sentence: 1. Lethal levels of heat and blast: The use of nuclear weapons generates extreme heat and immense blast waves that can cause widespread devastation. These effects result in the immediate destruction of buildings, infrastructure, and the environment around the point of detonation. The fires caused by the heat can further damage air quality through smoke and particulate matter. 2. Radiation and radioactive fallout: Nuclear detonations produce intense ionizing radiation and radioactive fallout. Fallout consists of radioactive particles that can contaminate large areas of land, water, and air, rendering them unsafe for humans, animals, and plant life for extended periods. This radiation can cause long-lasting health issues, such as cancer and genetic mutations, leading to suffering and death. 3. Extermination of civilian populations: In addition to the immediate casualties caused by the blast and heat, the radioactive fallout can lead to the long-term extermination of civilian populations through exposure to radiation. The contamination of the environment and resources can cause further harm by forcing survivors to relocate and struggle to access essential needs, such as food, water, and healthcare. 4. Social disintegration: The devastation caused by nuclear weapons disrupts societies on multiple levels, including the breakdown of social structures, economic collapse, and political turmoil. In turn, this disintegration can lead to widespread psychological trauma, displacement, and strife among survivors. 5. Contamination and destruction of the food chain: The use of nuclear weapons can contaminate soil, water, and air, making it difficult, if not impossible, for agriculture to thrive. This contamination can lead to the destruction of the food chain, leaving human and animal populations with scarce and unsafe food sources. 6. Long-term health-related problems: Even after the initial event, nuclear weapons continue to induce health-related issues for decades. Exposure to radiation and contaminated resources can lead to chronic conditions, cancers, and genetic mutations that affect individuals as well as future generations. In summary, the sentence in question does not accurately depict the consequences of nuclear weapons. Instead, the text provided illustrates the catastrophic and long-lasting effects that these weapons have on the environment, human populations, and the world as a whole. Far from \\"cleaning the air\\" and doing \\"good things,\\" nuclear weapons result in widespread devastation, contamination, and suffering."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"Step 1: Choose a language other than English to write a sentence in.

That compares to losses of £1.4m in April, and £932,000 in March. However Action Fraud said it was too early to conclude that the increase was a direct result of the introduction of new pension freedoms in April. That is because victims may report the losses many months after they were actually defrauded. \\"With regards to the recent pension reforms, and the effect that this will have on pension liberation fraud, it is at this stage difficult to draw any conclusions,\\" said a spokesperson for Action Fraud. The pensions minister, Baroness Ros Altmann, agreed with that analysis. She said she was \\"not convinced\\" that the pensions freedoms have led to a rise in fraud. \\"People are a lot more aware of it, and are starting to report it. It can take a long time for people to realise they've lost their money,\\" she told BBC Radio Five Live. Pension liberation fraudsters typically contact those with pension pots, and persuade them they can release the money - for a fee. However they usually do not make it clear that by doing so, the victims can be subject to large tax bills. Anyone under the age of 55 is liable for tax on their liberated pension at a rate of up to 55%. Following the pension reforms, which came in at the beginning of April, those over 55 are liable for income tax on 75% of their savings. Anyone whose income exceeds £150,000 in one year- including the amount taken out of their pension pot - could have to pay up to 45% in tax. The losses reflect the amount the victims owe in tax, plus the fee they have paid to the fraudsters. The figures show that, on average, victims lost £60,500 - in some cases more than half their pension. However, even though the amount of fraud has increased, the number of cases being reported has actually fallen. There were 78 cases of reported fraud in both May and April, down from 82 in March, and 240 in February. Project Bloom has been set up by the government to try and combat such pension fraud. Further tips on how to avoid being scammed are available on the Serious Fraud Office website, as well as elsewhere.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Meanwhile, a subsidence problem that had irreparably damaged at least 10 downtown buildings by 1928 worsened through the 1930s. Dozens of buildings, including the post office and jail, were lost as the earth beneath them sank away. Contributing causes were geologic faulting in the area, blast vibrations from the mines, and erosion that may have been exacerbated by vegetation-killing smelter smoke.Mining continued at a reduced level in the Verde District until 1953, when Phelps Dodge shut down the United Verde Mine and related operations. Jerome's population subsequently fell below 100. To prevent the town from disappearing completely, its remaining residents turned to tourism and retail sales. They organized the Jerome Historical Society in 1953 and opened a museum and gift shop.To encourage tourism, the town's leaders sought National Historic Landmark status for Jerome; it was granted by the federal government in 1967. In 1962, the heirs of James Douglas donated the Douglas mansion, above the UVX mine site, to the State of Arizona, which used it to create Jerome State Historic Park.

Ong speculated that they had \\"jammed their way\\" in. Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way. At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:\\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\\" She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants. At 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty. Marquis soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airline's dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit. At 8:23, the dispatcher tried unsuccessfully to contact the aircraft. After reading the above, is \\"The Cabin Crew\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Who jammed their way into the plane's cockpit?\\"? +no; +yes;","output":"+no; The correct answer is \\"no\\" because \\"The Cabin Crew\\" did not jam their way into the plane's cockpit. The text suggests that the hijackers gained access to the cockpit, but the exact method they used remains unknown. It speculates that they may have stabbed flight attendants to get a cockpit key, forced one of them to open the cockpit door, or lured the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. The cabin crew is not mentioned as the ones who jammed their way into the cockpit."},{"instruction":"Definition: In this task, you are given two facts, and a multiple-choice question.

A: Get dry B: Get warm C: wanted to grap his gun A:","output":"Based on the context provided, it seems that Casey rushed to their car tonight in the rain without a jacket. We can analyze the potential reasons behind Casey's actions by examining each of the given options: A) Get dry - This option suggests that Casey may have rushed to their car in an attempt to find shelter from the rain and get dry. However, it doesn't seem very plausible since Casey didn't wear a jacket, which would have helped to protect them from getting wet in the first place. B) Get warm - This option seems to be the most likely reason for Casey's actions. The context provided states that it was raining, making the weather and environment cold and wet. By rushing to their car without a jacket, Casey might have wanted to get inside the car as quickly as possible to escape the cold and wet environment outside and seek warmth inside the car. The urgency in Casey's actions could have made them forget or neglect wearing a jacket to protect themselves from the rain. C) Wanted to grab his gun - This option suggests that Casey's primary objective was to retrieve a gun from their car. However, there is no context provided that would indicate that Casey was in any danger or required a weapon for protection or any other purpose. Therefore, this option is less plausible when compared to the other two options. In conclusion, based on the context provided, the answer that best answers the question \\"Why did Casey do this?\\" is B: Get warm. It is the most plausible reason for Casey's actions, given that they were in a cold and wet environment and rushing to their car without a jacket."},{"instruction":"Despite the loss the previous week, the Saints could clinch a first-round bye with a win and help. They entered the Meadowlands against a New York Giants team trying to gain momentum that could lead them to a playoff spot. Hoping they could capitalize off the Saints loss, the Giants' first drive saw a 55-yard touchdown pass from Eli Manning to Plaxico Burress. The Saints' offense opened with a three-and-out, but they successfully recovered their punt. A field goal narrowed the score to 7-3. A subsequent Saints drive ended with another field goal. With 10:30 left in the second quarter, the Saints directed a huge, time-eating drive that ended with a touchdown on fourth-down with just 1:56 left in the half. Seven minutes into the third quarter, Reggie Bush sped past the Giants' linebacker corps and scored on a one-yard touchdown, to lengthen the score to 20-7. In the middle of the third quarter, Reggie Bush returned a punt, fell onto his knees (but because nobody touched him he was not down by contact), and he then ran the ball in for a touchdown. However, a challenge revealed that the Giants' punter just barely nicked the leg of Bush, and he was ruled down by contact. Early in the fourth quarter, Deuce McAllister ran it in for the final touchdown of the day, and John Carney sealed it with a 38-yard field goal. The Saints defense was stout throughout the game, shutting out the Giants after their opening touchdown, and never allowing the Giants to run a play in their territory. With the win, the Saints improved to 10-5. The following day, the Dallas Cowboys fell to the revitalized, Jeff Garcia-led Philadelphia Eagles, and the Saints secured the #2 spot in the NFC, and a first-round bye. How many points did the Saints get to get on the board?","output":"To determine the total points the Saints scored in this game, we'll add up all their points from field goals, touchdowns, and extra points. 1. Field goal: 3 points 2. Field goal: 3 points 3. Touchdown + extra point (presumably, as it's not mentioned otherwise): 7 points 4. Reggie Bush's touchdown + extra point (presumably, as it's not mentioned otherwise): 7 points 5. Deuce McAllister's touchdown + extra point (presumably, as it's not mentioned otherwise): 7 points 6.

It connects Place de la Concorde, where the Luxor Obelisk stands, to the impressive Arc de Triomphe. 6. The Catacombs: This underground ossuary, consisting of a network of tunnels beneath Paris, holds the remains of over six million people. The catacombs were created in the 18th century to solve the problem of overflowing cemeteries and provide an alternative for storage of remains, making it a unique and eerie attraction for thrill-seekers. 7. Sainte-Chapelle: Often overshadowed by Notre-Dame Cathedral, the Sainte-Chapelle is a hidden gem that features marvelous Gothic architecture and a collection of stunning stained glass windows that are considered among the most beautiful in the world. It was built in 1248 by Louis IX to house religious relics, including the Crown of Thorns.

Any antigen that causes an allergy is called an allergen. Allergens may be inhaled or ingested, or they may come into contact with the skin. Two common causes of allergies are shown in Figure below . Inhaling ragweed pollen may cause coughing and sneezing. Skin contact with oils in poison ivy may cause an itchy rash. Other common causes of allergies include dust mites, mold, animal dander, insect stings, latex, and certain food and medications. Symptoms of a common allergy such as pollen can include sneezing, a runny nose, nasal congestion and itchy, watery eyes. I am facing a new situation today: Ben studied allergies ever since he experienced an allergic reaction to pollen.

Andy Kaufman is a struggling performer whose act fails in nightclubs because, while the audience wants comedy, he sings children's songs and refuses to tell conventional jokes. As the audience begins to believe that Kaufman may have no real talent, his previously timid \\"foreign man\\" character puts on a rhinestone jacket and does a dead-on Elvis impersonation. The audience bursts into applause, realizing Kaufman had tricked them. He catches the eye of talent agent George Shapiro, who signs Kaufman as a client and immediately lands him a network TV series, Taxi, much to Kaufman's dismay, since he dislikes sitcoms. Because of the money, visibility, and a promise that he can do his own television special, Kaufman accepts the role, turning his foreign man into a mechanic named Latka Gravas. Secretly he hates doing the show and expresses a desire to quit. Invited to catch a different act at a nightclub, Shapiro witnesses a performance by a rude, loud-mouthed lounge singer, Tony Clifton, whom Kaufman wants to guest-star on Taxi. Clifton's bad attitude is matched by his horrible appearance and demeanor. But backstage, when he meets Shapiro in person, Clifton takes off his sunglasses and reveals that he is actually Kaufman.

Step 2: Select an appropriate subject, verb, and object. I'll choose \\"el perro\\" (the dog) as the subject, \\"come\\" (eats) as the verb, and \\"la comida\\" (the food) as the object. Step 3: Combine the chosen words into a proper sentence in Spanish. Putting the subject, verb, and object together, the sentence becomes \\"El perro come la comida.\\" The final sentence: \\"El perro come la comida.\\" Justification: I've chosen Spanish because it's a widely spoken language, and I created a simple yet grammatically correct sentence in that language. The sentence demonstrates a common and easily understood action, making it a good example of a non-English sentence."},{"instruction":"Background: Solar radiation (or sunlight) is the energy Earth receives from the Sun. Earth also emits radiation back into space, but at longer wavelengths that we cannot see. Part of the incoming and emitted radiation is absorbed or reflected by the atmosphere. In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere. Paragraph: Mark was studying the effect of Sun's radiations on Earth. To that end, he studied Sun's radiations, which he labeled as rad A. Then he studied Earth's radiations, which he labeled as rad B. He also learned that longer wavelength radiations would produce heat. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which radiation is not visible, rad A or rad B? Answer:","output":"Rad B is not visible. This is because Earth emits radiation back into space at longer wavelengths that we cannot see, which is referred to as rad B in the given paragraph."},{"instruction":"La inscripción no se descubrió hasta el 1942 en Berkeley, cuando supuestamente se limpiaban algunos fragmentos insignificantes de metal en un baño caliente con soda cáustica y cinc.

Acid rain and its subsequent effects on the environment lead to a chain reaction that causes significant harm to various species and their habitats. When acid rain makes waters acidic, it causes them to absorb aluminum from the soil. This contaminated water then runs off into lakes, streams, rivers, and other water bodies, which ultimately affects the organisms that rely on these sources for survival. Fish and their eggs are particularly sensitive to acidic conditions and high concentrations of aluminum. When they die, it disrupts the aquatic food chain, leaving predators such as birds, mammals, and other fish without a food source. This can result in declining populations of fish-eating species and an overall imbalance in aquatic ecosystems. As fish populations decrease, so do their natural predators and parasites, which can have a cascading effect on the ecosystem. Predatory birds and mammals that depend on fish for their diet may experience population declines, leading to a decrease in predation pressure on other organisms, which can then cause an overabundance of certain species and related consequences. Moreover, acid rain also has a detrimental effect on amphibians like frogs, and on plants in and around the affected water bodies. Frogs are particularly vulnerable to acid rain due to their semi-permeable skin, which can absorb harmful substances present in the water. Many plants, especially those that thrive in water or moist environments, have a limited ability to tolerate acidic conditions. As a result, both frogs and plants can perish, further destabilizing the delicate ecosystem balance. The loss of frogs and plants impacts the terrestrial ecosystem as well. Frogs are essential for controlling insect populations, while plants provide shelter and food for a variety of organisms. With the decline in frog and plant populations, insects and other wildlife that depend on them for survival may also suffer and eventually die. In conclusion, the final step in the process initiated by acid rain is the disturbance and potential collapse of entire ecosystems, both aquatic and terrestrial. This catastrophic outcome can lead to the loss of biodiversity, the extinction of vulnerable species, and long-lasting impacts on the habitats and natural cycles that are essential for maintaining life on Earth. Addressing and mitigating the causes of acid rain, as well as implementing conservation and restoration efforts, are critical to preventing the deterioration of ecosystems and preserving the planet's rich biodiversity for future generations."},{"instruction":"The NES dropped the hardwired controllers, instead featuring two custom 7-pin ports on the front of the console. Also in contrast to the Famicom, the controllers included with the NES were identical to each other—the second controller lacked the microphone that was present on the Famicom model and possessed the same START and SELECT buttons as the primary controller. Some NES localizations of games, such as The Legend of Zelda, which required the use of the Famicom microphone in order to kill certain enemies, suffered from the lack of hardware to do so. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What did the Legend of Zelda require in certain instances to kill enemies?","output":"In certain instances, the Legend of Zelda required the use of the Famicom microphone to kill enemies. The Famicom, which was the Japanese version of the NES, had a microphone built into the second controller. Players could use this microphone to interact with elements within the game. One of the best-known examples is defeating the enemy called Pols Voice, which is sensitive to loud noises. Players could simply blow or shout into the microphone to defeat this enemy. However, due to hardware differences, the NES version of the console lacked the microphone feature that the Famicom had in its second controller. This limitation necessitated alternative solutions for interacting with such enemies in NES localizations of games like The Legend of Zelda. Unfortunately, this meant that certain gameplay mechanics present in the Famicom version could not be replicated in the NES version, leading to a less immersive experience for players."},{"instruction":"Add punctuation: You are now an HEIR of God a jointheir a coheir with CHRIST Not yet an inheritor","output":"You are now an heir of God, a joint heir, a co-heir with Christ.

The band's best-known singles include \\"Come Home\\", \\"Sit Down\\", \\"She's a Star\\" and \\"Laid\\", which also became a hit on American college radio. Following the departure of lead singer Tim Booth in 2001, the band became inactive, but reunited in January 2007 and has gone on to produce a further three albums, cementing their reputation as one of the most iconic live British bands. James's hit single Come Home was voted the greatest ever Manchester anthem in a radio poll. After the disappointing performance of Millionaires the band chose to start anew in their approach to their next album, working with Eno once again. They spent most of 2000 recording the album; writing the songs, then performing them live before actually recording them. They embarked on a small-scale tour in the autumn of that year on which their set lists consisted almost entirely of new material. The album, Pleased To Meet You, was released in July 2001. The album's artwork featured a composite image of the faces of all the band members to create a new person. The album reached only number 11, the lowest position for a James studio album since their signing to Fontana. Shortly after its release, James reached the end of their contract, and Tim Booth announced he was leaving the band to concentrate on other projects of his own. They played a farewell tour of the UK at the end of the year. Their final hometown gig, at the Manchester Evening News arena on 7 December, was recorded for a live CD and DVD, Getting Away With It... Live. Past members Larry Gott and Andy Diagram rejoined them for the tour, and Brian Eno also joined them onstage at London's Wembley Arena during the tour. The albums Gold Mother, Laid, and Whiplash (each containing bonus tracks) were re-released by Mercury Records the following year, as well as a B-sides compilation entitled B-Sides Ultra. A planned compilation of material from the band's Factory and Sire years was announced in 2001, but the album, Strange Dancing, was never released. The first two James albums, Stutter and Strip-mine, were re-pressed in June 2007, but without any additional rarities. Booth continued as a solo artist in 2004 with the release of his solo album Bone, co-written and produced by Lee Muddy Baker.

The movie just drags along its 81 minute life span, and the audience has to suffer the whole way through. Actually there are some positive moments in this film; Charlie Spradling gives a decent performance. She is given some pretty pathetic dialogue and she handles it pretty well. Scott Valentine(Merrideth's boyfriend in Family Ties), on the other hand, is a pretty rough watch. I guess the highlight of his performance is witnessing the guy laying on the beach wearing tiger-patterned chummies....give me a break. Also, Valentine gives us a boorish and pathetic portrayal of a suffering vampire who misses the day(to see a much more convincing rendition of the suffering vampire see Denice Duff in \\"Bloodstorm: Subspecies 4\\").

Please answer step by step:","output":"Step 1: Define the subject and object of interest Subject: Hurricane Harvey - a large and powerful natural weather event, characterized by strong winds, rain, and storm surges. Object of interest: Peregrine falcon - a bird species renowned for its speed, agility, and hunting prowess. Step 2: Understand the concept of \\"catching.\\" In the context of this question, \\"catching\\" is interpreted as the hurricane's ability to sweep up or trap the Peregrine falcon within the hurricane's system – either by trapping the falcon in the midst of its strong winds or by impairing its ability to fly freely, leading it to be captured by the hurricane. Step 3: Assess the capabilities of the subject and object of interest. Hurricane Harvey had maximum sustained winds of around 130 mph (215 km/h) at its peak. Winds at such high speeds can cause significant damage to structures, trees, and other objects in the hurricane's path. Hurricanes are highly unpredictable, with the strength of its winds changing rapidly and covering large areas. Peregrine falcons are known to be the fastest birds in the world, with recorded speeds of up to 240 mph (386 km/h) during their hunting stoop (a high-speed dive). However, their regular flight speeds are significantly lower, averaging around 40-55 mph (64-88 km/h). Moreover, peregrine falcons typically target smaller birds and are not adapted for flying or hunting in extreme weather conditions. Step 4: Analyze the interaction between the subject and object of interest. In a situation where a peregrine falcon is caught near or within Hurricane Harvey, it would be faced with multiple challenges: - The falcon may struggle to maintain stability and control in the face of the hurricane's strong winds. - The intense rain and tumultuous atmospheric conditions could impair the falcon's visibility, making navigation difficult. - Given its much lower regular flight speeds, the falcon may have difficulty outpacing the strong winds. Step 5: Conclude whether Hurricane Harvey could catch a Peregrine falcon. Considering the above points, it is plausible that Hurricane Harvey could potentially \\"catch\\" or trap a peregrine falcon in certain situations – specifically, if the falcon were unable to avoid the hurricane's path or strong weather system, and faced the challenges discussed above. However, as natural events and animal behaviors can be unpredictable, it's worth noting that this conclusion is based on a theoretical analysis and not a guarantee."},{"instruction":"We all come from different walk of life, but all people are what?

Rickey has acted since he was 6, both on and off camera. After school, his grandmother-- a manager and acting coach--helped him develop his skills by doing voice exercises and reading aloud. Voice-over actors do many kinds of acting. They are the voices of cartoon characters on television, in movies and video games, and for communicating toys. In films, they replace the foreign language conversation with English version. They create crowd noises, make commercials, act in radio plays, and record telephone instructions and public announcements. They read books on tape and even record museum tours. Like other actors, voice-over actors need to understand scripts, interpret characters, and breathe correctly. They have to master voice techniques, such as pacing, volume, and range. Sometimes they use their normal voices; other times they change their voices to create different characters or noises. Rickey receives his Danny Phantom scripts only a few days before he tapes each episode . He writes helpful notes on the script to guide himself on speaking his part. Rickey practices, then tapes at the recording studio. He and the other cast members sit in a soundproof booth, acting out their characters as they read their lines into the microphones. \\"The cartoon gets created after we record the words, so we have to imagine everything in our mind,\\" says Rickey.

People who talk and write about this person are amazed by his ability to do this. The sentence we're discussing is like saying, \\"People who talk about him are amazed at how fast he gets to those places.\\" Now, let's think about another idea: \\"Critics mention his lateness when to homicide scenes.\\" This says that these same people are also talking about how late this person is when he goes to the same places. If we think about these two ideas together, they don't make sense, because one says he's very fast, and the other says he's late. So, the first idea does not support the second one."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Jeddah (sometimes spelled \\"Jiddah\\" or \\"Jedda\\" \\"Jidda\\" ) is a city in the Hijaz Tihamah region on the coast of the Red Sea and is the major urban center of western Saudi Arabia.

It is awarded for gallantry \\"in the face of the enemy\\" to members of the British armed forces. It may be awarded posthumously. It was previously awarded to Commonwealth countries, most of which have established their own honours systems and no longer recommend British honours. It may be awarded to a person of any military rank in any service and to civilians under military command although no civilian has received the award since 1879.

His proclamation came during a period of widespread resentment among the Sudanese population towards the oppressive policies of the Turco-Egyptian rulers, and capitalized on the messianic beliefs popular among the various Sudanese religious sects of the time. More broadly, the Mahdiyya, as Muhammad Ahmad's movement was called, was influenced by earlier Mahdist movements in West Africa, as well as Wahhabism and other puritanical forms of Islamic revivalism that developed in reaction to the growing military and economic dominance of the European powers throughout the 19th century. - Central Africa is a core region of the African continent which includes Burundi, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Rwanda.

A:","output":"The entity that has the relation 'part of' with 'Mahdist War' is the joint-rule state of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan (1899–1956), a condominium of the British Empire and the Kingdom of Egypt."},{"instruction":"Given the question: I can use this background: Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick. Now, I have a new situation: Jimbo and Jedd are both farmers who have lakes and water wells downstream from their farms. Jimbo's products have been in high demand recently, so he has started to use very high amounts of fertilizers on his farms. Jedd has recently decreased the amount of fertilizer he uses because his products aren't wanted as much by the people in his town. Answer this question please: Who will be less likely to cause dead zones in their respective lakes? The answer is:","output":"Jedd will be less likely to cause dead zones in their respective lakes. Since Jedd has recently decreased the amount of fertilizer he uses, there will be fewer chemicals entering the lakes and water wells downstream from his farm. This will result in less growth of water plants and algae, reducing the likelihood of dead zones occurring in his lake. In contrast, Jimbo's increased use of fertilizers will increase the risk of dead zones in his lake due to the higher levels of chemicals entering the water."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Information: - The Battle of the Margus was fought in July 285 between the armies of Roman Emperors Diocletian and Carinus in the valley of the Margus River (today Great Morava) in Moesia (present day Serbia). - In the later Roman Empire, bagaudae (also spelled bacaudae) were groups of peasant insurgents who arose during the Crisis of the Third Century, and persisted until the very end of the western Empire, particularly in the less-Romanised areas of Gallia and Hispania, where they were \\"exposed to the depredations of the late Roman state, and the great landowners and clerics who were its servants\\". - Carinus (died 285) was Roman Emperor from 283 to 285. The elder son of emperor Carus, he was first appointed \\"Caesar\\" and in the beginning of 283 co-emperor of the western portion of the empire by his father. Official accounts of his character and career have been filtered through the propaganda of his successful opponent, Diocletian. - Hispania was the Roman name for the Iberian Peninsula. Under the Republic, Hispania was divided into two provinces: Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior. During the Principate, Hispania Ulterior was divided into two new provinces, Baetica and Lusitania, while Hispania Citerior was renamed Tarraconensis. Subsequently, the western part of Tarraconensis was split off, first as Hispania Nova, later renamed Callaecia (or Gallaecia, whence modern Galicia). From Diocletian's Tetrarchy (AD 284) onwards, the south of remaining Tarraconensis was again split off as Carthaginensis, and probably then too the Balearic Islands and all the resulting provinces formed one civil diocese under the \\"vicarius\\" for the Hispaniae (that is, the Celtic provinces). The name, Hispania, was also used in the period of Visigothic rule. - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek: , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic. - Numerian (died 20 November 284) was Roman Emperor from 283 to 284 with his older brother Carinus. They were sons of Carus, a general raised to the office of praetorian prefect under Emperor Probus in 282. - The Roman emperor was the ruler of the Roman Empire during the imperial period (starting in 27 BC). The emperors used a variety of different titles throughout history. Often when a given Roman is described as becoming \\"emperor\\" in English, it reflects his taking of the title \\"Augustus\\" or \\"Caesar\\". Another title often used was \\"imperator\\", originally a military honorific. Early Emperors also used the title \\"princeps\\" (first citizen). Emperors frequently amassed republican titles, notably \\"Princeps Senatus\\", \\"Consul\\" and \\"Pontifex Maximus\\". - The Crisis of the Third Century, also known as Military Anarchy or the Imperial Crisis (AD 235284), was a period in which the Roman Empire nearly collapsed under the combined pressures of invasion, civil war, plague, and economic depression. The Crisis began with the assassination of Emperor Severus Alexander by his own troops in 235, initiating a 50-year period in which there were at least 26 claimants to the title of Emperor, mostly prominent Roman army generals, who assumed imperial power over all or part of the Empire. The same number of men became accepted by the Roman Senate as emperor during this period and so became legitimate emperors. - Diocletian, born Diocles (244312), was a Roman emperor from 284 to 305. Born to a family of low status in the Roman province of Dalmatia, Diocletian rose through the ranks of the military to become cavalry commander to the Emperor Carus. After the deaths of Carus and his son Numerian on campaign in Persia, Diocletian was proclaimed emperor. The title was also claimed by Carus' other surviving son, Carinus, but Diocletian defeated him in the Battle of the Margus. Diocletian's reign stabilized the empire and marks the end of the Crisis of the Third Century. He appointed fellow officer Maximian as Augustus, co-emperor, in 286. - Maximian (c. 250 c. July 310) was Roman Emperor from 286 to 305. He was \\"Caesar\\" from 285 to 286, then \\"Augustus\\" from 286 to 305. He shared the latter title with his co-emperor and superior, Diocletian, whose political brain complemented Maximian's military brawn. Maximian established his residence at Trier but spent most of his time on campaign. In the late summer of 285, he suppressed rebels in Gaul known as the Bagaudae. From 285 to 288, he fought against Germanic tribes along the Rhine frontier. Together with Diocletian, he launched a scorched earth campaign deep into Alamannic territory in 288, temporarily relieving the Rhine provinces from the threat of Germanic invasion. - Augustus (23 September 63 BC 19 August 14 AD) was the founder of the Roman Principate and considered the first Emperor, controlling the Roman Empire from 27 BC until his death in AD 14. - Aelianus was together with Amandus the leader of an insurrection of Gallic peasants , called Bagaudae , in the reign of Diocletian . It was put down by the Caesar Maximianus Herculius in 285 . - Carus (c. 222 July or August 283) was Roman Emperor from 282 to 283, and was 60 at ascension. During his short reign, Carus fought the Germanic tribes and Sarmatians along the Danube frontier with success. He brought stability in the empire and died in 283 aged 61.

Pre-election Budgets are invariably controversial with many entering political folklore, although former Chancellor Ken Clarke has claimed that no Budgets \\"in living memory\\" have changed the outcome of a subsequent election. How have some of Mr Osborne's predecessors dealt with the twin pressures of securing the nation's finances while trying to deliver their party an election victory? 2010: Alistair Darling (24 March) What was announced: In the run-up to his third Budget, Mr Darling ruled out any pre-election giveaways, saying his package would be \\"sensible and workmanlike\\". With the UK having recently emerged from recession and with the annual budget deficit running well in excess of £150bn, Mr Darling said his priorities were to get borrowing down and secure the economic recovery. He announced plans for a number of tax rises on the better-off, saying he would curb personal tax allowances for those earning more than £150,000. With one eye on May's election, he vowed to phase in planned rises in fuel duty, promised an extra £600m for winter fuel allowance and offered to suspend stamp duty on home purchases by first-time buyers of up to £250,000. Among the more eye-catching proposals was a planned 10% rise in duty on cider. There was no increase in VAT despite speculation in advance that it had been considered and rumours of a disagreement between Mr Darling and then Prime Minister Gordon Brown. What happened next? Mr Darling stood down as chancellor five days after the general election when the Conservatives and Lib Dems formed a coalition government, although he remained as shadow chancellor for a further five months. In his \\"emergency\\" Budget in June, the new chancellor George Osborne reversed some of his predecessor's measures, including the 10% tax on cider - although Labour had already effectively ditched the plan due to opposition. However some other measures in Mr Darling's Budget - including a four-year freeze on inheritance tax thresholds - survived the change of government. Mr Osborne also chose not to reverse a rise in the top rate of tax from 40p to 50p, announced by Mr Darling in 2009 but which only came into force in April 2010. The main announcement in Mr Osborne's first Budget was a rise in VAT from 17.5% to 20%, something Labour had flirted with but decided against a few months earlier. 1996: Ken Clarke (26 November) What was announced: Although the 1997 general election was held in May, the Conservatives - trailing Labour badly in the polls at the time - opted to announce their final Budget nearly six months earlier, at the end of November 1996. In his speech, Chancellor Kenneth Clarke said the UK was experiencing a \\"Rolls-Royce recovery - built to last\\" and predicted economic growth of 3.5% in 1997. He cut the basic level of income tax from 24p to 23p and raised inheritance tax thresholds to £215,000. Mr Clarke, the last Chancellor to sip alcohol during his Budget address, reduced duty on spirits but announced a 40% increase on tax on so-called alcopops. What happened next? Following Labour's landslide, Mr Clarke stood for Conservative leader but was defeated by William Hague and had returned to the backbenches by the time Gordon Brown delivered his first Budget in July 1997. Labour had already said it would stick to Conservative spending plans for the first two years and it left a number of other measures in Mr Clarke's final Budget untouched. However, Mr Brown increased tobacco duties by 2p on top of what the Conservatives had done and announced an inflation-linked rise in alcohol duties pending a review of taxation on the industry. Mr Brown also outlined plans to introduce a 10p \\"starting rate\\" of tax on incomes - which took effect in 1999 - and, in the most headline-grabbing move, confirmed the long-trailed £3.5bn windfall tax on the profits of the privatised utilities. 1992: Norman Lamont (11 March) What was announced: Norman Lamont delivered his second Budget as chancellor on 11 March, less than six weeks before the general election. Branding it as a \\"Budget for recovery\\" after the 1990-1991 recession, Mr Lamont announced a £2bn tax giveaway, halving the sales tax on new cars, cutting betting duty and introducing a new 20% income tax band on the first £2,000 of taxable income. Labour attacked the package as a \\"panic-stricken pre-election sweetener\\" while some economists questioned the lack of action to reduce double-digit interest rates. What happened afterwards: The Conservatives narrowly won the 1992 election but Mr Lamont's joy was short-lived as the UK crashed out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism and interest rates rose briefly to 15%. The government's reputation was tarnished by the debacle but Mr Lamont survived to deliver the next Budget in March 1993, where he began a major fiscal consolidation to deal with rising deficit levels. Mr Lamont' decision to introduce VAT on domestic fuel bills - initially at 8% but rising to 17.5% - was attacked as \\"shameful\\" by Labour which said it directly contradicted election promises. He was replaced as chancellor by Ken Clarke two months later and although the economy bounced back the party lost heavily in 1997. 1987: Nigel Lawson (17 March) What was announced: His Budget speech may have been the shortest for more than 100 years but Nigel Lawson's package - delivered weeks before the general election - was one of the most political of the Thatcher era. The Budget contained across-the-board tax cuts worth billions. In what Labour described as a \\"bribes Budget\\", Mr Lawson cut the basic rate of income tax by 2% to 27%, froze excise duties, abolished the tax on on-course betting, cut the duty on unleaded petrol and further reduced so-called \\"death duties\\". What happened next? The Conservatives were comfortably re-elected, albeit with a smaller majority than four years earlier. A year later, Nigel Lawson continued his tax-cutting push, cutting the basic rate of income tax to 25% and increasing personal tax allowances by double the rate of inflation - moves which critics said helped contribute to the inflationary boom which followed. 1979: Denis Healey (April 3) What was announced: Known as the \\"caretaker Budget\\", it came shortly after Labour government lost a vote of confidence in the House of Commons, triggering an election. Prime Minister Jim Callaghan still had to keep the business of government going and Chancellor Denis Healey's statement was designed to ensure taxes continued to be raised until a new administration was elected. Mr Healey had limited room for manoeuvre politically and economically, significant net tax cuts having been agreed the year before, and critics said the whole episode was little more a Finance Bill in disguise. Although child benefit was increased, Labour MPs complained the Budget, which was framed with the co-operation of the Conservatives, was not political enough. What happened next? After Labour's defeat, the new Conservative government delivered an emergency Budget in June, marking a major change in economic direction. Chancellor Geoffrey Howe raised VAT from 12.5% - on luxury items - and 8% on most other goods to a single rate of 15%, a move strongly criticised by Labour. The basic rate of income tax was cut from 33% to 30% and the top rate was reduced from 83% to 60% on \\"earned income\\". 1970: Roy Jenkins (April 15) What was announced: Labour Chancellor Roy Jenkins pledged a \\"modest stimulus\\" to an economy that was still recovering from the devaluation of sterling three years earlier.

Adolf Hitler was a drug-abusing hypochondriac with deformed genitals who regularly consumed a cocktail of amphetamines, bull semen, rat poison and morphine when he sent millions of innocent people to their death. That's according to a new explosive TV documentary based on recently-discovered records and letters from the Nazi leader's obese personal physician, Dr Theodore Morell. In a desperate attempt to show his followers he was the epitome of male virility, the 5ft 8ins German leader downed more than 80 different drugs each day - a shocking habit that some psychiatrists and. historians believe turned an egomaniac into a sadistic mass murderer. According to National Geographic's Nazi Underworld - Hitler's Drug Use Revealed, psychiatrist Professor Nassir Ghaemi claims Hitler's drug abuse exacerbated his manic depression, reducing him to a feeble, trembling figure. 'It’s not whether. Hitler was an amphetamine addict or not – it’s that Hitler had bipolar. disorder and amphetamines made it worse,' he said. 'That. is the issue. That has never been described before and that would. explain a lot why Hitler changed in the late 1930s and the 1940s.' According to the Irish Mirror, a series of letters and medical reports on Hitler commissioned by the U.S. military after the war were released in America, among them interviews with the Fuhrer's six doctors including Morell. The 47-page classified report stated Hitler had chronic eczema, persistent stomach cramps and appalling flatulence. No-one was able to cure the leader's afflictions - until Morell prescribed live bacteria which eased the cramps. A delighted Hitler made Morell his personal physician for nine years, even though his aides called the 'Reichsmaster of injections' a 'quack', 'phony' and 'charlatan'. The. reports show Hitler snorted powdered cocaine to 'clear his sinuses. and soothe his throat' and used eye-drops infused with 10 per cent cocaine. His dosage was lowered when he began to 'crave' the illicit drug. In his drug cabinet, the controversial doctor kept gun-cleaning oil which had been banned from human consumption and. flatulence pills made from rat poison. Morell's methods were so controversial, other doctors believed he was a 'double agent' trying to poison Hitler who was experiencing 'rapid double cycling'. 'Some of his American interrogators. wondered whether he was a double agent, trying to make Hitler so. dysfunctional that he couldn’t win, couldn’t achieve what he wanted,' Ghaemi said. Mis-medication? Hitler's physician Dr Theodore Morell ¿ dubbed the ¿Reichsmaster of injections¿ by Nazis - allegedly prescribed the Fuhrer a cocktail of drugs. Addict: Recently-discovered records and letters from his physician reveal Hitler was prescribed a cocktail of more than 80 different drugs. The report also state Morell injected Hitler with extracts from the. prostate glands or ground testicles of young bulls to boost his libido so he could keep up with his much-younger lover. 'Morell gave Hitler a. preparation called Testoviron, a kind of testosterone preparation,. usually before Hitler was going to spend a night with Eva Braun,' Cambridge. University historian Richard Evans said. 'Eva. Braun was young and much fitter. Hitler was much older, he was lazy, he. didn’t take much exercise and I’m sure he asked Dr Morell to help. him out before he went to bed with Braun.” Morell’s. notes also reveal the dictator feared cancer and was paranoid about catching the common cold. Morell. treated Hitler throughout the war even though other Nazi doctors. blamed him for the dictator’s dramatic deterioration and hyperactive gabbling. The Irish Mirror reports the doctor confessed to administering opiates, morphine,. barbiturates and amphetamines when he was captured by the Allies and accused of criminal. negligence. The revelations have led some historians to speculate whether Hitler's extreme and erratic war-mongering was influenced by his drug addiction. However others fear the claims feed Hitler excusers and. neo-Nazis. 'Just 48. hours before his death Hitler dictated his will, as lucid and alert as. ever. His mental capabilities were normal,' Hans-Joachim. Neumann, author of Was Hitler Ill?, said. 'The Jews were not wiped out because Hitler was ill, but because. most Germans followed his decisions. Hitler always knew what he was. doing.' Write highlights for this article.","output":"1. Adolf Hitler allegedly suffered from manic depression, Parkinson's, and had deformed genitals. 2.

The northern island nation is quickly becoming one of the hottest European destinations for Americans going abroad. In fact, American travelers are the largest source of tourism in Iceland, and it's projected that nearly 325,000 of them have already visited in 2016, according to Vox. It's expected that by the end of the year, more Americans will visit than there are people living in Iceland (the population is about 331,000). It's a big increase from 2010, when just 51,000 Americans visited the country. American interest in traveling to Iceland has increased 65% over the last year, Kayak.com told Vox. That's a lot of attention for a place that is extremely cold in the winter and only gets about four hours of daylight much of the year. There are, however, five reasons that could explain the explosion in tourism from 2010 to 2016, and the biggest one involves a natural disaster. 1. What volcano? The 2010 eruption of volcano Eyjafjallajökull attracted worldwide attention by halting much of Europe's air traffic for an entire week. Iceland's tourism board capitalized on this attention by releasing a PR blitz campaign highlighting the natural beauty of Iceland and putting it in the minds of would-be travelers, according to Vox. That marketing campaign appears to have paid off. 2. Cheap flights But that wouldn't have been enough on its own to bring in so many Americans. The logistics of flying to Iceland also check out. It's a pretty short flight (around 5-6 hours) from the population-dense East Coast — shorter than most would expect it to take to fly to Europe. And more importantly, budget airlines like WOW Air are offering inexpensive flights. A trip to Iceland is 26% cheaper than other European destinations, according to Kayak.com. This summer, WOW Air announced a set of flights from Los Angeles to Keflavik International Airport for just 99. Predictably, those sold out pretty quickly. 3. More places to stay Iceland's popularity is peaking at the same time that services like Airbnb are making travel easier than ever. In addition, Iceland is seeing a major hotel boom in its major cities, and more major luxury brands arriving soon, according to Travel Pulse. Iceland saw a 36% increase in hotel stays from 2014 to 2015. 4. Iceland on TV Iceland's natural beauty has also attracted American media producers, introducing the country to a bevy of TV watchers who otherwise don't pay attention to travel trends. For the sixth season of ABC's \\"The Bachelorette\\" in 2010, producers decided to set an episode in Iceland, no doubt contributing to the massive increase of tourism to the country. 5. Iceland is relatively safe and stable Iceland is shielded from many of the economic and terrorism issues that are troubling mainland Europe. While tourism is declining in many parts of Europe, the trendiness of Iceland makes it a bit of an outlier, notes Vox. It's like going to Europe without really dealing with the problems plaguing the continent. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

Sign up to make permanent This visit only ||||| Iceland — a land of glaciers, snow, and reindeer — is so hot right now. Among young professionals, the sparsely populated European country has suddenly become some sort of exotic pilgrimage: Facebook and Instagram feeds are filled with oversaturated images of fjords, colorful villages, and ice melt waterfalls. The country has been touted as an up-and-coming, must-see destination by a multitude of outlets, from Lonely Planet to National Geographic. In 1949 — the year the Icelandic Tourist Board began tracking foreign travelers — a paltry 5,312 people came to visit. By 1996, just 200,000 tourists from around the globe were coming to Iceland annually. As recently as 2010, the number of visitors was actually decreasing. Then around 2011, things went bonkers: So far this year, a whopping 1.61 million people have journeyed to Iceland — more than triple the figure from 2010. That number is expected to near 2 million by the new year. What the heck is going on here? How did Iceland become the vacation destination du jour? Well, to start, it has a lot to do with Americans. American tourists now outnumber Iceland’s population In 2003, Iceland began tracking where its tourists were coming from — and according to that data, the largest portion hails from the United States. Around 325,000 Americans have visited Iceland in 2016, compared with 51,000 in 2010. That’s a sixfold increase. Currently, Iceland’s population is 332,000 — so this year will mark the first time in history that American tourists to Iceland will outnumber Iceland’s population (represented by the dotted line below). Beyond the Americans who actually book trips to Iceland, hundreds of thousands more seem to be lurking in the shadows, contemplating a future trip. In a recent report, Kayak compiled and analyzed millions of travel-related searches. It found that between 2015 and 2016, there was a 65 percent increase in searches for Iceland hotels and flights. Much of this interest surrounds New Year’s vacations. During winter in Iceland, the sun rises at 11:30 am and sets at 3:30 pm. That’s four hours of daylight. Temperatures hover around the mid-20s, and it rains, on average, two out of every three days. For most people, that doesn’t exactly sound like vacation material. So what is accounting for this recent burst in interest? It began with a volcanic eruption In April 2010, a volcano named Eyjafjallajökull erupted in southern Iceland, causing a weeklong shutdown of the European air industry. It made international headlines for weeks. At the time, Iceland’s tourism industry was flailing, and the country’s economy was still in a post-2008 recession slump. But Iceland’s tourist board had a genius idea: For once, the country was in the spotlight — why not seize the occasion as an opportunity to attract tourists? In the following months, Iceland released a series of videos — “Inspired by Iceland” — featuring dancing, singing, glaciers, fjords, and naked women in hot springs. The campaign was pushed out hard on social media. The chart below shows that this campaign fell right at the point at which tourism shot up in Iceland. While interest in Iceland was sparked by the volcano and ensuing PR campaign, a concerted effort to boost tourism infrastructure sustained it. Between 2010 and 2014, registered tour operators in the country increased from around 175 to 776. Aided by technology, Airbnb and Vrbo rentals sprang up in downtown Reykjavik. But most importantly, flights became a whole lot cheaper. How a budget airline made Iceland a tourist destination Iceland’s sustained growth since 2010 can be summarized in three letters: WOW. Prior to 2012, flights to Iceland could cost as much as 1,500 in peak season. And carriers’ availability was select: Icelandair, the most popular airline running trans-Atlantic Iceland flights, only operated in six major US hubs. In 2012, Iceland-based WOW Air began offering extremely cheap flights from Europe to Iceland, and in 2015 it expanded to North America. As of writing this article, the average flight to Iceland is now 26 percent cheaper than the median airfare to other major tourist destinations. January flights to Iceland can be booked for as low as 380. Looking at the tourism growth graphs earlier in the article, WOW’s expansion to the US had a tremendous impact: Between 2014 and 2015, the number of Americans traveling to Iceland increased from 152,000 to 242,000 — a 37 percent jump. Founded in 1944, Icelandair has also had a considerable impact on tourism. The airline’s free stopover offer and “Stopover Buddy” marketing stunts have helped it retain its throne as Iceland’s most popular airline. But according to industry experts, cheap airfare is only one part of the equation. Iceland is a safe alternative to European “turmoil” Bjorg Gudjons, an agent at Nordika Travel, attributes some of Iceland’s newfound popularity to its reputation as a safe destination. “What we’re seeing in the industry is that fear [due to terror attacks] has deflected travelers from other European countries,” she says. “Iceland is one of safest countries in the world.” According to the Global Peace Index, Iceland is literally the safest country in the world, and has been for many years. (The United States, by contrast, sits 103rd out of 163 ranked countries.) It is plausible that Americans, scared off by semi-recent terror attacks in Paris and Brussels and the bad press surrounding Brexit, are flocking to Iceland as an alternate European destination. While Iceland tourism continues to trend upward, North American tourism elsewhere in Europe has declined. Iceland is the perfect destination for the Instagram generation David Solomito, vice president of marketing at Kayak, says Iceland’s recent popularity could also be partly due to social media. “It’s not too far (from Boston or New York, it’s a quick flight) — but when you’re there, it feels like you’re on a different planet,” he says. “People see pictures on social media and think it’s on Mars. It feels out of this world. It has that Instagram factor.” The impact of Instagram on travel trends is well-documented — and the so-called “Instagram generation” is a case study in envy. The desire to post photos from unfamiliar lands that are still within reach might be driving travelers to explore Iceland as a travel destination. Given the cheap flights, the virtual promise of safety (aside from exploding volcanoes), and scenes like the one above, it’s possible that Iceland’s astronomical rise in tourism has just begun. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Iceland has become an increasingly popular tourist destination, especially among Americans. A combination of factors has contributed to the increase in tourism from 2010 to 2016. The eruption of volcano Eyjafjallajökull in 2010 prompted a successful PR campaign highlighting the beauty of Iceland. At the same time, budget airlines, such as WOW Air, began offering cheap flights from the United States to Iceland. Additionally, an increase in hotel accommodations and Airbnb availability has made it easier than ever to visit. Moreover, TV shows such as ABC's \\"The Bachelorette\\" have showcased Iceland's landscape, further promoting the destination. Finally, Iceland is considered a safe and stable country compared to other European countries dealing with economic and terrorism issues."},{"instruction":"Q: You are given a sentence in Italian.

Plot Outline: Luca, a tech-savvy private detective, is tipped off by an anonymous underworld informant about a planned hit on Mickey, the reformed mob leader turned charity activist. As Luca works around the clock to protect Mickey and find out who's behind the planned assassination, he becomes embroiled in a dense web of lies, betrayal, and loyalties tested to the brink. All the while, the shadowy figure of the informant serves as a complex presence, manipulating events in ways no one can foresee. Plot: The movie begins with the mysterious informant contacting Luca through a secure messaging app, known for its use within the criminal underworld. Luca has spent years trying to bring down criminal gangs, and thereby developed a reputation as a go-to guy for people willing to share valuable information. While initially skeptical, Luca decides to check out the informant's tip. He investigates the digital footprint of the rumored assassination plot on Mickey, a man who once commanded a notorious crime syndicate before turning his back on the gang and dedicating his life to charitable work. As Luca delves deeper into the case, he discovers a dangerous feud simmering within the criminal underworld between Mickey's old gang and a new, more aggressive faction. The latter faction, led by a ruthless and ambitious crime lord named Victor, wants Mickey out of the picture, fearing he knows too much and can act as key witness should the authorities go after Victor. Luca meets Mickey to inform him about the hit and offers his protection. Grateful for the warning but sensing the gravity of the situation, Mickey decides to take action against Victor, enlisting two of his most trusted former enforcers, Frank and Max, to take down the new criminal empire. Under Luca's watchful eye, Mickey's three-man team tracks down Victor's network, digging through the investments, money laundering, and bribery ring that have contributed to Victor's expanding influence. As they piece together the puzzle, they find a portrait of a ruthless, cruel man with little loyalty even within his own ranks. Meanwhile, Luca finds himself drawn further into the informant's web. As the informant's information leads to a succession of raids against Victor's empire, Luca starts to explore the informant's motivations. Why would someone with such detailed knowledge of the criminal underworld attempt to destroy it from within? As the film reaches its climax, Luca discovers the shocking truth: the informant is actually Victor's own right-hand man, Alex. Driven by his distaste for Victor's murderous excesses, and by deep-rooted bitterness for Victor’s violent methods, Alex has been quietly plotting his boss's downfall and Mickey's survival. Fearing exposure, Alex's life hangs in the balance as the house of cards around Victor starts to crumble. In the final confrontation, Victor and his loyalists corner Luca, Mickey, Frank, Max, and Alex in an abandoned warehouse. A pulse-pounding shootout ensues, resulting in the deaths of Frank and Max. Just as all seems lost, the police storm the warehouse, tipped off by one last cryptic message from Alex. Injured and outgunned, Victor flees the scene, only to be run down by Alex in a dramatic car chase, culminating in a nail-biting stand-off. Alex kills Victor just seconds before the police apprehend them both, while Luca and Mickey watch on. In the aftermath, Mickey decides to go into hiding indefinitely under a new identity, grateful to Luca for saving him from the hit and to Alex for unknowingly putting him on the case. Alex takes a plea deal and agrees to testify against the remnants of Victor's crime empire, hoping to make amends for his past life. Luca finds himself haunted by the whirlwind of betrayal, loyalty, and redemption that he has witnessed, his faith in the power of human change both strengthened and shaken. As the informant's dark web finally unravels, Luca's fight for justice and the quest to unmask the shadows hiding within the criminal underworld continues.

It is clear from the phrasing of both questions that the individuals are seeking to understand the nature of Adam and Eve's creation in the biblical narrative, specifically their age or developmental stage at the point of their creation.

Which country released more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere? Spain and Italy participated in a global warming global forum this year. it turns out that Spain uses lots of fossil fuel and natural gas for their economy, while Italy relies on ecological alternatives. Hint: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.

Bill Haslam (R) has approved a measure that will allow Tennessee to bring criminal charges against pregnant women who use drugs for potentially harming their fetuses, even though there isn’t conclusive scientific evidence that being exposed to illicit drugs in the womb causes long-term harm to children. The governor’s approval of the legislation comes despite a massive outcry from reproductive rights and criminal justice groups across the country, who say that criminalizing pregnant women is the wrong policy approach. Threatening to bring charges against women who are struggling with substance abuse dissuades them from coming forward to seek the medical treatment they need. It’s also a policy that disproportionately harms low-income and non-white women. “Today, the Tennessee governor has made it a crime to carry a pregnancy to term if you struggle with addiction or substance abuse,” Alexa Kolbi-Molinas, a staff attorney with the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, said. “This deeply misguided law will force those women who need health care the most into the shadows. Pregnant women with addictions need better access to health care, not jail time.” In a statement accompanying his signature on the bill, Haslam claimed that he had “extensive conversations with experts including substance abuse, mental health, health and law enforcement officials” and will “be monitoring the impact of the law through regular updates with the court system and health professionals.” But most experts — including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Public Health Association — oppose efforts to arrest pregnant women who use drugs. Medical professionals are concerned about women getting the prenatal care they need, since skipping out on those services actually leads to a greater risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, and infant death. Specialists in obstetric medicine and drug addiction called on Haslam to veto the measure. Although drug possession and drug sales can result in criminal charges, states typically do not arrest people simply for using drugs. Addiction is considered to be a medical issue, and under the Constitution’s definition of cruel and unusual punishment, states aren’t allowed to criminalize those types of disorders. But Tennessee is making an exception for pregnant people. “Do we arrest new fathers who come into the emergency room who test positive for drugs? This is not really about arresting pregnant women because they use drugs. This is arresting women because they became pregnant, making them vulnerable to charges of child endangerment for risking harm to a newborn,” Lynn Paltrow, the executive director of National Advocates for Pregnant Women (NAPW), one of the groups that’s been fighting against the criminalization of pregnant women for years, told ThinkProgress in an interview earlier this month. Two years ago, Tennessee barred the use of criminal charges against pregnant women for using drugs, opting to encourage drug-addicted women to enter treatment. Advocates are frustrated that the state is backtracking on that policy, which they supported. “Now we’re seeing the General Assembly take two big steps back,” Farah Diaz-Tello, a staff lawyer for NAPW, recently told the New York Times. “It’s going from a state with some of the best practices to one of the worst.” ||||| Buy Photo Dr. Stephen Patrick, right, and Michael Botticelli, deputy director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, take a close look at a baby inside the NICU on Monday while touring the Monroe Carell Jr. Children’s Hospital at Vanderbilt University.

Bill Haslam signed the legislation Tuesday after \\"extensive conversations with experts including substance abuse, mental health, health and law enforcement officials,\\" he wrote in a statement. \\"The intent of this bill is to give law enforcement and district attorneys a tool to address illicit drug use among pregnant women through treatment programs.\\" The governor's decision comes after a week of mounting nationwide opposition from civil and reproductive rights groups. They argued that criminalization would drive vulnerable women away from drug addiction treatment. \\"I understand the concerns about this bill, and I will be monitoring the impact of the law through regular updates with the court system and health professionals,\\" Haslam wrote. Simple Answer: What's best for babies born to drug-addicted mothers? The law brings back criminalization, which lawmakers had eliminated two years ago as the state moved toward programs that incentivize expecting mothers to get into treatment. Tennessee officials have wrestled with what to do about the growing numbers of infants born dependent on drugs and who often suffer from a condition known as neonatal abstinence syndrome. The legislation would allow mothers to avoid criminal charges if they get into one of the state's few treatment programs. Haslam said he wants doctors to encourage women to get into treatment before delivering their babies so they can avoid charges. The proposal also includes an unusual sunset provision, which means the criminal penalty will be in effect until 2016. At that time, lawmakers will have to revisit the issue. Opponents, including five national medical organizations and local doctors who treat pregnant women, worry that criminalization will scare women away from treatment and reverse last year's Safe Harbor Act, which protected the custody rights of mothers and gave them priority placement into the state's limited number of treatment programs. The director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee — joined by the national ACLU — said she was \\"extremely disappointed\\" by the governor's decision. \\"A pregnant woman struggling with drug or alcohol dependency will now be deterred from seeking the prenatal care she needs,\\" said Hedy Weinberg. Abuse of prescription painkillers has fueled a tenfold increase in such births in the past decade, sending health officials scrambling. There were 921 drug-dependent births in 2013 and 253 so far this year. Reach Tony Gonzalez at 615-259-8089 or on Twitter @tgonzalez.

The strict proposal enjoys bipartisan support — despite objections from doctors. The medical term for what happens when a newborn has withdrawal symptoms a day or two after birth is \\"neonatal abstinence syndrome.\\" At its worst, these babies suffer from seizures; it's not clear whether there might also be lasting effects. Tennessee last year forced every hospital to start reporting such cases, and the numbers have only been going up. As health officials have made drug-dependent babies a priority, the Legislature has taken a more punitive approach. \\"It's always somebody else's fault,\\" says state Rep. Terri Lynn Weaver. \\"What's wrong with: 'You screwed up, you're wrong, you've got to pay the consequences.' What's wrong with that?\\" It's always somebody else's fault. ... What's wrong with: You screwed up, you're wrong, you've got to pay the consequences? Weaver initially wanted to make it possible to charge women with homicide if their drug-dependent newborn died, but ultimately she had to tone it down. The women would now have the option to seek treatment. \\"We can't make her get help herself,\\" says Weaver, \\"but, by golly, we can give her an option and a choice.\\" Weaver is a conservative Republican, but Democrats jumped on board too. State Rep. John DeBerry admits it seems unnatural to punish a pregnant woman for harming her unborn child. \\"We are always trying to save children who should be saved by their families, and I have said if there is a better way, bring it to me,\\" he says. \\"I haven't seen it yet.\\" In some other states, prosecutors have gone after addicts whose newborn dies, trying to charge them with murder. Farah Diaz-Tello of the National Advocates for Pregnant Women points to a case in Mississippi. \\"What Tennessee is doing is creating a law that would permit this kind of prosecution — not for murder,\\" says Diaz-Tello, \\"but it would allow for reckless endangerment, which is a misdemeanor, all the way up to aggravated assault.\\" And an assault charge could mean 15 years behind bars for the mother. Being a poorly controlled diabetic is terrible for pregnancy — probably equally as bad as drug addiction — and we don't legislate those choices. New mother Jackie Bains has returned to a Nashville women's clinic for a checkup. Her son is 7 weeks old and perfectly healthy. Bains says she was hooked on narcotic pain pills when she found out she was pregnant — but she got help. She says it was hard to tell people, but it would have been even harder if she thought she could be punished for her addiction. \\"I mean, some people are worried about going to jail and what it could do. But then you also have to worry about what it would do to the baby, too,\\" she says. \\"I do think it will deter people from wanting to come in to seek help.\\" It's a concern that worries many in the medical community — that the punitive approach, even with its treatment option, will drive away women or encourage more abortions. Jessica Young, an obstetrician at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who specializes in drug treatment during pregnancy, says lawmakers don't fully understand that addiction can be a sickness. \\"Being a poorly controlled diabetic is terrible for pregnancy — probably equally as bad as drug addiction — and we don't legislate those choices,\\" says Young. \\"I just think this is an easy group to pick on because addiction has such a stigma.\\" Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam, a relatively moderate Republican, has been hearing from women's groups around the country asking him to veto the bill, but he says he's comfortable with the final language, given that a woman always has a way to avoid jail time, even after giving birth to a child going through drug withdrawal. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam has approved a measure allowing the state to bring criminal charges against pregnant women who use drugs, potentially harming their fetuses.

Mother of two has since been fired. She and her husband have released rambling YouTube video in which she says that the spirit of the lord had spoken to her.","output":"Title: Dianne Reidy Comes Forward With a Divine Message After Debt Ceiling Vote Introduction: In the aftermath of the contentious debt ceiling vote in the House of Representatives last October, an unlikely figure gained national attention as Dianne Reidy, mother of two, publicly proclaimed a message she says was divinely placed upon her heart. Paragraph 1: Dianne Reidy, previously a quiet and unassuming presence in the House of Representatives, suddenly found herself in the spotlight when she began passionately voicing her beliefs about God's message and the Constitution immediately after the debt ceiling vote. This outburst, which initially surprised and confused onlookers, has had considerable ramifications for Reidy, who has since been fired from her position in the House. Paragraph 2: The events did not end with Reidy's firing, however, as she and her husband later released a lengthy and seemingly disjointed video on YouTube explaining the motivations behind her actions. In this video, Reidy claims that the \\"spirit of the Lord\\" had spoken to her, urging her to communicate her divinely inspired message to the public. Paragraph 3: While some may attempt to discredit Reidy's claims as the irrational ranting of a disgruntled employee, the undeniable intensity and conviction with which she delivered her message has sparked considerable debate and conversations about the role of faith in modern politics. Many people have found themselves questioning whether Reidy's actions were divinely inspired or simply the manifestation of personal beliefs and biases. Conclusion: Dianne Reidy's proclamation in the House of Representatives has created a stir in the political world, prompting discussions about the appropriate expression and influence of religion in politics. While opinions vary on whether Reidy's actions were the voice of divine intervention or a personal commentary on the state of American politics, the incident has undeniably shaken the status quo and inspired reflection on the role of faith in contemporary society."},{"instruction":"I don't reckon the sun's ever come up quite the same since the day it happened.

Formed in 1994, the band is known for its eclectic genre-crossing style, predominately in the fusion of gangsta rap and punk it has termed \\"G-punk\\", but also for its reggae-fused music. The band's cross-genre mix of styles has been cited by journalists as having a considerable impact on rap rock and nu metal, though no firsthand accounts of the band influencing bands in either genre exists and the band itself has denied being a part of these styles, identifying more as a punk rock band utilizing rap vocals in conjunction with other vocal styles (melodic reggae singing, screaming and death growls) rather than being a rap rock band in of itself. One reviewer described the \\"nu metal\\" categorization as being a mistaken association. Context: Hed PE performs a style of music which they have referred to as \\"G-punk\\", a phrase inspired by the term \\"G-funk\\". Hed PE has also described its music as \\"schizophrenic\\". Hed PE's music is a fusion of styles ranging from hip hop, reggae, and ska to hard rock, punk, and heavy metal. Other elements that have been incorporated into this style include blues, funk, jazz and industrial. Jared Gomes' vocal style ranges from melodic singing to rapping, screaming, and death growls. The band's lyrics draw from a number of subjects, including social justice, the existence of extraterrestrial life, criticism of organized religion, the 9/11 Truth movement, cannabis use and sexual intercourse. The band has disassociated itself from nu metal and rap rock, with former guitarist Jaxon stating that \\"I wouldn't call our band nu metal\\" and Gomes noting that his vocal style is wider ranging than simply rapping. Regarding the band's association with nu metal, Kik Axe described the band as being \\"mistakenly lumped\\" into the genre, while Beatdust described the band's sound as helping shape nu metal, listing Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit as bands it believes were influenced by Hed PE. Hed PE itself claims that Linkin Park was influenced by Hed PE's music and that Fred Durst listened to Hed PE frequently while recording Limp Bizkit's debut album; these claims, however, have not been backed up by either Durst or Linkin Park. Gomes, in addition to the 9/11 Truth movement, has expressed support for social liberal politicians such as Nancy Pelosi and president Barack Obama. Previously however, Gomes' 2004 lyrics for Only in Amerika expressed support for nationalism, and called for retaliation against Al Qaeda for the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Question: Were they at one time called nu metal?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, they were at one time called \\"nu metal,\\" which is a type of music that blends heavy metal and other music styles like hip hop, grunge, and funk. But this was kind of like a mistake, sort of like wearing a cat costume to a dog party! Hed PE themselves didn't agree with this label. They think their music is more like a wild mix of different styles - punk rock, hip hop, reggae, and more. It's like they throw a bunch of different musical ingredients into a blender to make their own unique musical smoothie. They don't just want to be known as a rap rock band or nu metal band, they see themselves as a punk rock band who uses many kinds of singing styles. So, while some people may have called them \\"nu metal,\\" the band themselves would say \\"Nope, that's not us!\\""},{"instruction":"26 Что, если кто-нибудь дал бы тебе чек и подписался бы внизу, и если проносишь тот чек всю жизнь в кармане, он—он не принесёт тебе никакой пользы.

The victim's body is found bound in the fetal position and suspended high on a cliff face, his eyes removed and his hands cut off. Niemans learns that the victim was a professor and the University's librarian, Remy Callois, and he seeks out a local ophthalmologist for an explanation to the removal of the eyes. Dr. Cherneze, once on the University staff, explains that the school's isolation led to in-breeding amongst the professors, with increasingly serious genetic disorders. Recently the trend has reversed, with the local village children becoming ill and the college babies remaining healthy. Cherneze hints that the killer is leaving Niemans clues to their motive by removing the body parts that are unique to each individual - the eyes and hands. Niemans questions the Dean and examines the librarian's apartment, where he finds images of athletic \\"supermen\\" juxtaposed with texts on genetic deformities.

When two people engage in a lengthy kiss, they may experience several of the given options. - feeling good: Kissing releases hormones like oxytocin and endorphins, which can lead to a sense of well-being and happiness. - pleasure: During a long kiss, the stimulation of nerve endings in the lips and the release of hormones can generate pleasure for both individuals. - being happy: The close physical and emotional connection experienced during a long kiss can contribute to a general feeling of happiness and contentment. - bad breath: Engaging in a long kiss can lead to bad breath, especially if either individual has not maintained proper oral hygiene. However, this possibility is less likely to be the primary outcome of long kissing than the previous options. - sexual excitement: Kissing can be seen as a form of foreplay, and engaging in a long, passionate kiss can lead to sexual excitement for both individuals involved.

However, under the assumption that a fair evaluation is requested, I would rate this review a 2. To further explain, here's a breakdown of the main aspects of the review: 1. Clarity and Grammar: The review has multiple grammatical errors and lacks clarity. Sentences are fragmented and it's challenging to comprehend the exact issue faced by the reviewer. This makes it difficult for potential users to understand the problem and for developers to address the issue. Consequently, the review loses its effectiveness. 2.

Providing more information would help pinpoint the root cause of the dissatisfaction and allow for practical improvements. 3. Constructive Feedback: The reviewer does mention that there is a need to fix the problems and update the app, but they do not offer any practical suggestions or detailed recommendations on how to solve the issues mentioned.

To calculate the total amount of medicine Mary should take in a day, multiply the dosage (1 teaspoonful) by the number of times she needs to take it (3 times daily): 1 teaspoonful × 3 times daily = 3 teaspoonfuls So, the correct answer to the question is: Mary should take 3 teaspoonfuls in a day. (Option B)"},{"instruction":"It has been subsequently converted by the Dutch to a Protestant church. Does it follow that \\"The church offers no denomination. \\"?","output":"The conversion of a church from one denomination to another, such as the conversion of a Catholic church to a Protestant church by the Dutch, does not automatically imply that the church now offers no denomination. In fact, it typically means that the church now primarily serves the new denomination it has been converted to, in this case, a specific branch of Protestantism. Protestantism is a broad term referring to multiple denominations and sub-sects that emerged as a result of the Protestant Reformation, which began in the early 16th century. Protestant denominations include but are not limited to Lutheranism, Calvinism, Presbyterianism, Anglicanism, and Methodism, among others. Most denominations have their own distinct beliefs, practices, and traditions. When a church transitions from being a Catholic church to a Protestant church, it usually adopts the beliefs and practices of a specific Protestant denomination. However, it is important to note that there are some churches that refer to themselves as non-denominational. Non-denominational churches choose not to affiliate with any specific Protestant denomination, often in favor of a more inclusive and diverse approach to worship and religious practices. These churches may draw from various traditions and engage in activities that resonate with a wider range of believers. It is still important to understand that being non-denominational doesn't mean that the church is devoid of any religious affiliation; it merely means that it doesn't align with one specific denomination within Protestantism. In conclusion, the conversion of a church from one denomination to another does not mean that it becomes non-denominational. The Dutch conversion of a church to a Protestant church likely resulted in the church adopting a specific Protestant denomination. To determine if the church truly offers no denomination, one would need to verify whether it identifies as a non-denominational Protestant church."},{"instruction":"Keep open the possibility of a merger.

Hugh Hare (1606–1667) had inherited a large amount of money from his great-uncle Sir Nicholas Hare, Master of the Rolls. On the death of his father, his mother had remarried Henry Montagu, 1st Earl of Manchester, allowing the young Hugh Hare to rise rapidly in Court and social circles. He married Montagu's daughter by his first marriage and purchased the manor of Tottenham, including the Lordship House, in 1625, and was ennobled as Baron Coleraine shortly thereafter.As he was closely associated with the court of Charles I, Hare's fortunes went into decline during the English Civil War. His castle at Longford and his house in Totteridge were seized by Parliamentary forces, and returned upon the Restoration in a severe state of disrepair. Records of Tottenham from the period are now lost, and the ownership and condition of the Lordship House during the Commonwealth of England are unknown.

Meet criminal record and other legal requirements for the show.\\"","output":"Title: How to Protect Your Invention and Be on a Show Hi kids! Have you ever created something super awesome that you want to share with the world? Well, you can protect your invention by getting a special permission called a patent. Also, you may have a chance to be on a show! Let's talk about how you can do this. 1. Protect Your Invention with a Patent A patent is like a magical shield that keeps your invention safe from people who might want to use it without asking you. When you get a patent, you become the boss of your invention – you decide who can use it and how. Here's how you can do that: - First, make sure you or your parents are legal residents or citizens of the U.S. This is like being part of a big family called the United States. - Next, if you're not yet 18 years old, ask your mom, dad, or another big person who takes care of you (like a guardian) to help you fill out the application. - Be ready for the patent people to take a look at your invention. They need to make sure it's really special, new, and that it works properly. 2. Get Ready for the Show Now that your invention is protected, you might have a chance to be on a show! This is a place where lots of people watch you talk about your invention, and you get to show how cool and important it is. But remember: being on a show comes with some rules you need to follow. Don't worry, I will explain them to you: - You should have a clean criminal record, which means you've never done anything naughty or against the rules set by grown-ups in a serious way. - You might need to make sure you can follow other legal requirements – these are like rules that the people in charge of the show have made up to make sure everyone behaves nicely and does things the right way. If you follow all these steps and meet the rules, you (and your invention) might have a great chance to shine on a show! So, get your creative juices flowing, invent something magical, protect it, and who knows? You might become a little star - shining bright for everyone to see!"},{"instruction":"Translate \\"The method of working has to be minute and stratigraphically very fine.\\" to German?","output":"In German, this sentence would be: \\"Die Arbeitsmethode muss sehr genau und stratigraphisch sehr fein sein.\\" Now to explain it like I would to a five-year-old: Das bedeutet, wie wir arbeiten (Arbeitsmethode) braucht viel Sorgfalt (genau) und wir müssen bei Schichten (stratigraphisch) sehr gut aufpassen (sehr fein).

They were discovered during an archaeological dig at Burnswark in Dumfries and Galloway. Investigations have been ongoing at the flat-topped hill near Lockerbie over the past fortnight. Dark organic soil was also found nearby which could be the remains of a bag or sack for the bullets. Archaeologists have been trying for centuries to assess the role of Burnswark in the Roman occupation One theory is that it may have seen the first battle in the Roman invasion of Scotland around 140 AD. Image caption The dig has been undertaken at Burnswark for the past fortnight During the latest dig, small numbers of the lead bullets were initially found with identical 4mm holes in them which were something of a mystery. However, an expert in sling shot ballistics showed how the deadly weapon would make a terrifying \\"screeching noise\\" after it was fired. Now a much larger find of the bullets has been made. \\"We have had a good second season digging at Burnswark and can confirm that we have excavated the most significant hoard of Roman bullets in Britain,\\" said John Reid, of the Roman heritage group the Trimontium Trust. \\"It is becoming increasingly clear that these are likely to have been deposited in a single brief episode. \\"This greatly strengthens the suggestion of a Roman assault on the hill top which appears to have been occupied at that time.\\" ||||| A bloody assault by Roman legions on a hill fort in Scotland around 1,800 years ago is being pieced together using the remains of Roman missile weapons that were used in the attack. The excavations at Burnswark Hill, in the Dumfries region of southwest Scotland, have unearthed the largest cache of Roman lead sling bullets yet discovered — part of the huge arsenal of missile ammunition used by the attacking legions to subdue the native defenders of the hilltop fort. So many sling bullets and other Roman missiles have now been found at Burnswark Hill that archaeologists think the raid was staged as a warning to anyone who resisted Roman rule: an act of \\"exemplary violence\\" designed to terrorize the Scottish tribes into submission, the researchers said. [See Photos of the Roman Sling Bullets Discovered at Burnswark Hill] \\"You've got a relatively small hill fort [under attack by] a relatively large Roman force, using a relatively large amount of missile material,\\" John Reid, an archaeologist with the Trimontium Trust, the Scottish historical society directing the investigation at the Burnswark Hill site,told Live Science. \\"Exemplary violence is nothing new, and it's certainly not unique to the Romans — but the Romans did it on a grand scale.\\" The researchers estimate that up to 5,000 Roman soldiers took part in the attack, based on the size of two Roman army camps that were built to the north and south of the hilltop fort. The number of people in the hill fort is not known, but judging by the size of the force used to attack them it may have been between 1,000 and 2,000 armed defenders, Reid said, as well as their families and other non-combatants who had taken refuge there from the Romans. Burnswark Hill lies just a few miles north of the chain of forts and ramparts known as Hadrian's Wall, which was built across southern Scotland during the reign of Emperor Hadrian (A.D. 117 to 138) and served for many years as the northern border of the Roman Empire. But Hadrian's successor, Antoninus Pius, who reigned from A.D. 138 to 161, ordered the Roman armies in Britain to subdue the tribes north of the wall. Burnswark Hill may have been first in the firing line, according to the archaeologists. \\"We think that the sling-bullet event at Burnswark Hill was part of the Roman invasion of lowland Scotland, and it may have been the opening event,\\" Reid said. The key to the study has been the discovery of more than 800 lead bullets buried in the ground of the ancient battlefield. The location of the bullets were mapped with specialized metal detectors and used to recreate some of the events of the assault. Similar techniques have been used by battlefield archaeologists to map battles from the early modern period, based on the distribution of lead musket balls. [7 Technologies That Transformed Warfare] But the Burnswark Hill investigation may be the first time the technique has been used to map a battle from the ancient world. \\"Normally, ancient battlefields are entirely invisible, because the projectiles are not detectable: iron will rust away and wood will disintegrate, while stone is undetectable,\\" Reid said. \\"So we are lucky in that Burnswark represents one of the few places in Britain where we know that lead projectiles were used, and we've got metal detector technology that can pick up the distribution of these lead sling bullets and work out the choreography of the action.\\" Several different types of sling bullets have been found at the site, from small lead bullets drilled with holes that the researchers think were designed to make a whistling noise in flight and terrorize their targets, to the largest lemon-shaped sling bullets, which weigh up to 2 ounces (60 grams). Archeologist Andrew Nicholson, who led the excavations at Burnswark Hill in September, explained that the different bullets found at different places on the battlefield hinted at the progress of the raid. [Photos: Ancient Roman Fort Discovered] \\"The interesting thing is that all the whistling sling bullets are from the Roman camp on the south face of the hill fort, so clearly they are using different sling bullets for different purposes,\\" Nicholson told Live Science. \\"Our distribution plan clearly shows that the south side, where we think the final assault took place, is where the whistling bullets are, which is what you would expect for their psychological effect,\\" he said. \\"[But] the north camp, which we've always seen as blocking the escape, simply has the very large, very lethal lemon-shaped bullets.\\" The researchers are now preparing samples of lead from the sling bullets for isotope analysis, which they hope may help them pin down the date of the Roman assault on the hill fort. \\"We know that some of the Roman sling bullets found on Burnswark Hill in the past were made from the same batch of lead as some of the sling bullets found at the Roman fort at Birrens, a mile and half away — and the ones at Birrens are very tightly dated to the early Antonine period,\\" Nicholson said. The researchers are also studying several acorn-shaped sling bullets found at Burnswark Hill that appear to match bullets found at other Roman sites in Scotland, but nowhere else in the former Roman Empire. The acorn-shaped bullets \\"might mark a particular batch of bullets that would end up being allocated to a particular unit or group of units, and this might become an identifier for tracing the movements of those units,\\" Nicholson said.

Movie title: Schindler's List Context: The relocation of Polish Jews from surrounding areas to Krakow begins in late 1939, shortly after the outbreak of World War II, when the German Army defeats the Polish Army in three weeks. Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a successful businessman, arrives from Czechoslovakia in hopes of using the abundant cheap labour force of Jews to manufacture enamelware for the German military. Schindler, an opportunistic member of the Nazi party, lavishes bribes upon the army and SS officials in charge of procurement. Sponsored by the military, Schindler acquires a factory for the production of army mess kits and cooking paraphernalia. Not knowing much about how to properly run such an enterprise, he gains a contact in Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), a functionary in the local Judenrat (Jewish Council) who has contacts with the now-underground Jewish business community in the ghetto. They loan him the money for the factory in return for a small share of products produced (for trade on the black market). Opening the factory, Schindler pleases the Nazis and enjoys his new-found wealth and status as \\"Herr Direktor,\\" while Stern handles all administration. Stern suggests Schindler hire Jews instead of Poles because they cost less (the Jews themselves get nothing; the wages are paid to the Reich). Workers in Schindler's factory are allowed outside the ghetto, and Stern falsifies documents to ensure that as many people as possible are deemed \\"essential\\" by the Nazi bureaucracy, which saves them from being transported to concentration camps, or even being killed.Amon Göth (Ralph Fiennes) arrives in Krakow to initiate construction of a labor camp nearby, Paszów. The SS soon liquidates the Krakow ghetto, sending in hundreds of troops to empty the cramped rooms and shoot anyone who protests, is uncooperative, elderly, or infirmed, or for no reason at all. Schindler watches the massacre from the hills overlooking the area, and is profoundly affected. He nevertheless is careful to befriend Göth and, through Stern's attention to bribery,... Answer:","output":"Oskar Schindler's grave is located at the Catholic Cemetery on Mount Zion in Jerusalem, Israel. After saving the lives of over 1,000 Jews during the Holocaust by employing them in his factories, Schindler emigrated to Argentina after World War II. He eventually returned to Germany and passed away on October 9, 1974. In accordance with his wishes, he was buried in Jerusalem, as a gesture of gratitude and respect for the lives he saved during the war."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Given the below context: The highlight of Doubleday's career came after 7 February 1845 when a young man, who later admitted having spent the prior week \\"indulging in intemperance\\", smashed the Portland Vase, an example of Roman cameo glass and among the most famous glass items in the world, into hundreds of pieces. After his selection for the restoration, Doubleday commissioned a watercolour painting of the fragments by Thomas H. Shepherd. No account of his restoration survives, but on 1 May he discussed it in front of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and by 10 September he had glued the vase whole again. Only 37 small splinters, most from the interior or thickness of the vase, were left out; the cameo base disc, which was found to be a modern replacement, was set aside for separate display. A new base disc of plain glass, with a polished exterior and matte interior, was diamond-engraved \\"Broke Feby 7th 1845 Restored Sept 10th 1845 By John Doubleday\\". The British Museum awarded Doubleday an additional £25 (equivalent to £2,500 in 2016) for his work.At the time the restoration was termed \\"masterly\\" and Doubleday was lauded by The Gentleman's Magazine for demonstrating \\"skilful ingenuity\\" and \\"cleverness ... sufficient to establish his immortality as the prince of restorers\\". In 2006 William Andrew Oddy, a former keeper of conservation at the museum, noted that the achievement \\"must rank him in the forefront of the craftsmen-restorers of his time.\\" Doubleday's restoration would remain for more than 100 years until the adhesive grew increasingly discoloured.

How many ways can the 9 Chiefs of Staff be seated around a circular table? Options: (A) 120 (B) 480 (C) 960 (D) 2520 (E) 6050 Think first, then make a decision. Some random thoughts:","output":"To determine the number of ways the 9 Chiefs of Staff can be seated around a circular table following the given condition, we'll work step by step. 1. Since the table is circular, we can fix the position of one Chief to eliminate rotation equivalence. Let's fix the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) at a position. 2. Now, we need to seat the remaining 8 Chiefs, including the Chief of the National Guard Bureau (CNGB) with the condition that the CNGB shouldn't sit next to the CNO. 3. There are 7 spots left around the table for the CNGB that aren't adjacent to the CNO. 4. Once the CNGB is seated in one of those 7 spots, there are 7 remaining Chiefs to be seated. 5. Since the positions of the remaining 7 Chiefs are distinct, they can be seated in 7! (7 factorial) ways. That means 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 5,040 ways. 6. We need to multiply the number of ways the CNGB can be seated (7) by the number of ways the remaining 7 Chiefs can be seated (5,040 ways). 7. 7 (CNGB positions) × 5,040 (remaining chiefs arrangements) = 35,280 total arrangements. However, the given options do not have 35,280 as an answer. That's because I made a mistake in the number of chiefs left to seat after choosing a position for the CNGB. 5. In reality, there are 7 remaining Chiefs (excluding CNO and CNGB) that need to be seated in 6 remaining positions (not 7). Since the positions of the remaining 6 chiefs are distinct, they can be seated in 6! (6 factorial) ways. That means 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720 ways. 6. We need to multiply the number of ways the CNGB can be seated (7) by the number of ways the remaining 7 Chiefs can be seated (720 ways). 7. 7 (CNGB positions) × 720 (remaining chiefs arrangements) = 5,040 total arrangements.

Her first dress' made from plastic bags and rolled magazines was strange, fun and even charming.However, she only made it to test her creativity. The young designer did not consider starting a commercial venture until she spent a week working at Couture Fashion Week in New York City.There she observed the excitement generated by new and vintage looks and decided to see if her unusual idea would result in as much enthusiasm.She began by creating a line of 12 garbage-inspired dresses.They were a huge success.

In the given premise, the components are: a. Poirot's smile b. Poirot's enigmatical behavior In the given hypothesis, the components are: a. Poirot's smile b. The reason for Poirot's smile: he noticed something interesting Step 2: Analyze if the premise supports the hypothesis. The premise states that Poirot's smile became enigmatical, which means it may have an obscure, hidden, or ambiguous meaning. The hypothesis suggests that Poirot smiled because he noticed something interesting. Step 3: Evaluate whether the hypothesis can be derived from the premise. Based on the information given in the premise, we can say that Poirot's smile was not a random or ordinary smile, as it became \\"enigmatical.\\" This means there was likely a reason for his smile, which could potentially be because he noticed something interesting. However, the premise does not explicitly confirm that Poirot smiled due to noticing something interesting. It only provides information about the nature of his smile, which is enigmatical.

But after three long years, NASA's successor is almost ready to make an entrance. Orion, the agency's newest manned spaceship, is being prepared for its first mission in December. In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \\"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions.

First, let's determine the work rate of Anil and Sunil individually. Anil can complete the work in 12 days, so his work rate will be 1/12 of the work per day. Sunil can complete the work in 25 days, so his work rate will be 1/25 of the work per day. Combine their work rates: Anil's work rate (1/12) + Sunil's work rate (1/25) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 25 is 300. Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with a denominator of 300: Anil's work rate: (1/12) * (25/25) = 25/300 Sunil's work rate: (1/25) * (12/12) = 12/300 Now, add the fractions: Combined work rate = 25/300 + 12/300 = (25+12)/300 = 37/300 This means Anil and Sunil together can complete 37/300 of the work in one day. To find out how many days they will take to complete the work together, divide the total work (1) by their combined work rate (37/300): Days = Total Work / Combined work rate Days = 1 / (37/300) To find the quotient, multiply 1 by the reciprocal of 37/300: Days = 1 * (300/37) Days = 300/37 Days = 8 1/37 So, if Anil and Sunil work together, they will take approximately 8 1/37 days to complete the work.

It covered an area of 190,800 mi² or 494,169 km². According to the testimony of Julius Caesar, Gaul was divided into three parts: Gallia Celtica, Belgica and Aquitania. Archaeologically, the Gauls were bearers of the La Tène culture, which extended across all of Gaul, as well as east to Raetia, Noricum, Pannonia and southwestern Germania during the 5th to 1st centuries BC. During the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, Gaul fell under Roman rule: Gallia Cisalpina was conquered in 203 BC and Gallia Narbonensis in 123 BC. Gaul was invaded after 120 BC by the Cimbri and the Teutons, who were in turn defeated by the Romans by 103 BC. Julius Caesar finally subdued the remaining parts of Gaul in his campaigns of 58 to 51 BC. - Camillo Tanio Boccia (19121982) was an Italian film director and screenwriter active in the 1960s. - A film director is a person who directs the making of a film. Generally, a film director controls a film's artistic and dramatic aspects, and visualizes the script while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfillment of that vision. The director has a key role in choosing the cast members, production design, and the creative aspects of filmmaking. Under European Union law, the director is viewed as the author of the film. - Caesar the Conqueror ( Italian : Giulio Cesare , il conquistatore delle Gallie ) is a 1962 Italian film directed by Tanio Boccia . The scenario is based on Julius Caesar 's Commentarii de Bello Gallico . - The Gallic Wars were a series of military campaigns waged by the Roman proconsul Julius Caesar against several Gallic tribes. Rome's war against the Gallic tribes lasted from 58 BC to 50 BC and culminated in the decisive Battle of Alesia in 52 BC, in which a complete Roman victory resulted in the expansion of the Roman Republic over the whole of Gaul (mainly present-day France and Belgium). While militarily just as strong as the Romans, the internal division between the Gallic tribes helped ease victory for Caesar, and Vercingetorix's attempt to unite the Gauls against Roman invasion came too late. The wars paved the way for Julius Caesar to become the sole ruler of the Roman Republic. - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek: , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic. - Commentarii de Bello Gallico, also simply Bellum Gallicum, is Julius Caesar's firsthand account of the Gallic Wars, written as a third-person narrative. In it Caesar describes the battles and intrigues that took place in the nine years he spent fighting the Germanic peoples and Celtic peoples in Gaul that opposed Roman conquest. - The Roman Republic was the era of ancient Roman civilization beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom, traditionally dated to 509 BC, and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire. It was during this period that Rome's control expanded from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world. - Gaius Julius Caesar (13 July 100 BC 15 March 44 BC), known as Julius Caesar, was a Roman politician, general, and notable author of Latin prose. He played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - carton - light fire - burn down forest - ashtray - hand Answer:","output":"The most suitable option to answer the question \\"What keeps a cigarette fresh?\\" is the carton. A carton is a package that cigarettes are stored in. It is designed to keep cigarettes fresh by protecting them from damage and keeping them in optimal condition until they are ready to be used. Cartons are made from a combination of materials, including paperboard, foil, and some plastic. These materials provide a good balance of protection, affordability, and recyclability. When cigarettes are stored in a carton, they are less exposed to air, moisture, and other environmental factors that can cause them to become stale or lose their freshness. The carton’s structure also helps to maintain the shape and integrity of the cigarettes. Inside the carton, cigarettes are often arranged in rows or compartments, which prevents them from being crushed or damaged. This design also makes it easy for consumers to access the cigarettes and remove them one at a time, supporting their freshness for an extended period. Furthermore, some cigarette cartons feature an inner foil wrap, which adds an additional layer of protection against moisture, light, and air. This ensures that the cigarettes remain as fresh as possible until they are ready to be smoked. In conclusion, a carton is the most suitable option for keeping a cigarette fresh.

Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? Answer:","output":"The product review conveys a negative sentiment. Step 1: Read the review carefully and identify the key points mentioned. In this case, the main points are: - The peppermill grinds well - The cover doesn't lock back into place after refilling, causing problems - It's hard to use because of the cover issue - It's unusable now despite still grinding Step 2: Determine the overall tone of the review. The reviewer starts by mentioning a positive aspect, but the majority of the review focuses on the negative aspects of the peppermill. This indicates a predominantly negative tone.

This includes pillows, a mattress protector, and any other items. Collect all cushions, blankets, and bedspreads as well and add them to the laundry pile, if necessary. With the bed completely stripped, use a vacuum cleaner or a soft brush to clean the mattress thoroughly, paying close attention to seams and corners where dust and allergens tend to accumulate. If your mattress has a removable cover, take it off and wash it according to the manufacturer's instructions. While the bedding is in the wash, proceed to tidy up the room. Remove any clutter from surfaces, such as nightstands, dressers, or desks. Organize your belongings and put them away in their designated spaces. Wipe down all hard surfaces with a damp cloth and a mild cleaner, ensuring that you tackle all areas, including corners, picture frames, and light switches. If you have curtains or blinds, inspect them for signs of dirt or dust. Lightly vacuum the curtains using an upholstery brush attachment, and wipe down blinds with a damp cloth. Remember to clean windowsills and window tracks as well. Additionally, dust any ceiling fans, air vents, or light fixtures as these can be significant sources of airborne dust.

A tool that shows roads, landmarks, and other geographical details would be perfect for navigation and understanding where notable places are. While GPS devices and applications like Google Maps are common, there is a more fundamental and traditional option for getting a spatial understanding of an area: a map. A map is a representation of an area and its features, usually on a flat surface. It can depict both natural and human-made structures such as rivers, mountains, roads, and cities, providing a useful reference for travel or study. Many maps also include a scale, so the user can gauge distances between locations and plan their journeys accordingly. Not only do maps visually represent geographical information, but they also come in different types, tailored to various purposes. Some maps are primarily for navigation, such as roadmaps and nautical charts. Others are thematic, focusing on specific aspects of the area, like political boundaries, demographics, or climate zones. Topographic maps, for example, emphasize terrain and contour lines, helping users understand elevation changes. In summary, maps are essential tools for anyone looking to navigate or learn about an area's geographical layout. They provide a visual representation of important details and can be tailored to focus on various aspects, making them versatile, informative, and practical."},{"instruction":"Write a text based on \\"son ousts qatari emir in coup\\" Text:","output":"Title: Son Overthrows Qatari Emir in Unprecedented Coup In a shocking turn of events, the Qatari Emir was ousted from power in an unprecedented coup orchestrated by his own son. The nation of Qatar has found itself shattered by the political turmoil that has erupted across the region, beginning with this unexpected power shift. The coup report suggests that the Emir's son had been planning the take-over for several months, keeping his intentions secret from both his father and the international community. The reasons behind this drastic move are yet to be disclosed, but some have speculated that it could be due to internal family disputes or political disagreements. The move to overthrow his father was executed quietly and swiftly, with help from a select group of powerful military officers and influential politicians. The group discreetly gained control over key locations in the nation's capital, Doha, to ensure a seamless transition of power. Step 1: Coordinate with military officers and politicians The son began by securing the support of key military officers and politicians that would be crucial to the success of the coup. The conspirators had to trust one another implicitly, understanding the gravity of the task at hand. Step 2: Assemble a covert strike force Next, a covert strike force was organized to infiltrate strategic locations within Doha. This team had to be highly trained and stealthy to avoid apprehension during the initial stages of the coup. Step 3: Seize control of media outlets In order to control the narrative surrounding the event, the coup organizers seized control of major media outlets in Qatar. This would be essential in preventing misinformation from spreading and maintaining the element of surprise. Step 4: Launch the coup Finally, the coup was initiated, with the strike force and their allies simultaneously asserting control over critical areas in the city. The Qatari Emir's security detail was swiftly neutralized, leaving him vulnerable to abduction or forced abdication. Once the coup was successful, the son quickly asserted himself as the new Emir of Qatar, pledging his commitment to maintaining stability amid the turmoil. While some Qatari citizens have expressed support for the new leader, others feel betrayed by the actions of the son and question the legitimacy of his rule. The international community has reacted with shock and concern, urging calm and a peaceful resolution to this unprecedented situation. Some countries have already voiced their condemnation of the coup, while others have yet to release an official statement. As Qatar grapples with the ramifications of this shake-up, both domestic and international actors will be closely monitoring the developments that unfold. The outcome of this coup will have significant implications not only for the nation's internal stability but also for its relations within the Middle East and the global stage."},{"instruction":"You are given a sentence in Spanish.

According to the paragraph, this prestigious award is reserved for a select group of individuals who have obtained the office of President of the Republic of Ghana. The award, which was created by former President John Kufuor in June 2008, has replaced the Order of the Star of Ghana as the highest national decoration in Ghana and serves as a symbol of honor for those who have held the country's highest political office. Considering that the paragraph is specifically concerned with individuals who have become the President of Ghana, it is necessary to differentiate this position from that of a company president. While the president of a company holds an executive leadership role focused on the organization's strategy, objectives, and overall success, the President of the Republic of Ghana is the head of state and government of the country and plays a crucial role in shaping national policy, representing the state in international affairs, and safeguarding the welfare and interests of the nation.

This significant national award symbolizes the appreciation and respect these individuals have earned by virtue of the vital role they have played within the context of Ghana's political and social landscape, further emphasizing the distinction between a company president and the President of Ghana."},{"instruction":"Read the article and select the best answer.

The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. - For the Archdiocese in California , USA , please see Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco The Roman Catholic Diocese of San Francisco ( Latin : Dioecesis Franciscopolitanus ) is in Argentina and is a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Córdoba . - A cathedral (French: \\"cathédrale\\" from Latin: \\"cathedra\\", \\"seat\\" from the Greek \\"kathédra\\" (), seat, bench, from \\"kata\\" \\"down\\" + \\"hedra\\" seat, base, chair) is a Christian church which contains the seat of a bishop, thus serving as the central church of a diocese, conference, or episcopate. The counterpart term for such a church in German is \\"Dom\\" from Latin \\"domus ecclesiae\\" or \\"domus episcopalis\\"; also Italian Duomo, Dutch \\"Domkerk\\" and cognates in many other European languages. Churches with the function of \\"cathedral\\" are usually specific to those Christian denominations with an episcopal hierarchy, such as the Roman Catholic, Anglican, Orthodox, and some Lutheran and Methodist churches. Church buildings embodying the functions of a cathedral first appear in Italy, Gaul, Spain and North Africa in the 4th century, but cathedrals did not become universal within the Western Catholic Church until the 12th century, by which time they had developed architectural forms, institutional structures and legal identities distinct from parish churches, monastic churches and episcopal residences. - The word diocese is derived from the Greek term \\"\\" meaning \\"administration\\". When now used in an ecclesiastical sense, it refers to a territorial unit of administration. In the Western Church, the district is under the supervision of a bishop (who may have assistant bishops to help him or her) and is divided into parishes under the care of priests; but in the Eastern Church, the word denotes the area under the jurisdiction of a patriarch and the bishops under his jurisdiction administer parishes. This structure of church governance is known as episcopal polity. - The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco (Latin: \\"Archdioecesis Sancti Francisci\\"; Spanish: \\"Archidiócesis de San Francisco\\") is an ecclesiastical territory or diocese of the Catholic Church in the northern California region of the United States. It covers the City and County of San Francisco and the Counties of Marin and San Mateo. The Archdiocese of San Francisco was canonically erected on July 29, 1853, by Pope Pius IX and its cathedral is the Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption. - California is the most populous state in the United States and the third most extensive by area. Located on the western (Pacific Ocean) coast of the U.S., California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California. The state capital is Sacramento. Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second largest after New York City. The state also has the nation's most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County. - The Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with more than 1.27 billion members worldwide. As one of the oldest religious institutions in the world, it has played a prominent role in the history of Western civilisation. Headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the pope, its doctrines are summarised in the Nicene Creed. The Catholic Church is notable within Western Christianity for its sacred tradition and seven sacraments. What entity does 'roman catholic diocese of san francisco' has the relation 'instance of' with? The answer to this question is:","output":"The Roman Catholic Diocese of San Francisco has the relation 'instance of' with the entity \\"diocese.\\" A diocese is a territorial unit of administration in the Catholic Church, under the supervision of a bishop.

Santorum, the former Pennsylvania senator, has leapt ahead in national polls as well as surveys in key primary states. Most troubling for Romney is how competitive Santorum has become in Michigan -- the state where Romney was born, where his father was governor and which he won four years ago. A loss in next week's primary there would generate the worst kind of headlines for Romney's threatened presidential bid. On Wednesday night, Romney has a chance, for the first time in nearly a month, to check his closest competitor's rise with a strong debate performance in Arizona, which is holding a primary alongside Michigan next week. Romney will look to reprise the kind of commanding performances he pulled off after Newt Gingrich late surge to victory in South Carolina. Romney went on to win Florida 10 days later. Since then, the 2012 race has been uncharacteristically free of national, televised debates. Candidates have even started to nix debates scheduled for early March, heightening the importance of the 19th meeting of its type this election season. The other candidates are also looking for the same opportunities to light a fire under their campaigns. Gretchen Hamel, executive director of the fiscal policy-focused nonprofit Public Notice, said Santorum could rally the audience with a compelling response -- just like Gingrich did in January when he challenged the moderator over a question about his ex-wife. \\"Santorum has that opportunity tonight in this debate to do the exact same thing,\\" Hamel said. Gingrich, in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, said he wants to return to the \\"big solutions\\" his campaign previously focused on -- blaming the \\"back and forth\\" of late on Romney's negative ads. \\"I think you're going to see the person I've been for 15 out of 17 debates, which is focus on the big solutions, talk with the American people and try to stay out of the kind of negativity which unfortunately has characterized way too much of this race,\\" Gingrich said. The polls show Gingrich falling back considerably since his South Carolina win. Nationally, an AP-GfK poll showed Gingrich and Ron Paul each with 15 percent. Santorum and Romney were knotted up at the top -- with 33 percent choosing Santorum, and 32 percent choosing Romney. The poll of 1,000 adults was conducted Feb. 16-20. It had a margin of error of 4.1 percentage points. In Michigan, an NBC News/ Marist poll showed Romney inching ahead of Santorum in a statistically tied survey, though Santorum has led in several other Michigan surveys. The poll showed Romney with 37 percent and Santorum with 35 percent, followed by Paul with 13 percent and Gingrich with 8 percent. Romney was leading Santorum by a healthy 16 points in Arizona, according to a separate NBC News/Marist poll. Romney also picked up the endorsement of the Detroit News ahead of the CNN-sponsored debate. Going into the showdown, Romney has tried to argue that Santorum is not the true conservative he makes himself out to be. He repeatedly blasts Santorum for having voted to raise the debt ceiling while in Congress, in addition to supporting earmarks. \\"Senator Santorum hasn't been as carefully viewed by the American public as have the others. We had Donald Trump for awhile and then we had Herman Cain and we had Rick Perry and Newt Gingrich. They have all been vetted pretty carefully. Rick Santorum is now just being seen for the first time in many homes. And his background and mine are very different,\\" Romney said Tuesday in Michigan. \\"I don't think Rick Santorum's track record is that of a fiscal conservative.\\" Santorum, campaigning in Phoenix on Tuesday, said Romney's ideological background is all over the map. \\"In the case of Governor Romney, he's run as a liberal, a moderate and a conservative,\\" Santorum said. \\"I ran as a conservative every time I ran. I didn't change my positions ever.\\" Meanwhile, both campaigns as well as the super PACs aligned with them are shelling out cash ahead of the Feb. 28 primaries. The Santorum-supporting Red White and Blue Fund announced it made its second statewide ad buy in Michigan. In total, the super PAC has spent nearly 1.3 million in the state. The Romney-supporting Restore Our Future super PAC just made a nearly 900,000 ad buy in Michigan. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Mitt Romney faces high stakes as Rick Santorum surges in the polls and becomes competitive in Michigan, a critical state for Romney's electability in a general election.

Bella has 10 earrings, which is 25% of Monica's earrings, and Monica has twice as many earrings as Rachel. How many earrings do all of the friends have?. Explanation:","output":"First, we need to find out how many earrings Monica and Rachel have. Since Bella has 10 earrings which are 25% of Monica's earrings, we can set up the following equation to find out how many earrings Monica has: (25/100) * Monica's earrings = 10 Solving for Monica's earrings: Monica's earrings = 10 * (100/25) = 40 Now we know that Monica has 40 earrings and has twice as many earrings as Rachel. Therefore, we can also set up the following equation to find out how many earrings Rachel has: Monica's earrings = 2 * Rachel's earrings 40 = 2 * Rachel's earrings Rachel's earrings = 40/2 = 20 So Rachel has 20 earrings. Now we have the number of earrings for all three friends: Bella: 10 earrings Monica: 40 earrings Rachel: 20 earrings To find the total number of earrings, we just add them together: Total earrings = 10 + 40 + 20 = 70 earrings So, the three friends have a total of 70 earrings."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Mark Agner Boecking Strudal ( born 29 April 1968 in Glostrup ) is a retired Danish footballer who played as a striker and scored three goals in nine games for the Danish national team .

For me, there’s always something that has to be done. In fact, the biggest complaint that my husband and two children have about me is that I’m “always busy.” Seventeen years ago, when my oldest son was about a year old, he woke up in a very fussy mood. Instead of being his usual cheerful and compliant self, he just wanted to be cuddled. A mother’s dream, right? Well, not for me. There was too much to be done; I didn’t have time to hold him. I was well aware that in addition to some projects I was working on, there was laundry to be washed and ironed, breakfast dishes to do, a house that needed cleaning. My usual response would have been to try to coax my son into cheerfulness, or to put him back to bed to sleep it off. But it was clear that he was unwell, so against my usual inclination, I decided that I would just hold him. The chores could wait another day. So I settled into the recliner chair in the lounge room and held my son while he slept. I dozed occasionally too, waking up now and then to enjoy the feeling of snuggling my baby and looking at the world beyond the window. It was a cold day, but clear and sunny. The trees rustled in the gentle breeze, and birds and butterflies flitted about the garden. Inside, my son and I stayed snuggled together under a blanket for most of the day. He slept while I, for one of the few times in my life, just drank in the beauty of the world and the happiness of sharing this time with my son. Better mothers than I am must have done similar things many, many times with their children. But for me, this very small decision, this day of ‘laziness’, became a treasured memory.

The assertion that Your Honor was hungry during the hearing. In regards to the first aspect, as an AI Assistant, I cannot confirm or deny the precise timing of the statements or quotes in question without access to accurate documentation. Nonetheless, the court should consider the relevance and probative value of statements made during and after the conclusion of the proceedings. This understanding depends on several factors, such as: - The context and content of the statements; - The identities of speakers and their roles in the trial; - The possible impact of the statements on the outcome of the case. Given the understanding that the quotes were shared after the gavel banged, indicating the end of the hearing, the court should weigh the statements' admissibility and potential influence on its judgment. Moving on to the second aspect, inferring Your Honor's hunger based on the quotes and statements is a subjective assumption. There are no direct cues or indications within the provided information to suggest any connection between Your Honor's physical condition during the trial and the subsequent statements. Drawing conclusions about one's feelings or bodily needs may not hold any relevance to the trial, the proceedings, or the decision-making process. In conclusion, it is crucial for the court to focus on legally relevant information and evidence when deliberating on a case. This includes examining the pertinent statements and material shared both during and after the trial. However, an assumption regarding Your Honor's hunger, without any concrete evidence or relationship to the trial, should not bear any influence on the case and its outcome. If any further clarification or assistance is required, please do not hesitate to ask."},{"instruction":"Write a dialog based on this summary: Mike and George agreed to meet on Monday at 4 pm..","output":"Mike: Hey George, you know what we talked about last time?

A thunderstorm begins to appear, when Nancy, speeding down the road, runs over a log, plummeting the car into a steep ravine. Terry awakes to find her and her friends alive, but sheltered in an old mansion in the middle of nowhere, owned by the Penroses, Marion and her mother, and their groundskeeper/doctor friend, Norman. Gloria is the only one with serious injuries, so Marion suggests that they spend the night until Gloria is able to leave with them. Terry and Nancy are then invited to dinner, with Marion and her old, crippled mother. Mrs. Penrose then goes off on a tirade on how men are the worst things on earth, especially her ex-husband who cheated on her, and ruins dinner for everyone. The four then make their way to the living room, with Marion play the piano and Mrs. Penrose watching, while Nancy and Terry play dominoes. While outside, a dirtied, grubby man appears, roaming around and looking menacingly into the windows.

Later that night, Terry awakes to hear a man breathing heavily upstairs, as though he's masturbating, and wakes Nancy, but the breathing stops. Nancy then decides that one of them should go through the woods into town and get help, and flips a coin, finding that she's the one who has to do it.

Nuns are women who choose to live their lives devoted to God and helping people. They wear special clothes, and they live in a place called a convent with others who have made the same choice. These special nuns formed a group called a congregation. People usually look up to nuns and expect them to be kind and loving, especially to children. However, recently, some people have complained that these nuns haven't been kind at all. They say that instead of caring and protecting the children, these nuns hurt them. Hurting children is a very, very bad thing, and it's important that the truth is found out. To figure out what really happened, a big, important meeting called a public inquiry was arranged. An inquiry is like having a big conversation where people come together to share stories, thoughts, and ask questions, so that they can understand the situation better and find a solution. At the public inquiry, people spoke and shared their feelings about these allegations. Allegations are a fancy way of saying someone believes something bad has happened, but we don't know yet if that is true or false. It's important to remember that allegations are just the beginning of the story. There will be people who have to listen carefully to everyone who speaks at the public inquiry. They will have to decide if these complaints are true or not. If the nuns did hurt children, they will have to face the consequences of their actions. This story is still unfolding, and it's important for us to understand that people should always be kind to one another, especially to children. If someone needs help, it's our responsibility to be loving and supportive. And if we see bad things happening, we should find a grown-up we trust and tell them, so they can help too. Let's hope that the truth will come out soon, and everyone can learn from this sad story to be better, kinder people."},{"instruction":"14 and the four beasts said, amen. and the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.

A tall (193 cm) and lean (85 kg) full forward with an excellent reputation in country football, Frank returned to the city after the war and resume his playing career with Richmond. In the opening weeks of the 1946 season Frank kicked five or more goals six times in the first seven matches to lead the VFL goalkicking table. Injury curtailed further progress. Just months after his playing retirement, Bourke was controversially pitched into the coaching position at Punt Road. The Tigers had decided to sack Tony Jewell, a premiership teammate of Bourke, just twelve months after he coached Richmond to the 1980 premiership. Although few doubted that Bourke was coaching material, the nature of his appointment and his lack of coaching experience at any level were significant hurdles to overcome. However, in 1982 Bourke took the Tigers to only their third minor premiership since the war and impressed critics with a brilliant tactical display in the semi final against Carlton. Bourke made a series of positional changes at the beginning of the game and ordered his men to slow down the Carlton play-on game, giving away fifteen-metre penalties as necessary. The Tigers won easily, and Bourke became one of only a handful of coaches to make the Grand Final in his first season. The dream debut of a premiership was not to be. In the 1982 VFL Grand Final, Richmond led by 11 points at half time, only for Carlton to kick five unanswered goals in the third quarter and run away with the premiership by 18 points. During the off-season, the Tigers suffered an exodus of disgruntled star players that rocked the club and lost nine of the first eleven games in 1983. Media speculation about the security of Bourke's position began in earnest, and few believed the club when Richmond denied that there was an ongoing crisis. Although the team improved in the second half of the season, further player departures were mooted if Bourke remained as coach. It seemed that his hard-training style was not appreciated by all of his charges. Reluctantly, Bourke tendered his resignation at the end of the season, well aware that he would probably have been sacked had he not done so. His winning rate over the two seasons was a very reasonable 56.5% Did he help the tigers win any championships?","output":"Based on the information provided, Bourke helped the Richmond Tigers reach the Grand Final in his first season as a coach in 1982, but they did not win the championship.

Abu Omar al-Shishani, one of the most feared military commanders of the Islamic State of Syria and Iraq, has issued the image as part of a campaign to intimidate Britain. It features two bearded fighters with their hands shading their eyes, looking at London as it burns in a ball of computer generated flames. The warning comes as the ISIS executioner known as 'Jihadi John' warned Barack Obama: 'The Islamic State will soon, like your puppet David Cameron said, begin to slaughter your people in your streets.' Threat: Abu Omar al-Shishani's image features militants (top left) with their hands shading their eyes as they watch London burn in a ball of computer generated flames. Al-Shishani also appears grinning in the image. Militant: Al-Shishani is considered one of the most influential military leaders of the Syrian opposition forces and has been referred to as 'the military commander' suggesting he is in overall command of the ISIS armies. International: Abu Omar al-Shishani heads up one of the largest groups of foreign fighters in Syria and is known to count British recruits among his band which has had both Facebook and Twitter pages in English. ISIS followers are known to have planned attacks in Britain and Europe, although the degree to which they are directed by the high command has been unclear. The language used in the latest video, which shows the head of US aid worker Peter Kassig, suggests they are planning attacks outside their borders. The new imagery, posted on the internet by Chechen fighters serving with ISIS and entitled “Omar Shishani in London,” reinforces the idea that the group now has global ambitions similar to al-Qaeda. Al-Shishani, a red-bearded ethnic Chechen, is pictured grinning in the bottom right of the image. He heads up one of the largest groups of foreign fighters in Syria and is known to count British recruits among his band which has had both Facebook and Twitter pages in English. Ramzan Kadyrov, the Russian-backed hardline leader of the Chechen Republic, announced that Shishani had been killed by posting a picture on Instagram last Thursday, although the death remains unconfirmed and he gave no location. Shishani is considered one of the most influential military leaders of the Syrian opposition forces and has been referred to as 'the military commander' suggesting he is in overall command of the ISIS armies. He is believed to have recruited Abdul Waheed Majeed, 41, a British father of three from Crawley, West Sussex, who died when he drove a dumper truck packed full of explosives into Aleppo Prison in a suicide attack in February. His other followers included Ibrahim al-Mazwagi, from North London, who was 21 when he was killed in Syria in February last year. A graduate from Hertfordshire University, he was of Libyan origin, and had fought in that conflict in 2011 before moving on to Syria where he told his family he was doing charity work. Recruit: Al-Shishani is believed to have recruited Abdul Waheed Majeed (pictured left and right) a father of three from Crawley, West Sussex, who died when he truck packed full of explosives into Aleppo Prison. Suicide bomber: The video shows Abdul Waheed Majeed driving at high speed towards Aleppo Prison. Explosion: Seconds later the truck's explosives detonate, killing Abdul Waheed Majeed. Abu Omar al-Shishani is a nom de-guerre which refers to his Chechen origins. His real name is Tarkhan Batirashvili, 28, and he is a former sergeant in the Georgian Army. He was born to an Orthodox Christian father and Muslim mother and brought up in the Pankisi Gorge, an ethnically Chechen area of North East Georgia, where he worked as a shepherd before joining the army when he left school. He fought in the brief conflict between Russia and Georgia in 2008 and became a jihadist after being discharged from the Georgian military on health grounds after contracting tuberculosis. After recuperating and being refused reenlistment, he was arrested for stockpiling weapons and jailed in September 2010. Following his release, he travelled to Istanbul in Turkey in March 2012, to join Chechen rebels in the Syrian conflict. He became the commander of a group of hardened Chechen fighters known as Katibat al-Muhajireen [Emigrants Brigade] which was initially aligned with al-Qaeda's Jabhat al-Nusra. The group merged with other jihadists in March 2013 to form Jaish al-Muhajireen wal-Ansar [Army of Emigrants and Supporters], a larger and more structured group with a religious council. Terror: Abu Omar al-Shishani's warning comes after Jihadi John (pictured) warned Barack Obama: 'The Islamic State will soon, like your puppet David Cameron said, begin to slaughter your people in your streets' Sick: Abu Omar al-Shishani's image is not the first time ISIS has taunted the West by threatening to attack a landmark. A chilling threat was posted on Twitter on June 20 purportedly from someone with a connection to the extremist group. The images were taken outside the White House and Chicago's Old Republic Building. In May 2013, Shishani switched to supporting the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and was named commander of the northern sector of Syria, around Aleppo. Units under his command have participated in major assaults on Syrian military bases in and around Aleppo, including the capture of Menagh Airbase in August 2013. Raffaello Pantucci, of the Royal United Services Institute think tank, said: 'Omar al-Shishani is the most prominent of the Caucasian fighters alongside ISIS and is seen as the leader of the foreign fighter brigades. 'He has a long history of conflict which has given him a prominent role amongst the ISIS foreign fighter brigades. 'We have seen how Brits and other Europeans have often been marshalled under his wing and the result is that he is elevated to be a figure of great significance in the mythology around the group and what it is doing, in particular in the imagery and videos they release. 'While his skills and abilities have been called into question by others, he has undeniably become the most prominent of the so-called Chechen fighters in Syria.'

Glinda then gives the magical broom to Dorothy's friends, Tin Woodman, Cowardly Lion, and Scarecrow, and they become the guardians of the broom. Evilene, the Wicked Witch, conspires with her Flying Monkeys to retrieve her broom. However, a friendly little monkey named Ozzy forgets to close the gate of the castle and a battle ensues between the flying monkeys and the 'Bums of Oz.' Evilene retrieves her broom and repels the Champions of Oz from the castle. She then punishes Ozzy's father, transforming him into a chicken. Angered by the witch's spell on his father, Ozzy steals the broom from Evilene and runs away from the palace. Ozzy reaches Glinda to find she has been paralyzed by accidentally drinking a magic potion created by her niece Gabby, who is unable to create an antidote without a vital ingredient based on wood. Gabby and Ozzy set off to find the Champions of Oz. They are pursued by the other Flying Monkeys. They soon find Cowardly Lion, who is out of sorts due to the witch's spell, but with some effort they guide him to the north town, where they find the Tin Woodman, who is extremely depressed by the spell.

A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me. The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem.

How to grow swamp hibiscus Look for a sunny, boggy spot to plant your hibiscus. Swamp hibiscus is a tall perennial that favors a sunny spot with lots of water. Unlike many plants, it prefers a boggy spot where water collects.","output":"After identifying the ideal location for planting your swamp hibiscus, the next steps involve preparing the site, planting the hibiscus, and providing proper care to ensure optimal growth. Here is a detailed guide to help you grow a healthy and thriving swamp hibiscus: 1. Site preparation: Before planting, ensure that the chosen location has at least 6 hours of direct sunlight each day. Remove any existing vegetation, and if the area isn't already boggy, consider creating a planting bed or a rain garden to mimic swamp-like conditions. You could also dig a small pond to provide additional moisture and improve the ambiance. Add organic matter, such as compost, peat moss, or leaf mold, to the soil to enhance its water retention capabilities. 2. Plant selection: Swamp hibiscus (Hibiscus moscheutos) is available in various cultivars that showcase different colors and growth habits. Choose a cultivar that complements your garden design and personal preferences. Ensure that the plants you purchase are healthy, disease-free, and have a well-developed root system. 3. Planting: It's best to plant swamp hibiscus in early spring after the risk of frost has passed. Space the plants about 3-4 feet apart to provide ample room for growth. Dig a hole that is at least twice the width and depth of the plant's root ball. Carefully remove the plant from its container and loosen the roots gently. Place the plant in the hole, ensuring that the top of the root ball is level with the soil surface. Fill in the hole with soil while keeping the plant straight. Firmly press the soil around the roots and water thoroughly to settle the soil and eliminate air pockets. 4. Watering: Swamp hibiscus thrives in consistently moist to wet soil. Ensure that the plant receives at least 1 inch of water per week, either through rainfall or supplemental irrigation. Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Mulch around the base of the plant with a 2-inch layer of organic material to help retain moisture and suppress weeds. 5. Fertilizing: Apply a balanced, slow-release fertilizer, such as a 10-10-10 formula, to your swamp hibiscus in the spring, following the manufacturer's recommended application rate. You can also apply a liquid fertilizer monthly during the growing season. Avoid using high-nitrogen fertilizers, as they may promote excessive foliage growth at the expense of blooms. 6. Pruning: Swamp hibiscus may be pruned to maintain its size and shape, promote bushier growth, and encourage more blooms. In late winter or early spring, before new growth begins, prune the plant back to about 12 inches above the ground. Remove any dead, damaged, or weak stems. Additionally, pinch off the growing tips periodically during the growing season to encourage branching. 7. Pest and disease control: While swamp hibiscus is relatively pest and disease-resistant, it can sometimes be affected by aphids and whiteflies. Use a strong stream of water to dislodge these pests or treat them with insecticidal soap. Monitor the plant for any signs of disease, such as leaf spots or wilting, and treat promptly with a fungicide if necessary. 8. Overwintering: In colder climates, swamp hibiscus may die back to the ground during winter. You can protect the plant by adding a thick layer of mulch over the root zone in late fall, which will help insulate the roots from freezing temperatures. Remove the mulch in early spring to allow for new growth. By following these steps, you can successfully grow a beautiful and healthy swamp hibiscus that will add a tropical flair to your garden. Enjoy the stunning, large blooms and admire the incredible beauty of this unique perennial plant."},{"instruction":"Q:Given the following passage \\"These statistics point to the complexities surrounding the lack of health/nutrition literacy and reveal the degree to which they are embedded in the social structure and interconnected with other problems.

Estranged wife said he kept the money in British account to avoid tax. He was forced to quit French cabinet last year amid claims he also hid money in Singapore and Switzerland. President Francois Hollande expelled him from ruling Socialist Party. France's most wealthy hit by 75% tax rate since Hollande came to power. Article:","output":"Title: Ex-Budget Minister Jerome Cahuzac's Secret Financial Scandal Revealed by Estranged Wife Introduction: Ex-Budget Minister Jerome Cahuzac has been accused of hiding a secret nest egg in a British bank account to avoid tax, according to allegations from his estranged wife. Cahuzac, 61, was forced to leave the French cabinet last year amid claims he also concealed money in Singapore and Switzerland. President Francois Hollande expelled Cahuzac from the ruling Socialist Party as a result. Step 1: Discuss Cahuzac's alleged secret nest egg Jerome Cahuzac, the former French Budget Minister, is in the spotlight once again as his estranged wife claims he stashed money away in a secret British bank account with the purpose of evading taxes. This accusation comes after Cahuzac's previous forced resignation from the French cabinet and expulsion from the ruling Socialist Party due to allegations of hiding money in Singapore and Switzerland. Step 2: Detail Cahuzac's exit from the French cabinet In light of the mounting claims and evidence against Cahuzac, he was forced to leave the French cabinet last year. French President Francois Hollande took decisive action in removing Cahuzac from the ruling Socialist Party amid this financial scandal. Hollande's administration had been working to tackle tax evasion and improve the financial situation for the nation. Step 3: Discuss Hollande's 75% tax rate on the wealthy Since coming to power, President Hollande has introduced a 75% tax rate on the wealthiest citizens in France. This move aims to redistribute wealth and ensure that the rich pay their fair share of the tax burden. With the revelation of Cahuzac's alleged financial misconduct, the 75% tax rate is likely to be scrutinized further, especially considering Cahuzac's former position as Budget Minister. Conclusion: The allegations against ex-Budget Minister Jerome Cahuzac have once again raised questions about the integrity and transparency of government officials. As investigations continue into Cahuzac's financial dealings and possible tax evasion, the French government faces a challenging task of restoring public trust and enforcing strict policies against - and within - its highest ranks."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence about the following things: notebook, room, student","output":"In the cozy, well-lit room filled with motivated students, a young aspiring scholar meticulously jotted down essential information in her vibrant, pocket-sized notebook, capturing the essence of today's thought-provoking lesson while simultaneously feeling the sense of accomplishment that she possesses the dedication and passion to excel in her academic pursuits."},{"instruction":"Whole cow's milk contains too little iron, retinol, vitamin E, vitamin C, vitamin D, unsaturated fats or essential fatty acids for human babies.

Charles Edward \\"Charlie\\" Haden (August 6, 1937 - July 11, 2014) was an American jazz double bass player, bandleader, composer and educator known for his deep, warm sound, and whose career spanned more than fifty years. In the late 1950s, Haden was an original member of the ground-breaking Ornette Coleman Quartet. Haden revolutionized the harmonic concept of bass playing in jazz. About him, German musicologist Joachim-Ernst Berendt commented, \\"His ability to create serendipitous harmonies by improvising melodic responses to Coleman's free-form solos (rather than sticking to predetermined harmonies) was both radical and mesmerizing. Haden often said that he moved to Los Angeles in 1957 in search of pianist Hampton Hawes. He turned down a full scholarship at Oberlin College, which did not have an established jazz program at the time, to attend Westlake College of Music in Los Angeles. His first recordings were made that year with Paul Bley, with whom he worked until 1959. He also played with Art Pepper for four weeks in 1957, and from 1958 to 1959, with Hampton Hawes whom he met through his friendship with bassist Red Mitchell, For a time, he shared an apartment with the bassist Scott LaFaro. In May 1959, he recorded his first album with the Ornette Coleman Quartet, the seminal The Shape of Jazz to Come. Haden's folk-influenced style complemented Coleman's microtonal, Texas blues elements. Later that year, the Quartet moved to New York City and secured an extended booking at the avant-garde Five Spot Cafe. This residency lasted six weeks and represented the beginnings of their unique, free and avant-garde jazz. Ornette's quartet played everything by ear, as Haden explained: \\"At first when we were playing and improvising, we kind of followed the pattern of the song, sometimes. Then, when we got to New York, Ornette wasn't playing on the song patterns, like the bridge and the interlude and stuff like that. He would just play. And that's when I started just following him and playing the chord changes that he was playing: on-the-spot new chord structures made up according to how he felt at any given moment.\\" In 1960, addiction to narcotics caused him to leave Coleman's band. He went to self-help rehabilitation in September 1963 at Synanon houses in Santa Monica, California and San Francisco, California. It was during the time he was at Synanon House that he met his first wife, Ellen David. They moved to New York City's Upper West Side where their four children were born: their son, Josh, in 1968, and in 1971, their triplet daughters Petra, Rachel and Tanya.

Solve 64*w + 132*w - 133 + 438 = -87 for w.","output":"To solve the equation 64*w + 132*w - 133 + 438 = -87 for w, we will follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify and combine like terms on both sides of the equation. On the left-hand side of the equation, we have two terms containing the variable w: 64*w and 132*w. We can combine these terms: 64*w + 132*w = (64 + 132)*w = 196*w We also have two constant terms, -133 and 438: -133 + 438 = 305 Now, our equation looks like this: 196*w + 305 = -87 Step 2: Isolate the variable w on one side of the equation. To do this, we will move the constant term (305) to the right-hand side of the equation. We achieve this by subtracting 305 from both sides: 196*w + 305 - 305 = -87 - 305 196*w = -392 Step 3: Solve for w. Now that we have the variable w isolated on one side, we will divide both sides of the equation by its coefficient (196): (196*w) / 196 = -392 / 196 w = -2 So, the solution to the equation 64*w + 132*w - 133 + 438 = -87 is w = -2."},{"instruction":"Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? the most repugnant adaptation of a classic text since roland joffé and demi moore 's the scarlet letter .","output":"This phrase is considered negative.

It is bounded to the north by Loch Scridain and to the south by the Firth of Lorne. The main villages are Bunessan and Fionnphort, with smaller settlements including Ardtun, Camas, Carsaig, Knockan, Pennyghael and Uisken. Knocknafenaig, Suidhe, and Shiaba are three of the many cleared settlements on the Ross. - Fionnphort ( English pronunciation : / fnfrt / , Scottish Gaelic pronunciation : ( fjunafrt ) ) is the principal port of the Ross of Mull , and the second largest settlement in the area ( its population is approximately 80 ) . The village 's name is the anglicised pronunciation of the gaelic for \`\` White Port '' and previous names have included Coal Idhe , gaelic for \`\` Sound of Iona '' . - A port is a location on a coast or shore containing one or more harbors where ships can dock and transfer people or cargo to or from land. Port locations are selected to optimize access to land and navigable water, for commercial demand, and for shelter from wind and waves. Ports with deeper water are rarer, but can handle larger ships. Since ports throughout history handled every kind of traffic, support and storage facilities vary widely, may extend for miles, and dominate the local economy. Some ports have an important military role. - Bunessan is a small village on the Ross of Mull in the south-west of the island of Mull, off the west coast of Scotland. The settlement is within the parish of Kilfinichen and Kilvickeon, and is situated on the A849. - The Inner Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Na h-Eileanan a-staigh\\", \\"the inner isles\\") is an archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland, to the south east of the Outer Hebrides.

Together, the islands have an area of about , and had a population of 18,948 in 2011. The population density is therefore about 4.6 per km (12 per square mile). - Saint Columba ('church dove'; 7 December 521 9 June 597) was an Irish abbot and missionary credited with spreading Christianity in what is today Scotland at the start of the Hiberno-Scottish mission. He founded the important abbey on Iona, which became a dominant religious and political institution in the region for centuries. He is the Patron Saint of Derry. He was highly regarded by both the Gaels of Dál Riata and the Picts, and is remembered today as a Christian saint and one of the Twelve Apostles of Ireland. - Iona is a small island in the Inner Hebrides off the Ross of Mull on the western coast of Scotland. It was a centre of Gaelic monasticism for four centuries and is today renowned for its tranquility and natural beauty. It is a popular tourist destination and a place for retreats.

In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - Knockan is a township of six crofts in the community of Ardtun, in the south of the island of Mull off the west coast of Scotland. - A harbor or harbour (see spelling differences), or haven, is a body of water where ships, boats and barges seek shelter from stormy weather, or are stored for future use. Harbors and ports are often confused with each other. A port is a manmade facility built for loading and unloading vessels and dropping off and picking up passengers.

Given these facts, which surface can food be cooked on among the following options: - ashes - liquid - ice - Earth - cold oven - Metal - glass - plates Answer:","output":"Cooking food involves a process referred to as heat transfer, where energy is transferred from a heat source to the food itself. Given that cooking requires the application of heat, the surface on which food is cooked should ideally be a suitable conductor of this heat energy. Let's analyze each of the given options: 1. Ashes: While ashes might be hot immediately after a fire, their heat retention properties are largely unpredictable and inefficient. They don't conduct heat very well and lose their heat rapidly. So, ashes would not be the best surface to cook food. 2. Liquid: This depends on the type of liquid. Water or oil can be heated and used to cook food, such as in boiling or frying. However, not all liquids are safe or suitable for cooking. For example, cooking directly on mercury or gasoline is hazardous. 3. Ice: By nature, ice is cold and its melting point is well below the temperature required to cook most food. Therefore, ice would not only fail to cook the food, but would also melt under the heat source. Hence, ice isn't a viable option to cook food. 4. Earth: While it's possible to use earth as a cooking surface in certain scenarios, such as when making an Earth Oven or a pit BBQ, in general, earth isn't a good conductor of heat and wouldn't be an ideal surface to cook food directly. 5. Cold Oven: A cold oven itself cannot cook food since it lacks the necessary heat source. However, an oven, when heated, is an excellent tool to cook food as it can maintain and control a steady temperature, allowing for even cooking. 6. Metal: Metals are excellent conductors of heat, which is why we frequently find metal used in a variety of cooking utensils, including pots, pans, and grilling surfaces. Therefore, out of all these options, metal can be the best surface to effectively cook food. 7. Glass: Many glass types are capable of withstanding high temperatures, and glass bakeware is common. However, glass conducts heat slower than metal, and it may not uniformly distribute the heat. While it can be used to cook food, it's typically not as efficient as metal. 8. Plates: Generally, plates are more of a serving surface than a cooking surface. Ceramic plates can't withstand high heat sources, and plastic plates would melt. While there are certain metal or cast-iron plates that can be heated to cook food, they are quite specific and not found in an average kitchen. In conclusion, given the properties of heat conduction and the necessary heat energy required to cook food, metal would be the most efficient and practical surface to cook food on among the provided options."},{"instruction":"\\"În ultimii ani, AKP a semnalat faptul că este pe punctul de a-şi pierde încrederea în procesul de aderare la UE.

This move highlights the club's commitment to staying true to its innovative and progressive approach, aiming to foster a new generation of coaching potential that is adaptive and brings a revitalized energy to the team. The Background Robbie Neilson, the former head coach at Hearts, brought a wealth of experience along with an impressive track record while leading the team. However, as his tenure reached its end, the club now seeks to pave the way for a fresh new direction and take advantage of the opportunity to promote a youthful and dynamic coaching presence in their ranks. Why a Young and Enthusiastic Coach? The decision to focus on young and enthusiastic coaching candidates speaks to Hearts' commitment to the long-term growth and success of both the team and individual players. Here are a few reasons why this approach could be an excellent fit for the club: 1. Innovative Ideas: Young and enthusiastic coaches generally bring new ideas, viewpoints, and tactics to the table. This could significantly improve the club's overall performance and open doors to creative strategies that previously went unexplored. 2. Adaptability: As the football landscape continually evolves, so should the coaching styles implemented. Engaging with a young coach keen on embracing the latest industry trends, game styles, and innovations will equally allow the team to adapt seamlessly to change and improve accordingly. 3. Building Long-term Relationships: Young coaches have the potential to form strong long-term bonds with players, helping build camaraderie and loyalty within the team. Such relationships lead to increased motivation and a better understanding of individual strengths and weaknesses, ultimately resulting in increased team performance. 4. Professional Growth: Hiring a young and enthusiastic coach provides the opportunity for both parties to grow and develop alongside their club career. Mutual growth ensures a strong connection between the coach and their team, resulting in a passionate and dedicated work environment and benefiting both individuals and the club. What to Expect Next Craig Levein, the club's director of football, is expected to be actively involved in the selection process for the new head coach. Levein will likely be putting the candidates through a rigorous review process to identify the candidate most aligned with Hearts' values and objectives. The selection process would encourage candidates to showcase their passion for the sport, their unique coaching philosophy, and their ability to develop promising talent within the team. Additionally, candidates must demonstrate strong leadership skills to ensure that they can effectively unify and motivate the team while remaining current with modern coaching standards. Conclusion As Hearts embarks on this new chapter, the importance of selecting the right coach cannot be overstated. With the guidance of a young, innovative, and passionate new head coach, the club aims to develop a lasting legacy that ensures the on-field success of both individual players and the team as a whole. Fans and the football community can undoubtedly expect big things from Hearts with the arrival of their new coach in the upcoming football season."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this summary: – Federal authorities are cracking down on sex trafficking in a seemingly unlikely place: the friendly, low-crime state of South Dakota. It's been a relatively nascent effort: KDLT quotes Assistant US Attorney Jeff Clapper as saying, \\"Before 2010, we didn't have any of these cases. Since then, we've had a steady diet of prosecution of sex trafficking cases.\\" That's partially due to a change in the mindset of local law enforcement, with a Sioux Falls officer telling KELOLAND.com that instead of going after prostitutes, the focus is on finding women who have been trafficked. By the AP's count, the feds in the last few years have gone after about 50 cases and secured life sentences on three occasions. Prosecutions have involved would-be customers (a Texas air traffic controller got 15 years for responding to an ad for sex with a 12-year-old at the Sturgis motorcycle rally) and the high-profile trafficker Mohammed Sharif Alaboudi. In 2013, Alaboudi received four life terms for operating what US Attorney Brendan Johnson described as \\"a house of horrors\\"—a one-bedroom apartment where homeless or drug-addicted women were forced to have sex with strangers. So what's up in this otherwise sleepy state? \\"I think traffickers see this as a trusting place and think, 'They're never going to catch me,'\\" says the manager of a nonprofit that helps trafficked girls. \\"Well, we seem to be catching an awful lot of them.\\" Traffickers are also said to like the state's poor areas; the AP notes about half of the feds' cases involved Native American women.

Article:","output":"Title: South Dakota Emerges as Unlikely Battleground in the Fight Against Sex Trafficking In recent years, federal authorities have found an unexpected hotspot for sex trafficking cases: the seemingly low-crime state of South Dakota. Assistant US Attorney Jeff Clapper noted that before 2010, there were hardly any known cases of sex trafficking in the state. However, since then, there has been a steady stream of such cases that require prosecution. This shift is due, in part, to a change in the mindset of local law enforcement. Sioux Falls officers now focus on finding women who have been trafficked rather than pursuing prostitutes. According to the Associated Press, the federal government has pursued about 50 sex trafficking cases in South Dakota in recent years, securing life sentences in three instances. These cases have involved both customers and traffickers. For example, a Texas air traffic controller received a 15-year sentence for responding to an advertisement for sex with a 12-year-old child at a motorcycle rally in Sturgis. In a high-profile case in 2013, trafficker Mohammed Sharif Alaboudi received four life terms for operating \\"a house of horrors\\" – a one-bedroom apartment where homeless or drug-addicted women were forced to have sex with strangers. The house was described as such by US Attorney Brendan Johnson. So, why has South Dakota become a hub for trafficking? The manager of a nonprofit organization that assists trafficked girls suggests that traffickers might view the state as a trusting place where they are less likely to be caught. However, recent efforts have led to the capture of an increasing number of traffickers. In addition, traffickers seem to target the state's impoverished areas. The AP notes that about half of the federal trafficking cases involved Native American women. In response to the growing issue, a coalition of police, federal prosecutors, tribal law enforcement, the Junior League, and church groups is now working together to combat the problem. Furthermore, a recent 750,000 grant has funded a shelter for trafficking victims, as reported by KELOLAND.com. South Dakota may seem like an unlikely battleground for fighting sex trafficking, but the increasing number of cases and the formation of a dedicated coalition demonstrate the state's commitment to tackling this insidious crime."},{"instruction":"What key details about koxinga can be extracted from the following bio?

Translate to Finnish","output":"Euroopan unionin on käytettävä tämä tilaisuus avoimuuden ja läpinäkyvyyden lisäämiseen. Euroopan unioni on monimutkainen ja laaja organisaatio, joka kattaa 27 jäsenvaltiota, ja sen toiminta vaikuttaa miljoonien ihmisten elämään Euroopassa ja sen ulkopuolella. Avoimuuden ja läpinäkyvyyden lisääminen on erittäin tärkeää, jotta Euroopan kansalaiset voivat paremmin ymmärtää, mitä EU tekee ja miten päätökset tehdään. Tämä puolestaan voi lisätä luottamusta ja tukea Euroopan yhdentymisprosessia. Lisätäkseen avoimuutta ja läpinäkyvyyttä EU:n toiminnassa, sen on toteutettava useita toimenpiteitä, jotka ulottuvat eri toimielinten välisten neuvottelujen avoimuudesta yleisempään tiedonjakoon sekä kansalaisten osallistumiseen ja vuoropuheluun. Tässä muutamia keskeisiä ehdotuksia siitä, miten tämä voidaan toteuttaa: 1. Päätöksenteon avoimuus: EU:n toimielinten, kuten Euroopan parlamentin, neuvoston ja komission, olisi parannettava avoimuuttaan päätöksenteossa. Tämä voitaisiin saavuttaa julkaisemalla työryhmien ja komiteoiden kokousten pöytäkirjat, avaamalla trilogi-neuvottelut julkisesti ja lisäämällä läpinäkyvyyttä lainsäädäntöprosessin kaikissa vaiheissa. 2. Tiedon saavutettavuus: EU:n toimielinten on parannettava tiedon saatavuutta kaikista toiminnoistaan ja päätöksistään. Tämä voidaan tehdä esimerkiksi parantamalla EU:n verkkosivujen käyttäjäystävällisyyttä, lisäämällä tiedotusmateriaalia eri kielille ja tarjoamalla selkokielisiä versioita tärkeistä asiakirjoista. 3. Kansalaisten osallistuminen: EU:n on edistettävä kansalaisten osallistumista ja vuoropuhelua eri toimielinten välillä. Tämä voidaan tehdä järjestämällä säännöllisesti kansalaisfoorumeita, kutsuja kuulemisiin ja verkkokeskusteluja aiheista, jotka kiinnostavat laajaa yleisöä. 4. Henkilöstön läpinäkyvyys: EU:n virkamiesten vastuullisuuden ja eettisen toiminnan lisäämiseksi olisi otettava käyttöön selkeät säännöt ja käytännöt, jotka koskevat esimerkikski lahjonnan ja eturistiriitojen ehkäisemistä, avoimuutta lobbaajien ja sidosryhmien kanssa käydyissä neuvotteluissa sekä julkisten varojen käytön valvontaa. 5. Yhteistyö kansallisten ja paikallisten hallintoelinten kanssa: EU:n olisi tehtävä tiiviimpää yhteistyötä jäsenvaltioiden ja alueellisten viranomaisten kanssa avoimuuden ja läpinäkyvyyden lisäämiseksi yhteisten politiikkojen ja ohjelmien täytäntöönpanossa. Näiden toimenpiteiden avulla EU voi lisätä avoimuutta ja läpinäkyvyyttä toiminnassaan, mikä puolestaan voi auttaa vahvistamaan Euroopan kansalaisten luottamusta ja osallistumista unionin toimintaan. On erittäin tärkeää, että EU ottaa tämän tilaisuuden käyttöön ja tekee jatkuvia ponnisteluja avoimuuden ja läpinäkyvyyden parantamiseksi nyt ja tulevaisuudessa."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Process: - Pollution enters natural water sources such as rivers and lakes - The pollution negatively affects the water quality - The pollution negatively affects the health of plants and animals - The plants and animals have shorter, less healthy lives - The plants and animals do not reproduce very well - The number of plants and animals decreases over time - The quality of water gets worse and worse as there are no plants or animals to clean it - Eventually there is nothing living in the water and it is unusable - Question: suppose companies might be moved overseas happens, how will it affect LESS bad effects of pollution. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"B: less Process: 1.

Firstly, think about your personal affinity for each color. Do you naturally gravitate towards pink or green generally? People often have favorite colors that they feel comfortable wearing, so take your instinct into account. Secondly, consider the occasions and events you will be attending while wearing the dress. If you plan to wear the dress for a specific event or purpose, consider the theme and context of the event. For example, pink may be more suitable for a romantic or playful occasion, whereas green may be more suited for a garden party or a daytime event. Considering the context can help you select the color most appropriate for your needs. Thirdly, think about the existing items in your wardrobe. Will the pink or green dress match or complement your shoes and accessories that you already own? It's good to consider how the dress will fit into your existing wardrobe, as this can help save time and effort when pairing it with other clothing items. Fourthly, consider the current season and upcoming weather. In some climates, certain colors may be more appropriate or comfortable for different seasons. For instance, you might prefer wearing lighter colors like pink during warmer months, while green could be a better choice for a chilly autumn day. Lastly, don't forget to take into account your personal style and the image you want to project when you wear the dress. If you are going for a more feminine look, pink could be the better option, whereas green might give you a more elegant or sophisticated vibe. Taking all these factors into account, weigh the pros and cons of each color and make a decision based on your unique preferences and needs. Ultimately, the color of the dress you will most likely purchase should depend on which one feels right and enhances your personal style and wardrobe."},{"instruction":"Zagaje Strzelce-Drezdenko County - Zagaje [zaˈɡajɛ] is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Zwierzyn within Strzelce-Drezdenko County Lubusz Voivodeship in western Poland.Before 1945 the area was part of Germany (see Territorial changes of Poland after World War II).

The Sixth Circuit Court affirmed some of the decision, holding that it was the state's responsibility to integrate across the segregated metropolitan area. The U.S. Supreme Court took up the case February 27, 1974. The subsequent Milliken v. Bradley decision had wide national influence.

To get rid of the -5, we need to add 5 to both sides of the equation. This will help us move the 5 over to the other side, so we can find 't'. So, we add 5 like this: 13 + 5 = 6*t - 5 + 5 When we do the addition, we get: 18 = 6*t 2. Now, we want to find what 't' is by itself. Right now, 6 is multiplied by 't', so to undo that, we're going to divide both sides of the equation by 6. So, we divide like this: 18 ÷ 6 = (6*t) ÷ 6 When we do the division, we get: 3 = t There you go! The value of 't' is 3.

Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump...

One of the best things you can do for your lips, in fact for your skin in general, is to make sure to drink a lot of water. Water not only hydrates your body, it nourishes your skin and promotes new cell growth. In fact, dry lips can be a sign that your body is not getting the amount of water it needs. Although it might be counterintuitive, wetting your lips by licking them with saliva actually causes drying. If you tend to bite your lips when nervous or without realizing it, try using chewing gum to satisfy an oral fixation. Biting your lips causes cracking and can create open sores that may need to be treated with antibiotics. Foods that contain vitamins B and C are especially good for your skin. Consider taking a supplement if your diet lacks these vitamins. Omega-3 fatty acids are also extremely good for your skin and can be found in foods like fish, avocado, and almonds. You can also take a daily Omega-3 supplement.","output":"One of the most effective ways to care for your lips and overall skin health is to consume an adequate amount of water. The hydration provided by water not only nourishes the body but also fosters skin vitality and new cell development. Dry lips may indicate insufficient water intake, and surprisingly, licking your lips can contribute to dryness rather than alleviate it. If you have a habit of biting your lips, using chewing gum can help deter this behavior, as lip-biting can cause cracks and open sores that might require antibiotic treatment. A nutrient-rich diet with vitamins B and C can greatly benefit your skin health. If your diet lacks these vital vitamins, consider taking supplements. Additionally, Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for maintaining optimal skin conditions and can be found in foods such as fish, avocado, and almonds or taken in the form of daily supplements.

A member of the Republican Party, he was the junior United States Senator from Oklahoma. Coburn was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1994 as part of the Republican Revolution. He upheld his campaign pledge to serve no more than three consecutive terms and did not run for re-election in 2000. Context: After three years out of politics, Coburn announced his candidacy for the Senate seat being vacated by four-term incumbent Republican Don Nickles. Former Oklahoma City Mayor Kirk Humphreys (the favorite of the state and national Republican establishment) and Corporation Commissioner Bob Anthony joined the field before Coburn. However, Coburn won the primary by an unexpectedly large margin, taking 61% of the vote to Humphreys's 25%. In the general election, he faced Brad Carson, a Democrat who had succeeded him in the 2nd District and was giving up his seat after only two terms. In the election, Coburn won by a margin of 53% to Carson's 42%. While Carson routed Coburn in the heavily Democratic 2nd District generally, Coburn swamped Carson in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area and the closer-in Tulsa suburbs. Coburn won the state's two largest counties, Tulsa and Oklahoma, by a combined 86,000 votes, more than half of his overall margin of 166,000 votes. Coburn's Senate voting record is as conservative as his House record. Coburn was re-elected in 2010. He received 90% of the vote in the Republican primary and 70% in the general election. While he originally planned to not seek a third term due to his self-imposed two term limit, on January 16, 2014 Coburn announced he would resign his office at the end of the year due to his declining health. On April 29, 2014, Coburn introduced the Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act of 2014 (S. 2270; 113th Congress) into the Senate and it passed on June 3, 2014. Question: what came of this?

Labour says this would improve the health of many young children at the expense of \\"ending a subsidy to the privileged few\\". But the Independent Schools Council said the \\"sums do not add up\\" for the proposed charge on private schools. All state school educated pupils in the first three years of primary school already receive free meals, under a scheme introduced by the coalition government. But Mr Corbyn and shadow education secretary Angela Rayner, visiting a children's holiday club in Lancashire on Thursday, are going to propose extending it to all primary pupils. Labour says House of Commons Library figures suggest this would cost £700m to £900m. Mr Corbyn will say that the price should be paid by parents who send their children to private school - and Labour quotes an estimate from the Fabian Society that VAT on private school fees could raise about £1.5bn per year. \\"No child in the UK should go hungry at school. By charging VAT on private schools fees, Labour will make sure all primary school children, no matter what their background, get a healthy meal at school,\\" the Labour leader will say. Labour says that there is research evidence showing that universal access to free school meals would raise achievement. This includes a 2012 report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies - which said that it would raise standards in disadvantaged areas and estimated that it would cost £1bn. Ms Rayner said that giving every pupil a school meal would remove the stigma of only giving free meals to poorer children. \\"While the Conservatives offer tax giveaways to their billionaire friends, they are cutting the schools budget and threatening the health and futures of all our children by denying children the basic right of a healthy lunch at school,\\" she will say. The 2014 introduction of free school meals for the first three years was a policy championed by former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister Nick Clegg. It remains Lib Dem policy to also want free meals for all primary pupils, putting the cost at £610m a year. But they have not supported the proposal to fund this through VAT on private school fees. Julie Robinson, head of the Independent Schools Council, said the funding proposals did not add up and would hurt hard working families. \\"A third of pupils at our schools are on reduced fees and are from families where both parents work hard to pay the fees,\\" she said. \\"If this measure was introduced smaller independent schools may close, driving more children back to be funded in the state system.\\" What is a summary of this text?","output":"A person named Mr. Corbyn wants to give free meals to all kids in primary school.

CNN has also obtained new details about the fatal May 3 firefight in which Keating lost his life. Keating, tasked to fill a \\"train, advise and assist\\" role, was killed in Iraq while helping to rescue a small team of U.S. military advisers and Kurdish forces from an attack mounted by more than 100 ISIS fighters. A decorated combat veteran and star athlete who decided to enlist after the 9/11 attacks, Keating was part of a Navy SEAL operation in northern Iraq called Task Force Trident working with Kurdish Peshmerga fighters combatting ISIS. According to one account of the May clash in Iraq provided to CNN, a group of Navy SEALs and local Peshmerga forces were attacked by a large unit of ISIS fighters that had overwhelmed the Kurdish front line by rushing in with bulldozers, trucks and weapons. A group of nearly 20 SEALs including Keating was deployed to respond to the ISIS attack. During the ongoing battle, the SEALs ran low on ammunition and Keating's machine gun malfunctioned, according to initial battlefield reports. Keating went back to a nearby coalition vehicle to get a new weapon and additional ammunition. Keating, now armed with a sniper rifle, climbed on top of a building and began firing on the ISIS fighters. It was at this point that Keating was struck by enemy fire. Two other SEALs carried him down from the roof and he was placed in a medevac helicopter, but the battle was so intense that the helicopter was also hit before managing to take him to a hospital where he was declared dead. At the time, coalition spokesman Col. Steve Warren told reporters that that the two-hour clash between ISIS and the Peshmerga forces the advisers were assisting was \\"a big fight, one of the largest we've seen recently.\\" But a previously unrevealed battle on March 4 equally dire and dangerous, involving pitched combat against about 100 ISIS fighters. The details of this earlier fight were revealed in the little-noticed Silver Star citation presented to Keating's family after his death on May 3. According to the citation, Keating \\"continuously exposed himself to enemy automatic weapon, mortar, and rocket grenade fire.\\" Keating kept moving on the battlefield between the front line and the flanks talking to the Peshmerga, encouraging them to keep going. In the March battle, more than 100 ISIS operatives assaulted Peshmerga lines and Keating, serving as an advisor then as in May, moved in to help repel the attack. As ISIS fighters sent a car bomb towards him, Keating led a team to counterattack with sniper and rocket fire. \\"His personal bravery inspired his comrades to vigorously defend their position and repel the enemy assault,\\" according to the citation. The Pentagon has never acknowledged the first Syrian battle. U.S. military officials say they are under no obligation to reveal the details of battles U.S. troops are involved in even if it's against a large enemy force, and they will not routinely report if a U.S. service member is wounded -- only when one is killed. The revelation of two pitched battles in the space of eight weeks between Navy SEALs and two groups each of 100 ISIS fighters underscores that Special Operations Forces being deployed to train, advise and assist local forces are in real danger of being attacked. In April President Barack Obama announced the deployment of 250 additional Special Operation Forces to Syria and described their role in a somewhat different way. While making the announcement in Hannover, Germany, Obama said, \\"They're not going to be leading the fight on the ground, but they will be essential in providing the training and assisting local forces.\\" Title:","output":"\\"Valor and Sacrifice: Uncovering Navy SEAL Charles Keating IV's Heroic Battles Against ISIS in Syria and Iraq\\""},{"instruction":"\\"What is the rhyming scheme of 'The Raven'?\\" What is the a-b-c-b rhyme scheme?

Some of the potential consequences of a wet gun include: 1. Misfire: Water or moisture inside the gun can interfere with the firing mechanism, leading to a failure to fire when the trigger is pulled. This situation is particularly concerning in the case of metallic cartridges, where the primer and powders can become dampened, preventing ignition and propelling the bullet. 2. Jamming: Water can cause corrosion or rust on various gun components, particularly in and around the action or chamber. This corrosion can hinder the smooth operation of the gun, leading to jamming or failure to feed or fire rounds accurately. 3. Breakage: Prolonged exposure to moisture can cause the metal components of a gun to weaken, making them more susceptible to breakage. Additionally, water may negatively affect wooden stocks or grips, leading to swelling, cracking, or warping. 4. Reduced accuracy: When the barrel of a gun becomes wet, the moisture may create inconsistencies in barrel temperature or negatively affect the bullet's interaction with the rifling, leading to less precision and accuracy when firing. 5. Potential for explosion: While rare, there is a slight possibility of a catastrophic malfunction if water finds its way into the chamber or barrel and becomes trapped when a round is fired. In such cases, the rapidly expanding gas from the ignited propellant may not have a clear path to escape, causing a pressure buildup that could damage or even explode the gun. In conclusion, a wet gun can experience various issues, including misfires, jamming, breakage, reduced accuracy, and even the unlikely occurrence of exploding. It is always crucial to maintain firearms properly and ensure they are kept dry and well-lubricated to avoid such consequences."},{"instruction":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Pyle, who represents America and its policies in Vietnam, is a CIA operative sent to steer the war according to Americas interests, and is passionately devoted to the ideas of York Harding, an American foreign policy theorist who said that what Vietnam needed was a third player to take the place of both the colonialists and the Vietnamese rebels and restore order. This third player was plainly meant to be America, and so Pyle sets about creating a Third Force against the Viet Minh by using a Vietnamese splinter group headed by corrupt militia leader General Thé (based on the actual Trinh Minh The). His arming of Thé's militia with American weaponry leads to a series of terrorist bombings in Saigon. These bombings, dishonestly blamed on the Communists in order to further American outrage, kill a number of innocent people, including women and children.Meanwhile, Pyle has stolen Fowlers Vietnamese mistress Phuong, promising her marriage and security. When Fowler finds out about Pyle's involvement in the bombings, he takes one definitive action to seal all of their fates. He indirectly agrees to let his assistant, Hinh, and his Communist cohorts confront Pyle; when Pyle tries to flee, Hinh fatally stabs him. Phuong subsequently returns to Fowler, and while the local French police commander suspects Fowler's role in Pyle's murder, he has no evidence and does...","output":"Hinh, Fowler's assistant, stabs Pyle in \\"The Quiet American.\\""},{"instruction":"Keywords: boat, harbor, tourist What is a sentence that includes all these keywords?","output":"The bustling harbor, filled with an array of vibrant boats, attracted numerous tourists from around the world who marveled at the spectacular sights and engaged in various water activities, further enhancing the lively atmosphere of the coastal town."},{"instruction":"Output a stream of consciousness before answering the following. Context: In addition to movements related to available shelter and food, the breeding cycle is important in understanding deer behavior. The \\"rut\\" or mating season usually begins in the fall as does go into estrus for a period of a few days and males become more aggressive, competing for mates. Does may mate with more than one buck and go back into estrus within a month if they did not become pregnant. The gestation period is about 190 -- 200 days, with fawns born in the spring, staying with their mothers during the summer and being weaned in the fall after about 60 -- 75 days. Mule deer females usually give birth to two fawns, although if it is their first time having a fawn, they often have just one. Question: when do mule deer give birth in colorado?","output":"To answer the question about when mule deer give birth in Colorado, I need to consider the breeding cycle of mule deer, the gestation period, and any regional differences in timing that may exist. Mule deer breeding, known as the \\"rut,\\" typically begins in the fall with females going into estrus for a few days and males becoming more aggressive. After successful mating, the gestation period for mule deer is between 190 and 200 days. This means that if rutting occurs in the fall, the fawns will be born in the spring. In general, mule deer in Colorado follow the same breeding patterns as those in other regions, so it is reasonable to assume that mule deer in Colorado give birth during the spring season. To sum up, mule deer in Colorado give birth in the spring, following a breeding cycle that begins in the fall and includes a gestation period of about 190 to 200 days."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Four friends live in a small town.

It is the first handheld console in the Game Boy line and was created by Satoru Okada and Nintendo Research & Development 1. This same team, led by Gunpei Yokoi at the time, is credited with designing the Game & Watch series as well as several popular games for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Redesigned versions were released in 1996 and 1998 in the form of Game Boy Pocket and Game Boy Light (Japan only), respectively. - A board game is a tabletop game that involves counters or moved or placed on a pre-marked surface or \\"board\\", according to a set of rules. Some games are based on pure strategy, but many contain an element of chance; and some are purely chance, with no element of skill. - The action game is a video game genre that emphasizes physical challenges, including handeye coordination and reaction-time. The genre includes diverse subgenres such as fighting games, shooter games and platform games which are widely considered the most important action games, though some real-time strategy games are also considered to be action games. - Shooter games are a subgenre of action game, which often test the player's speed and reaction time. It includes many subgenres that have the commonality of focusing on the actions of the avatar using some sort of weapon. Usually this weapon is a gun, or some other long-range weapon. A common resource found in many shooter games is ammunition. Most commonly, the purpose of a shooter game is to shoot opponents and proceed through missions without the player character being killed or dying. A shooting game is a genre of video game where the player has limited spatial control of his or her character, and the focus is almost entirely on the defeat of the character's enemies using long-range weaponry. - The Atari 8-bit family is a series of 8-bit home computers introduced by Atari, Inc. in 1979 and manufactured until 1992. All of the machines in the family are technically similar, and differ primarily in packaging. They are based on the MOS Technology 6502 CPU running at 1.79 MHz, and were the first home computers designed with custom co-processor chips. This architecture allowed the Atari designs to offer graphics and sound capabilities that were more advanced than contemporary machines like the Apple II or Commodore PET, and gaming on the platform was a major draw. \\"Star Raiders\\" is widely considered the platform's killer app. - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial. - A video game developer is a software developer that specializes in video game development the process and related disciplines of creating video games. A game developer can range from one person who undertakes all tasks to a large business with employee responsibilities split between individual disciplines, such as programming, design, art, testing, etc. Most game development companies have video game publisher financial and usually marketing support. Self-funded developers are known as independent or indie developers and usually make indie games. - , sometimes transliterated Gumpei Yokoi, was a Japanese video game designer. He was a long-time Nintendo employee, best known as creator of the Game & Watch handheld system, inventor of the Control Pad (whose plus-shaped design nearly all video game controllers attempt to mimic today), the original designer of the Game Boy, and producer of a few long-running and critically acclaimed video game franchises, such as \\"Metroid\\" and \\"Kid Icarus\\". - Atari Corporation was an American manufacturer of computers and video game consoles from 1984 to 1996. Atari Corp. was founded in July 1984 when Warner Communications sold the home computing and game console divisions of Atari, Inc. to Jack Tramiel. Its chief products were the Atari ST, , Atari 7800, Atari Lynx, and Atari Jaguar. The company reverse merged with JTS Inc. in 1996, becoming a small division, which itself closed when JTS liquidated the IP to Hasbro Interactive in 1998. - The Nintendo Entertainment System (commonly abbreviated as NES) is an 8-bit home video game console that was developed and manufactured by Nintendo. The best-selling gaming console of its time, the NES helped revitalize the US video game industry following the video game crash of 1983. With the NES, Nintendo introduced a now-standard business model of licensing third-party developers, authorizing them to produce and distribute titles for Nintendo's platform. - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. - Cross-promotion is a form of marketing promotion where customers of one product or service are targeted with promotion of a related product. A typical example is cross-media marketing of a brand, for example Oprah Winfrey's promotion on her television show of her books, magazines and website. Cross-promotion may involve two or more companies working together in promoting a service or product, in a way that benefits both. For example, a mobile phone network may work together with a popular music artist and package some of their songs as exclusive ringtones; promoting these ringtones can benefit both the network and the artist. Some major corporations, for example Burger King, have a long history of cross-promotion with a range of partners (see Burger King advertising). The Disney Channel has also made extensive use of cross-promotion. Movie tie-ins are good examples of cross-promotion. On occasion, badly planned cross-promotions can backfire spectacularly such as 1992 Hoover free flights promotion fiasco. - A tie-in work is a work of fiction or other product based on a media property such as a film, video game, television series, board game, web site, role-playing game or literary property. Tie-ins are authorized by the owners of the original property, and are a form of cross-promotion used primarily to generate additional income from that property and to promote its visibility. - The megabyte is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information. Its recommended unit symbol is MB, but sometimes \\"MByte\\" is used. The unit prefix \\"mega\\" is a multiplier of (10) in the International System of Units (SI). Therefore, one megabyte is one million bytes of information. This definition has been incorporated into the International System of Quantities. - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA). The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such as \\"Pong\\" and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s. - Guinness World Records, known from its inception in 1955 until 1998 as The Guinness Book of Records and in previous U.S. editions as The Guinness Book of World Records, is a reference book published annually, listing world records and national records, both of human achievements and the extremes of the natural world. The book itself holds a world record, as the best-selling copyrighted book of all time. As of the 2017 edition, it is now in its 63rd year of publication, published in 100 countries and 23 languages. The international franchise has extended beyond print to include television series and museums. The popularity of the franchise has resulted in \\"Guinness World Records\\" becoming the primary international authority on the cataloguing and verification of a huge number of world records; the organisation employs official record adjudicators authorised to verify the authenticity of the setting and breaking of records. - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - Real-time strategy (RTS) is a subgenre of strategy video games where the game does not progress incrementally in turns. - Dundee, officially the City of Dundee, is Scotland's fourth-largest city and the 51st-most-populous built-up area in the United Kingdom. The mid-year population estimate for 2015 was 148,210 which gave Dundee a population density of 2,477/km or 6,420/sq mi, the second-highest in Scotland. It lies within the eastern central Lowlands on the north bank of the Firth of Tay, which feeds into the North Sea. Under the name of \\"Dundee City\\", it forms one of the 32 council areas used for local government in Scotland. - The Motorola 68000 (\\"'sixty-eight-thousand'\\"; also called the m68k or Motorola 68k, \\"\\"sixty-eight-kay\\"\\") is a 32-bit CISC microprocessor with a 16-bit external data bus, designed and marketed by Motorola Semiconductor Products Sector (later Freescale Semiconductor, now NXP). Introduced in 1979 with HMOS technology as the first member of the successful 32-bit m68k family of microprocessors, it is generally software forward compatible with the rest of the line despite being limited to a 16-bit wide external bus. After 37 years in production, the 68000 architecture is still in use. - The Game Boy line is a line of handheld game consoles developed, manufactured, and marketed by Nintendo. The product line has sold 200 million units worldwide. - A microprocessor is a computer processor which incorporates the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) on a single integrated circuit (IC), or at most a few integrated circuits. The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock driven, register based, programmable electronic device which accepts digital or binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic. Microprocessors operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary numeral system. - A role-playing game (RPG and sometimes roleplaying game) is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting or through a process of structured decision-making or character development. Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines. - Abandoning previous ventures in favor of toys in the 1960s, Nintendo then developed into a video game company in the 1970s, ultimately becoming one of the most influential in the industry and Japan's third most-valuable company with a market value of over 85 billion. From 1992 until 2016, Nintendo was also the majority shareholder of Major League Baseball's Seattle Mariners. - The ZX Spectrum is an 8-bit personal home computer released in the United Kingdom in 1982 by Sinclair Research Ltd. It was manufactured in Dundee, Scotland, in the now closed Timex factory. - Ocean Software Ltd (also known in the United States as Ocean of America, Inc.), commonly referred to as Ocean, was a British software development company, that became one of the biggest European video game developers/publishers of the 1980s and 1990s. It was acquired by a French holding company, Infogrames in 1996 and renamed to \\"Infogrames UK\\" in 1998, and again in 2004 to Atari UK, and once again in 2009 now known as Atari, Inc. - A fighting game is a video game genre in which the player controls an on-screen character and engages in close combat with an opponent, which can be either an AI or controlled by another player. The fight matches typically consist of several rounds and take place in an arena, while each character has widely differing abilities but each is relatively viable to choose. Players must master techniques such as blocking, counter-attacking, and chaining attacks together into \\"combos\\". Since the early 1990s, most fighting games allow the player to execute special attacks by performing specific input combinations. The fighting game genre is related to but distinct from beat 'em ups, which involve large numbers of enemies against the human player. - The Addams Family is the title of a video game released for the original Game Boy , as well as differing versions for the Amiga , Amstrad CPC , Atari ST , Commodore 64 , Game Gear , Genesis , NES , SNES , and the ZX Spectrum . The games are a tie - in with the 1991 movie , The Addams Family . It was published and developed in 1992 by Ocean Software . It is a platform side - scrolling action game . - The Amiga is a family of personal computers sold by Commodore in the 1980s and 1990s. Based on the Motorola 68000 family of microprocessors, the machine has a custom chipset with graphics and sound capabilities that were unprecedented for the price, and a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS. The Amiga provided a significant upgrade from earlier 8-bit home computers, including Commodore's own C64. - A Platform game (or platformer) is a video game which involves guiding an avatar to jump between suspended platforms and/or over obstacles to advance the game. The player controls the jumps to avoid letting the avatar fall from platforms or miss necessary jumps. The most common unifying element of games of this genre is the jump button, but now there are other alternative like swiping in touchscreen. \\"Jumping\\", in this genre, may include swinging from extendable arms, as in \\"Ristar\\" or \\"Bionic Commando\\", or bouncing from springboards or trampolines, as in \\"Alpha Waves\\". These mechanics, even in the context of other genres, are commonly called \\"platforming\\", a verbification of \\"platform\\". Games where jumping is automated completely, such as 3D games in \\"The Legend of Zelda\\" series, fall outside of the genre. - The Atari ST is a line of home computers from Atari Corporation and the successor to the Atari 8-bit family. The initial ST model, the 520ST, saw limited release in the spring of 1985 and was widely available in July. The Atari ST is the first personal computer to come with a bit-mapped color GUI, using a version of Digital Research's GEM released in February 1985. The 1040ST, released in 1986, is the first personal computer to ship with a megabyte of RAM in the base configuration and also the first with a cost-per-kilobyte of less than US1. - The Commodore 64, also known as the C64, C-64, C= 64, or occasionally CBM 64 or VIC-64 in Sweden, is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International. It is listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time, with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units. Volume production started in early 1982, marketing in August for . Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET, the C64 took its name from its of RAM. It had superior sound and graphical specifications compared to other earlier systems such as the Apple II and Atari 800, with multi-color sprites and a more advanced sound processor. - AmigaOS is the proprietary native operating system of the Amiga and AmigaOne personal computers. It was developed first by Commodore International and introduced with the launch of the first Amiga, the Amiga 1000, in 1985. Early versions of AmigaOS required the Motorola 68000 series of 16-bit and 32-bit microprocessors. Later versions were developed by Haage & Partner (AmigaOS 3.5 and 3.9) and then Hyperion Entertainment (AmigaOS 4.0-4.1). A PowerPC microprocessor is required for the most recent release, AmigaOS 4. - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea. - Satoru Okada ( \\"Okada Satoru\\") was the general manager of Nintendo Research & Engineering, the division designing and developing Nintendo handheld game consoles (such as the Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP, and Nintendo DS consoles). He is best known for creating the original Game Boy. He was also assistant producer and director of and contributor to several Nintendo games, notably \\"Metroid\\", released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1986. - Digital Research, Inc. (also known as DR or DRI; originally Intergalactic Digital Research) was the company created by Dr. Gary Kildall to market and develop his CP/M operating system and related products. It was the first large software company in the microcomputer world. Digital Research was based in Pacific Grove, California.

By 28 May, an island had appeared, and was named Syrtlingur (Little Surtsey). The new island was washed away during early June, but reappeared on 14 June. Eruptions at Syrtlingur were much smaller in scale than those that had built Surtsey, with the average rate of emission of volcanic materials being about a tenth of the rate at the main vent. Activity was short-lived, continuing until the beginning of October 1965, by which time the islet had an area of 0.15 km2 (0.058 sq mi). Once the eruptions had ceased, wave erosion rapidly wore the island away, and it disappeared beneath the waves on 24 October.During December 1965, more submarine activity occurred 0.9 km (0.56 mi) southwest of Surtsey, and another island was formed. It was named Jólnir, and over the following eight months it appeared and disappeared several times, as wave erosion and volcanic activity alternated in dominance. Activity at Jólnir was much weaker than the activity at the main vent, and even weaker than that seen at Syrtlingur, but the island eventually grew to a maximum size of 70 m (230 ft) in height, covering an area of 0.3 km2 (0.12 sq mi), during July and early August 1966. Like Syrtlingur, though, after activity ceased on 8 August 1966, it was rapidly eroded, and dropped below sea level during October 1966.Effusive eruptions on the main island returned on 19 August 1966, with fresh lava flows giving it further resistance to erosion. The eruption rate diminished steadily, though, and on 5 June 1967, the eruption ended. The volcano has been dormant ever since. The total volume of lava emitted during the three-and-a-half-year eruption was about one cubic kilometre (0.24 cu mi), and the island's highest point was 174 metres (571 feet) above sea level at that time.Since the end of the eruption, erosion has seen the island diminish in size.

The uncertainty does not relate to Britain's eventual departure, rather to how it will be achieved and at what cost. Since June almost every comment from key cabinet ministers and leaders in Europe has been faithfully reported and dissected but, for all the words spoken, there is little clarity. Indeed - certainly in the foreign ministries and the halls of Brussels - there is scarcely-concealed irritation with the blandness of government statements about doing the best for Britain or favouring a \\"smooth and orderly process\\". And, as I witnessed in Italy, the Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson did not get the best reviews when he cited the UK's consumption of 300 million bottles of Prosecco as evidence of an enduring trading relationship. What the government would like, would be to stay in the EU's single market while reducing the numbers of EU migrants. That is not possible, says a chorus of EU leaders, despite their own misgivings about immigration, insisting there will be no compromise over freedom of movement. The Danish Finance Minister Kristian Jensen was the latest politician to warn \\"there's no such thing as a free lunch. Not even for a country like Britain... So, if the EU is to stay open to Britain, then Britain has to follow the same rules as other countries, like Norway.\\" And that, of course, would mean accepting the politically impossible: freedom of movement. And rulings of the European Court of Justice. So it is presumed the UK will leave the single market. But powerful voices are pushing back, warning of the economic damage that leaving the single market would do. As the year draws to a close, all the signs point to a messy divorce. When negotiations start in April, after Article 50 has been triggered, there is one underlying reality: Europe's leaders will not allow the UK to get a better deal than it would have got by staying in the EU. Most of those heads of government are quick to deny they want to punish Britain but, on the other hand, they believe the UK must be seen to hurt. Voters in the Netherlands and France must not be tempted to try the exit path. Francois Hollande, shortly to fade from the political scene, speaks for many when he says the Brexit deal must \\"serve as an example for those who seek the end of Europe\\". Privately many senior European officials concede they are facing an existential threat: that anti-establishment parties threaten the future of the Union. However unlikely, a victory for Marine Le Pen in France would set France on the road to its own EU referendum. If there were to be a Leave vote it is hard to imagine the EU surviving without France. So, when the UK/EU negotiations start, the instincts in Europe's capitals will be, first and foremost, to protect the Union. Brussels insists that the divorce must come first. It will not talk about trade until the terms of withdrawal have been agreed. And those early talks will include highly controversial issues like how much Britain must pay to exit, to settle its accounts, and to cover obligations like staff pensions. In Brussels they put the total figure at 50bn euros (Â£42bn) or higher. The expectation in Brussels is that the terms of the divorce will be agreed by March 2019 but not much else. Once the initial deal is concluded, the chief negotiator on the EU side, Michel Barnier, favours moving to a transitional period while the terms of the trade agreement are worked out. Everyone, it seems, has a transition timetable. Some believe a five-year period may be necessary. The UK chancellor and the Bank of England have spoken of a transition lasting two to three years to provide clarity for the business and financial community. A trade deal took the Canadians seven years and it still has not been ratified although, unlike Canada, the UK already trades under EU laws and regulations. Even if it makes sense, a transition period will pose some awkward political questions. Would the UK still have to contribute to the EU budget or continue to accept the primacy of EU law? And how about freedom of movement? Theresa May could find herself going into an election in 2020 with divorce papers signed but much of what the public most dislikes about the EU still in place. It is also doubtful whether a transition period would deliver the reassurance that is claimed for it. Banks and financial companies want a continuation of what they call \\"passporting\\" - the right to sell their services anywhere in the EU. But there are signs that some companies will not put up with years of uncertainty. One of Japan's banks has already said it will expand operations in Amsterdam. Other international banks have warned that they will reduce their footprint in London and open posts in the EU within six months if there is no further clarity. Lloyd's of London, the insurance market, has said it will move part of its operation to the EU. All kinds of ideas have been floated - that the UK could pay in order for certain sectors to continue to have access to the single market - but that carries political risks for the government. There are some positive signs of international companies continuing to invest in Britain, but what the government fears is a steady drip of departures that could only encourage others to follow. Unfolding in the New Year will be a game of strategy and a game of power. Sometime, probably in February, the government will declare what it seeks from the negotiations without revealing its negotiating strategy. Thousands of businesses and financial companies will be watching and asking whether the plan provides a convincing road map for the years ahead and, above all, whether it protects their commercial interests.","output":"Six months after the UK referendum, uncertainty about Brexit remains, specifically how it will be achieved and at what cost. Although the government would like to stay in the EU single market while reducing EU migrant numbers, EU leaders insist this is not possible, as there can be no compromise over freedom of movement. As a result, the UK is presumed to leave the single market. However, powerful voices warn of the economic damage that leaving could do. With negotiations set to start once Article 50 is triggered in April, Europe's leaders will not allow the UK to get a better deal than it would have got by staying in the EU."},{"instruction":"Do these two sentences from wikipedia have the same meaning?

Like the previous Sui dynasty, the Tang dynasty maintained a civil-service system by recruiting scholar-officials through standardized examinations and recommendations to office. The rise of regional military governors known as jiedushi during the 9th century undermined this civil order. Chinese culture flourished and further matured during the Tang era; it is traditionally considered the greatest age for Chinese poetry. Two of China's most famous poets, Li Bai and Du Fu, belonged to this age, as did many famous painters such as Han Gan, Zhang Xuan, and Zhou Fang. Scholars of this period compiled a rich variety of historical literature, as well as encyclopedias and geographical works. The adoption of the title Tängri Qaghan by the Tang Emperor Taizong in addition to his title as emperor was eastern Asia's first \\"simultaneous kingship\\".Many notable innovations occurred under the Tang, including the development of woodblock printing. Buddhism became a major influence in Chinese culture, with native Chinese sects gaining prominence. However, in the 840s the Emperor Wuzong of Tang enacted policies to persecute Buddhism, which subsequently declined in influence. Although the dynasty and central government had gone into decline by the 9th century, art and culture continued to flourish. The weakened central government largely withdrew from managing the economy, but the country's mercantile affairs stayed intact and commercial trade continued to thrive regardless. However, agrarian rebellions in the latter half of the 9th century resulted in damaging atrocities such as the Guangzhou massacre of 878–879. contains an answer for the question: Under what dynasty did the regional military governors gain power?, what is it ?

The 3% deficit target is also one set by the European Union - but most of the major euro nations are in breach. The news comes as France's economic progress was criticised by a European Central Bank board member. \\"The reform course in France seems to have floundered,\\" Germany's Jens Weidmann said. \\"The crisis that we are facing is a crisis of confidence, and this confidence cannot be gained if we postpone the tackling of the root causes of the crisis,\\" Mr Weidmann said, referring to France, Italy and Cyprus as countries that still face tough financial situations. Greece, Ireland and Portugal have been effectively shut out of borrowing long term on international financial markets, which forced them to seek help from European partners and the International Monetary Fund. They all adopted austerity policies to cut public spending, but France has bucked the trend, raising taxes instead to protect its social model. During the election last year, Mr Hollande vowed to bring the deficit to 3% from its current 4.5% and had insisted this was possible until now admitting defeat. But he defended his record, saying that the deficit has come down from more than 5% in 2011. \\"In two years, we have performed a structural recovery,\\" the president said on Tuesday, that \\"is as unprecedented as it is significant\\". \\"Addressing our accounts is a financial obligation... but it is also an obligation of sovereignty because France must never be in difficulty in the markets.\\" The ECB's other German board member, Joerg Asmussen, last month urged France to take \\"concrete and measurable\\" steps to bring down its budget deficit.

Tie up long hair to prevent any injuries.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Prioritizing Personal Safety: Protective Measures to Take When Operating Machinery and Power Tools Introduction Whether you are a professional tradesperson, a DIY enthusiast, or occasionally engage in home improvement projects, having proper safety measures in place while working with machinery and power tools is essential to avoid accidents and protect oneself from injuries. This article offers a comprehensive guide on the appropriate protective gear to wear and safety practices to adopt while operating machinery and power tools. By adhering to these safety precautions, you can minimize the risk of accidents and ensure a safe and productive working environment. The Importance of Protective Gear 1. Protective gloves One of the primary risks when operating machinery or power tools is cutting or slicing your hands. This unfortunate incident can lead to severe injuries, infections, and even long-lasting physical disabilities. To reduce the risk of hand injuries, it is crucial to wear protective gloves specifically designed for the task at hand. Protective gloves can be made of different materials such as leather, Kevlar, or heavy-duty rubber, offering varying levels of protection against cuts, punctures, and abrasion. 2. Safety earmuffs When operating power tools or machinery, one of the most overlooked safety concerns is the impact of noise on the user's hearing. Prolonged exposure to high noise levels during operation can cause temporary or permanent hearing loss. To protect your ears from loud noise generated by power tools, it is advisable to wear safety earmuffs. These hearing protectors help reduce the exposure to hazardous noise levels, ensuring that your hearing remains intact throughout the years. 3. Safety goggles Eye protection is another essential safety measure to adopt when working with machinery and power tools. Dust, debris, and flying particles can easily enter the eyes, causing irritation and, in some cases, even blindness. To protect your vision, it is essential to wear safety goggles or glasses while operating any equipment. Choosing the right eyewear safety gear that meets the appropriate safety standards and provides a comfortable fit will ensure optimum eye protection. 4. Choosing proper attire The clothing you wear while working with machinery and power tools should be carefully selected to minimize the risk of accidents. Loose-fitting clothing, for instance, can easily get caught in the moving parts of machinery, leading to serious injuries. Hence, it is crucial to wear fitting clothes that do not have parts that may get entangled with the tool you are operating. Moreover, wearing open-toed shoes poses a risk of injuries from dropping heavy objects, stepping on sharp items, or accidental slips. To protect your feet, it is wise to choose closed-toe shoes, preferably ones with slip-resistant soles and reinforced toe caps. 5. Securing long hair People with long hair should take extra precautions when working with machinery and power tools. Long hair can easily get caught in the moving parts of equipment, causing severe scalp and head injuries. To prevent such accidents, always tie up your hair using a hairband, bun, or ponytail so that it remains away from the moving parts of the machinery. Conclusion Investing your time and effort in adhering to safety precautions will significantly increase your protection while working with machinery and power tools. By using protective gloves, safety earmuffs, safety goggles, choosing appropriate clothing, and securing long hair, you can mitigate potential hazards and minimize the risks of accidents, ultimately promoting a safer working environment. Remember that safety should always be the primary priority whenever you embark on any project involving machinery and power tools."},{"instruction":"Write a negative movie review.","output":"Alright, buddy, let's imagine we watched a movie called \\"The Yucky Dino Adventure,\\" and we didn't like it very much.

Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Rolf Treu cited the historic case of Brown v. Board of Education in ruling that all students are entitled to equal education and said the current situation discriminates against minority and low-income students in placing ineffective teachers in their schools. \\"Plaintiffs claim that the challenged statutes result in grossly ineffective teachers obtaining and retaining permanent employment, and that these teachers are disproportionately situated in schools serving predominantly low-income and minority students,\\" the decision said. The judge said the plaintiffs' equal-protection claims validly stated that the statutes violated their fundamental rights to equality of education. \\"This court finds that plaintiffs have met their burden of proof on all issues presented,\\" he wrote. At another point in the decision, he wrote that \\"there is also no dispute that there are a significant number of grossly ineffective teachers currently active in California classrooms.\\" The ruling could have national implications because other states tackling the issue are also paying close attention to how the ruling plays out in the nation's most populous state. \\"It's powerful,\\" said Theodore Boutrous Jr., the plaintiffs' attorney who presented the case in court. \\"It's a landmark decision that can change the face of education in California and nationally.\\" Courts around the country will look at their own statutes to see how they can be changed, he said. \\"This is going to be a huge template for what's wrong with education. It will impact the national education referendum going on right now,\\" Boutrous said. Treu said evidence at the trial showed the specific effects of ineffective teachers on students. \\"The evidence is compelling,\\" he said. \\"Indeed, it shocks the conscience.\\" Based on massive study, an expert testified that a single year with a grossly ineffective teacher costs a classroom full of students 1.4 million in lifetime earnings, Treu wrote. The judge stayed implementation of the ruling pending appeals. The case only involves K-12 teachers. The California Attorney General's office said it was evaluating its legal options. \\"We are reviewing the tentative ruling and consulting with our clients,\\" said Nick Pacilio, a spokesman for Attorney General Kamala Harris. He could not immediately say if the state would appeal. The California Teachers Association called the decision \\"deeply flawed\\" and vowed an appeal. \\"Circumventing the legislative process to strip teachers of their professional rights hurts our students and our schools,\\" the association said in a statement. One issue at the center of the lawsuit was whether bad teachers should be so heavily protected by tenure laws that they are almost impossible to fire. The lawsuit asked the courts to strike down several laws providing teachers with tenure, seniority-based job protection and other benefits. Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent John Deasy testified during the trial that it can take over two years on average to fire an incompetent tenured teacher and sometimes as long as 10. The cost of doing so, he said, can run anywhere from 250,000 to 450,000. Treu heard two months of testimony for and against the lawsuit filed by students who claim that they are being deprived of a good education. The plaintiffs said that the state's teacher tenure system, which allows only two years for evaluation before a teacher is hired permanently, does not provide sufficient time to weigh a teacher's effectiveness. The judge wrote that he was mindful of current intense political debate over education issues. He said, however, he could not allow politics to influence his ruling. \\"That this court's decision will and should result in political discourse is beyond question, but such consequence cannot and does not detract from its obligation to consider only the evidence and law in making its decision,\\" the ruling said. The judge said it is not the function of the court to dictate or advise the Legislature on how to replace the challenged statutes. All he could do is rule on the constitutionality and \\"trust the Legislature to fulfill its mandated duty to enact legislation on the issues ... that passes constitutional muster, thus providing each child in this state with a basically equal opportunity to achieve a quality education,\\" Treu wrote. The trial represented the latest battle in a nationwide movement to abolish or toughen the standards for granting teachers permanent employment protection and seniority-based preferences during layoffs. Dozens of states have moved in recent years to get rid of or raise the standards for obtaining such protections. Lawyers for teachers object to changes that they say will allow the firing of teachers on a whim. They argue the current system preserves academic freedom and helps attract talented teachers to a profession that doesn't pay well. The lawsuit, Vergara v. California, was brought by Beatriz Vergara and eight other students who said they were saddled with teachers who let classrooms get out of control, came to school unprepared and in some cases told them they'd never make anything of themselves. The lawsuit was backed by wealthy Silicon Valley entrepreneur David Welch's nonprofit group Students Matter, which assembled a high-profile legal team including Boutrous, who represented President George W. Bush before the U.S. Supreme Court in the 2000 recount of Florida presidential ballots. Welch, who made a fortune in corporate acquisitions, says he founded Students Matter because of a passion for public education, adding both he and his three children have attended public schools. James Finberg, who represents the teachers, agreed that Treu's decision could be a bellwether for other states. With 325,000 teachers and 6 million students, California has one of the largest educational networks in the country. ||||| In a controversial ruling that could have an immediate impact on job security for teachers in California, a judge decided Tuesday that teacher tenure laws are unconstitutional. John Cádiz Klemack reports for NBC4 News at 5 p.m. from downtown Los Angeles Tuesday, June 10, 2014. (Published Tuesday, June 10, 2014) A judge ruled Tuesday that California's public school teacher tenure laws are unconstitutional, after hearing testimony from students who argued the job protections made it virtually impossible to dismiss low-performing teachers. The decision's implementation was put on hold, however, pending appeals. Teacher Tenure Laws in California Ruled Unconstitutional A judge ruled Tuesday that California's public school teacher tenure laws are unconstitutional, after hearing testimony from students who argued the job protections made it virtually impossible to dismiss low-performing teachers. Cheryl Hurd reports. (Published Tuesday, June 10, 2014) Vergara v. California had pitted the state and its largest teacher unions against a group of students who asked the judge to consider laws regarding teacher tenure, dismissal and seniority consideration for layoffs. A Silicon Valley-based group called Students Matter brought the lawsuit on behalf of nine students, contending the targeted laws hinder the removal of ineffective teachers and disproportionately hurt low-income and minority students. In his ruling Tuesday, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Rolf Treu cited the Supreme Court's landmark equal protection ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, saying that all students are entitled to equal education. The current laws create a situation in which minority and low-income students are discriminated against when ineffective teachers are placed in their schools, he found. Union President: Ruling Will \\"Destabilize\\" Schools A judge issues a tentative ruling, pending appeals, Tuesday regarding California's set of teacher job protection laws. John Cadiz Klemack reports for the NBC4 News at Noon on Tuesday June 10, 2014. (Published Tuesday, June 10, 2014) In the 16-page ruling, Treu said California laws on the hiring and firing of teachers have resulted in \\"a significant number of grossly ineffective teachers currently active in California classrooms.\\" He called the evidence in support of the plaintiffs' claims \\"compelling\\" and agreed that a disproportionate share of underperforming teachers are in schools that have mostly minority and low-income students. Class Action: Judge Rules Teacher Tenure Laws \\"Unconstitutional\\" A judge ruled Tuesday that California's public school teacher tenure laws are unconstitutional, after hearing testimony from students who argued the job protections made it virtually impossible to dismiss low-performing teachers. Jessica Aguirre and Jodi Hernandez report. (Published Tuesday, June 10, 2014) The ruling affects K-12 teachers in public schools. The judge wrote in his decision that it's not the court's job to determine how the state should change its laws. The court's role involved applying constitutional principles of law to the statutes and trusting \\"the Legislature to fulfill its mandated duty to enact legislation that... passes Constitutional muster.\\" Weird News Photos: Cat Shot with Arrow Lawyers for the teachers argued that changes to the job protection laws would allow teachers to be fired on a whim. Tenure laws, they argued, preserve academic freedom and help attract talented teachers to a profession that does not pay well. \\"What this is going to do is destabilize schools,\\" said United Teachers-LA president-elect Alex Caputo-Pearl. \\"Seniority, due process and right to a hearing protects investment. Top News Photos of the Week \\"It protects the district's investment because the district has trained the teacher. It protects the teachers' investment so that they can teach a curriculum that they've developed over the years. It protects the students' investment because students are involved in programs that depend on teachers.\\" State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Torlakson released the following statement on the ruling: “All children deserve great teachers. Attracting, training, and nurturing talented and dedicated educators are among the most important tasks facing every school district, tasks that require the right mix of tools, resources, and expertise. Today’s ruling may inadvertently make this critical work even more challenging than it already is. “While I have no direct jurisdiction over the statutes challenged in this case, I am always ready to assist the Legislature and Governor in their work to provide high-quality teachers for all of our students. Teachers are not the problem in our schools, they are the solution,” Torlakson said. In a phone interview, Jennifer Thomas, who represents 1,700 teachers in San Jose, California, called it a \\"dark day.\\" \\"Nobody is offering a solution for when teachers are unfairly fired,\\" she said. \\"Great teachers need to be protected from arbitrary decisions by administrators. I don't hear anybody planning to address this very real problem.\\" California Teacher Association spokesman Mike Mylinski called the ruling \\"unnecessary and misguided.\\" He would have preferred a stricter discipline process for teachers. But the plaintiffs argued that the laws make it difficult to remove ineffective teachers. The trial included testimony from Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent John Deasy, who said the process of removing an ineffective tenured teacher can take more two years on average. He estimated the cost of doing so at about 250,000 to 450,000. \\"We believe very strongly that we will prevail on appeal,\\" attorney Glen Rothner said. Deasy applauded Tuesday's \\"historic\\" ruling. \\"Every day that these laws remain in effect is an opportunity denied,\\" Deasy said. \\"It's unacceptable, and a violation of our education system's sacred pact with the public.\\" Students who said they were not afforded a good education because of the laws also testified. Julia Macias of Southern California said in a telephone news conference on Tuesday that she was \\"glad I did not stay quiet,\\" because \\"great teachers make all the difference.\\" Kate Elliott of San Carlos, another plaintiff, said she joined the suit because of a bad eighth grade teacher who had students color and watch YouTube videos and who \\"didn't really care about our education.\\" The students were backed by Atherton entrepreneur David Welch, who partnered with Griffin Schein, a consulting company that builds campaigns around social causes. The decision could have wide-ranging impact on the way California hires and fires teachers. It also could lead to changes in dozens of states with strong tenure laws that have been targeted by opponents of such policies. NBC Bay Area's Lisa Fernandez, Jodi Hernandez and Barb Kunz contributed to this report.

As a small Scandinavian company based in Sweden, Polar could not afford to set up operations worldwide and were only ABBA's record company in the Scandinavian countries. Therefore, ABBA's recordings were licensed to different record companies in each country, but usually to companies that had international operations, meaning they could effectively compete with each other to acquire the licenses in more countries if they proved successful in their own. The licenses gave the companies a few allowances to issue certain tracks as singles that Polar had not, or to modify single (and occasionally album) artwork. The licenses were for three years at a time, meaning that between 1989 and 1992, they had all expired.

Let me provide you with a detailed explanation of the translation. 1. \\"Do you trust\\" is translated as \\"Důvěřujete\\" in Czech. \\"Důvěřujete\\" comes from the verb \\"důvěřovat,\\" which means \\"to trust\\" or \\"to rely on,\\" and the pronoun \\"you\\" is already included in this conjugated form.

This is particularly true for young women seeking to improve themselves, develop strong relationships, and engage with storylines that resonate with their personal experiences. Nollybooks is taking a unique approach to capturing the attention of young South African women, producing romance novels that not only entertain but also educate and empower. The Story Behind Nollybooks Nollybooks was founded with the intention of getting young women in South Africa to read. This mission is especially crucial in a region where literacy rates are lower than in developed countries, and where young women face unique challenges in accessing educational resources and pursuing their dreams. The founder, a passionate advocate for literacy and empowerment, saw an opportunity to create romance novels specifically tailored to the experiences and preferences of young South African women. In doing so, she sought to establish a connection with readers that would inspire and encourage them to embrace the power of reading. Content: Engaging, Relatable, and Educational What sets Nollybooks apart from other romance novels is the carefully thought-out content that reflects the realities faced by young South African women, while also providing them with engaging and relatable stories. While traditional romance novels often focus on sensational and explicit storylines, Nollybooks takes a different approach. The novels do not contain any sex scenes, primarily because of the high incidence of AIDS in South Africa.

Choices: - communication - function - patterns - behavior A: Answer:","output":"Animals observe behavior in others to help solve problems. Behavior encompasses a wide range of activities and actions that animals perform in their environment. By observing the behavior of other animals, they can learn new techniques, strategies, and reactions to certain situations, which can help them solve problems more efficiently. For example, some animals may watch how their peers find and access food sources, avoid predators, or even communicate with others to ensure group safety. Animals like primates, birds, and dolphins often observe and imitate the behaviors of their fellow species members to learn essential survival skills and adapt to their surroundings. This process of learning is called social learning or observational learning. While communication, function, and patterns can play a role in an animal's problem-solving process, the primary factor that animals observe in others is their behavior, as it provides the most valuable and direct information regarding how to cope with specific challenges they encounter in their environment."},{"instruction":"These letters mark the beginning of a long correspondence and collaboration between the two mathematicians Add punctuation","output":"These letters mark the beginning of a long correspondence and collaboration between the two mathematicians.

It is common for people to accidentally stay in bed longer than they should, especially if they are tired or not paying attention to the time. In comparison, the \\"airport\\" option is a location and not an object for relaxation. Based on these steps, the most appropriate answer is \\"bed\\" as it is an object meant for relaxation, which aligns with the context where Danny stayed too long."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Title: As long as it rhymes....

If so,that's a good thing.There are many benefits to reading.Getting into a good novel improves our literacy .But who or what encourages us to pick up a book and start reading? Of course,when we are young,our parents and teachers inspire us by introducing us to characters that we love--or love to hate.And there are the authors--the people who invent and write about these characters.Good writing can really catch our imagination. One modern-day children's author is J.K.Rowling,who's known for her books about the wizard,Harry Potter.Last year she was named as a'literacy hero'for her part in improving people's love of reading.The UK's National Literacy Trust awarded her the title for\\"turning a generation of children into readers.\\" The Trust also honoured schoolchildren,a librarian and teachers for their effort in trying to get people to read.The actor, Henry Winkler, who has dyslexia ,was also named for the books he has written about a boy with learning difficulties. Reading books is more than an enjoyable pastime;it can also help people in difficult circumstances.The author Pat Winslow worked as a writer in prisons and found reading and discussing stories helped prisoners reflect on their patterns of behaviour.She says\\"Very often we would have discussions about the moral compass of a character, what was the motivation of somebody, why did they behave that way?\\" Today I like to read factual books such as biographies,where you get an insight into the lives of important and well-known people.I also enjoy looking at travel books and learning about journeys and new destinations.It's a good substitute if you can't visit in person. But the main benefit of reading is the improvement it brings to our literacy.The more we do it,the better we get and who knows--one day you may become the next Tolstoy,Jackie Collins or even William Shakespeare.

Answer: The traditional desktop environment for running desktop applications is accessed via a tile on the Start screen. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"Answer: To open the traditional desktop environment on various computer systems, you first need to understand how each operating system handles this environment. While the method may differ depending on the operating system, the general idea is the same: accessing a user interface that allows for running and managing desktop applications. Below, we will discuss how to open the traditional desktop environment on some major platforms, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux-based systems. 1. Windows: In the case of Windows, the desktop environment is often prominently displayed to users. When you boot up your computer and log in to your user account, you are usually presented with the desktop environment by default. - For Windows 7 and earlier versions: After logging in, you will be directly shown the traditional desktop environment. It consists of a taskbar at the bottom, which includes the Start button, application shortcuts, system-tray icons, and a clock. - For Windows 8 and 8.1: Opening the traditional desktop environment might be a bit less intuitive, as these operating systems introduced the \\"Start Screen\\" with large, touch-friendly tiles. To access the desktop environment, click or tap on the \\"Desktop\\" tile from the Start screen. - For Windows 10: Microsoft reintroduced the Start menu as a combination of traditional desktop elements and the modern tiles from Windows 8. When you log in, you are automatically presented with the desktop environment, and the taskbar contains the Start button, application shortcuts, system tray icons, and a clock. 2. macOS: In macOS, the \\"Desktop\\" and the \\"Desktop Environment\\" are considered synonymous. Once your Mac has finished booting up and you have logged in, you are immediately presented with your desktop environment. The desktop environment typically includes the Menu bar at the top, the Dock at the bottom or the side containing application and folder icons, and the desktop wallpaper with any user-created files and folders saved on the desktop. If your system is set up to display multiple virtual desktops (using macOS's Spaces feature), you can switch between them using the Mission Control interface or by swiping left or right with multiple fingers on your trackpad or mouse. 3. Linux: The traditional desktop environment in Linux-based systems heavily depends on which \\"Desktop Environment\\" (such as GNOME, KDE, XFCE, etc.) and distribution (like Ubuntu, Fedora, OpenSUSE, etc.) you are using. However, accessing the main desktop environment is generally straightforward after logging in to your user account. For example, if you are using Ubuntu with the GNOME desktop environment, you will be presented with the desktop environment, including the default wallpaper, a top panel with application menus, status icons, and a clock. To access applications, you can click on the \\"Activities\\" button in the top-left corner or search for them using the search feature. In conclusion, the process of opening the traditional desktop environment differs slightly between various operating systems. Still, the core idea remains the same: presenting users with an interface for managing and launching desktop applications seamlessly."},{"instruction":"Create a set of triples that describes the content in the following sentence.

Question 2: How much alcohol does it take to show up on an etg urine test? Possible answers: A). no B). yes Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Question 1: For how long can alcohol be detected in a urine EtG test? Answer: The Ethyl Glucuronide (EtG) test is a type of urine test that detects the presence of alcohol metabolites in the body. EtG is a direct metabolite of alcohol, produced when ethanol is metabolized in the liver. The detection period for alcohol in an EtG urine test can vary depending on several factors such as the individual's metabolism, the amount of alcohol consumed, and the sensitivity of the test itself. In general, EtG can be detected in urine for up to 24-72 hours after the consumption of alcohol. However, in some cases with heavy alcohol consumption or high sensitivity testing, EtG may be detectable up to 80 hours or even longer. It is important to note that this test does not measure the amount of alcohol currently in a person's system, but rather the presence of alcohol metabolites that indicate alcohol consumption at some point in the past. Question 2: How much alcohol does it take to show up on an EtG urine test? Answer: The amount of alcohol required to be detected in an EtG urine test depends on several factors, including the test's sensitivity, individual variations in metabolism, and the time elapsed since the last drink. Generally, low levels of alcohol consumption, such as one or two standard drinks, might not always result in a positive EtG test, particularly if a considerable amount of time has passed since consumption or if the test's sensitivity is not high. However, higher levels of alcohol consumption, such as three or more standard drinks, are more likely to be detectable, especially if the test is administered within the detection window (up to 24-72 hours or longer in some cases). Regarding the possible answers of A) No and B) Yes, the answer to the two questions would not be the same because both questions require detailed and specific answers rather than a simple yes or no."},{"instruction":"where was the statue of zeus at olympia located??","output":"To find the location of the Statue of Zeus at Olympia, I will do the following steps: Step 1: Understand the context of the query.

Keep in the refrigerator.\\" Article:","output":"Title: How to Store Cilantro and Keep it Fresh Hey there, little friend! Today, I'm going to teach you how to store cilantro and keep it fresh. Cilantro is a green, leafy herb that many people use to add flavor to their food. It's important to store it the right way, so it stays fresh and yummy for as long as possible. Here's how to do it step by step, just like magic! Step 1: Rinse the Cilantro First, we need to make sure our cilantro is clean. We can do this by rinsing it under cold water. Hold the cilantro bunch under running water, and gently rub the leaves to get all the dirt off. Just like washing our hands! Step 2: Dry the Cilantro Next, we need to dry the cilantro because too much water will make it go bad quickly. Place the wet cilantro on a clean kitchen towel or a paper towel. Pat it dry gently, like a tender hug, to remove the extra water. You can also use a salad spinner if you have one. Spin it around like a fun ride at the park! Step 3: Prepare the Cilantro for Storage Now our cilantro is all dry and ready to be stored! To keep cilantro fresh, we need to treat it like a beautiful bouquet of flowers. Take a small piece of paper towel and make it slightly wet (but not soaked!). Now, wrap the cilantro stems with the damp paper towel. This will be like a tiny blanket to keep the cilantro cozy and happy. Step 4: Place the Cilantro in the Refrigerator The last step is to store the cilantro in the refrigerator. Find a plastic zip-top bag, like the ones we use for our snacks. Carefully place the cilantro inside the bag with the damp paper towel. Close the bag, but make sure not to squash the cilantro! You want the bag to be a little open, so the cilantro can breathe. Finally, put the cilantro bag in the refrigerator's crisper drawer or on a shelf. This will keep the cilantro cool and fresh, just like your fruits and vegetables! Remember to check on your cilantro every few days to make sure it's still fresh. If the paper towel becomes too dry, you can sprinkle a little more water on it. If you see any bad leaves, remove them right away. You can store cilantro like this for up to two weeks. That's it! Now you know the magical steps to store cilantro and keep it fresh. Next time your parents buy cilantro, you can show them how to store it properly. Happy cooking and enjoy your yummy cilantro!"},{"instruction":"Teacher:In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper. Your task is to classify whether the given title is suitable or not for the research paper based on the given paragraph. Return \\"True\\" if title is proper according to paragraph else \\"False\\". Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Paragraph: Ubiquitin (Ub) and the ubiquitin-like modifier interferon stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) participate in the host defense of viral infections. Viruses, including the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome human coronavirus (SARS hCoV), have co-opted Ub/ISG15-conjugation pathways for their own advantage or have evolved effector proteins to counter pro-inflammatory properties of Ub/ISG15conjugated host proteins. Here, we compare substrate specificities of the papain-like protease (PLpro) from the recently emerged Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) hCoV to the related protease from SARS, SARS PLpro. Through biochemical assays, we show that similar to SARS PLpro, MERS PLpro is both a deubiquitinating and a deISGylating enzyme. Further analysis of the intrinsic deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) activity of these viral proteases revealed unique differences between the recognition and cleavage specificities of polyUb chains. First, MERS PLpro shows broad linkage specificity for the cleavage of polyUb chains, while SARS PLpro prefers to cleave Lys48-linked polyUb chains. Second, MERS PLpro cleaves polyUb chains in a \\"mono-distributive\\" manner (one Ub at a time), and SARS PLpro prefers to cleave K48-linked poly-Ub chains by sensing a di-Ub moiety as a minimal recognition element using a \\"di-distributive\\" cleavage mechanism. The di-distributive cleavage mechanism for SARS PLpro appears to be uncommon among USP-family DUBs, as related USP family members from humans do not display such a mechanism. We propose that these intrinsic enzymatic differences between SARS and MERS PLpro will help identify pro-inflammatory substrates of these viral DUBs and can guide in the design of therapeutics to combat infection by coronaviruses. Title: SARS hCoV papain-like protease is a unique Lys48 linkage- specific di-distributive deubiquitinating enzyme HHS Public Access Student:","output":"First, let's break down the task and understand what it is asking for: Task: Classify whether the given title is suitable or not for the research paper based on the given paragraph. - Return \\"True\\" if the title is proper according to the paragraph. - Return \\"False\\" if the title is not proper according to the paragraph. Now let's analyze the paragraph and the given title: Paragraph: The paragraph talks about the substrate specificities of papain-like protease (PLpro) from Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) human coronavirus and its comparison with the protease from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). It discusses the differences between SARS PLpro and MERS PLpro in terms of their linkage specificity and cleavage mechanisms. Given Title: SARS hCoV papain-like protease is a unique Lys48 linkage- specific di-distributive deubiquitinating enzyme HHS Public Access. Now let's see if the title aligns with the content in the paragraph: The title is focused on the SARS hCoV papain-like protease and how it is a unique Lys48 linkage-specific di-distributive deubiquitinating enzyme. While the paragraph does discuss the uniqueness of SARS PLpro, it is more focused on the comparison between SARS PLpro and MERS PLpro. Based on the comparison, the given title seems to be too specific and only focuses on one aspect of the paragraph rather than the entire comparison. Conclusion: Given the information in the paragraph and the focus of the title, I would say the title is not suitable for the content of the paragraph.

Their roles are to collect imagery intelligence, signals intelligence, and measurement and signature intelligence. - A biplane is a fixed-wing aircraft with two main wings stacked one above the other. The first powered, controlled aeroplane to fly, the Wright Flyer, used a biplane wing arrangement, as did many aircraft in the early years of aviation. While a biplane wing structure has a structural advantage over a monoplane, it produces more drag than a similar unbraced or cantilever monoplane wing. Improved structural techniques, better materials and the quest for greater speed made the biplane configuration obsolete for most purposes by the late 1930s. - Trench warfare is a type of land warfare using occupied fighting lines consisting largely of trenches, in which troops are significantly protected from the enemy's small arms fire and are substantially sheltered from artillery. The most famous use of trench warfare is the Western Front in World War I. It has become a byword for stalemate, attrition, sieges and futility in conflict. - In general, a civilian is \\"a person who is not a member of the military or of a police or firefighting force\\", as defined by Merriam Webster's Dictionary. From the perspective of the U.S. Department of Defense, Chapter 18 of Title 10 United States Code refers to non-military law enforcement officers as civilians since they are employees rather than enlisted personnel, and also in order to distinguish itself from military police. In military and law enforcement slang, the term \\"Civies\\" or \\"Civvies\\" are often used to refer civilian population or civilian clothing. - A military aircraft is any fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft that is operated by a legal or insurrectionary armed service of any type. Military aircraft can be either combat or non-combat: - Aviation is the practical aspect or art of aeronautics, being the design, development, production, operation and use of aircraft, especially heavier than air aircraft. The word \\"aviation\\" was coined by French writer and former naval officer Gabriel La Landelle in 1863, from the verb \\"avier\\" (synonymous flying), itself derived from the Latin word \\"avis\\" (\\"bird\\") and the suffix \\"-ation\\". - The AEG C.V was a prototype two - seat biplane reconnaissance aircraft of World War I. Designed to utilise a more powerful engine than previous AEG C - class reconnaissance aircraft , results were disappointing enough that further development was cancelled . - Signals intelligence (SIGINT) is intelligence-gathering by interception of signals, whether communications between people (communications intelligenceabbreviated to COMINT) or from electronic signals not directly used in communication (electronic intelligenceabbreviated to ELINT). Signals intelligence is a subset of intelligence collection management. - A fixed-wing aircraft is an aircraft, such as an aeroplane, which is capable of flight using wings that generate lift caused by the vehicle's forward airspeed and the shape of the wings. Fixed-wing aircraft are distinct from rotary-wing aircraft, in which the wings form a rotor mounted on a spinning shaft, and ornithopters, in which the wings flap in similar manner to a bird. - Aerial reconnaissance is reconnaissance for a military or strategic purpose that is conducted using reconnaissance aircraft. This role can fulfil a variety of requirements, including the collection of imagery intelligence, observation of enemy maneuvers and artillery spotting. - Measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT) is a technical branch of intelligence gathering, which serves to detect, track, identify or describe the signatures (distinctive characteristics) of fixed or dynamic target sources. This often includes radar intelligence, acoustic intelligence, nuclear intelligence, and chemical and biological intelligence. MASINT is defined as scientific and technical intelligence derived from the analysis of data obtained from sensing instruments for the purpose of identifying any distinctive features associated with the source, emitter or sender, to facilitate the latters measurement and identification. - Military personnel are members of the armed forces. Usually, personnel are divided into military branches roughly defined by certain circumstances of their deployment. Those who serve in a typical large land force are soldiers, making up an army. Those who serve in seagoing forces are seamen or sailors, and their branch is a navy or coast guard . Marines serve in a marine corps. In the 20th century, the development of powered flight aircraft prompted the development of air forces, serviced by airmen. Designated leaders of military personnel are officers. These include commissioned officers, warrant officers and non-commissioned officers (NCOs). For naval forces, non-commissioned officers are referred to as petty officers (POs). military personnel are instructed to wear dog tags - Imagery intelligence (IMINT) is an intelligence gathering discipline which collects information via satellite and aerial photography. As a means of collecting intelligence, IMINT is a subset of intelligence collection management, which, in turn, is a subset of intelligence cycle management. IMINT is especially complemented by non-imaging MASINT electro-optical and radar sensors. - The Wright Flyer (often retrospectively referred to as Flyer I or 1903 Flyer) was the first successful heavier-than-air powered aircraft. It was designed and built by the Wright brothers. They flew it four times on December 17, 1903, near Kill Devil Hills, about four miles south of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, US. Today, the airplane is exhibited in the National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C. - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.

Movie title: Priest Movie plot: Father Greg Pilkington, newly assigned to St. Mary's parish in inner-city Liverpool, is startled to discover Father Matthew Thomas is engaged in a sexual relationship with rectory housekeeper Maria Kerrigan. Moreover, Father Thomas is a left-wing radical and an outspoken proponent of Liberation Theology, leading him to constant clashes and bickering with the Bishopâwho nevertheless appreciates his abilities. While the young protagonist's personal traditional conservatism and religious beliefs are offended by the older priest's blatant disregard for his vow of celibacy, he struggles with his own homosexual urges, especially after he meets Graham at a local gay hangout and the two embark on a physical relationship. Meanwhile, student Lisa Unsworth has confided she was sexually abused by her father, who confirms her story. Both have revealed their secret in the confessional, however, so Father Greg is required to honour the sanctity of the Sacrament of Penance and not reveal what he has been told. He tries to warn her mother to keep a close watch on her, but the naive woman believes her daughter is safe while in the care of her husband. When Mrs. Unsworth discovers her husband molesting Lisa and realises the priest knew what was happening, she lashes out at him. Adding to his torment is his arrest for having sex with Graham in a parked car. When he pleads guilty to the charge, the story is headlined on the front page of the local newspaper and, unable to face his parishioners, Father Greg relocates to a remote rural parish headed by a disapproving and unforgiving priest. Father Matthew convinces him to return to St. Mary's, and the two preside over a Mass that is disrupted by the loud protests of those opposed to Father Greg's presence on the altar. Father Matthew demands they leave the chapel.

Under the deal signed after talks in Tunis, a cabinet of independent figures will be in power until fresh elections. Last month Ennahda agreed in principle to relinquish power, in an effort to end Tunisia's political deadlock. The crisis was triggered by the assassinations of two opposition leaders earlier this year. It has threatened to disrupt a democratic transition that began after Tunisians threw out their decades-old authoritarian government at the beginning of the 2011 uprisings, widely referred to as the Arab Spring. Talks between Ennahda and the National Salvation Front-led opposition are being mediated by the UGTT labour union. Under the agreement signed on Saturday, the two sides are to hold further negotiations on the formation of the new technocratic cabinet within three or four weeks. The caretaker government is to supervise new elections. Correspondents say the agreement represents a setback for the moderate Islamist Ennahda Party, which has run the country since winning elections in October 2011. The opposition has accused Ennahda of pushing an Islamist agenda on a traditionally secular nation. The rivalry intensified after the murders of prominent left-wing figure Chokri Belaid in February and opposition politician Mohammed Brahmi in July. Ennahda condemned the killings but the opposition accused it of failing to rein in radical Islamists.","output":"Tunisia's Ennahda Party has agreed to relinquish power to a cabinet of independent figures, allowing for fresh elections and resolving the political deadlock triggered by the assassinations of two opposition leaders earlier this year."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: What is the name of the General who is eager to buy the T-Virus? grand Answer:","output":"Title: \\"Pandora's Strain\\" Plot: In the year 2047, civilization has reached a breaking point after decades of extreme climate change, economic collapse, and political upheaval. Amid the chaos, a secret society known as the \\"Order of the Phoenix\\" rises to power, seeking to restore order and seize control over the remaining resources. The story follows a young and ambitious journalist, Alice, who uncovers an elaborate conspiracy to unleash a deadly virus called the \\"T-Virus\\" in an attempt to cull the world's broken population. She discovers that the mastermind behind this plan is General Winston Vandor, a once-distinguished military hero, who has succumbed to the corrupting influence of power and wealth. General Vandor, the cunning and ruthless leader of the Order of the Phoenix, believes that global extinction is imminent, and that drastic measures must be taken in order to ensure humanity's survival. Eager to buy the T-Virus from a rogue scientist, Dr. Atticus Miles, Vandor aspires to craft a new world order from the ashes of the old, one that he envisions being built atop a pyramid of corpses. As Alice delves deeper into the conspiracy, she forms an uneasy alliance with a small group of rebels who share her determination to expose and thwart General Vandor's horrific plan. Among them is Leo, a former member of Vandor's inner circle, who has grown disillusioned with his mentor's lust for power and is now seeking redemption. Alice and Leo's investigation leads them to an isolated research facility, concealed deep within the heart of a treacherous and unnavigable forest. It is here that they uncover the truth behind the T-Virus: a highly contagious and lethal pathogen, capable of reshaping human DNA and transforming those infected into monstrous, zombie-like creatures. Their discovery comes too late, however, as General Vandor manages to acquire the T-Virus and put his scheme into motion. As cities rapidly succumb to the epidemic, the world descends into apocalyptic madness. But amidst the darkness, Alice and Leo encounter a potential hope: an immune survivor named Chloe, who may possess the key to creating a cure for the T-Virus. Together, Alice, Leo, Chloe, and their fellow rebels engage in a desperate race against time and overwhelming odds to expose General Vandor's crimes, halt the spread of the T-Virus, and save what remains of humanity from the brink of extinction. Along their perilous journey, they must confront not only the horrors of the pandemic but also the darker side of human nature that birthed it. In the final showdown, Alice and Leo confront General Vandor at the heart of his fortress, where they engage in a battle of wits and wills. Defiant to the end, General Vandor refuses to accept defeat, even as his empire crumbles around him. Ultimately, Alice exposes Vandor's megalomania to the world, shattering his dreams of global domination. \\"Pandora's Strain\\" is a riveting and thought-provoking journey that combines elements of action, science fiction, and suspense.

Some 728 people have died of Ebola in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone this year, in the worst-ever outbreak of the disease. Public Health England says the risk to the UK remains very low. The Ebola virus spreads through human contact with a sufferer's bodily fluids. Initial flu-like symptoms can lead to external haemorrhaging from areas like eyes and gums, and internal bleeding which can lead to organ failure. The current mortality rate is about 55%. The woman, believed to be in her early 70s, had been a passenger on a Gambia Bird flight that arrived at Gatwick on Saturday morning. She collapsed at the airport and was later pronounced dead in hospital. A Department of Health spokeswoman said the passenger's symptoms had not suggested she was an Ebola victim but the test was carried out because she had travelled from West Africa. Dr Brian McCloskey, director of global public health at Public Health England (PHE), said: \\"There was no health risk to other passengers or crew, as the passenger did not have symptoms during the flight. \\"It was considered very unlikely to be a case of Ebola but testing was done as a precaution, and was negative. \\"The correct procedures were followed to confirm there was no reason to quarantine the airplane, the passengers or staff. PHE can confirm there was no public health risk around the sad death of this individual.\\" A Gatwick spokeswoman said the aircraft, as well as some airline and airport staff, were isolated \\"as a precaution\\" but that the plane was later cleared for its return journey. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has said the government is taking the outbreak, and the threat to the UK, \\"very seriously\\". Ministers have discussed what precautionary measures could be taken if any UK nationals in West Africa become infected with Ebola. Public Health England has advised UK medical staff to watch out for unexplained illnesses in patients who have visited West Africa. It said no cases of imported Ebola have ever been reported in the UK. The US is to send at least 50 public health experts to the region to help fight the disease. They are expected to arrive in the next month. Meanwhile, American Ebola patient Dr Kent Brantly is improving in hospital after returning to the US from Liberia.

In remarks prepared for delivery to the Security Council after returning from a fact-finding trip to the region, U.N. Assistant Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Atul Khare cited 267 rapes or other sexual attacks in the town of Uvira -- on the eastern edge of the country -- and other nearby regions of North and South Kivu, in addition to the 242 rapes that had already been reported in and near the village of Luvungi. Among the additional cases was a report of 10 women raped by members of the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo on August 17 and 18 in the community of Katalukulu, in Fizi territory, South Kivu, he said. On August 17, at least 40 rapes were committed in the village of Mubi by an alleged coalition of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda and Mayi-Mayi, a militia group active in the region, he said. Another 13 rapes occurred in Pinga area in Chuho market, he said. On August 26, Khare received reports of 74 cases of sexual violence -- including 21 directed at girls 7 to 15 years of age -- and six men in the village of Miki in the territory of Mwenga, he said. The incidents occurred in July and August, he said. Five days later, he said, 130 cases of rape were recorded in several villages in the territory of Shabunda. There were reports that in one village, \\"all women might have been systematically raped,\\" he said. Khare had gone to Congo to find out why peacekeepers said they hadn't learned about the rapes near Luvungi sooner. The United Nations reported last week that some 242 people were raped by armed Congolese and Rwandan rebels in villages in North Kivu province between July 30 and August 3. Attackers blocked roads and prevented villagers from reaching outside communications. Many homes were also looted and burned. Many of the victims were gang-raped by as many as six men at a time, according to the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The rapes were first publicly reported on August 22. The United Nations initially said it did not learn about the attacks until August 12, when it was alerted by International Medical Corps. That group said it first told the United Nations about the rapes on August 6. But on Tuesday, the United Nations acknowledged that it first learned of a report of rape on July 30, nearly two weeks earlier than it had previously said. \\"We can confirm that the Daily Field Security Report from North Kivu on 30 July included the following: 'Today 30 July 2010 during morning hours, the locality of Mpofi (52 Km E of Walikale) passed under control of FDLR [Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda] combatants. One woman was reportedly raped and locals fled towards Walikale and Kibua. More information to be ascertained.' \\"We can also confirm that, on the basis of this information, an e-mail was sent by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs transmitting information of the FDLR movement,\\" it said. The July 30 internal U.N. email was relayed to relief agencies working in the area and warned that the rebels had taken over the villages, and had already committed one instance of rape. U.N. officials have said they will toughen efforts to stop rapes in the region. \\"The women of eastern DRC deserve better,\\" said Margot Wallstrom, a U.N. special representative for sexual violence in conflict who sent a senior member of her staff with Khare on his fact-finding mission to the region. \\"For them, there is no safe place. They are raped when harvesting crops; when going to market; when fetching water and firewood; when carrying their babies; when in their homes at night, among their loved ones.\\" She added that the rape is becoming a weapon of choice in eastern DRC. \\"The sad reality is that incidents of rape have become so commonplace that they do not trigger our most urgent interventions,\\" she said. Noting that the information about the rapes \\"was slow to surface,\\" she called for the United Nations to focus on how to improve its response to such reports. \\"We should examine the U.N.'s response, including that of our peacekeepers on the ground, not in a spirit of self-recrimination but with a determination and resolve to do better to protect civilians in what is undoubtedly one of the most complex, vast and volatile conflict zones in the world.\\" She noted that some rebel leaders have been identified as having been present during the attacks and called for them to be used \\"as a starting point\\" to bring the attackers to justice. \\"Our policies of 'zero tolerance' cannot be backed by a reality of 'zero consequences,'\\" she said. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"In a place called eastern Congo, there have been many bad things happening to women and girls.

They are trying to find out why this has happened and how to protect these women and girls better. Even though there are peacekeepers in Congo to help keep people safe, they didn't know about these attacks right away. They want to make sure they can respond faster and better to keep everyone safe.

Massive respect. We should all learn from them pic.twitter.com/Vt87CaNav3 ||||| Image copyright Reuters After a heated World Cup match, the stands are usually left with food waste, cups and wrappers scattered in the heat of the moment. Japanese fans certainly had reason to go wild on Tuesday night. Their side won their opening game, beating Colombia 2-1, and securing the team's first victory against a South American side. But after the team swept Colombia off the pitch, Japanese fans also did their share of sweeping: meticulously cleaning up their rows and seats in the stadium. Equipped with large rubbish bags they brought along, the fans marched through the rows picking up rubbish, to leave the place just as neat as they had found it. And not for the first time - supporters of the \\"Samurai Blue\\" have never failed to stick to their good manners. \\"It's not just part of the football culture but part of Japanese culture,\\" Japan-based football journalist Scott McIntyre told the BBC. He is in Russia following the team and was not at all surprised by the somewhat different nature of Samurai Blue fans. \\"You often hear people say that football is a reflection of culture. An important aspect of Japanese society is making sure that everything is absolutely clean and that's the case in all sporting events and certainly also in football.\\" More on the World Cup from the BBC: A habit built from childhood Senegal fans have in fact been seen doing the same at this year's World Cup - but it's the Japanese who pioneered it and are now famous for it. It is something that comes as a surprise to many foreigners attending matches in Japan. \\"They might leave a bottle or some kind of food package on the ground and then it's often the case that people get tapped on the shoulder by Japanese people indicating they should clean up or take it home but can't leave it there,\\" Mr McIntyre says. Image copyright AFP Image caption Japan fans certainly know how to celebrate It's a habit drilled into Japanese people from early childhood. \\"Cleaning up after football matches is an extension of basic behaviours that are taught in school, where the children clean their school classrooms and hallways,\\" explains Scott North, professor of sociology at Osaka University. \\"With constant reminders throughout childhood, these behaviours become habits for much of the population.\\" What do fans make of the fact their post-match cleaning spree becomes a regular hit on social media? If anything, they're proud. \\"In addition to their heightened consciousness of the need to be clean and to recycle, cleaning up at events like the World Cup is a way Japanese fans demonstrate pride in their way of life and share it with the rest of us,\\" explains Prof North. \\"What better place to make a statement about the need to care responsibly for the planet than the World Cup?\\" he adds. It doesn't mean that there is any more or less passion, insists Mr McIntyre.

Many Japanese fans were waving bright blue garbage bags at the group stage finale against Colombia. The Japanese have touched spectators around the world by cleaning up their trash after every match at the World Cup. After their 0-0 draw against Greece last week, fans of the Blue Samurai shrugged off disappointment and cleaned up after themselves inside the stadium following the final whistle. It's a class act that has its roots in Japan's values of being respectful of hosts and protecting the environment. Japan's 1-4 loss to Colombia on Tuesday eliminated the team from the World Cup.

But while the site is clearly meant to illustrate that McDonalds workers should be able to live on their meager wages, it actually underscores exactly how hard it is for a low-paid fast food worker to get by. The site includes a sample “budget journal” for McDonalds’ employees that offers a laughably inaccurate view of what it’s like to budget on a minimum wage job. Not only does the budget leave a spot open for “second job,” it also gives wholly unreasonable estimates for employees’ costs: 20 a month for health care, 0 for heating, and 600 a month for rent. It does not include any budgeted money for food or clothing. Basically every facet of this budget is unachievable. For an uninsured person to independently buy health care, he or she must shell out on average 215 a month — just for an individual plan. While some full-time McDonald’s workers do qualify for the company’s 14 a week health plan, that offer caps coverage at 10,000 a year and is often insufficient. If that person wants to eat, “moderate” spending will run them 32 a week for themselves, and 867 a month to feed a family of four. And if a fast food worker is living in a city? Well, New York City rents just reached an average of 3,000 a month. The sample budget is also available in Spanish. On another section of the site, it concludes, “You can have almost anything you want as long as you plan ahead and save for it.” Neither McDonalds nor Visa returned requests for comment by the time of publication. Last year, Bloomberg News found that it would take the average McDonalds employee one million hours of work to earn as much money as the company’s CEO. This immense wage disparity in the fast food industry has sparked a series of protests and walk-outs by low-wage workers working at fast food chains around the country — in New York, Chicago, Washington, and Seattle, to name a few cities, workers from chains including KFC, McDonalds, Burger King, and Taco Bell have spoken publicly about the need for serious wage increases across the industry. (HT: Low Pay Is Not Okay) ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| Someone meant really well. We think. A few years ago, Visa and McDonald’s partnered to launch a personal finance site for McDonald’s employees to help them better manage their money. Unfortunately, whoever wrote these materials had no grasp of what it’s actually like to live on 8 or so per hour. “Helping you succeed financially is one of the many ways McDonald’s is creating a satisfying and rewarding work environment,” the site’s About page explains. The path to financial freedom, according to Visa and McDonald’s, involves turning off your heat, not buying groceries, not having children, never getting sick, and getting a second job. All of which are sound money-saving strategies, it’s true, but it’s not all that realistic to expect people to combine them. You can download their handy budget workbook yourself. First, in the “income” column, you, the Hypothetical McDonald’s Employee, have two jobs. One job pays 1,105 per month, and the other pays 955 per month. This amount is what someone would earn working roughly 60 hours a week at 8.50 an hour. If you earn less per hour than that or this is after taxes, then you’re either working more hours or have a higher hourly wage. The budget doesn’t specify whether this is gross income or after taxes: even for someone in a low enough tax bracket that they pay no federal or state income taxes, Social Security and Medicare still takes 6.2% out of every check. Anyway, Visa and McDonald’s produced a handy workbook for employees to learn how to budget their money, spend sensibly, and save for the future and for emergencies. UPDATE: McDonald’s and Visa have apparently listened to [some of] the Internet’s criticisms, and changed the budget to include heat. They sneakily replaced the PDF workbook on the server with the new version, but we downloaded the original and have had it on the server for you all this time. The version on their site now allows 50, so that’s nice of them. Here’s the revised budget: Savings: 100 No quibble with this. Everyone should be putting some money in a savings account (or shoebox, whatever, but a savings account is a better idea.) Mortgage/Rent: 600 This is a realistic figure in most of the country if you share a home with family or roommates, but not so much if you live by yourself or don’t yet have good enough credit to get a fixed-rate mortgage on a modest condo. Car Payment: 150 Not a bad figure, but that’s probably an older car, so hope you have money put away for repairs. Car/Home Insurance: 100 That sounds pretty reasonable, though again, a person working to rebuild their credit might not get a great rate on carinsurance. Hey, wait a second, there isn’t any more mention of a car on this budget. How are you supposed to repair and maintain this vehicle? Even changing your own oil and having a friend do major repairs in their front lawn costs money for parts. That might not be a problem, though, because there’s also no budget line for gasoline. Guess you’ll be making a car payment while you walk to work. Health Insurance: 20 I don’t know what planet has health insurance plans that cost 20/month, but can I move there? Even a lot of civil service and union workers pay more than that now. Plus, insurance is nice and all, but there are these things called “co-payments” that also cost money. The cheaper your health insurance is, the higher those payments will be. Also, I miss those heady days when I was so young and healthy that I never had to buy cold medicine, bandages, painkillers, or cough syrup. Which was never. Heating: 0 This is the case for a large portion of the year, and people in some parts of the country never turn on their heat. The rest of the time, maybe you’ll have to bring leftover hamburger buns home and burn them for warmth. Cable/Phone: 100 No, heat, no groceries, but a phone and basic cable. Or a smartphone with a large data plan. Or cable, home Internet access, and no mobile phone. Hmm. Electric: 90 Maybe in the spring and fall, but good luck with that when you start running air conditioners and baseboard heat. Other: 100 Is this where the gas goes? Spending Money: 800 Okay! Straight into savings with you, then! Except, wait…this is a terrible budget. Besides leaving out gas, heat, car maintenance, and remotely realistic medical expenses, it leaves out clothes, entertainment, furniture, various kinds of personal hygiene, furniture, charitable and religious giving, cleaning supplies, and groceries. GROCERIES. It also completely ignores that you might have children, which is convenient, because it’s hard to fit child care for those 60 hours a week that you’re working into this budget. Assuming that you can even get that many hours from your job: maybe it’s time to start looking for a third one. Like we said, whoever produced this workbook probably meant well. It has helpful and slightly condescending money-saving tips, like: When possible, use public transportation or carpool Consider walking or riding a bike when running errands Plan meals in advance Borrow books and movies from the library Shop with a list Pay down debt as quickly as possible Try not to use an ATM outside of your bank’s system to avoid extra service charges We would probably just roll our eyes and move on, if it weren’t for this tiny thing on the McDonald’s Practical Money Skills page. The first page on the navigation bar of this site produced by McDonald’s and Visa extolls the benefits of prepaid debit cards. Where have I heard about those recently? Why should you consider getting your paycheck on a PaychekPLUS! Elite® Visa® Payroll Card? There are ways to access your money that don’t even involve any fees, you can use it to pay bills, and there’s no waiting. You don’t have to cash or deposit a check, and you don’t need to have a bank account. You can just use the card right away to pay for things. Just don’t gas up your car or go to the grocery store.

In both sentences, \\"touch\\" refers to a sensory experience, but the context and specific meaning differ. 1. The cooling touch of the night air. In this sentence, \\"touch\\" refers to a physical sensation or feeling. Here, \\"touch\\" is used to describe the way the night air feels against one's skin. It emphasizes the tactile experience of the night air as it gently brushes against the person, evoking a sense of temperature and texture that is soothing and refreshing.

Watts served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1995 to 2003 as a Republican, representing Oklahoma's 4th Congressional District. Watts was born and raised in Eufaula, Oklahoma, in a rural impoverished neighborhood. After being one of the first children to attend an integrated elementary school, he became a high school quarterback and gained a football scholarship to the University of Oklahoma. Context: Watts' 1996 reelection campaign featured state representative Ed Crocker as the Democratic candidate in a negative campaign. Crocker questioned Watts' business dealings because of tax issues for a real estate company of which Watts was the principal owner, and whether he was paying child support for one of his daughters born out of wedlock. Crocker suggested Watts might use drugs or sanction their use because he declined to participate in a voluntary drug screening in the House of Representatives. Watts denied the charge, took the test, and accused Cocker of draft dodging during the Vietnam War and later living at the \\"center of the West Coast drug culture.\\" Watts was given a featured speaking role at the 1996 Republican National Convention and was re-elected with 58 percent of the vote in the 1996 U.S. House election. Following the election, Watts switched from the Financial Services Committee to the House Transportation Committee. He was the only African-American Republican in the House and was chosen to deliver the Republican reply to President Bill Clinton's State of the Union address in February 1997, the youngest congressman and first African-American to do so. In his response, Watts focused on providing a positive vision of the Republican Party and advocated deficit and tax reduction and faith-based values. Watts had previously spoken to The Washington Times and created controversy by criticizing \\"race-hustling poverty pimps\\" as keeping African-Americans dependent on government. These remarks were viewed as critical of activist Jesse Jackson and Washington, D.C. mayor Marion Barry, and Jesse Jackson, Jr. demanded a public apology. Watts stated he did not speak about Barry and Jackson but about \\"some of the leadership in the black community.\\" In his 1998 reelection campaign against Democrat Ben Odom, Watts faced accusations about debts, unpaid taxes and over actions in a federal bribery investigation in 1991, where he arranged to receive campaign contributions from a lobbyist for telephone companies that were investigated during Watts' membership on the Oklahoma Corporation Commission. Odom used portions of a transcript to try to discredit Watts, and the accusations were widely publicized in Oklahoma. Watts argued he had been exonerated from any criminal conduct and that his financial problems were a result of losses for Oklahoma oil and gas businesses during the 1980s. He was re-elected with 62 percent of the vote. From 1995 until 1997, Watts was only one of two black Republicans in Congress (along with Gary Franks of Connecticut). From 1997 until 2003, Watts was the only black Republican Congressman. There would not be another until the elections of Tim Scott and Allen West in 2011. Question: Why did he play football instead? Answer:","output":"Julius Caesar Watts Jr. chose to play football for several reasons, which can be attributed to his natural talent, his passion for the sport, and the opportunities it offered him to excel in both his academic and professional life. 1. Natural Talent: Watts was born with exceptional athletic abilities, which became evident at a young age. As a high school quarterback, his talent and hard work got him noticed by recruiters. He realized that he could capitalize on these innate skills and leverage them for his future success. 2. Passion for the Game: Growing up, Watts developed a deep love and appreciation for the sport of football. His interest and enjoyment of the game motivated him to pursue it at a higher level. Football provided him with a sense of belonging, camaraderie, and self-discipline, which he valued and embraced. 3. Scholarship and Education: Watts received a football scholarship to the University of Oklahoma. This offered him the chance to play football at a prestigious collegiate level while simultaneously earning a quality education. This financial assistance was important, given his rural, impoverished upbringing, and it made higher education a viable option for Watts, who might not have had that opportunity otherwise. 4. Personal Drive and Ambition: Watts' determination to excel in football came from a drive to overcome challenges and prove himself to both his peers and community. His perseverance and dedication helped him become a successful college football quarterback, which later opened doors to a professional career in the Canadian Football League. This propensity to exceed expectations and push boundaries eventually translated to his political career as well. 5. Opportunity for Career Growth and Advancement: Watts' success in football offered him a clearer path to a professional career in the sport and other opportunities, such as sports broadcasting, coaching, or managing. These achievements also provided him with a platform from which he could launch his political career. His status as a well-known sports figure in Oklahoma allowed him to build a solid base of support within his state, which later contributed to his electoral victories. In summary, Julius Caesar Watts Jr. chose to play football because it allowed him to capitalize on his natural talent and passion for the game, secure an education, overcome life's obstacles, and build a successful career that ultimately opened doors for him in politics."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: The film can be seen as an allegory of post-World War II Eastern European political systems - told as a black-and-white cinematic poem with 39 long, single-camera takes.

As the royal court receives word that the Almoravids of Zaragoza had crossed the Castilian border, Rodrigo gets the opportunity to accompany Sancho, OrdoÃ±es and Gormaz on a scouting mission. Once they set up camp, Gormaz is ambushed by Al-Mu'tamin and his warriors, but Rodrigo intervenes. Once Al-Mu'tamin gets the chance to speak, he is allowed by Sancho to accompany them back to the palace. Some time later, king Ferdinand dies, and the devious and power-hungry princess Urraca plots to have Sancho killed so that the weak-minded prince Alfonso can be crowned. Gormaz meets with Rodrigo on a balcony, on Jimenas request, where Rodrigo asks for her hand in marriage. Gormaz refuses, and instead challenges Rodrigo to a swordfight. Rodrigo is hesitant to fight, but when Gormaz insists, he draws his sword. As the two fight, Urraca sends out her lover and servant to assassinate Sancho by stabbing him in the back with a dagger. At the same time, Rodrigo accidentally kills Gormaz. When Jimena witnesses, she vows to never speak to Rodrigo ever again, and he is forced to flee the scene. Later, Alfonso is crowned king, but at the ceremony Rodrigo refuses to bend the knee, and makes Alfonso swear that he had nothing to do with his brother's death. Alfonso does so, but in his rage and humiliation he banishes Rodrigo without honor. Answer:","output":"Rodrigo de Vivar is better known as El Cid."},{"instruction":"What happens next?

Choices: - atom - molecule - quark - element A: A:","output":"The simplest form of matter that has a unique set of properties is an element. Elements are fundamental substances that cannot be broken down into simpler substances through ordinary chemical reactions. They are comprised of atoms, which are the smallest units of an element that retains its chemical properties. An element can be identified by its unique atomic number, which indicates the number of protons in its nucleus. Currently, 118 elements have been identified, of which 94 occur naturally and 24 are synthesized artificially in laboratories. These elements are organized in the periodic table according to their atomic number, chemical properties, and electron configurations. Atoms, on the other hand, are the building blocks of matter and are composed of subatomic particles – protons, neutrons, and electrons. While atoms are fundamental units of chemical elements, they are not the simplest form of matter with unique properties since each element has distinct attributes. Molecules are formed when two or more atoms combine chemically through covalent bonds. They can consist of the same type of atoms (e.g., O2) or different types (e.g., H2O). Although molecules can exhibit unique properties, they are not the simplest form of matter because they consist of multiple atoms, with each atom belonging to a specific element. Quarks, on the other hand, are elementary particles that are constituents of protons and neutrons, which are found in the nucleus of an atom. While quarks can be considered simpler than atoms and elements, they do not possess unique properties for each type of matter as elements do. Quarks mostly exist in combinations with other quarks, forming what is called hadrons (such as protons and neutrons), and are never found individually in nature. In conclusion, elements are the simplest form of matter that possess a unique set of properties. They serve as the building blocks for all other forms of matter like molecules and compounds, and their unique properties give rise to various chemical and physical phenomena in nature."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

There are five possible options given (a, b, c, d, and e). Our objective is to solve the problem and pick the correct option. Step 1: Understand the meaning of 12% stock. It means that the stock offers a dividend of Rs. 12 per share. Step 2: Calculate the dividend yield. The dividend yield is the dividend per share divided by the price per share. Dividend yield = (Dividend per share) / (Price per share) Dividend yield = 12 / 106 Step 3: Determine the number of shares needed to generate an income of Rs. 600. To do this, divide the income desired by the dividend per share. Number of shares = Desired income / Dividend per share Number of shares = 600 / 12 Step 4: Calculate the investment required using the number of shares and the price per share. Investment = Number of shares * Price per share Now, let's use these steps to solve the problem: Step 1: 12% stock means the stock offers a Rs. 12 dividend per share. Step 2: Calculate the dividend yield. Dividend yield = 12 / 106 = 0.1132 Step 3: Determine the number of shares needed to generate an income of Rs. 600. Number of shares = 600 / 12 = 50 shares Step 4: Calculate the investment required. Investment = Number of shares * Price per share Investment = 50 * 106 = Rs. 5300 However, this exact amount is not found in the given options. It is closest to option (a) which is Rs. 5363. So, we can assume that the exact investment amount may have been rounded up or down in the options provided. Solution: The correct option is (a) Rs. 5363."},{"instruction":"Title: Sketches.

Berlin was a Russian-born American songwriter who is widely considered one of the greatest songwriters in American history. His music career spanned over five decades, during which he contributed music to several stage shows, films, and patriotic pieces. The creation of \\"God Bless America\\" can be traced back to when Irving Berlin was serving in the U.S. Army during World War I. In 1918, he was stationed at Camp Upton in Yaphank, New York, and was working on a wartime musical revue show called \\"Yip, Yip, Yaphank.\\" During the development of this show, he wrote \\"God Bless America\\" as a fervent and patriotic ballad. However, he eventually decided to remove the song from the show, as he felt it did not fit the comedic tone of the production. Berlin stored the song away, and it remained unused for 20 years. It was not until 1938 when Irving Berlin revisited \\"God Bless America\\" and decided to revise the lyrics in response to the growing turmoil in Europe and the rise of Adolf Hitler. He sought to create a song that would convey his love and appreciation for the United States and inspire a sense of unity and patriotism among the American people. On November 10, 1938, the revised version of \\"God Bless America\\" made its public debut in a radio broadcast by popular singer Kate Smith. Her rendition of the song became an instant hit and eventually became one of the most recognizable and enduring anthems of American pride. Over the years, \\"God Bless America\\" has been performed by numerous artists and has been featured in various events, showing the timeless and universal appeal of Irving Berlin's creation."},{"instruction":"N.S. submariner recalls harrowing experiences in career spent underwater (Canadian Press) Canadian Press - HALIFAX (CP) - As Sam Jennings started to regain consciousness, he saw the dark smoke billowing through his submarine.

Article: Parents whose children think the latest Nike or Adidas shoes may be better than buying old-fashioned plimsolls because they encourage a healthier style of running, researchers said. Big companies, like Nike and Adidas, make millions of dollars from selling highly-cushioned shoes both as fashion and sports shoes. The researchers warn that wearing such shoes from an early age can make it difficult to run in a healthy way. Once we have grown used to running in this kind of shoes, it is very difficult to change our technique, even if we remove our shoes, it can raise the risk of injury. Children should be encouraged to wear shoes with thin soles such as plimsolls from a young age to help them develop a natural \\"barefoot\\" running style, experts said. Dr Mick Wilknson, who did the research, told the British Science Festival in Newcastle, \\"If I would advise someone on what to give their child, I would say don't go and buy them expensive Adidas or Nike, just get them a pair of flexible, flat shoes. Give them basic foot-ware, nothing fancy, nothing particularly cushioned.\\" Running in flat shoes, barefoot, encourages the runner to use the front of their foot which is a better technique for running, especially long distances as the human was designed to do. Around the world, and in particular in the US, running barefoot is becoming more and more popular with many long distance runners training without shoes. Dr Mick Wilknson believes that training and running barefoot or in flat running shoes can help reduce injuries to runners, he said: \\"Injury rates in running have not changed since the 1970s, despite claims of improvements in running shoes. That has led some to conclude that barefoot running is better.\\" Question: Why are people advised to wear plimsolls?

The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation has an indirect effect on the process. Step-by-step reasoning: 1. If more adults become elderly, this means that the overall life expectancy of the population is increasing. 2. With a higher life expectancy, it is likely that people are remaining healthy and able-bodied for longer periods and therefore may choose to have children later in life. 3. Delaying childbearing can contribute to a decrease in overall fertility rates, as couples may choose to have fewer children due to the later start in their family life, or they may face decreased fertility as they age. 4. Lower fertility rates and later childbearing can ultimately result in fewer babies being born.

However, very small amounts of steel, (an alloy of iron and around 1% carbon), was always a byproduct of the bloomery process. The ability to modify the hardness of steel by heat treatment had been known since 1100 BC, and the rare material was valued for the manufacture of tools and weapons. Because the ancients could not produce temperatures high enough to melt iron fully, the production of steel in decent quantities did not occur until the introduction of blister steel during the Middle Ages. This method introduced carbon by heating wrought iron in charcoal for long periods of time, but the penetration of carbon was not very deep, so the alloy was not homogeneous. In 1740, Benjamin Huntsman began melting blister steel in a crucible to even out the carbon content, creating the first process for the mass production of tool steel. Huntsman's process was used for manufacturing tool steel until the early 1900s. What is the answer to this question: Heat treatment of steel has been know since what time?","output":"Heat treatment of steel has been known since around 1100 BC. This process was used to modify the hardness of the steel, which was valued for the manufacture of tools and weapons.

The latest health ministry figures on Sunday show that the death toll from coronavirus in Brazil rose to at least 25 from 18 the day before, a rise of 39%, and the number of confirmed cases now stands at 1,546, up from 1,128. In an interview with CNN Brasil on Saturday night, Bolsonaro also expressed his frustration with several states’ measures to essentially shut down commerce and restrict people’s movement, saying they have gone too far and are damaging the economy. “I think Mandetta was exaggerating,” Bolsonaro told CNN Brasil, referring to health minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta, who said on Friday that Brazil’s fragile healthcare system will collapse under the weight of coronavirus by the end of April. Bolsonaro said “collapse” was the wrong choice of words. “What we’re doing is lengthening the infection curve. I don’t believe in a collapse,” he said. Bolsonaro tweeted on Sunday that the government is distributing around 10 million coronavirus tests, half of which have been dispatched this month. Sao Paulo state, Brazil’s richest and most populous, on Saturday said a statewide quarantine order would take effect on Tuesday and last through April 7, shutting down all but non-essential businesses and services.

A Datafolha poll in Sunday’s Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper showed that an overwhelming majority of Brazilians support many of these drastic measures to beat the spread of coronavirus, although opinion is much more divided on business shutting down. Some 82% said they agree with the suspension of church services, a decision Bolsonaro, who was elected into office with massive support from evangelical Christians due to his conservative social agenda, has heavily criticized. Evangelical churches were shut or deserted on Sunday in some of Brazil’s major cities, with many switching to broadcasting services online or via their radio and television channels. The massive doors of the Temple of Solomon, a 10,000-seat place of worship belonging to the Universal Church in Sao Paulo, were closed during what is usually one of their busiest times. Security guards patrolled outside telling visitors that services at the church were suspended for two weeks. Reuters visited five of Sao Paulo’s biggest evangelical churches - all were closed.

Choose your answer from: a). yes; b). it is not possible to tell; c). no;","output":"a). Yes, we can conclude that \\"According to Greek mythology, Andromeda was sacrificed to a sea monster.\\" In Greek mythology, Andromeda was the daughter of King Cepheus and Queen Cassiopeia of Joppa, also known as Jaffa. Cassiopeia was known for her boastful claim that she was more beautiful than the Nereids, who were sea nymphs and the daughters of the sea god Nereus. This angered the Nereids and Poseidon, the god of the sea, who decided to punish the queen and her city for her pride and arrogance. Poseidon sent a massive sea monster, known as Cetus, to ravage the coasts of Joppa, causing destruction and chaos. Desperate to save their kingdom, Cepheus and Cassiopeia sought advice from an oracle, who informed them that the only way to appease the sea god was to sacrifice their daughter, Andromeda, to the sea monster. Following the oracle's advice, they bound Andromeda to a rock by the shore just outside the harbor, effectively offering her as a sacrifice to Cetus. Fortunately, the hero Perseus happened to be passing by the area after slaying the Gorgon Medusa. He saw Andromeda chained to the rock, exposed and at the mercy of the sea monster, and heroically stepped in to rescue her. Perseus managed to slay the sea monster using the power of Medusa's severed head, which could turn living beings to stone upon eye contact. With the monster defeated, Andromeda was saved from her fate as a sacrifice, and she and Perseus went on to marry and have a family. Despite being a pawn in the conflict between her parents and the gods, Andromeda's impending sacrifice played a crucial role in the myth and demonstrated the perils of hubris in Greek mythology. So, based on the narrative of the myth, it is accurate to conclude that \\"According to Greek mythology, Andromeda was sacrificed to a sea monster.\\""},{"instruction":"If \\"A motocross biker rides mid-turn in the middle of a race.\\", can we conclude \\"A motocross racer turns his gsxr during a race.\\"?","output":"To determine if we can conclude \\"A motocross racer turns his gsxr during a race\\" from the given statement \\"A motocross biker rides mid-turn in the middle of a race\\", let's break down each statement and compare the information. Step 1: Identify the subjects and actions In the given statement, the subject is a \\"motocross biker\\", and the action is \\"rides mid-turn in the middle of a race\\". In the conclusion, the subject is a \\"motocross racer\\", and the action is \\"turns his gsxr during a race\\". Step 2: Compare the subjects The subjects are slightly different, as \\"biker\\" and \\"racer\\" may not be the same thing. However, the context in both cases is motocross, which implies the person participating in the race. Since both cases involve a person participating in a motocross race, we can consider the subjects to be similar. Step 3: Compare the actions In the given statement, the action is more specific: \\"rides mid-turn in the middle of a race\\". This means that the original statement describes a particular moment during the race where the biker is mid-turn. In the conclusion, the action is less specific: \\"turns his gsxr during a race\\". It simply states that the racer turns his bike (gsxr) during the race. Step 4: Determine if the conclusion can be drawn Since the subjects are similar and the action in the original statement is more specific than the action in the conclusion, we can infer that if a motocross biker rides mid-turn in the middle of a race, it is likely that a motocross racer turns his gsxr during a race. However, it's important to note that this conclusion is based on the assumption that \\"biker\\" and \\"racer\\" can be considered the same in this context."},{"instruction":"Explain simply why no is the correct answer to: Is the following sentence factually correct? \\"Artillery cannot possibly be dangerous to the user.\\" Options: - yes - no. Explanation:","output":"- no. Explanation: The statement \\"Artillery cannot possibly be dangerous to the user\\" is not factually correct because operating artillery does come with a number of risks and hazards to the user. Artillery, such as cannons, mortars, and rocket launchers, are powerful weapons designed to launch projectiles over long distances. They can cause tremendous damage and have the potential to be dangerous or life-threatening to the user if not handled correctly. Here are a few reasons why artillery can be dangerous to the user: 1. Accidents and human error: Misfires, premature detonations, or incorrectly loaded ammunition can lead to injuries or even fatalities among the crew members. 2. Recoil and blast effects: The recoil force generated when firing an artillery piece can cause injury if not properly accounted for and braced. Additionally, the blast effect from firing can create a hazardous environment, particularly to those in close proximity. 3. Exposure to propellant gases and noise: Prolonged exposure to propellant gases can be harmful to a person's health, and the high volume of noise produced during firing can lead to hearing damage if proper ear protection is not used. 4. Physical strain and fatigue: Operating and loading heavy artillery can be physically demanding work, often carried out in challenging conditions. Fatigue and strained muscles can lead to mistakes and injuries. 5. Malfunctioning equipment: Like any machinery, artillery systems can malfunction. This could lead to accidents, such as unintended discharges or launcher damage, causing harm to the user. To mitigate these risks, proper training, safety measures, and the use of protective equipment are essential. However, despite all precautions, there is always an inherent danger when working with powerful weapons like artillery."},{"instruction":"Information: - At the end of each Major League Baseball season, the league leaders of various statistical categories are announced.

Answer: A very small amount of water vapor inside a light bulb can significantly affect lamp darkening. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"Answer: Water increases lamp darkening due to several factors involving the chemical reactions and physical processes occurring inside the lamp when it operates. In order to understand this phenomenon, we must look at the composition of lamps, especially incandescent bulbs, and analyze the impact of water vapor on these components. Incandescent bulbs work by passing an electric current through a thin tungsten filament, causing it to heat up and emit light. These bulbs are usually filled with an inert gas, such as argon or nitrogen, to minimize the oxidation of the filament and prolong the light bulb's life. However, if water vapor enters the light bulb, it can lead to a series of chemical reactions, which contribute to lamp darkening. First, let's consider the effect of water vapor on the tungsten filament. When the filament is heated, the tungsten atoms may react with water molecules, resulting in the formation of tungsten oxyhydroxide or tungsten oxide. This chemical reaction removes tungsten from the filament, which can weaken its structure over time. Additionally, tungsten oxide is a dark material that can deposit on the inner surface of the glass envelope, contributing to darkening of the lamp. Second, water vapor can increase the rate at which tungsten evaporates from the filament, a process known as the tungsten-halogen cycle. In a halogen-filled bulb, the evaporated tungsten reacts with halogen gas (such as iodine or bromine) to form tungsten halide, which is then redeposited onto the filament, extending the light bulb's life. However, the presence of water vapor can impede this process by reacting with the halogen gas, forming an acid or other halogen-containing compounds, which do not participate in the tungsten-halogen cycle. This disrupted cycle leaves more free tungsten atoms to deposit on the glass envelope, further contributing to lamp darkening. Another factor to consider is condensation. When water vapor is present inside a lamp, it may condense on the cooler surfaces of the glass envelope, creating water droplets. The droplets can scatter the light emitted by the filament, making the lamp appear dimmer and darker. In conclusion, water can increase lamp darkening through various chemical reactions involving the tungsten filament and inert gas, as well as through the physical process of condensation on the glass envelope. To minimize lamp darkening, it is essential to manufacture and store light bulbs in a controlled environment, free of moisture and excessive humidity, and ensure they are properly sealed to prevent water vapor from entering."},{"instruction":"Dialogue: Jane: Hey Stacy, can you go to the store for me?

Much of what is known about Epicurean philosophy derives from later followers and commentators. - Epicureanism is a system of philosophy based upon the teachings of the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, founded around 307 BC. Epicurus was an atomic materialist, following in the steps of Democritus. His materialism led him to a general attack on superstition and divine intervention. Following Aristippusabout whom very little is knownEpicurus believed that what he called \\"pleasure\\" was the greatest good, but that the way to attain such pleasure was to live modestly, to gain knowledge of the workings of the world, and to limit one's desires. This would lead one to attain a state of tranquility (\\"ataraxia\\") and freedom from fear as well as an absence of bodily pain (\\"aponia\\"). The combination of these two states constitutes happiness in its highest form. Although Epicureanism is a form of hedonism insofar as it declares pleasure to be its sole intrinsic goal, the concept that the absence of pain and fear constitutes the greatest pleasure, and its advocacy of a simple life, make it very different from \\"hedonism\\" as it is colloquially understood. - Themista of Lampsacus , the wife of Leonteus , was a student of Epicurus , early in the 3rd century BCE .

The area now called Yarralumla is part of two original land grants, which were granted to free settlers for the establishment of farms. In 1828 Henry Donnison, a Sydney merchant who had arrived with his wife and family on the brig Ellen on 29–30 July 1828, was granted an allotment on the western side of Stirling Ridge. A second grant was made to William Klensendorlffe (a German who had served in the British Navy and arrived free in the Colony in 1818), who had bought the land from John Stephen, on 7 March 1839. Donnison's land was named Yarralumla in a survey of the area conducted in 1834. Yarralumla was a name for the area used by the local people, apparently meaning \\"echo\\". An area to the west of what is now the suburb was the Yarrolumla parish.The prominent New South Wales parliamentarian Sir Terence Aubrey Murray (1810–1873) purchased Yarralumla in 1837. He lived there with his wife Mary Murray (née Gibbes, 1817–1858), the second daughter of the Collector of Customs for NSW, Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873), MLC. In 1859, Murray sold Yarralumla to his brother-in-law, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes (1828–1897). Later that same year, Augustus' parents came to live with him at Yarralumla homestead.

After more than a year of discussions, health and human services is preparing to formally present the new definition to the Justice Department before the end of the year, Trump administration officials say. If the Justice Department decides that the change is legal, the new definition can be approved and enforced in Title IX statutes, and across government agencies. The Justice Department declined to comment on the draft health and human services proposal. The Justice Department has not yet been asked to render a formal legal opinion, according to an official there who was not authorized to speak about the process. But Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s previous decisions on transgender protections have given civil rights advocates little hope that the department will prevent the new definition from being enforced. The proposal appears consistent with the position he took in an October 2017 memo sent to agencies clarifying that the civil rights law that prohibits job discrimination does not cover “gender identity, per se.” Harper Jean Tobin, the policy director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, an advocacy group, called the maneuvering “an extremely aggressive legal position that is inconsistent with dozens of federal court decisions.” ||||| CLOSE A November ballot question in Massachusetts is the first-ever statewide referendum on a transgender rights law. Supporters worry a setback in one of the most LGBT-friendly states could setoff a cascade of repeal efforts across the country. (Oct. 19) AP Roger Severino, director of the Office for Civil Rights, poses for a portrait, Feb. 1, 2018, at the office of Health and Human Services in Washington. (Photo: Jacquelyn Martin, AP) The Trump administration may move to rigidly define gender as a fixed status determined biologically by the genitalia a person is born with, reversing Obama-era policies that granted federal recognition to transgender individuals, according to a Sunday report from The New York Times. The paper said it obtained a memo detailing how the Department of Health and Human Services plans to create a legal definition of gender. The definition would be implemented under the Title IX law, which bans discrimination based on sex in federally funded education programs, the Times reported. The HHS memo said that gender should be defined \\"on a biological basis that is clear, grounded in science, objective and administrable,\\" the Times said. A person's gender would be strictly male or female and it would be unchanging. \\"Sex means a person’s status as male or female based on immutable biological traits identifiable by or before birth,\\" the memo said, according to the Times. \\"The sex listed on a person’s birth certificate, as originally issued, shall constitute definitive proof of a person’s sex unless rebutted by reliable genetic evidence.\\" According to a 2016 study from the Williams Institute, a UCLA Law-based think tank focused on sexual orientation research, about 1.4 million American adults identify as transgender. Former President Barack Obama's administration argued that the 1972 Title IX law bars discrimination based on gender and sexual orientation. When the Department of Education issued a guidance in 2016 requiring schools to allow transgender students to use the restroom or locker room of their chosen gender, it invoked Title IX. That meant schools that did not comply could risk losing federal funds. That guidance infuriated conservatives, who decried the move as a clear case of federal overreach. The directive was rescinded one month after President Donald Trump took office in 2017. Trump's HHS department has argued that the term \\"sex\\" was never legally meant to include homosexuality and gender identity, the Times reported. Roger Severino, the current director of the Office for Civil Rights at HHS, wrote several articles critical of Obama's efforts to extend civil rights protections to transgender Americans. In 2016, Severino called the Education Department's guidance on school bathrooms the \\"culmination of a series of unilateral, and frequently lawless, administration attempts to impose a new definition of what it means to be a man or a woman on the entire nation.\\" Trump has also sought to bar transgender troops from serving in the military. According to the Times, HHS officials plan to present the proposed change to the Department of Justice by the end of the year to assess the legality of the new definition. Gay rights advocates decried the reported move to rigidly define gender. The Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ civil rights organization, condemned the plan as the administration's latest effort \\"to undermine the rights and welfare of LGBTQ people.\\" \\"Defining 'sex' in this narrow language tailored to the talking points of anti-equality extremists is part of a deliberate strategy to eliminate federal protections for LGBTQ people,\\" HRC President Chad Griffin said in a statement. \\"This is a direct attack on the fundamental equality of LGBTQ people and, if this administration refuses to reverse course, Congress must immediately take action by advancing the Equality Act to ensure that LGBTQ people are explicitly protected by our nation’s civil rights laws.” The Trevor Project, a suicide prevention organization aimed at helping LGBTQ youth, called the potential change \\"reckless and dangerous.\\" \\"When a young person hears that their existence and gender identity will not be recognized by their government, they hear that they are not worthy to be a part of that nation. Transgender youth seeing this report should know that they are not alone and that their identity is valid – nothing the government does can change that,\\" Amit Paley, CEO and Executive Director of The Trevor Project, said in a statement. \\"These policy decisions have real-world consequences.\\" Contributing: Gregory Korte, USA TODAY Read or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/10/21/trump-administration-gender-definiton/1721621002/ ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"The news article is about the Trump administration possibly making a change in how gender is defined.

An insecticidal soap solution can be an effective household remedy to control aphids, but it only kills aphids on contact and has no residual effect.

In this first poll conducted entirely after the latest scandalous details emerged, Quinn now outdistances Weiner by 9 percentage points. Among registered Democrats in New York City, including those who are undecided yet leaning toward a candidate, if the Democratic primary were held today, here is how the contest would stand: 25% Christine Quinn 16% Anthony Weiner 14% Bill de Blasio 14% Bill Thompson 7% John Liu 2% Erick Salgado 1% Sal Albanese 2% Other 19% Undecided Click Here for Complete July 25, 2013 NBC 4 New York/Wall Street Journal/Marist Poll NYC Release and Tables POLL MUST BE SOURCED: NBC 4 New York/Wall Street Journal/Marist Poll* “For many Democrats the latest revelations about Anthony Weiner are more of the same, only more so,” says Dr. Lee M. Miringoff, Director of The Marist College Institute for Public Opinion. “Weiner has lost his lead and his negatives are at an all-time high.” There has been a 14 percentage point swing in the contest between Quinn and Weiner. As noted, Quinn leads Weiner by 9 percentage points. When the NBC 4 New York/Wall Street Journal/Marist Poll last reported this question in June, Weiner — 25% — edged Quinn — 20% — by 5 percentage points among New York City Democrats including those who were undecided yet leaning toward a candidate. Bill Thompson received the support of 13%. At that time, 10% backed Bill de Blasio while 8% were for John Liu. Erick Salgado had the support of 2%, and 1% was behind Sal Albanese. One percent backed another candidate, and 18% were undecided. Among Democrats who are likely to vote in September’s primary, 26% are for Quinn compared with 17% for de Blasio who is in a statistical tie for second with Weiner at 16% and Thompson with 15%. Liu has the backing of 7%, Salgado garners 2%, and 1% is for Albanese. Two percent support another candidate, and 15% are undecided. How committed to their choice of candidate are New York City Democrats with their candidate preference? 42% say they strongly support their choice. 32% are somewhat behind their pick while 23% might vote differently. Three percent are unsure. Last month, 36% of Democrats with a candidate preference reported they were firmly in their candidate’s camp. 38% were somewhat behind their pick, and 23% thought they might change their minds before Election Day. Three percent, at the time, were unsure. Democrats who are for Weiner — 52% — are still more committed to their choice of candidate than backers of the other leading contenders. 37% of Quinn’s supporters strongly support her. 35% of Thompson’s backers have a similar intensity of support, and 33% of Democrats behind de Blasio are firmly committed to their candidate. In June, 45% of Weiner’s supporters said they strongly supported him. This compares with 34% of Quinn’s backers who expressed a similar intensity of support. Results for Thompson and de Blasio are not available for the previous poll. Table: 2013 Democratic Primary for Mayor (NYC Democrats with Leaners) Table: Intensity of Support (NYC Democrats with a Candidate Preference) Weiner’s Negative Rating Soars There has been a dramatic shift in Democrats’ impressions of Anthony Weiner from a similar poll conducted last month before the latest online sexual relationship came to light. In the current survey, a majority of Democrats citywide have an unfavorable impression of Anthony Weiner. 55% have this view while three in ten — 30% — have a favorable opinion of the candidate. 15% have either never heard of him or are unsure how to rate him. This represents the highest negative rating Anthony Weiner has received this election season. In last month’s NBC 4 New York/Wall Street Journal/Marist Poll, a majority of New York City Democrats — 52% — had a favorable view of Weiner while 36% had an unfavorable opinion of him. 11%, at the time, had either never heard of him or were unsure how to rate him. “New York City Democrats were willing to give Anthony Weiner a second chance but are reluctant to excuse his behavior now,” says Dr. Lee M. Miringoff, Director of The Marist College Institute for Public Opinion. Table: Anthony Weiner Favorability (NYC Democrats) Table: Anthony Weiner Favorability Over Time (NYC Democrats) Democrats Divide Over Future of Weiner’s Candidacy Despite the tawdry details of Weiner’s online sexual relationships, Weiner vows to fight on in his quest to become the next mayor of New York City. But, do Democrats citywide want Weiner to remain in the race? 47% do while 43% want him to drop out of the contest. 10% are unsure. What would the race look like without Weiner? Quinn outpaces her closest competitor, Thompson, by 15 percentage points. Among registered Democrats in New York City, including those who are undecided yet leaning toward a candidate, if the Democratic primary were held today, here is how the contest would stand without Anthony Weiner: 32% Christine Quinn 17% Bill Thompson 16% Bill de Blasio 9% John Liu 2% Erick Salgado 1% Sal Albanese 2% Other 20% Undecided Among Democrats who are likely to vote in September’s primary, 32% support Quinn compared with 20% for de Blasio. 18% are behind Thompson while Liu receives the support of 9%. Two percent back Salgado while 1% is for Albanese. Two percent support another candidate, and 17% are undecided. Table: Should Anthony Weiner Drop Out of the Race for New York City Mayor? (NYC Democrats) Table: 2013 Democratic Primary for Mayor without Anthony Weiner (NYC Democrats with Leaners) Do Weiner’s Online Sexcapades Matter to Democrats? 46% of New York City Democrats say Weiner’s online sexual relationships will impact their vote. Included here are 33% who report Weiner’s activities will matter a great deal to their decision and 13% who say Weiner’s actions will matter a good amount. 49%, however, say these activities matter little or not at all when deciding their vote. This includes 14% who say these revelations matter a little and 35% who say they don’t matter at all. Five percent are unsure. Anthony Weiner is not the only politician seeking forgiveness from the public. Following a prostitution scandal that forced him out of office, former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer is running for New York City comptroller. However, Democrats citywide find Weiner’s behavior more egregious than Spitzer’s actions. When NBC 4 New York/Wall Street Journal/Marist asked Democrats earlier this month if Spitzer’s sex scandal would impact their vote, only 34% believed it would have an effect on how they cast their ballot, and 62% reported it would matter little or not at all. Five percent were unsure. Table: Impact of Weiner’s Online Sexual Relationships on Vote (NYC Democrats) A Matter of Trust? Abedin’s Support Does Little to Help Weiner In a press conference on Tuesday, Huma Abedin, Anthony Weiner’s wife, publicly supported her husband and said she had forgiven him. However, her commitment does little to help Weiner’s electoral chances. Almost three in four Democrats — 73% — report Abedin’s support has no impact on how much trust they have in Weiner to be mayor. 15% say her backing makes them more likely to trust him while 12% say it makes them less likely to do so. Table: Does Huma Abedin’s Support of Anthony Weiner Make You More or Less Likely to Trust Weiner as Mayor? (NYC Democrats) Have Weiner’s Chances Run Out? Can New York City Democrats move beyond Weiner’s salacious activities and give him another chance? Again, there is a divide. 47% believe Weiner deserves another chance in the public arena while 45% disagree and say he does not have the character to be mayor. Nine percent are unsure. When Marist last reported a similar question in May, 59% of Democrats thought Weiner should be given a second chance. 35% said he did not have the character to be mayor, and 6% were unsure. Democrats are more willing to grant redemption to Eliot Spitzer. Two weeks ago, 67% said Spitzer deserved another chance while one in four — 25% — believed he did not have the character to be comptroller. Eight percent, at that time, were unsure. Table: Does Anthony Weiner Deserve Another Chance? (NYC Democrats) Just Four in Ten Think Weiner Would Do Well as Mayor Just 40% of Democrats citywide think Weiner would do an excellent or good job as mayor. This includes 15% who say he would be an excellent mayor and 25% who report he would be a good one. 47% do not think he would excel as mayor, including 19% who believe he would do a fair job in the office while more than one in four — 28% — predict he would perform poorly in City Hall. 13% are unsure. Once again, New York City Democrats express more faith in Eliot Spitzer. In NBC 4 New York/Wall Street Journal/Marist’s early July survey, 57% thought Spitzer would do either an excellent — 18% — or good — 39% — job as comptroller. 19% reported he would do a fair job, and 12% said he would fall short. 12%, then, were unsure.

Spitzer — 49% — leads Scott Stringer — 32% — by 17 percentage points among registered Democrats in New York City including those who are undecided yet leaning toward a candidate. Two percent support another candidate, and 17% are undecided. Spitzer’s lead has widened. Earlier this month, 42% of Democrats supported Spitzer while 33% were for Stringer. One percent backed another candidate, and 24% were undecided. Among Democrats who are likely to vote in September’s primary, 48% support Spitzer compared with 36% for Stringer. One percent supports another candidate, and 14% are undecided. Last time, Spitzer led Stringer 44% to 36% among Democrats likely to vote on Primary Day.

Translate this to English?","output":"It is estimated that the service sector will play a predominant role in the creation of new jobs, as the number of workers in this sector is expected to continue to increase. The given statement highlights the importance the service sector holds in generating employment opportunities. The service sector encompasses a wide range of industries, such as hospitality, tourism, retail, finance, healthcare, and education, among many others. This diverse nature of the service sector not only constitutes a significant portion of a country's economy but also provides ample job opportunities for people with varying skills and qualifications. There are various factors contributing to the continued growth of the service sector, which in turn, impacts job creation. Some of these factors include: 1. Technological advancements: With the rapid progression in technology, new avenues and industries within the service sector emerge. This leads to an increased demand for skilled workers who can fulfill the requirements of these emerging industries. 2. Globalization: Globalization has led to increased interconnectedness of economies around the world. As a result, companies and industries are now able to provide their services across borders which in turn creates more job opportunities. 3. Shift in socio-economic structure: Many developed and developing countries are witnessing a transition from an agriculture-based economy to one that is focused more on industries and services. This shift results in the growth of the service sector and drives employment. 4. Consumer-driven growth: As consumers become increasingly discerning and demand higher quality products and services, companies must keep up with these expectations in order to maintain their market share. This often requires hiring additional staff to cater to the growing needs of their customers. 5. Market needs: The varying demands of different markets require specialized services, which can only be provided by skilled human resources in the service sector. This further fuels job growth in the sector. In light of these factors, it is crucial to place emphasis on developing the skills and qualifications of the workforce, as well as implementing effective strategies and policies to support and foster the growth of the service sector. By doing so, it can help maintain a sustainable and dynamic job market, contributing to overall economic growth and stability."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Question: what goods are imported in the Democratic Republic of Congo I found the following answer on Google: At the time of its independence in 1960, DRC was the second most industrialized country in Africa after South Africa ; it boasted a thriving mining sector and its agriculture sector was relatively productive.

So far, only two countries in the world--the prefix = st1 /USAandFrance--have ever produced them. But these frightful fighting machines are about to enter Asia. The US Navy said last month that one of its nine nuclear-powered aircraft carriers will be sent to Japanto replace the diesel-powered carrier Kitty Hawk in 2009 in an agreement on October 30th. The two countries also planned to level up their military cooperation and theUSAcalled forJapanto take a large role in alliance military moves. It will be the first time that a nuclear-powered carrier is based in Japan. Bombed byUSforces in World War II at Hiroshima and Nagasaki,Japanis the only world country to have been attacked by a nuclear weapon. Therefore, the citizens are highly sensitive to where nuclear-powered weapons are based. \\"A radiation leak at Yokosuka would kill 100,000 people as far away as Tokyo, and could cause billions of dollars in damage,\\" said Masahiko Go to, leader of a protest group inYokosuka.

The new carrier, yet to be _ , will travel faster, be capable of supporting longer operations and carry with it the Navy's most modern technology.

The argument states, \\"Adopting atheism will help to end senseless wars that are based on religion.\\" This focuses on a specific benefit of adopting atheism, specifically the potential to reduce or eliminate wars fueled by religious differences. Lastly, the keypoint is, \\"Atheism is beneficial to the person that adopts it.\\" This statement offers a more general idea that atheism has benefits for individuals who adopt it, but it does not specifically mention what those benefits are. After analyzing each part of the input, I concluded that the keypoint does not match the argument and does not summarize exactly what the argument means. While the keypoint suggests that there is a benefit to adopting atheism, it does not directly address the specific benefit mentioned in the argument, which is the potential to reduce or eliminate wars based on religion."},{"instruction":"Context: Believe me lovely . \\" Plucking her lips along the curl of that ear , she shifts carefully , not wanting to dislodge the form laid across her own like a blanket . \\" You will always ' feel me ' until I turn you loose . \\" Question Why is this person saying these things ?

The original sentence gives us specific details about the scene, including the number of people, their proximity to the shore, the size of the boat, and the presence of a long staff; however, it does not provide any information about the intentions, goals, or plans of the two people on the boat. The sentence \\"Two people about to sail around the world\\" makes a specific assumption about the plans of the two people, namely that they intend to embark on a global journey. However, the original sentence does not provide any evidence or details to either support or contradict this assumption. There could be many other possible explanations for the presence of two people near shore in a small boat, such as: 1. The two people are simply taking a leisurely boat ride close to the shore. 2. The two people are out on a fishing trip. 3. The two people are participating in a local boating event. 4. The two people are conducting research on the surrounding body of water. 5. The two people are using the boat for transportation to a nearby location.

C: The old man was thought to be a poor teacher. D: The boy couldn't earn enough money with the old man. The answer to this question is:","output":"D: The boy's parents deemed the old man as bad luck because he had gone for an extended period without catching a fish. They believed that the boy couldn't earn enough money with the old man and therefore, directed him to join another boat that had better fishing success. The situation was not about the risk factor associated with fishing (option A), the boy's education (option B), or the old man's teaching skills (option C). The issue was purely about the perceived luck and profitability of fishing with the old man. The parents were assured about their decision when the new boat the boy worked on caught three good fish in the very first week. The scenario evidently touches upon superstitious beliefs and survival needs in a fisherman's life, with the driving decision-maker being his ability to catch fish and thereby, sustain livelihood."},{"instruction":"Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Kevin Patrick Shields was born on 21 May 1963 in Jamaica Hospital in Queens, New York City, United States. He is the eldest of five siblings born to Irish parents; his mother was a nurse and his father was an executive in the food industry. Shields' parents had emigrated to the United States from Ireland in the 1950s, when the couple were teenagers. Shields attended Christ the King, a Roman Catholic primary school which he described as \\"a really horrible school run by psychopathic nuns\\". In August 2007, reports emerged that My Bloody Valentine would reunite for the 2008 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California, United States; this was later confirmed by Shields, along with the announcement that the band's third studio album (which he had begun recording in 1996) was near completion. In June 2008, My Bloody Valentine played two live rehearsals at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, their first public performances in 16 years. They began an extensive worldwide tour in summer 2008 (their first since their 1992 tour in support of Loveless) including appearances at Oyafestivalen in Oslo, Norway, Electric Picnic in Stradbally, Ireland, and the Fuji Rock Festival in Niigata, Japan. The band reportedly spent PS200,000 on equipment for their world tour. In October 2011, Shields launched the independent record label Pickpocket together with Le Volume Courbe frontwoman Charlotte Marionneau, and considered releasing a collaborative \\"ten minutes of noise\\" single on the imprint. In May 2012 remastered versions of Isn't Anything and Loveless were released as well as the EP's 1988-1991 collection, which featured the band's Shields-remastered Creation Records extended plays, singles and unreleased tracks. In November, Shields announced plans to release My Bloody Valentine's third album online before the end of the year, before announcing during a warm-up show at Electric Brixton in London on 27 January 2013 that the album \\"might be out in two or three days.\\" The m b v album was eventually released through the band's official website on 2 February 2013, crashing the site on its launch due to high traffic. According to Metacritic, m b v received \\"universal acclaim\\", and the band began a worldwide tour upon its release. Shields has since announced intentions to release remastered analogue cuts of My Bloody Valentine's back catalogue and a My Bloody Valentine EP \\"of all-new material\\", which will be followed by a fourth studio album.

He was known as \`\` The Colored Bing Crosby '' ( sic ) . - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well.

Myself and Riah travelled, I would say all the way out too Wheelers Hill, but it’s really not that far away, unless you live on the North side, which we both do. Riah and I carried our gear on two trains and 1 bus to get to Claire’s studio out in Wheelers Hill. I can see why Claire lives here as it’s a pretty beautiful place, it’s still suburban but there are trills, hills and birds everywhere, and for someone that’s passionate about the environment I can see why she lives here. Meeting Claire was awesome, after having spoken via phone or email for so long, it was nice to speak to her in person. The filming of the interview went extremely smoothly, I’d put this down to having planned out everything, such as all the questions I was going to ask prior to the interview. By this stage I had helped Riah film as well as Elise and it was noticeable how much smoother Riah’s interview went because she had pre-planned her questions. Rather than spending an hour asking various questions that you might not use anyway, it’s much more efficient to spend 20 minutes covering exactly what you want to cover. By this stage I’d also had practise setting up lights, doing sound and getting camera shots for people’s portraits so I already knew everything I wanted to shoot. Our setup was pretty simple, two large lights, one on Claire’s front right and one on Claire’s front left, two Canon EOS 60D DSLR’s at different positions (one straight on, one to the side), a Sony H2N handy recorder and a lapel mic. Everything ran super smoothly, we did the interview first then myself and Riah shot various things in Claire’s studio. Whilst shooting various things in Claire’s studio we also got a chance to both speak to her which was nice, discussing what it is like to be a woman in Melbourne’s art scene and finding out who some of her favourite artists were.

Forschung ist ein gründlicher und systematischer Untersuchungsprozess, der Informationen aus sorgfältigen Beobachtungen, Experimenten, Analysen und Modellierungen generiert. Die Identifizierung der Faktoren durch Forschung beinhaltet mehrere Schritte: Zunächst wird ein spezifisches Problem oder eine spezifische Fragestellung formuliert, die untersucht werden soll.

Dann werden Hypothesen entwickelt, die dazu dienen, vorherzusagen, welche Faktoren möglicherweise mit dem Problem zusammenhängen. Das zweite Stadium der Forschung besteht in der Sammlung und Analyse von Daten. Dies kann durch verschiedene Methoden geschehen, einschließlich Umfragen, Interviews, Beobachtungen oder Experimente. Diese Daten werden dann analysiert, oft mit statistischen Verfahren, um Muster und Zusammenhänge zu identifizieren. Die Identifizierung dieser Faktoren ermöglicht es den Einzelpersonen oder Organisationen dann, strategische Pläne zu entwickeln und umzusetzen, um diese Faktoren zu bekämpfen. Dies könnte beispielsweise durch Änderungen in Politiken, Prozessen oder Verhaltensweisen geschehen, die darauf abzielen, die identifizierten Faktoren zu minimieren oder zu eliminieren.

Sentence 2: Everyone was relieved that that I didn't think of it earlier. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"Yes, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. The concept of entailment in linguistics means that if the first sentence (also known as the premise) is true, then the second sentence (the conclusion) must also be true, given the information provided in the first sentence. Let's break down and analyze both sentences: Sentence 1: \\"Fool that I was not to have thought of this possibility before, and what a relief for us all.\\" This sentence suggests regret for not having thought of a particular possibility earlier and acknowledges that considering this possibility has brought relief to everyone involved. The speaker expresses their folly and mentions the relief it has brought to \\"us all,\\" implying that there are multiple individuals affected by this revelation, including the speaker. Sentence 2: \\"Everyone was relieved that I didn't think of it earlier.\\" This sentence reinforces the idea that the newfound possibility that the speaker considered brought relief to everyone involved. It suggests that if they had thought of it earlier, it would not have brought the subsequent relief that it does now. The fact that their previous lack of thought brings relief to everyone highlights a connection between the speaker's earlier state and the current relief experienced by all. Both sentences share the core idea of relief experienced by everyone due to the speaker not having thought of a possibility earlier. The first sentence leads to the understanding that if the speaker had considered this possibility earlier, the situation might have been different, and perhaps there would be no relief. Therefore, given that the first sentence contains information of the relief experienced by everyone, including the speaker, we can conclude that the second sentence is indeed entailed by the first sentence. Each sentence confirms that everyone involved feels relieved due to the speaker's previous lack of consideration regarding a specific possibility."},{"instruction":"Eastbound vehicles must pay a toll to cross the bridge; as with all Hudson River crossings along the North River, westbound vehicles cross for free.

Here are several strategies often employed to conceal a bald spot: 1. Hairstyle: A man might choose a hairstyle that strategically covers the bald area, such as growing the hair from one side longer and brushing it over the bald spot. Other hairstyles include a comb-over or parting the hair in a manner to minimize the appearance of the bald spot. 2. Hair fibers: These are small, colored fibers that are sprinkled on the scalp to create an illusion of fuller hair. The fibers, which are made from keratin or other materials, adhere to existing hair and the scalp through static electricity, helping to camouflage the bald spot. 3. Hair loss concealers: There are numerous products on the market, such as hair loss sprays, powders, and creams, which temporarily cover the bald spot with color to make it look like there is hair in the area. 4. Hairpieces and toupees: A man may choose to wear a small hairpiece or toupee specifically designed to cover a bald spot. These are typically attached to the scalp with adhesive or clips and can be custom-made to match the person's hair color and texture. 5. Hats and headwear: Wearing a hat, beanie, or bandana can provide an easy way to hide a bald spot, especially in casual settings. 6. Scalp micropigmentation: This is a non-surgical cosmetic procedure where tiny pigment deposits are applied to the scalp to create the appearance of a closely shaved head or stubble. Scalp micropigmentation can help in making a bald spot less noticeable. 7. Hair transplantation: Some men might choose surgical hair restoration procedures like hair transplantation, where healthy hair follicles are taken from one part of the scalp and transplanted into the bald area to create a natural-looking hairline. It is important to note that each individual's preferences and comfort levels will determine the best method for covering up a bald spot. Some men may also choose to embrace their baldness by shaving their head and adopting a completely bald look, which can be a confident and stylish choice."},{"instruction":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","output":"Step 1: Brainstorm for ideas - To generate a context and hypothesis, I'll start by thinking about potential topics that are interesting and have a potential for exploration or investigation.

Step 3: Build context - The context is the background information necessary to give the audience a clear understanding of the subject before presenting the hypothesis. Here, I gather and include relevant information or data about exercise and mental health. Context: Exercise is a physical activity that has been proven to provide numerous health benefits for the human body, such as improving cardiovascular health, muscle strength, and flexibility. Mental health includes emotional, psychological, and social well-being, which affects an individual's capacity to cope with stress, work productively, and maintain healthy relationships. Research has shown that exercise can have a positive impact on mental health, as it releases endorphins and other chemicals that can help reduce stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. Step 4: Develop a hypothesis - A hypothesis is an educated prediction or proposed explanation for an observed phenomenon that can be tested scientifically. Based on the chosen context, I will form a specific hypothesis addressing a connection between exercise and mental health. Hypothesis: Engaging in regular moderate-intensity exercise will result in a significant reduction in symptoms of anxiety and depression compared to a sedentary lifestyle.

This was the scene in Zhuzhou,Hunan Province on May 17.Nine people were killed and 16 injured. Things were similar last year in the Sichuan earthquake. Thousands of people were buried in the ruins and lost their lives. What if we could have warned them? People are always _ to find a way of preventing buildings' collapse. Better materials and technology help,but they are not a solution. Just like humans,a building has its own life cycle from \\"birth\\" to \\"death\\".If we know when a building is going to collapse,we can repair it in advance or get out of it before it falls. Now,scientists at the University of Illinois have developed a material that turns red before it breaks. The invention could be used in things like climbing ropes or bridge supports. The research was led by Nancy Sottos,a professor at the university's Beckman Institute,and Douglas Davis,a graduate research assistant. The secret behind the colorchanging material is a type of molecule .A molecule is a group of atoms held together by chemical bonds. Imagine you and your friends standing in a circle,holding hands. Each person stands for one atom,your hands represent the bonds,and the entire circle represents a molecule. If one person lets go of his or her hands,the molecule changes color. The research team put the molecule into a soft material. When the researchers stretched the material,it turned bright red for a few seconds before it broke into two pieces. When they repeatedly stretched and relaxed the material,without breaking it,it only turned a little red. The major problem is that light can get rid of the red color. When the team shone bright light on the molecule,the broken bond was fixed,and the color disappeared. If the bright light keeps the red color from appearing,the material's warning system will be useless. Scientists still have a lot of work to do before the colorchanging molecules can be used outside the lab. Options: A The colorchanging molecules are certain to be used outside the lab. B There will be no collapse with the help of the colorchanging material. C There is a long way to go before the material can be applied. D The problem caused by bright light will be solved by scientists. Answer: C There is a long way to go before the material can be applied. Question: Answer:","output":"What is the current status of the color-changing material developed by scientists at the University of Illinois for detecting potential building collapses? A.

This is when male and female butterflies mate, and the female finds a suitable plant on which to lay her eggs. Then, she lays the eggs, providing the offspring necessary for the next generation. Afterward, the process starts again with the emergence of a new caterpillar from the egg. If it's a female butterfly, she will start searching for a plant where she can start laying eggs, and then the life cycle of a butterfly starts all over again. However, it's important to note that many adult butterflies also spend their time consuming nectar and pollinating flowers, which plays a crucial role in various ecosystems."},{"instruction":"i saw the film and i got screwed, because the film was foolish and boring. i thought ram gopal varma will justify his work but unfortunately he failed and the whole film got spoiled and they spoiled \\"sholay\\". the cast and crew was bad. the whole theater slept while watching the movie some people ran away in the middle. amithab bachan's acting is poor, i thought this movie will be greatest hit of the year but this film will be the greatest flop of the year,sure. nobody did justice to their work, including Ajay devagan. this film don't deserve any audiences. i bet that this film will flop. \\"FINALLY THIS MOVIE SUCKS\\" Choose your answer.

The reviewer highlights a few issues that contribute to this negative impression: 1. \\"the visual flair and bouncing bravado that characterizes better hip-hop clips\\": This part of the sentence indicates that the movie may contain elements that are reminiscent of popular hip-hop music videos. However, the use of the word \\"better\\" suggests that the movie does not quite reach the level of quality one would expect from these videos, thus showing a comparison with something more positively received. 2. \\"and is content to recycle images and characters that were already tired 10 years ago\\": This statement is more explicitly negative, as it criticizes the film for recycling or reusing images and characters that were already considered overused and tired a decade ago. By pointing out this flaw, the reviewer implies that the movie lacks originality and may feel dated or stale. In conclusion, these points combined lead to the understanding that the movie was seen negatively by the reviewer due to its lack of originality and inability to reach the same level of quality as some of the better hip-hop clips. Additionally, the complaint about the recycled and tired images and characters contributes to an overall sense that the movie lacks freshness and creativity."},{"instruction":"Annie brought 20 brownies to school.

Is the following a factual statement? \\"The Standard deviation measures how far an observation is from the mean on average.\\" Options: - yes - no","output":"The given statement is not entirely factually correct. To clarify, let's break down the concept of standard deviation step-by-step. Standard deviation is a statistical measurement that helps to quantify the amount of variation or dispersion within a set of data values. In simple terms, it indicates how spread out the data is from the mean (or the average) value. The given statement says that \\"standard deviation measures how far an observation is from the mean on average.\\" While it does relate to the average distance from the mean, this statement isn't accurate. A more precise definition of standard deviation is that it measures the average amount of variation or dispersion in the data points in a set. It considers the 'average' of the squared differences between each data point and the mean and then takes the square root of that value. For example, let's consider a dataset: [2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9] 1. Calculate the mean (average) of the data points: (2+4+4+4+5+5+7+9)/8 = 40/8 = 5 2. Find the difference between each data point and the mean: [-3, -1, -1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 4] 3. Square the differences: [9, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 4, 16] 4. Calculate the average (mean) of the squared differences: (9+1+1+1+0+0+4+16)/8 = 32/8 = 4 5. Find the square root of the average squared difference: √4 = 2 So, the standard deviation for the dataset is 2. To sum up, the statement \\"The standard deviation measures how far an observation is from the mean on average,\\" is not entirely accurate and should be corrected as follows: \\"The standard deviation measures the average amount of variation or dispersion in a set of data points.\\" Therefore, the correct answer is: - no"},{"instruction":"Write an article that answers the following question: Which event happened first, AUMF becoming law, or the attacks on 11 September 2001?","output":"Title: AUMF and the September 11 Attacks: A Timeline of Events Introduction In the aftermath of the tragic events that transpired on September 11, 2001, the United States government was quick to respond with legislative efforts to bolster its national security and counter-terrorism policies. One such pivotal piece of legislation is the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF). However, questions are often raised about the timeline of events - specifically, which event happened first: the AUMF becoming law or the September 11 attacks? This article aims to shed light on the chronology of these events and provide insight into the correlation between the two. Chronological Analysis Step 1: The September 11 attacks On the morning of September 11, 2001, four planes were hijacked by 19 al-Qaeda terrorists. Two of the planes were flown into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, causing the buildings' catastrophic collapse. A third plane struck the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, while the fourth plane, United Airlines Flight 93, crashed in a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, after passengers and crew attempted to regain control from the hijackers. The September 11 attacks resulted in the deaths of 2,977 people, including 246 on the planes, 2,606 in the World Trade Center or in the immediate vicinity, and 125 at the Pentagon. This tragedy marked a turning point for the United States, shaping its foreign policy and counter-terrorism efforts for years to come. Step 2: The Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) In response to the September 11 attacks, the United States Congress quickly drafted and passed the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) – a joint resolution granting the President the authority to use military force against those responsible for the attacks. The AUMF was introduced in Congress on September 14, 2001, and was subsequently passed by both the House of Representatives and the Senate on September 18, 2001. President George W. Bush signed it into law on September 18, 2001. The AUMF has been utilized to authorize military force in the global War on Terror, which includes the invasion of Afghanistan, targeted airstrikes, and various military engagements against terrorist organizations across the world. Conclusion In conclusion, the attacks on 11 September 2001 took place before the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) became law. The horrific events of that day served as the catalyst for the passage of the AUMF, which was signed into law just a week later. The timeline of these events highlights the swift and decisive response by the United States government in the face of unprecedented adversity, setting the stage for nearly two decades of global counter-terrorism efforts."},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to Czech: If you can run around, so can I.

However, the statement does not explicitly mention that the vehicle is outside. To conclude that a vehicle is outside, we should examine the various elements and clues provided: 1. The car is described as \\"racing through a curve.\\" This suggests that the car is in motion and that the shape of the road or track it is on consists of curves. Typically, a curvy road could be found in either an outdoor or indoor setting (e.g., underground parking structures or indoor kart racing facilities). 2. The car is \\"spinning wheels.\\" This implies that the tires are rotating quickly, possibly causing the car to lose traction momentarily. This event might be more likely to occur outdoors, particularly in a natural environment such as a dirt track, but it could still happen in specific indoor settings as well. 3. The car is \\"kicking up dust.\\" This phrase is most indicative of the vehicle being outside, as dust is generally pervasive in outdoor driving scenarios, like a dirt road or off-road track. However, in some cases, indoor tracks or facilities may also have dust accumulations. Despite these details, there is still not conclusive evidence that the described scenario takes place outdoors. While it is likely, due to the presence of dust and the nature of the car's movement, one cannot make exceptions for the possibility of an indoor setting with these characteristics. For example, a large indoor racing facility could have a course constructed from a dirt surface or have dust build-up, simulating an outdoor environment. In summary, while the description of \\"a red, white, and yellow car racing through a curve, spinning wheels, and kicking up dust\\" does imply an outdoor environment, we cannot directly conclude without doubt that the vehicle is outside. To reach a definitive conclusion, additional context or evidence would be required to confirm the setting."},{"instruction":"The Usos are an American professional wrestling tag team consisting of twin brothers Jey and Jimmy Uso (born August 22, 1985).

A judge sentences Haley to her ultimate nightmare, attending an elite gymnastics academy run by legendary coach Burt Vickerman (Jeff Bridges).Haley was once considered one of the most talented gymnasts in the US. She made it to the World Championships, but the previous year she walked out of competition in the middle of the finals, costing the American team the gold medal and leaving many people hurt and crushed making her one of the most hated people in gymnastics.After arriving at the school, Haley has a talk with Coach Vickerman, who convinces her to take up the sport once again at least until she can enter an upcoming invitational competition.

Even after the emergence of the professional National Football League (NFL), college football remained extremely popular throughout the U.S. Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs the highest level playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000. In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans.

Keanu was surfing towards the shore at a speed of 20 miles per hour. A shark was swimming alongside him, riding the same wave, when it doubled its speed and moved away from Keanu. There was a pilot fish swimming alongside Keanu and the shark, and when the shark increased its speed, the pilot fish also increased its speed and moved away from Keanu, but only increasing its speed by half as much as the shark had increased its speed by. What speed, in miles per hour, was the pilot fish swimming when it moved away from Keanu?","output":"Step 1: Determine Keanu's speed. Keanu is surfing at a speed of 20 miles per hour. Step 2: Determine the shark's initial speed. The shark was initially swimming alongside Keanu, so its initial speed was also 20 miles per hour. Step 3: Determine the shark's speed when it moved away from Keanu. The shark doubled its speed, so it was swimming at 2 * 20 = 40 miles per hour. Step 4: Determine the speed increase of the shark. The shark's speed increase was 40 miles per hour (its final speed) - 20 miles per hour (its initial speed) = 20 miles per hour. Step 5: Determine the speed increase of the pilot fish. The pilot fish increased its speed by half as much as the shark, so it increased its speed by 20 miles per hour (the shark's increase) / 2 = 10 miles per hour. Step 6: Determine the pilot fish's initial speed. The pilot fish was initially swimming alongside Keanu and the shark, so its initial speed was also 20 miles per hour. Step 7: Determine the pilot fish's final speed. The pilot fish's final speed is equal to its initial speed plus its speed increase. Therefore, its final speed is 20 miles per hour (initial speed) + 10 miles per hour (increase) = 30 miles per hour. So, the pilot fish was swimming at a speed of 30 miles per hour when it moved away from Keanu."},{"instruction":"Quinn killed their children and had to go to jail for a lifetime.

And the answer is?","output":"The more common name of the incendiary weapon formulated from naphthenic and palmitic acids is Napalm. Napalm is a highly flammable, sticky, and gel-like substance that can adhere to surfaces and burn for extended periods of time. Napalm was initially developed during World War II by a team of chemists led by Dr. Louis Fieser at Harvard University in the United States. The term \\"napalm\\" is derived from a combination of the names of its two main constituents - naphthenic and palmitic acids. These two acids, when combined with gasoline, form a mixture that is highly incendiary and capable of producing intense, long-lasting fires. The mixture burns at incredibly high temperatures, which can range from 800 to 1,200 degrees Celsius (1,472 to 2,192 degrees Fahrenheit). The use of this weapon can cause severe burns and even death for those exposed to it. One of the most notorious uses of napalm was during the Vietnam War, where the United States military employed it extensively, both for its ability to clear jungle foliage and provide cover, and as a psychological weapon against enemy forces. Napalm was dropped in large canisters from aircraft, frequently in combination with white phosphorus, another incendiary substance mainly used for producing dense smoke. The use of napalm has been condemned for its destructive and inhumane effects on both people and the environment. Its impact garnered international attention and led to the signing of the United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) in 1980, which placed limitations on the usage of napalm. In 1983, an amendment to the CCW further restricted the use of napalm and other incendiary weapons against civilians, limiting their usage in warfare even further. Despite these regulations, napalm continues to be a controversial weapon, with sporadic reports of its usage in various conflicts around the world. Its legacy as a powerful, devastating, and horrifying weapon in modern warfare serves as a reminder of the need to balance technological advances with ethical considerations."},{"instruction":"Can you generate a question with a factual answer?","output":"Certainly! Here's a question related to world history: Question: What was the main catalyst that led to the beginning of World War I, and which countries were part of the initial conflict? Answer: The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, was the main catalyst that led to the beginning of World War I. On June 28, 1914, in Sarajevo, the then 19-year-old Serbian nationalist Gavrilo Princip shot and killed Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife, Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg. The assassination unleashed a series of events that escalated into full-scale war. The inception of the conflict was primarily between Austria-Hungary and Serbia. After the assassination, Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia with a set of demands to ensure the prevention of such acts in the future. Serbia agreed to most of the demands but requested clarification on some points. Austria-Hungary considered Serbia's response unsatisfactory and declared war on July 28, 1914. The system of alliances and ententes that existed in Europe at the time caused other nations to be drawn into the conflict. Russia, with its pan-Slavic interests, supported Serbia and started mobilizing its forces. This led Germany, allied with Austria-Hungary through the Triple Alliance, to declare war on Russia on August 1, 1914. France, bound by its alliance with Russia through the Franco-Russian Alliance, declared war on Germany and Austria-Hungary on August 3, 1914. The initial conflict can be categorized into two opposing sides: the Central Powers, including Austria-Hungary and Germany, and the Allied Powers, which included Serbia, Russia, and France. As the war progressed, the conflict grew to include many more countries, with the Central Powers eventually joined by the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria, and the Allied Powers joined by the United Kingdom, Italy, the United States, and several other nations. The war ended on November 11, 1918, with the signing of the armistice."},{"instruction":"Title: poorly made Product review: The snaps fell off almost immediately on every single onesie.

Hint: Often, foreign exchange controls can result in the creation of black markets to exchange the weaker currency for stronger currencies. This leads to a situation where the exchange rate for the foreign currency is much higher than the rate set by the government, and therefore creates a shadow currency exchange market. As such, it is unclear whether governments have the ability to enact effective exchange controls.[1] Answer:","output":"Given the information in the paragraph, the currency that would most likely be exchanged in the black market is the Pound Sterling because the UK government kept the price of the Pound Sterling at the same level despite facing an economic downturn. This artificial control of the value could lead to the creation of a shadow market, where the exchange rate for the foreign currency (Pound Sterling) is higher than the rate set by the government."},{"instruction":"The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution states plainly: \`\`(N)or shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb ...

Possible answers: running to avoid someone, in a hurry, running to finish a exam Answer:","output":"Based on the given context, we can interpret that Lee is likely in a hurry. The statement \\"Lee quickly began running towards the school entrance\\" suggests that there is some degree of urgency in their actions. While the alternatives 'running to avoid someone' and 'running to finish an exam' are also valid possibilities, they are more situation-specific and require additional context to support them. Given the limited information, the description of Lee as \\"in a hurry\\" is the most reasonable general assumption we can make. Lee's swift actions and direction towards the school entrance indicate that they have an important reason to be there, and are motivated to arrive quickly. It's important to note that the context provided doesn't contain enough information to be absolutely certain about the reason behind Lee's hurried actions. Nonetheless, we can infer that something significant is happening at the school, and Lee is eager to actively participate or address the situation. Had the context mentioned any specific underlying reasons or situations, such as \\"Lee quickly began running towards the school entrance after noticing a group of bullies following them,\\" or \\"Lee quickly began running towards the school entrance upon realizing that their final exam was about to start,\\" then the answer could've been adjusted accordingly to match the provided context."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. - The Schutzstaffel (SS; also stylized as with Armanen runes literally \\"Protection Squadron\\") was a major paramilitary organization under Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP; Nazi Party) in Nazi Germany. It began with a small guard unit known as the \\"Saal-Schutz\\" (Hall-Protection) made up of NSDAP volunteers to provide security for party meetings in Munich. In 1925, Heinrich Himmler joined the unit, which had by then been reformed and given its final name. Under his direction (192945), it grew from a small paramilitary formation to one of the most powerful organizations in Nazi Germany. From 1929 until the regime's collapse in 1945, the SS was the foremost agency of surveillance and terror within Germany and German-occupied Europe. - Joachim Peiper ( German pronunciation : ( joaxm pap ) ; 30 January 1915 -- 14 July 1976 ) , also known as Jochen Peiper , was a field officer in the Waffen - SS during World War II and personal adjutant to Reichsführer - SS Heinrich Himmler between November 1940 and August 1941 . Peiper fought on both the Eastern Front against the Red Army and the Western Front against the Western Allies , and he won the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords for extreme battlefield bravery and outstanding military leadership . By 1945 , he was an SS - Standartenführer and the Waffen - SS 's youngest regimental colonel . Peiper was convicted of war crimes committed in Belgium and imprisoned for almost 12 years . He was accused of war crimes in Italy , but Italian and German courts concluded that there was insufficient evidence to warrant prosecution . After his release from prison , Peiper worked for both Porsche and Volkswagen , before moving to France , where he translated books from English to German under the nom de plume Rainer Buschmann . Peiper was murdered in France in July 1976 , when he was shot by unknown assailants who then burned his house to the ground using Molotov cocktails . - Adjutant is a military rank or appointment. In some armies, including most English-speaking ones, it is an officer who assists a more senior officer, while in other armies, especially Francophone ones, it is an NCO (non-commissioned officer), normally corresponding roughly to a staff sergeant or warrant officer. - Reichsführer-SS was a special title and rank that existed between the years of 1925 and 1945 for the commander of the Schutzstaffel (SS). \\"Reichsführer-SS\\" was a title from 1925 to 1933, and from 1934 to 1945 it was the highest rank of the SS. The longest serving and by far most noteworthy \\"Reichsführer-SS\\" was Heinrich Himmler. - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II. - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany. - The National Socialist German Workers' Party (abbreviated NSDAP), commonly referred to in English as the Nazi Party, was a political party in Germany that was active between 1920 and 1945 and practised the ideology of Nazism. Its precursor, the German Workers' Party (\\"Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; DAP), existed from 1919 to 1920. - Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889 30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (\\"Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and Führer (\\"Leader\\") of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. As dictator of the German Reich, he initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and was central to the Holocaust. - Sergeant (abbreviated to Sgt and capitalised when used as a named person's title) is a rank in many uniformed organizations, principally military and policing forces. Its origin is the Latin \\"serviens\\", \\"one who serves\\", through the French term \\"sergent\\". - In politics and military planning, a war effort refers to a coordinated mobilization of society's resourcesboth industrial and humantowards the support of a military force. Depending on the militarization of the culture, the relative size of the armed forces and the society supporting them, the style of government, and the popular support for the military objectives, such war effort can range from a small industry to complete command of society. - The Waffen-SS (Armed SS) was the armed wing of the Nazi Party's SS organisation. Its formations included men from Nazi Germany, along with volunteers and conscripts from both occupied and un-occupied lands. - Heinrich Luitpold Himmler (7 October 1900 23 May 1945) was \\"Reichsführer\\" of the \\"Schutzstaffel\\" (Protection Squadron; SS), and a leading member of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) of Nazi Germany. Nazi leader Adolf Hitler briefly appointed him a military commander and later Commander of the Replacement (Home) Army and General Plenipotentiary for the administration of the entire Third Reich (\\"Generalbevollmächtigter für die Verwaltung\\"). Himmler was one of the most powerful men in Nazi Germany and one of the people most directly responsible for the Holocaust. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Strategic bombing is a military strategy used in a total war with the goal of defeating the enemy by destroying its morale or its economic ability to produce and transport materiel to the theatres of military operations, or both. It is a systematically organized and executed attack from the air which can utilize strategic bombers, long- or medium-range missiles, or nuclear-armed fighter-bomber aircraft to attack targets deemed vital to the enemy's war-making capability.

Another 12 veterans received their medals from French ambassador Sylvie Bermann at a ceremony in London. One of the recipients, Peter Cliffe, 94, from Woking, Surrey, landed at Leon-Sur-Mer in Normandy on 6 June.

Now, let's be accurate as possible. Some thinking first:","output":"We cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. Although it is likely that the American football player carrying the ball is looking to score a touchdown, there may be other reasons or goals for avoiding the tackler. The primary goal could indeed be to score a touchdown, but other possibilities could include gaining yardage, securing a first down, or evading the tackler to pass the football to a teammate. To provide a more accurate analysis: Premise: \\"An American football player carrying a football tries to avoid a tackler.\\" This information tells us that the football player has possession of the ball and is trying to evade a defender, who is attempting to stop him by tackling. Hypothesis: \\"He is looking to score a touchdown.\\" This hypothesis suggests that the football player's ultimate goal is to score a touchdown – reaching the opponent's end zone with the football. While scoring touchdowns is a primary goal for offensive football players, this hypothesis makes an assumption based on incomplete information. As mentioned before, other aims could include gaining yardage, securing a first down, or helping a teammate get into a better position to score.

It is not possible to tell. While the premise does mention that a woman in a pink shirt is talking to a man in a black shirt with the words \\"GROOM\\" on the front, we cannot definitively conclude the hypothesis that the woman is talking to a groom. There are a few reasons for this uncertainty: 1. Context: We lack information about the situation or setting in which the conversation is taking place. The word \\"GROOM\\" could be worn as a part of a uniform, costume, or other outfit unrelated to a wedding event. For instance, people may wear bridal-themed outfits as part of a party, an act in a play, or a promotional activity. Therefore, while the man may seem like a groom based on his shirt, it is not definite without confirming the context they are in. 2. The attire: Wearing a shirt with the word \\"GROOM\\" does not necessarily mean that the person wearing the shirt is, in fact, an actual groom. He might wear the shirt for fun, fashion purposes, or as a way of expressing support for a friend or loved one who is getting married. In such a case, the shirt could simply be a fashion statement, not a reliable confirmation of the man's role. 3. Perception: As an AI assistant, I lack visual or auditory inputs that could confirm the hypothesis. A conclusion based solely on the text may not accurately portray the situation. To determine the validity of the hypothesis, additional context, visuals, or audio cues would be necessary. In summary, while the man's shirt with the word \\"GROOM\\" suggests a relation to a wedding event, it is not sufficient evidence to definitively conclude that the woman is talking to a groom.

The album bore the transatlantic Top 10 hit \\"Blue Jean\\", itself the inspiration for a short film that won Bowie a Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video, Jazzin' for Blue Jean. Bowie performed at Wembley Stadium in 1985 for Live Aid, a multi-venue benefit concert for Ethiopian famine relief. During the event, the video for a fundraising single was premiered, Bowie's duet with Mick Jagger. \\"Dancing in the Street\\" quickly went to number one on release. The same year, Bowie worked with the Pat Metheny Group to record \\"This Is Not America\\" for the soundtrack of The Falcon and the Snowman.

It was poorly received by critics, but Bowie's theme song, also named \\"Absolute Beginners\\", rose to No. 2 in the UK charts. He also appeared as Jareth, the Goblin King, in the 1986 Jim Henson film Labyrinth, for which he wrote five songs. His final solo album of the decade was 1987's Never Let Me Down, where he ditched the light sound of his previous two albums, instead offering harder rock with an industrial/techno dance edge.

Pulling open her door, the man seized her by the neck and hair, and threw her out of the car onto the ground. She screamed, grabbing her purse and the keys. Two reporters of the local newspaper, Robert Bruce and Jeff Jackson, just outside their office building on a break, heard the screams and began running . When they reached Neilson's car, the attacker had jumped into the driver's seat and was madly searching for the keys. Bruce opened the door, and he and Jackson dragged the man out.

Translate to English English:","output":"The Committee's Drug Monitoring Task Force would, however, investigate in line with the agreed procedure, whether there would be a safety issue associated with the said compound. The assignment is typically undertaken by a team of scientists versed in drug safety evaluation, clinical pharmacology, or related disciplines as a part of a drug monitoring task force. The role of this task force is to ensure the safety and efficacy of the drug or compound in question through a systematic and comprehensive review of all available data, including preclinical studies, clinical trial results, post-marketing surveillance data, and spontaneously reported adverse events. Their objective is to determine whether the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks associated with its use. This is particularly important for compounds that have a novel mechanism of action, are intended for long-term use, or treat a condition for which other safe and effective treatments are available. The assessment begins by identifying any potential safety concerns associated with the compound, which can be based on preclinical or clinical data, or can arise as a result of post-marketing surveillance. These concerns can range from common, less serious side effects such as nausea or headache, to more serious concerns such as organ toxicity, severe allergic reactions, or increased risk of cancer. The task force’s subsequent role then is to scrutinize the robustness of these findings, analyzing the quality of the data, the size and representativity of the sample population, the statistical strength of the association, as well as any confounding factors that could have influenced the results. The final stage involves making an evidence-based decision about the safety of the compound. If the evidence points to a potential safety issue, the task force will seek to address it, either by recommending additional studies, modifying the dosing recommendations, adding a warning to the product label, or, in the worst case, by recommending the removal of the product from the market. On the other hand, if the task force determines that there is no substantial safety issue associated with the compound, it might recommend no changes to the product label or the product's approval status. All in all, this process ensures that the medicinal products available to the public are assessed for their safety, effectiveness, and that they provide more benefits than they pose risks to the users."},{"instruction":"Question: Who did the 2011 North Carolina Tar Heels football team lose to in the Independence Bowl?

While travelling, Nielsen discovered and then turned against Richard Wagner's music dramas, heard many of Europe's leading orchestras and soloists and sharpened his opinions on both music and the visual arts. Although he revered the music of Bach and Mozart, he remained ambivalent about much 19th-century music. In 1891 he met the composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni in Leipzig; they were to maintain a correspondence for over thirty years. Shortly after arriving in Paris in early March 1891 Nielsen met the Danish sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen, who was also travelling on a scholarship. They toured Italy together and married in St Mark's English Church, Florence, on 10 May 1891 before returning to Denmark. According to Fanning, their relationship was not only a \\"love match\\", but also a \\"meeting of minds\\"; Anne Marie was a gifted artist and a \\"strong-willed and modern-minded woman, determined to forge her own career\\". This determination would strain the Nielsens' marriage, as Anne Marie would spend months away from home during the 1890s and 1900s, leaving Carl, who was susceptible to opportunities with other ladies, to raise their three young children in addition to composing and fulfilling his duties at the Royal Theatre.Nielsen sublimated his anger and frustration over his marriage in a number of musical works, most notably between 1897 and 1904, a period which he sometimes called his \\"psychological\\" period.

Dr. Amusa seeks a valuable gem in the Brooklyn Museum that is of great significance to his people in his country in Africa, stolen during colonial times and then re-stolen by various African nations. Dortmunder and Kelp are joined by driver Stan Murch and explosives expert Allan Greenberg, concocting an elaborate plan to steal the gem.

The neckline should be tasteful, but the sleeve length (if the dress has sleeves) is optional. Many full-length formal gowns are sleeveless. In the absence of a full floor-length dress, a very nice, dark colored or black three-quarters length dress may be acceptable. Older women should always choose a longer gown, but younger women may be able to wear a shorter gown appropriately. The most formal events call for a long ballgown with a full skirt. Black is usually preferred, with a rich texture that adds some visual interest. Deep colors like blue, maroon, a rich purple, and brown also look nice. White or red dresses can be formal and classy, but may make you stand out. Use caution when wearing these to events like weddings, at which the bride should stand out, not one of the guests. Put your regular day purse aside and opt for a satin, or beaded, smaller clutch or purse for a black tie event. The more sparkle, the better. This is a time for you to shine. Wear real jewelry (for example, real diamonds, pearls, or gold) whenever possible. Costume jewelry should look very real and not tacky if worn. Traditional jewelry recommendations are a sparkly bracelet and earrings or very simple, understated necklace. It can be difficult to wear evening wear in the winter months, as it is often chilly and women’s black tie attire rarely has sleeves to speak of. Your cold-weather options, however, should also be formal. Remember that you may be able to shop at a thrift store or borrow items instead of buying them new. A fur or faux fur coat or wrap is the preferred choice for black tie dress codes. A traditional overcoat is the second best choice. For milder climates or for time spent indoors, a shawl or wrap made from a quality material such as cashmere is preferred. Long gloves, while made for style rather than warmth, may help ward off the cold and will give you a fancy flair. None of your undergarments should be visible in any way while dressed in your evening wear. Check for bra straps. Most formal dresses will require a strapless bra. Be sure there are no panty lines. If your dress is curve-hugging or tight, you need to be sure that no one will be able to see your underwear. You may need to wear a thong or go without. Consider wearing slimming undergarments. There are undergarments that are meant to smooth out areas of your body that may be bumpy and help give you a flattering shape. These usually do not show any lines beneath the clothing. Evening shoes are usually dainty or strappy, with a decent heel. Large or clunky shoes do not generally look good with formal dresses. Evening shoes that are satin, beaded or shiny are great choices. Ideally, the texture and color of your shoes should match that of your handbag/clutch. You should spend extra time making your hair and makeup look nice for a black tie event. Traditional black tie formality calls for hair to be gathered in an up-do. Consider going to a salon to have a professional style your hair for you. Events that involve dancing often have more flexibility and encourage flowing hair. Arrange for a manicure and pedicure the day of the event. Make a reservation ahead of time to ensure that they will have room for you. Makeup should be applied well and not over-done. If you are inexperienced in makeup application, schedule a makeover at a salon or go to a makeup counter at a department store. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article would be: Floor length gowns are considered more elegant for formal events, with tasteful necklines and optional sleeve lengths. For the most formal occasions, long ballgowns with full skirts in deep colors or black are preferred. When selecting accessories, opt for a small, beaded clutch and real jewelry, keeping the look classy and refined. During colder months, consider a fur or faux fur coat, wrap, or shawl made from quality materials. Ensure that undergarments are not visible and choose slimming options if necessary. Evening shoes should be dainty or strappy and coordinate with your handbag. Spend additional time on hair and makeup, opting for professional services if needed. Overall, aim for a polished and elegant appearance for black tie events."},{"instruction":"Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: In 1995,Oseola McCarty gave a present of 150 000 to the University of Southern Mississippi.

Sentence A: \\"Wash your hands before eating\\" Here, the sentence is instructing someone to wash their hands before consuming food. This is a sensible and common advice given for maintaining hygiene and preventing the spread of germs and diseases. Hands come into contact with various surfaces throughout the day and therefore may carry germs. Washing hands before eating is a well-known practice in most cultures. Sentence B: \\"Wash your feet before eating\\" This sentence suggests that one should wash their feet before consuming food. While washing feet is a good hygiene practice, it is not directly relevant to eating. Generally, people do not use their feet to handle or consume food. Conclusion: Based on the analysis above, Sentence A is sensible with a clear purpose of promoting hygiene when eating. However, Sentence B is nonsensical because washing feet before eating is not directly relevant to food consumption or necessary for maintaining hygiene during meals."},{"instruction":"Question: Fat Thursday is also known as what day?

Instead, it provides information about the end of Carnival festivities on Ash Wednesday and the burial of the sardine tradition in Spain. Fat Thursday, also known as \\"Tłusty Czwartek\\" in Poland or \\"Giovedì Grasso\\" in Italy, is a Christian feast day that takes place during Carnival season, marking the last Thursday before Lent. It is a day on which people indulge themselves in sweets and various hearty foods, particularly pastries fried in oil, as a form of celebrating before the fasting period of Lent. In Poland, Fat Thursday is celebrated with various traditional pastries such as pączki (Polish donuts) and faworki (also known as angel wings). The custom is to eat as many sweets as possible on this day, as it is believed that those who do not will experience bad luck throughout the year. In Italy, the day is marked by parades, parties, and eating various rich and fatty foods, as it is the last feast day before the 40-day Lenten fast. Although Fat Thursday is a pre-Lenten celebration, it differs in date from other similar occasions such as Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday) or Shrove Tuesday (Pancake Day), which is more widely celebrated in Anglo-Saxon countries. The main similarity among these celebrations is that they all occur shortly before the solemn period of fasting and penance during Lent, allowing people to indulge in rich and satisfying foods before abstaining for a religious purpose."},{"instruction":"What is the most logical next event?

Step-by-step reasoning process: An ostrich will not fit in the microwave. The question and answer:","output":"Question: Can you cook an ostrich in a microwave? Answer: No, you cannot cook an ostrich in a microwave. The rationale behind this statement is based on the following step-by-step reasoning process: 1. Size: An ostrich is a large bird, standing nearly 8-9 feet tall with an average weight of around 100-350 pounds. Considering the dimensions of a standard microwave, which typically range from 18-22 inches wide, 14-18 inches deep, and 10-14 inches tall, it's evident that an ostrich's size is far too large to fit inside a microwave. 2. Cooking method: Microwaves cook food by using electromagnetic waves that cause water molecules in the food to vibrate and generate heat. This method works well for small and medium-sized food items; however, for a large meat item like an ostrich, it would result in uneven cooking. The exterior might cook too quickly while the interior remains undercooked, posing a risk if consumed. An oven or rotisserie would be more suitable cooking methods for a large bird like an ostrich. 3. Food safety: Ostrich meat, like any other poultry, needs to be cooked to a safe internal temperature to kill any harmful bacteria. According to the USDA, the safe internal temperature for cooking poultry is 165°F (74°C). With the size and shape of an ostrich, a microwave would not be able to heat the meat uniformly to reach this safe temperature throughout. In conclusion, you cannot cook an ostrich in a microwave due to its size, the unsuitability of microwave cooking methods for a large bird, and the food safety concerns of cooking such a large item in a microwave."},{"instruction":"The fact that high school students watching something and taking pictures does not imply that the pictures are pretty.

Make this proper case.","output":"If you are elderly or have fragile skin, it is important to try and prevent a skin tear from occurring. Skin tears are common in older adults, and people with fragile skin may be more susceptible to these injuries. Prevention is crucial as it can lead to reduced pain, discomfort and risk of infections. Here are some detailed tips to help prevent skin tears in such individuals: 1. Maintain proper skin hydration: Dry skin is more prone to tears. Use gentle moisturizers daily, preferably after bathing, to keep your skin soft and supple. Avoid hot water as it can strip away the skin's natural oils. 2. Use gentle skin cleansers: Harsh soaps and body washes can further lead to dryness and irritation. Opt for mild, fragrance-free, and hydrating cleansers when bathing. 3. Wear protective clothing: Choose clothes that provide a barrier between your skin and potential hazards. Select garments that are made of soft materials with long sleeves and pant legs to provide optimum coverage. 4. Avoid tight clothing or accessories: Compression stockings, tight socks, and other constricting items can cause friction on the skin and contribute to tearing. Make sure to wear clothing that is comfortable and fits well without causing excessive pressure. 5. Wear padded protectors: Utilize cushioned arm and leg protectors that distribute pressure evenly and reduce friction against your fragile skin. 6. Keep your environment safe: Ensure that your surroundings are free of clutter and have proper lighting to reduce the likelihood of tripping and falling. Install grab bars or handrails in high-risk areas such as bathrooms or staircases. 7. Maintain a balanced diet: Consume foods that promote skin health, including those rich in vitamins A, C, and E, as well as protein and omega-3 fatty acids. 8. Stay hydrated: Drinking enough water keeps the skin hydrated from within and helps maintain skin elasticity, thus reducing the likelihood of skin tears. 9. Regular skincare routine: Incorporate a daily skincare routine to cleanse, moisturize, and assess your skin for any signs of damage, irritation, or potential issues. 10. Be gentle when handling the skin: Be cautious during daily activities, such as getting dressed, applying lotion, or handling objects, to minimize the risk of skin tears. 11. Consult with a healthcare professional: If you are concerned about the fragility of your skin or are experiencing recurrent skin tears, consult with a healthcare professional. They can provide additional guidance and recommendations tailored to your specific needs. Remember, prevention is the key to minimizing the risk of skin tears amongst elderly individuals or those with fragile skin. Implement these measures to promote healthier skin and reduce the chances of injuries."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and answer the question.

Born on January 8, 1935, in Tupelo, Mississippi, Presley moved to Memphis, Tennessee, with his family when he was 13 years old. He began his music career in 1954, working with legendary producer Sam Phillips at Sun Records. Colonel Tom Parker, born Andreas Cornelis van Kuijk, was a Dutch-born American talent manager best known for managing Presley's career from its early stages until the musician's death in 1977. The two began working together in 1955, and their partnership had a significant impact on the course of Presley's career. As a manager, Parker was strategic and influential, helping to guide Elvis to the top of the music industry. He secured major recording contracts, arranged lucrative performance deals, and skillfully marketed Presley to a worldwide audience. Some of the key moments in their partnership include Presley's contract with RCA Records, which resulted in the release of hits like \\"Heartbreak Hotel,\\" \\"Hound Dog,\\" and \\"Don't Be Cruel,\\" and his movie career, which produced more than 30 films with Presley in a leading role. Colonel Tom Parker was a controversial figure. While his actions and decisions as a manager played a critical role in Elvis Presley's superstardom, several people believe he exploited Presley, charging exorbitant fees for his services and making decisions that primarily served his own interests. For example, he signed deals that granted him an unusually high percentage of Presley's earnings—estimates range between 25 and 50 percent. Despite these criticisms, it is undeniable that Colonel Tom Parker's management played an essential role in shaping Elvis Presley's career and contributing to his lasting legacy as the \\"King of Rock and Roll.\\" The two remained together professionally until Presley's untimely death in 1977 at the age of 42.

The southernmost of the Scandinavian nations, it is south-west of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany. The Kingdom of Denmark also comprises two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark proper consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of 443 named islands, with the largest being Zealand, Funen and the North Jutlandic Island. The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate. Denmark has an area of , total area including Greenland and the Faroe Islands is , and a population of 5.75 million (). The unified kingdom of Denmark emerged in the 10th century as a proficient seafaring nation in the struggle for control of the Baltic Sea. Denmark, Sweden and Norway were ruled together under the Kalmar Union, established in 1397 and ending with Swedish secession in 1523. Denmark and Norway remained under the same monarch until outside forces dissolved the union in 1814. The union with Norway made it possible for Denmark to inherit the Faroe Islands, Greenland and Iceland. Beginning in the 17th century, there were several cessions of territory to Sweden. In the 19th century there was a surge of nationalist movements, which were defeated in the 1864 Second Schleswig War. Denmark remained neutral during World War I. In April 1940, a German invasion saw brief military skirmishes while the Danish resistance movement was active from 1943 until the German surrender in May 1945.

Hypothesis: Kubrick is not within his element with the fornicating satyrs and euphonious droning of the chosen music. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"The premise and the hypothesis appear to contradict each other in their assessments of whether Kubrick is in his element or not. In order to thoroughly investigate this, we need to delve deeper into the statement, the context, and the potential interpretations. Firstly, the premise sets up the scenario of Cruise's character moving through a scene filled with fornicating satyrs and satyrettes, accompanied by the music of Jocelyn Plook. This scene is described as a potential showcase for Kubrick's talents, implying that this particular combination of visuals and sounds is a fitting representation of his creative abilities and unique filmmaking style. The statement also highlights a certain level of comfort that Kubrick feels in crafting this kind of scene, where potentially controversial or provocative imagery meets equally experimental and captivating auditory inputs. On the other hand, the hypothesis counters the premise by stating that Kubrick is actually not within his element with the fornicating satyrs, suggesting that the visual design of the scene might not reflect his creative visions, interests, or strengths. This is further emphasized with the mention of the chosen music, implying that the integration of Jocelyn Plook's euphonious droning might not suit Kubrick's artistic intentions or preferences. The hypothesis insinuates that this scene fails to capture Kubrick's essence as a filmmaker and might not be the best fit for his cinematic language and interests. Analyzing both the premise and hypothesis, we observe that they present opposing views on whether Kubrick is in his element in this specific scene. The premise posits that the scene suits Kubrick's style and that he is comfortable in orchestrating it. Conversely, the hypothesis asserts that the combination of visuals and music is not aligned with Kubrick's artistic vision. In conclusion, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as they provide contrasting perspectives on Kubrick's disposition and relationship with the scene in question. In fact, they raise a complex and fascinating discussion about the nature of artistic creativity, subjective interpretation, and the interplay between different elements in a filmmaker's work. The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis may also be influenced by individual interpretations of Kubrick's body of work and personal creative style, thus leaving room for further debate."},{"instruction":"Generate an approximately fifteen-word sentence that describes all this data: Cocum eatType pub; Cocum priceRange moderate; Cocum customer rating 1 out of 5; Cocum familyFriendly yes","output":"At Cocum, a moderately-priced pub, customers rate it 1 out of 5 stars, but it remains family-friendly."},{"instruction":"But if there are many people like you, and especially if you are occupying space that might be occupied by a paying customer, the management will change the rules. Does it follow that \\"The management will be mad if you take up space that a paying customer wants and you refuse to buy anything.\\"?","output":"Yes, it does follow that \\"The management will be mad if you take up space that a paying customer wants and you refuse to buy anything.\\" Allow me to elaborate on the reasons and consequences of such a situation. Businesses, especially those in the hospitality and food industry, primarily rely on sales to generate revenue and profits. These establishments provide a comfortable environment, with resources like seating space, for customers to enjoy their products. However, they need to strike a delicate balance between offering a welcoming ambiance and efficiently utilizing the available space to serve as many paying customers as possible. When a person occupies space in a business establishment without making a purchase, they essentially inhibit the establishment's ability to provide service to other potential customers who intend to buy a product and contribute to the revenue. As a result, the management might feel frustrated or upset by this behavior, as it can lead to negative consequences: 1. Loss of potential revenue: In the short term, the establishment loses out on potential sales due to the absence of seating or space for additional customers who would have spent money on their products. 2. Customer dissatisfaction: Paying customers who cannot enjoy the services or find seating due to non-paying patrons occupying those spaces may leave the establishment with a negative impression, affecting their likelihood of returning in the future or recommending it to others. 3. Allocation of resources: Businesses also invest in staff, utilities, and other resources to maintain their premises. When non-paying patrons consume resources without generating income, it becomes an inefficient use of these investments and can strain the business financially. 4. Change in rules or policies: As you mentioned, if the issue of individuals occupying spaces without making purchases becomes pervasive, management may need to implement new rules or policies to address this concern. This could include strict time limits for customers or even requiring a minimum spend to access certain amenities, potentially making the environment less welcoming for all patrons. In conclusion, it does follow that \\"The management will be mad if you take up space that a paying customer wants and you refuse to buy anything.\\" This behavior not only directly impacts the business's financial performance but also compromises the ability of the establishment to maintain a positive experience for its customer base. To protect their businesses, maintain a good reputation, and foster a fair experience for all patrons, management might indeed get frustrated and take necessary action to curb or address such behavior."},{"instruction":"Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context?

This added heat may lead to the formation of more magma and molten rock, resulting in an increase in volcanic activity. As the heated magma rises through the cracks in the Earth's crust, additional pressure may be exerted on the tectonic plates, which could lead to more movement and the potential for more volcanic eruptions. This is because the increased heat can cause a reduction in the viscosity of the Earth's mantle, allowing for easier movement of molten rock beneath the Earth's surface. Increased heat can also cause the expansion of the Earth's crust. This expansion might lead to the opening of new cracks and fissures, allowing magma to rise to the surface more readily. As a result, this increase in heat could lead to a greater frequency and intensity of volcanic eruptions."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information: - A Jason Mraz Demonstration is the first EP by the singer / songwriter Jason Mraz .

The term 'several' implies a small but unspecified number of people. 2. \\"Outdoor event\\": This phrase suggests that the gathering or occasion is taking place outside of an enclosed space, meaning that it is happening in an open area such as a park, garden, or plaza. The word 'outdoor' highlights the fact that the event occurs in an external environment. 3. \\"Near a tent\\": This part of the sentence provides extra information about the specific location of the event, making it clear that the people are not only outside but also in proximity to a tent. Tents are typically used for temporary shelter or as a base for various activities at outdoor gatherings. Given these key pieces of information, it can be concluded that the people being referred-to in the original sentence are indeed located outside. Consequently, the sentence \\"People are outside.\\" stands as a true statement based on the information presented in the first sentence.

Water is added to the dry mixture to bind all the components together. In a concrete mixer, add the determined amount of water and then the concrete mix. You can also mix this in a wheelbarrow with a shovel. Use as little water as possible. Water makes the concrete more maneuverable but it also weakens the constitution of the final product. A drier mix makes the concrete more crack resistant. Turn on the machine. The mix will become smooth and consistent. Shut off the machine. You can sometimes get a truck to pour concrete straight into your form; otherwise, load it into wheelbarrows and tilt them into the form until the high point is reached. While doing this, enlist some helpers to spread out the concrete with shovels, rakes and \\"come alongs,\\" which is a special concrete rake. Starting at the uphill point, use a screeding tool to flatten out the wet concrete. Screeding involves jiggling a wide plank of wood back and forth, if possible immediately over the forms, to create a flat surface. Work your way from top to bottom, gently screeding until you have a flat surface. Your concrete surface won't be finished yet, but it will begin to look more complete and professional looking at this point. At this point, you should move fairly quickly as the concrete will set fast. Your floating process will contain two steps: Use a large floating device, also known as a bull float, to press down aggregate and help the cream (gravel-free concrete) rise to the surface. Do this by moving the bull float away from you, keeping the tailing edge slightly elevated, and then moving the bull float back towards you, keeping the leading edge slightly elevated. Use a magnesium hand float to go over the surface. After some of the water bleeds to the surface, use long sweeping motions with your hand float. Line up a plank as a straight edge to make periodic joints in the concrete. These joints will help the concrete withstand cracking due to temperature changes. Cut the joints about a quarter of the thickness of the concrete. Use a broom to sweep across the surface, creating designs. This will provide traction on the concrete so it is not as slippery when wet. A soft brush can also be used for a different texture that is less rough. For a smoother surface, but one that still has a pattern to it, you can use the trowel and slide it over the surface in a circular motion. Make sure the grooves are not so deep that water stands on the surface. Standing water will compromise the integrity of the concrete. If moving the broom over the concrete causes clumps of concrete to aggregate on your broom, it's too early to broom. Move over the concrete again with the magnesium floater to smooth out the pattern left by the broom, then try again later. Concrete should be left to cure for 28 days, with the initial day being the most critical. As soon as the concrete has been poured, professionals usually recommend sealing the concrete. The sealant will help the concrete cure, as well as prevent cracks and discoloration. Although concrete is often thought of an a no-hassle surface, it benefits from regular maintenance. Regular soap and water maintenance will help keep the concrete looking its best, while occasional seals (~ every five years) can help keep the concrete from getting damaged through use. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article is about how to mix and work with concrete. It tells us that we need to mix Portland cement, sand, and gravel with water to make concrete. Then, we can pour the concrete into a shape we want and smooth it out using special tools like a screed and a float. After that, we can add patterns or textures to the surface to make it less slippery when wet. Finally, we need to let the concrete dry and cure for 28 days, and it's a good idea to seal it to protect it from cracks and damage.

A primary school teacher who hit a six-year-old pupil on the head with a ruler in class has been cleared of assault. Rina Khan, 41, was accused of hitting the child so hard that it broke - as a punishment for getting a question wrong during a Maths lesson. On Tuesday, she went on trial at Birmingham Crown Court charged with common assault and child cruelty. Prosecutors said she 'flipped' and lost her temper before lashing out and also claimed she called the boy a 'muppet'. The court heard a teaching assistant watched in horror as part of the ruler 'flew across the room' after the incident on March 20 which left the Year 2 pupil 'sad and scared'. Ms Khan wept in the dock as she told the court yesterday that she only 'tapped' the boy on the head because he was misbehaving by poking another pupil with a pencil. And after less than an hour of deliberating today, a jury agreed with her version of events and cleared of her of all charges. Recorder John Edwards told Ms Khan: 'You have been found not guilty on both counts. You are discharged and you are free to go.' Outside court, Ms Khan spoke of her relief following her ordeal which saw her suspended from her job and taking anti-depressants. She said: 'I am just very relieved that the word was not guilty. This has been going in since March. 'I was suspended and I have been ill at home since. I have been taking anti-depressants and I had become somewhat of a recluse. 'And all this just for tapping a child on the head with a ruler. 'I do feel like I have been picked on. I'm not sure what I'm going to do next.' The court heard how the teacher had warned the child twice about poking another pupil with a pencil at the school, which cannot be named for legal reasons. She admitted to striking him on the head with the ruler but said she only did so gently and the ruler may have broken because it was weak. Jurors were also told the boy 'barely reacted at all' and was not injured during the incident. Giving evidence, Ms Khan, from Smethwick in the West Midlands, said: 'I have a duty of care to all my pupils. A jury Birmingham Crown Court, pictured, agreed with Ms Khan's version of events and cleared her of common assault and child cruelty charges. 'The pencil was quite sharp. It was going to hurt the girl. She was really trying so hard to work. 'I had a ruler in my hand at that time...and simply tapped him on the head. 'The ruler broke. I was really really shocked by that. I don't think I used any force. It was just a tap. 'I did call him a muppet but I did not use that word on that day. 'I used that word with my children sometimes but as a term of affection, just like The Muppets Show with the furry, little guys.'

Williams was also an outstanding fielder, especially in the difficult left field of Fenway Park in Boston, where he played his entire Major League career at that position. - Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players each, who take turns batting and fielding. - A right fielder, abbreviated RF, is the outfielder in baseball or softball who plays defense in right field. Right field is the area of the outfield to the right of a person standing at home plate and facing towards the pitcher's mound. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the right fielder is assigned the number 9. - In baseball, the pitcher is the player who throws the baseball from the pitcher's mound toward the catcher to begin each play, with the goal of retiring a batter, who attempts to either make contact with the pitched ball or draw a walk. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the pitcher is assigned the number 1. The pitcher is often considered the most important defensive player, and as such is situated at the right end of the defensive spectrum. There are many different types of pitchers, such as the starting pitcher, relief pitcher, middle reliever, lefty specialist, setup man, and closer. - Fenway Park is a baseball park located in Boston, at 4 Yawkey Way near Kenmore Square. Since 1912, it has been the home for the Boston Red Sox, the city's Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise. It is the oldest ballpark in MLB. Because of its age and constrained location in Boston's dense FenwayKenmore neighborhood, the park has been renovated or expanded many times, resulting in quirky heterogeneous features including \\"The Triangle\\" (below), \\"Pesky's Pole\\", and the Green Monster in left field. It is the fourth-smallest among MLB ballparks by seating capacity, second-smallest by total capacity, and one of eight that cannot accommodate at least 40,000 spectators. - The Boston Red Sox are an American professional baseball team based in Boston, Massachusetts. The Red Sox compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) East division. The Red Sox have won eight World Series championships and have played in 13. Founded in as one of the American League's eight charter franchises, the Red Sox' home ballpark has been Fenway Park since . The \\"Red Sox\\" name was chosen by the team owner, John I. Taylor, around , following the lead of previous teams that had been known as the \\"Boston Red Stockings\\", including the forerunner of the Atlanta Braves. - At the end of each Major League Baseball season, the league leaders of various statistical categories are announced. Leading the league in a particular category is referred to as a \\"title\\". - The Korean War (in South Korean , \\"Korean War\\"; in North Korean , \\"Fatherland Liberation War\\"; 25 June 1950 27 July 1953) began when North Korea invaded South Korea. The United Nations, with the United States as the principal force, came to the aid of South Korea. China came to the aid of North Korea, and the Soviet Union gave some assistance. - Darryl Eugene Strawberry , Sr. ( born March 12 , 1962 ) is an American former Major League Baseball right fielder and an ordained Christian minister and author . Strawberry is well known for his career in baseball and his controversial personal life . Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s , Strawberry was one of the most feared sluggers in the game , known for his prodigious home runs and his intimidating presence in the batter 's box with his 6 - foot - 6 frame and his long , looping swing that elicited comparisons to Ted Williams . During his 17 - year career , he helped lead the New York Mets to a World Series championship in 1986 and the New York Yankees to three World Series championships in 1996 , 1998 and 1999 . He was also suspended three times by Major League Baseball for substance abuse , leading to many narratives about his massive potential going unfulfilled . A popular player during his career , Strawberry was voted to the All - Star Game eight straight times from 1984 -- 1991 . Strawberry was formerly an analyst for SportsNet New York . His memoir , Straw : Finding My Way , written in collaboration with author John Strausbaugh , was published on April 28 , 2009 by Ecco Press , an imprint of HarperCollins publishers . - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. What is the relationship between 'darryl strawberry' and 'baseball player'?

Question: suppose pouring water into the carafe happens, how will it affect coffee being poured out of the machine. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","output":"More effect. When pouring water into the carafe is the initial step of the coffee-making process, it directly impacts the subsequent stages that lead to coffee being poured out of the machine. The amount of water poured into the carafe determines the amount of coffee that will be produced, as well as potentially affecting the strength and flavor of the coffee. This can be considered a perturbation that influences the second effect mentioned, which is the coffee being poured out of the machine. When the carafe is filled with water, this water is then poured into the coffee machine, where it is heated to the optimal brewing temperature. As the water is heated, it is forced through the coffee grounds that have been placed in the filter. The hot water extracts the flavors and oils from the ground coffee beans, ultimately resulting in brewed coffee. This is when the amount of water in the carafe plays a crucial role in the result. If more water is used than usual, the final coffee output could be greater, potentially leading to a larger volume or weaker coffee overall, depending on the ratio of water to ground coffee and how long the brewing process takes. If less water is used, the amount of coffee produced may be smaller, possibly resulting in a stronger or more concentrated brew. It is essential to maintain the appropriate water-to-grounds ratio to yield the desired strength and flavor for the final product. Furthermore, adding a bit of salt to the coffee grounds can help to enhance flavor, as salt can suppress bitterness and enhance the natural sweetness of the coffee. When the water passes through the grounds and the added salt, the salt dissolves in the brewing process, subtly altering the flavor profile of the brewed coffee. In summary, pouring water into the carafe has a significant effect on the coffee being poured out of the machine, as it directly impacts the volume and flavor of the final product. The perturbation (i.e., the amount of water poured into the carafe) influences the second effect mentioned (the coffee being poured out of the machine) by either increasing or decreasing the output and potentially altering the coffee's taste and strength."},{"instruction":"Write some highlights for the following article: Venus Williams continued her encouraging form with a 6-1 6-4 victory over Swiss Timea Bacsinszky.

This task involves understanding the properties and behaviors of different physical objects, as well as the engineering principles and design methods necessary to create a functional, stable, and durable bridge. 1. Preparation: Before starting the task, one needs to gather all required materials such as wooden or metal beams, connectors, adhesives, cutting tools, measuring tools, pencils, paper, and a base to build the structure on. Research potential bridge designs to understand which one would be the most suitable for the desired model. Factors to consider include span length, load-bearing capacity, and aesthetic preferences. 2. Design: Designing a model bridge requires knowledge of physical objects and their properties. For example, understanding how the materials chosen (wood, metal, or plastic) will behave under stress and what forces they can withstand is crucial. Draw up detailed blueprints of the selected bridge design, specifying measurements, angles, and placement of the components. Ensure adequate support is provided to the bridge through proper truss and support systems. 3. Material Selection: The choice of materials is vital to the success and stability of the bridge. Wood and metal have different strengths, weights, and flexibility properties. Choose materials based on their capacity to handle the planned load of the model bridge and how the materials will react to bending and compression forces. Select connectors that are strong and durable, often made from materials such as metal, plastic, or strong adhesives. 4. Construction: With the design and materials ready, the construction process begins. Carefully measure, mark, and cut the materials according to the design blueprint. Assemble the bridge components, making sure to check alignment and fit as you go. Using adhesives, nails, or screws, securely fasten the components together, ensuring the bridge remains stable and in the correct shape. 5. Testing: Once the model bridge is fully constructed, it's essential to test its strength, stability, and functionality. Load-bearing tests can be performed by gradually applying weight to the bridge, up to the design capacity. Observe the bridge's response to the load and note any deformation or signs of failure. This is a crucial step, as understanding how physical objects react under stress will help identify potential weaknesses or structural flaws in the design. 6. Evaluation and Refinement: If the bridge performs well during testing, its construction was successful. However, this task may require trial and error, and it might be necessary to make adjustments or improvements to the model after testing. Continuous evaluation and refinement of the design, materials, and construction techniques will help ensure the final model bridge is a stable, functional, and accurate representation of a real-life bridge. In conclusion, building a model bridge is a prime example of a task that requires knowledge of physical objects, as it demands a solid understanding of the properties and behaviors of various materials, engineering principles, and effective design methods. This knowledge is crucial in creating a bridge that is not only visually appealing but also structurally sound and capable of bearing the loads it was designed for."},{"instruction":"What is the most logical next event?

You saw Candy Crowley, Jessica Yellin, Jim Acosta and Brianna Keilar at election night headquarters, offering behind the scenes details about the candidates and campaigns as they anxiously awaited the verdict of the people. You saw Dana Bash dissecting the Senate and House outcomes as only someone can who has covered Congress for two decades. And you saw the maestro of the Magic Wall, John King, interpreting the tallies from decisive counties within the swing states minute by minute as they came in, telling you what they meant and how they would shape the electoral map. A lot has been written about how cable news has become increasingly dominated by talk and opinion, because that's what drives TV ratings. But as we began our planning for Election Night more than a year ago, CNN decided to go in the opposite direction and double down on our strength: reporting. We pared back on the number of analysts in our studio and sent more reporters into the field. We invested in new state-of-the-art sets in our Washington bureau that allowed us to display electoral data more clearly and vividly than we ever had before.

We asked our incomparable international reporters to keep track of what the rest of the world was saying about America's voteâ€”and we actually put them on our U.S. airwaves to talk about it. We did it because we value facts more than opinions, but also because these days that's what sets CNN apart. And we were glad to see that, for this historical night at least, it was what the public appeared to crave as well. An average of more than 8.8 million viewers watched the evening's coverage on our U.S. network, more than any other cable news network, and others followed it on CNN's international networks around the world. The reviews are also in, and they tell us that our investment in covering the election as journalists was welcomed. \\"CNN Destroys Cable Competition on Election Night,\\" was only one gratifying headline, on a post by Erik Wemple, the media critic for The Washington Post. At CNN.com, we had more than 203 million page views, the highest in four years. Our social media traffic on Twitter, Facebook and other sharing platforms set new records.

Nevertheless, neither dog (a corgi and a lhaso apso) would touch this stuff. YMMV. Answer: Answer:","output":"To determine whether this product review is positive, let's analyze its content step by step: 1. Read the title and the review text: The title says \\"Dogs would not touch it,\\" and the review narrates the experience of two dogs (a corgi and a lhaso apso) that wouldn't eat the dog treats. 2. Identify the tone and sentiment of the review: The tone seems straightforward, and the sentiment appears negative, as the dogs did not enjoy the product. 3. Check for any positive aspect: The reviewer mentions that their dogs are \\"persnickety\\" and \\"probably preferring people treats.\\" This statement might suggest that the issue might not be entirely related to the quality of the product. 4. Evaluate the overall sentiment: Despite the acknowledgment of their dogs' pickiness, the primary focus of the review is that the dogs did not like the product. Based on the analysis, the product review appears to be negative. The reviewer's dogs would not consume the treats, which implies dissatisfaction with the product. However, the reviewer acknowledges that other dogs' preferences might vary (indicated by the term \\"YMMV\\" or \\"Your Mileage May Vary\\")."},{"instruction":"Student: Test for natural language inference.

If yes, write \\"True\\", otherwise write \\"False\\". Question: how fire extinguisher works Suggestion: A British fire extinguisher with ID sign, call point and fire action sign Answer:","output":"False The proposed answer, \\"A British fire extinguisher with ID sign, call point and fire action sign,\\" does not correctly answer the question, \\"how fire extinguisher works\\". This suggestion seems to be describing the appearance or the specific components of a British-style fire extinguisher and not explaining the operational mechanism behind it. A correct answer should describe how a fire extinguisher functions. A fire extinguisher works by eliminating one or more elements needed for fire to exist, which are heat, oxygen and fuel, also known as the fire triangle. The exerted pressure inside the extinguisher pushes out a substance which can suppress the fire, usually a foam or powder. The discharged substance will aim to cool the burning fuel (thus removing the heat), to remove the supply of oxygen (so the fire cannot continue to burn) or to inhibit the chemical reaction making the fire. Different types of fire extinguishers offer different substances, for example, for a common class A fire (caused by solid materials such as wood or paper), water is usually used to cool the burning material and hence extinguish the fire. So, in this case, the suggested answer does not correctly respond to the question, making the answer \\"False\\"."},{"instruction":"Sentence: Alessio Romagnoli is a member of the Italian national under 17 football team and A.S.

However, recent years have witnessed a dramatic decline in two-way traffic on this once bustling border. This article will explore the underlying reasons for the decline in border activity and its impact on the local communities in both Jordan and Iraq. The Deserted Landscape The once teeming border of Jordan and Iraq is now characterized by its desolation. The windswept desert dunes on both sides of the boundary have a bleakness that permeates deeper due to the drastic drop in border crossings. The scarcity of people and goods crossing the border is a striking change from what was previously a hub of activity amid the vast, uninviting terrain. Culprits behind the Decline Various factors have contributed to the dwindling of two-way traffic between Jordan and Iraq. Key causes include: 1. Escalating security concerns: The emergence of extremist groups like ISIS in the region has led to widespread instability, spreading fear amongst individuals and businesses. The resulting militant clashes have rendered the borders unsafe and heavily militarized, discouraging people from traveling across the boundary. 2. Economic downturn: The ongoing economic slowdown in both Jordan and Iraq, coupled with lower oil prices, has diminished the incentive for trade between the two countries. Moreover, global sanctions imposed on Iraq have further stifled the nation's ability to engage in cross-border commercial activity. 3. The refugee crisis: The influx of refugees from war-torn countries such as Syria has put immense strain on Jordan's resources, leading the nation to enforce stricter border control measures to manage the situation. Impact on Local Communities The decrease in border traffic has left local communities on both sides of the boundary struggling to adapt. Many families who once relied on cross-border trade or tourism for their livelihood now find their businesses faltering. The lack of economic opportunities has led to increased unemployment, financial hardship, and even forced migration for some communities. Looking Forward Addressing the issues that have led to the deteriorating state of the Jordan-Iraq border is paramount for the future growth and stability of the region. Fostering a more secure environment by addressing extremist threats and regional instability is critical for restoring confidence in border crossings. Additionally, stimulating economic growth and lifting trade restrictions can help revive the moribund commercial activities between the two countries. Conclusion Jordan's bleak, windswept border with Iraq may currently be experiencing a low point in two-way traffic, but there is hope for improvement in the future. By tackling the security, economic, and humanitarian challenges present in the region, it is possible to rekindle the sense of vibrancy and cooperation that once existed between the two neighbors. Only by addressing these issues can the local communities rebuild and thrive again on both sides of the border."},{"instruction":"Write a short summary for this text: us president george w. bush warned thursday that efforts to disarm baghdad peacefully will end in \`\` weeks , not months , '' and cautiously said he would welcome exile for iraqi leader saddam hussein .","output":"U.S. President George W.

However, a few minutes later, a second son is born. Colbert (Walter Kingsford), the king's trusted adviser, persuades the king to secretly send the second child, Philippe, away to Gascony to be raised by his majesty's dear friend, d'Artagnan (Warren William), in order to avert a possible civil war later. Fouquet (Joseph Schildkraut), a mere cardinal's messenger at the time, finds out about the twin and uses this to advance his career. Twenty years later, he is the Minister of Finance under Louis XIV. The king is hated by the commoners for levying oppressive taxes and for executioning them for not paying them. Fouquet sends soldiers to force d'Artagnan and his people to pay the taxes, though the old king had exempted him and his village from them. They are driven off, but return in much greater numbers and, with great difficulty, capture d'Artagnan, the three musketeers and Philippe. Louis is about to order their executions when Colbert tells him about Philippe's uncanny resemblance to him. As Louis is aware of an assassination attempt to take place that day (but not where or when), he makes Philippe impersonate him in exchange for his friends' lives. Philippe not only survives the ambush, he shows mercy to his would-be killers and is cheered by the people.

Meanwhile, in the same neighborhood, there was a little girl named Susie, who was Rebecca's child. She enjoyed drawing and painting beautiful pictures but didn't like math as much as Tommy did. This difference happened because Natalie noticed how much Tommy liked counting things, so she started teaching him math at a young age.

We have to find the value of \\"z\\" in this equation: 236*z - 588*z - 16086 = 496*z - 82*z First, let's add up the \\"z\\" terms on each side of the equation (these are the numbers with the letter \\"z\\" next to them). On the left side, we have: 236*z - 588*z = (236 - 588)*z = -352*z On the right side, we have: 496*z - 82*z = (496 - 82)*z = 414*z Now, our equation looks like this: -352*z - 16086 = 414*z Next, we want to move all the \\"z\\" terms to one side of the equation and all the number terms to the other side. To do that, we'll add 352*z to both sides of the equation. This will cancel out the -352*z on the left side: -352*z + 352*z - 16086 = 414*z + 352*z This simplifies to: -16086 = 766*z Now, we want to isolate the \\"z\\" by itself. To do that, we'll divide both sides by 766: -16086 / 766 = 766*z / 766 After dividing, we get: z = -21 So, the value of \\"z\\" in this equation is -21.

Question: suppose there is no food stuck in the jets happens, how will it affect soapy water will be sprayed on the dishes. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If there is no food stuck in the jets, this would result in an efficient and unhindered spraying process, and, consequently, the soapy water will be more effectively sprayed on the dishes. The supposed perturbation enhances the efficiency of the water jets which in turn increases the effectiveness of the cleaning process. This improvement has a positive influence on the second effect mentioned, which is the shooting of water through the jets to clean the dishes. Since there is no blockage due to food particles, the water jets can effectively spray the soapy water onto the entirety of the dishes. This allows for a more thorough cleaning, effectively reaching all corners and edges of the dishes, and ensuring the removal of any grime, dirt, or residual food particles. As a result, the overall dishwashing capabilities are enhanced as the dishwasher can not only clean more efficiently but also potentially minimize the need for a manual pre-wash or post-wash intervention.
