You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which best determines the health of a lake used as a source of freshwater?  Your answer:","output":"There are numerous factors that are used to determine the health of a lake used as a source of freshwater. These include biological, chemical, and physical parameters. It is important to monitor all these parameters over time because it gives a more comprehensive understanding of the overall health of the lake and its ability to sustain life, perform water purification services, maintain a balanced ecosystem, and provide clean and safe water for human consumption. 1. Biological Parameters: These refer to the living organisms in the lake. The presence and types of certain organisms, from microorganisms to fish, can indicate the health of a lake. For example, some types of algae can grow excessively and produce toxic compounds as a response to pollution. The abundance of certain fishes and aquatic plants can also indicate whether a lake is healthy or not. Biodiversity is a key element and a rich variety of species often indicates a healthy lake. 2. Chemical Parameters: The quality of water is heavily determined by its chemical composition, including parameters like pH, dissolved oxygen, and nutrient concentrations among others.     - pH measures how acidic or basic the water is. Most aquatic organisms have adapted to live within specific pH ranges. Any significant change in acidity can influence the health of these organisms and thereby the overall health of the lake.     - Dissolved oxygen is important for the survival of fish and other aquatic organisms. Low levels can be a sign of pollution and poor health.     - Nutrient concentration, particularly that of nitrogen and phosphorus, is relevant because an excess of these nutrients from runoff can lead to eutrophication, a condition characterized by excessive growth of algae and other aquatic plants, which can deplete the oxygen in water and harm fish populations. 3. Physical Parameters: Physical parameters like temperature, clarity, water levels, and sediments provide important details about the health of a lake.     - The temperature of the lake can affect the types of organisms that can survive as each species has its optimal temperature range. Climate change may influence lake temperature and hence its health.     - Turbidity or water clarity is a simple measure of how clear the water is, which can affect the amount of light penetration and consequently photosynthesis by aquatic plants.    - Water levels could indicate whether there's enough water to support life. If it's too high, it could lead to flooding, while if it's too low, it could damage aquatic habitats.    - Sedimentation can harm a lake's health by creating an environment conducive to harmful algae blooms and by smothering benthic habitats where many organisms live. 4. Human activity: The use of the lake and its surroundings by humans can also influence its health. Pollution, whether it is from industrial waste, agricultural runoff, or residential sewage, is a significant determinant of a lake’s health. Similarly, activities like fishing, boating, and tourism can impact a lake's ecosystem. In summary, determining the health of a lake used as a fresh water source requires a comprehensive evaluation of biological, chemical, and physical parameters, and human activity. Quantitative and qualitative assessments conducted over time are necessary for accurate readings, as lake health can fluctuate due to seasonal and weather changes, as well as human influence. Regular monitoring and conservation efforts can help maintain the health of a lake and the life it supports."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The tape recorder holds sentimental value, as it carries the voices of his father and mother, both of whom were avid explorers and narrators of their own expeditions. With the guidance of his parents' voices, Ashley embarks on a journey to confront his fears and anxieties and to honor their memory. An unexpected opportunity arises when Ashley learns about a diverse group of wanderers preparing to embark on a challenging trek across the Australian outback. They are searching for the legendary \\"Lost Oasis,\\" a mysterious, hidden paradise spoken of in ancient aboriginal tales. Spurred by his parents' past and the need to forge his own path, Ashley finally decides to join the group with nothing more than the tape recorder and a few basic supplies. The group, consisting of Olga, an experienced but unorthodox explorer, Mark, a burly Australian outdoorsman with a secret, and Lily, a gifted wildlife photographer, welcomes Ashley with mixed emotions. The group's reservations are apparent, but they accept him out of respect for his parents, well-known Australian adventurers who had vanished during an earlier search for the Lost Oasis. As they journey through the harsh and breathtaking landscapes of the Australian outback, Ashley grows into his role amongst the group. He becomes the unofficial emotional support provider in times of conflict and stress. Throughout the trip, Ashley frequently listens to the tapes filled with his parents' voices. He shares their wisdom, advice, and anecdotes with the group, helping them navigate through treacherous paths and hostile situations. Along the way, the group encounters numerous obstacles, including venomous snakes, sandstorms, and territorial native tribes. Through these trials, Ashley's tape recorder becomes a symbol of strength and unity for the group, bringing them closer together and solidifying their bonds. As the group ventures deeper into the uncharted territory of the outback, they unravel the story behind his parents' disappearance and the true nature of the Lost Oasis. As the final piece of the puzzle falls into place, the group unexpectedly stumbles upon the Lost Oasis. It is not a tangible oasis of water, but a metaphor for the power of human resilience and connection amidst adversity. Ashley realizes that his journey was never about finding an elusive paradise, but about discovering the strength within himself and honoring his parents' spirit of adventure. With the support and friendship of his new family, Ashley returns home and starts a travel blog, sharing his experiences and his parents' tapes with the world. He unwittingly becomes a symbol of hope for those seeking to overcome their fears, and the tape recorder: a beacon of inspiration that proves the impact we leave behind echoes through time, much like the echoes of the outback."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Chloroplasts contain the green pigment chlorophyll, and animals lack chloroplasts. Given these facts, what do animals lack among the following options: - hearts  - skin cells  - h2o  - the body's largest organ  - organic matter  - characteristics  - green pigment chlorophyll  - Chemical energy Answer:","output":"Among the given options, animals lack green pigment chlorophyll. Since animals do not possess chloroplasts, which are the cellular structures that contain chlorophyll, they cannot engage in the process of photosynthesis like plants do. The green pigment chlorophyll plays a crucial role in capturing light energy and converting it into chemical energy during photosynthesis. This chemical energy is stored in the form of glucose, which serves as an essential source of energy for the plant's growth and sustenance. In contrast, animals obtain their energy through consuming other organisms, either directly or indirectly. Instead of producing their own glucose via photosynthesis, animals consume plants or other animals to access the nutrients and energy they require to survive and maintain their bodily functions. In this way, animals depend on chlorophyll-containing plant life for sustenance, despite not housing the green pigment themselves. As for the other options provided: - Hearts: Animals typically have some form of circulatory system, with many possessing a heart that pumps blood throughout their bodies, supplying oxygen and nutrients to their cells. - Skin cells: Animals have skin cells that form a protective barrier shielding the body from external harm and assisting in the regulation of body temperature and moisture. - H2O: Animals, like all living organisms, require water (H2O) to maintain their vital life processes. Water is essential for numerous cellular functions and biochemical reactions. - The body's largest organ: Animals have various organs, and the largest is usually the skin, which serves to protect, regulate, and maintain homeostasis within the organism. - Organic matter: Animals are composed of organic matter, including carbon-based molecules that constitute their cells and tissues. - Characteristics: Animals possess many distinct characteristics and features, which are typically linked to their evolutionary adaptations and ecological niche. - Chemical energy: Animals do not produce their own chemical energy through photosynthesis like plants do. However, they obtain chemical energy from consumed food, which is then utilized for various bodily functions. In summary, animals lack the green pigment chlorophyll, as they do not contain chloroplasts. This pigment is essential for plants in the process of photosynthesis, which is how plants produce chemical energy. Animals, on the other hand, obtain their energy and nutrients through consuming plants or other animals, not through photosynthesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: The king strolled through his back courtyard, where was near? Possible A: palace, garden, country estate, large house, suburbs  Why is \\"palace\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"The answer \\"palace\\" is aligned with human common sense because the word \\"king\\" typically suggests a royal context. Conventionally, a king resides in a palace which is more than just a personal residence - it's the administrative headquarters of a monarchy. Therefore, it is common sense to associate a king with a palace.  There are multiple indications in the question to confirm this. First, it mentions \\"his back courtyard,\\" which implies a large, complex structure rather than a simple house. This is more in line with a palace. Second, the king is described as \\"strolling,\\" which suggests he is in a familiar, possibly residential, setting. The other options may also make sense, given that a king may also spend time in other affluent settings such as a \\"country estate\\" or a \\"large house\\". However, these are less immediate connections than a palace, because they imply specific leisurely or residential circumstances and are not the 'default' residence of a king in the way a palace would be. Finally, \\"garden\\" could be near but it's not a living area. And \\"suburbs\\" implies a densely populated residential area which is not typically associated with a king's living quarters.  So, based on typical associations and implications in the question, \\"palace\\" is the most aligned with human common sense as an answer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

But honesty is very important to me , and although I can forgive dishonesty , I need some reason to forgive , some indication that it was a mistake that wo n't happen again . Tonight I shared this sentiment with her . Why may they have a discussion with her about honesty ?","output":"The person may have initiated a discussion with her about honesty due to several possible reasons. These reasons could range from wanting to establish trust in their relationship, providing a safe space to address any underlying issues, or promoting an open line of communication for future conversations. Below, I delve into the possible explanations in more detail. 1. Building trust: Trust is a crucial foundation to any relationship, whether it's a personal or professional one. By discussing the importance of honesty, the individual may want to emphasize the need for openness and transparency, allowing both parties to feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and emotions. This may be a way for them to build trust and create a solid foundation for their relationship. 2. Addressing past incidents: There may have been a prior incident where dishonesty was present, and the person wants to clear the air to prevent any lingering negative effects or misunderstandings. By discussing their preference for honesty and their willingness to forgive, the individual may want to encourage her to open up about anything that previously happened, with the hopes of resolving any outstanding issues. 3. Establishing expectations: By sharing their sentiment about honesty, the person may want to communicate their expectations within the relationship. This could include a mutual understanding of being truthful with each other, sharing genuine feelings, and holding one another accountable. This conversation may serve as a reference point for future discussions, wherein both parties understand what is expected from each other in terms of honesty. 4. Offering support and understanding: The individual may want to emphasize their ability to forgive dishonesty, provided there is a reason and an assurance that it won't happen again. By doing so, they may be trying to create a safe environment for her to share any concerns, fears, or reasons she might have had for being dishonest in the past. This could signal their willingness to listen and empathize, ultimately fostering a deeper connection between them. 5. Personal growth: It's possible that the person has had their own experiences with dishonesty, either by being dishonest themselves or being on the receiving end of dishonest behavior. By sharing their preference for honesty, they may want to impart the value and importance of truthfulness that they have learned from their own journey. This conversation might act as a way to grow and learn together, creating an even stronger bond. In conclusion, the person may have initiated a discussion with her about honesty for a variety of reasons, such as building trust, addressing past incidents, establishing expectations, offering support and understanding, and fostering personal growth. Ultimately, the conversation may serve as an avenue to nurture and strengthen their relationship by promoting trust, understanding, and openness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the premise \\"hm a little much yes we have uh we're a town of five thousand and so our local newspaper is not too swift\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"The population of our town is five thousand.\\" is true?","output":"Based on the given premise, \\"hm a little much yes we have uh we're a town of five thousand and so our local newspaper is not too swift\\", we can extract some information that may help us in evaluating the hypothesis \\"The population of our town is five thousand.\\" Firstly, let us analyze the premise in detail. It appears to be a somewhat casual statement, with phrases like \\"hm\\", \\"uh\\", and \\"a little much\\" being used. Nevertheless, the speaker does explicitly mention \\"we're a town of five thousand,\\" which suggests that the population of the town they are referring to is indeed 5,000. However, it's crucial to consider that the context of the statement also mentions the local newspaper not being \\"too swift.\\" While this information doesn't directly impact the evaluation of the given hypothesis, it may provide some context about the speaker's perception of their town and its resources. It is important to ask why the speaker is mentioning the fact about the newspaper, and whether that fact has any bearing on the speaker's credibility or reliability in discussing the population. Another consideration is the possibility that the speaker is not a reliable source or may be mistaken. The casual nature of the statement brings into question the speaker's seriousness when providing this figure for the population of their town. It's important to consider corroborating evidence or additional sources to verify the speaker's claim as it's possible that, while the statement gives an indication of the hypothesis, it may have inaccuracies. In summary, the premise, \\"hm a little much yes we have uh we're a town of five thousand and so our local newspaper is not too swift\\", does seem to support the hypothesis that \\"The population of our town is five thousand.\\" However, the hypothesis should not be accepted as entirely true without taking into account the casual nature of the statement and the credibility of the speaker. Further investigation and additional sources can help in more definitively determining the accuracy of the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Input: Famed novelist Paul Sheldon (James Caan) is the author of a successful series of Regency romance novels featuring a character named Misery Chastain. Wanting to focus on more serious stories, he writes a manuscript for a new novel that he hopes will launch his post-Misery career. While traveling from Silver Creek, Colorado to his home in New York City, he is caught in a blizzard and his car goes off the road, rendering him unconscious. Paul is rescued by a nurse named Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates), who brings him to her remote home. When Paul regains consciousness he finds himself bedridden, with both his legs broken as well as a dislocated shoulder. Annie claims she is his \\"number one fan\\" and talks a lot about him and his novels. As a reward for saving him, Paul gives Annie his new manuscript. While feeding him, she is angered by the profanity in the new manuscript and spills soup on him but apologizes. She buys a copy of Paul's most recently published book, Misery's Child, giving him praise. However, when she discovers that Misery dies at the end of the book, she flies into a rage. She reveals that she lied about calling his agent and the authorities; nobody knows where he is. Paul tries to escape from his room, but she has locked the door.The next morning, Annie forces Paul to burn his latest manuscript. When he is well enough to get out of bed, she insists he write a new novel titled Misery's Return, in which he brings the character back to life. Paul complies, believing Annie might kill him otherwise. He also tells her he will use Annie's name in the book in appreciation of her nursing him back to health. When the first few chapters show continuity errors, Annie chides him angrily and forces him to start again. One day, Paul sneaks out when Annie is away and begins stockpiling his painkillers. He tries poisoning Annie during dinner, but fails. Paul later finds a scrapbook of newspaper clippings about Annie's past. He discovers that she was suspected and tried for the deaths of several infants, but the trial collapsed due to lack of evidence. Annie had quoted lines from his Misery novels during her trial. Annie later drugs Paul and straps him to the bed. When he wakes, she tells him that she knows he has been out of his room and breaks his ankles with a sledgehammer to prevent him from escaping again.[6]The local sheriff, Buster (Richard Farnsworth), is investigating Paul's disappearance. When a shopkeeper informs the sheriff he has sold Annie considerable quantities of typing paper, Buster pays Annie a visit. When he finds Paul drugged in the basement, Annie fatally shoots Buster and tells Paul that they must die together. He agrees, on the condition that he must finish the novel in order to \\"give Misery back to the world\\". He then conceals a can of lighter fluid in his pocket.When the book is done, he reminds Annie it is his practice to have a single cigarette and a glass of champagne after finishing a novel. After he gets them, Paul sets the manuscript on fire, giving him the chance to hit Annie over the head with the typewriter. Paul and Annie fight and Annie is killed.Eighteen months later, Paul, now walking with a cane, meets his publishing agent Marcia (Lauren Bacall) in a restaurant in New York City. The two discuss his first non-Misery novel. Marcia tells him about the positive early buzz which Paul does not care about, saying he wrote the novel for himself. Marcia asks if he would consider a non-fiction book about his captivity, but Paul declines. While at the restaurant, he imagines the waitress as Annie. The waitress says she is his \\"number one fan\\", to which Paul uncomfortably responds \\"That's very sweet of you\\".

Options: - child's hand - pool table - street - toy box - soccer field  Explain why a human would choose \\"pool table\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"pool table\\" to answer the question above because it is the most appropriate, logical, and contextually relevant option among the given choices. The central idea of the question is to identify an environment or a setting where a ball is hit with a stick, subsequently causing the movement or interaction of other balls. First, let us analyze the other options: 1. Child's hand: Hitting a ball with a stick in a child's hand is neither safe nor a suitable context for the activity in question. It could cause harm or injury to the child and is not an environment specifically designed for this type of interaction between balls. 2. Street: While it is possible that one might hit a ball with a stick into other balls on the street, it is not the most ideal environment for this activity. Streets are usually busy with traffic and pedestrians, making such an activity dangerous and inappropriate in such a setting. 3. Toy box: A toy box is a container where toys are stored, and although it might contain balls, it is not specifically designed for the activity of hitting a ball with a stick into other balls. A toy box is usually small and overcrowded and would not provide enough space for the balls to move and interact as intended. 4. Soccer field: While a soccer field is designed for interaction between players and a ball, the main activity in soccer is kicking the ball and not hitting it with a stick. Moreover, a soccer field is designed for a specific game that does not involve hitting a ball into other balls using a stick. Now, let us examine the option of a pool table: A pool table is explicitly designed for the game of pool, also known as billiards or cue sports. In this game, participants utilize a stick called a cue to strike cue balls into other object balls. The objective of most pool games is to hit a cue ball with the stick in a way that it makes contact with the other balls and subsequently pockets them into one of the six holes located at the corners and sides of the table. Pool tables are crafted to provide a smooth and level playing surface, typically covered in cloth, that ensures predictable and controlled movement of the balls. The bounds of the table are marked with cushions or rails, which ideally provide consistent rebound properties for the balls, enabling precise shots and strategic play. The design and purpose of the pool table make it the perfect environment for hitting a ball with a stick into other balls, satisfying the requirements of the question. Therefore, among the provided options, a human would choose \\"pool table\\" as the correct answer because it is specifically designed for the activity of hitting a ball with a stick into other balls, and it provides the most appropriate and purposeful setting for such an interaction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - jail - internet cafe - blacksmith's shop - building - bar The answer is:","output":"The most suitable option to answer the question \\"Where can the legs of a stool be built?\\" is a blacksmith's shop.  A blacksmith's shop is a place where a blacksmith, a skilled artisan who works with metal, operates. Blacksmiths specialize in manipulating, shaping, and joining various metals, such as iron, steel, and copper, to create tools, hardware, furniture, and various decorative and functional items. Some blacksmiths may even specialize in a specific type of work, such as ornamental or architectural metalwork. In the context of the question, it is essential to evaluate the other options and why they are not suitable: 1. Jail: A jail or detention center is a place where people who have been accused or convicted of crimes are held. Jails are primarily designed to hold, secure, and rehabilitate individuals, not to provide facilities for manufacturing or creating items. While there may be some instances where inmates participate in crafting or work programs, the primary purpose of a jail is not manufacturing, making it an unsuitable option. 2. Internet cafe: An internet cafe is a public establishment where customers can access the internet, usually for a fee. These cafes often provide computers for customers' use and may serve beverages and light snacks. While an internet cafe could potentially be a place for people to research or design the stool's plans, it is not a location where the actual manufacturing or assembly would take place. 3. Building: A general building could refer to any structure with a roof and walls, making this option's context vague. While it is possible that some kind of workshop or production area could be located within a building, this option's ambiguity doesn't provide enough information to determine whether the building has the necessary resources and equipment to fabricate the legs of a stool. 4. Bar: A bar is an establishment where alcoholic beverages are served and consumed. It is primarily a social establishment, focused on providing an environment for patrons to relax, socialize, and enjoy drinks and food. While a bar may have stools, it is not a place where manufacturing or construction of furniture takes place. In conclusion, a blacksmith's shop is the most suitable option for the location where the legs of a stool can be built. The shop is equipped with the necessary tools, equipment, and skilled artisans to create durable and functional metal legs for a stool. Furthermore, the environment and purpose of a blacksmith's shop directly align with the fabrication of metalwork and other functional items."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Question: Why did Axel want Pia to return to Germany? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Walk on Water Context: Eyal is an agent in Mossad, the Israeli security service. He is a hitman who targets enemies of Israel. His wife has recently committed suicide, and the agency decides that he needs to take on a less challenging assignment: to find an aging Nazi war criminal and get him \\"before God does\\". In order to track down the old man, Eyal poses as a tour guide and befriends the Nazi's adult grandchildren, Axel and Pia. Pia lives on a kibbutz, an Israeli commune. Her brother Axel visits her in order to convince Pia to return to Germany for their father's seventieth birthday. It is later revealed that Pia's estrangement with her parents began when she discovered that they were hiding her grandfather. She shares this information with Axel. Although he has a job to perform, Eyal truly befriends Axel and Pia. Axel and Pia are decent people who demonstrate that most Germans have gotten beyond the hatred that led to the Holocaust. They spend time together and Eyal enjoys himself, even if he would not openly admit so. His friendship with Axel allows him to display some humanity, letting down his tough-guy machismo. Eyal and Axel even take a mud bath by the Dead Sea, showering off together in the nude afterward. When the three are at dinner one night in a Tel Aviv restaurant, Axel speaks privately to the Palestinian waiter, Rafik, and finds out where the best club in town is. Later that evening, Axel, Pia, and Eyal arrive at the club. Eyal is shocked to discover that it is a gay club. He sees Axel dancing with Rafik and is taken aback.

The problem is the school is giving the seventh graders inappropriate material and not explaining it to the parents,\\" she said.      Horalek said she wants the unedited version of \\"Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl,\\" which became part of the curriculum this year, removed from the school.      The school should have at least sent a letter home to parents, she said, similarly to how it's done for other sensitive material.      \\"If they watch any kind of movie with a swear word in it, I have to sign a permission slip,\\" she said.      Horalek said every parent she has spoken to was not aware of the passages in the unedited version that describe the female body, which her daughter brought to her attention on April 12.      \\"She had two books to choose from and she chose 'The Diary of Anne Frank' and I thought that was awesome,\\" she said.      After the class had been reading it for a week, Horalek said her daughter told her she didn't want to read the book anymore because it made her uncomfortable. Horalek thought it might be because of the book's depressing nature in regards to the Holocaust. But her daughter said that wasn't why and gave Horalek the page numbers for the graphic passages.      This particular material is inappropriate for seventh grade students to read, especially without their parents' knowledge, Horalek said.      \\"It doesn’t mean my child is sheltered, it doesn’t mean I live in a bubble, and it doesn’t mean I'm tyring to ban books,\\" she said.      Horalek said her daughter approached her teacher about the passages with two other students, but the teacher didn't seem concerned. Horalek emailed the teacher about what was happening.      \\"I told her I understood that they're reading the book,\\" she said.      However, Horalek said she told her daughter she didn't have to read it, and the teacher gave her permission to switch books.      The teacher advised Horalek to fill out a form for a formal complaint to which the teacher had five days to respond. If the parent is not happy with the response, the form goes to the principal who has another five days to respond. After that it goes to the school board, which does not have a time frame in which to respond, Horalek said.      Not wanting the issue to continue before reaching the school board's attention, Horalek said she emailed Robert Behnke, assistant superintendent for Instructional Services, telling him she had started the formal complaint process.

Until I was eleven or twelve, I didn't realize there was a second set of labia on the inside, since you couldn't see them. What's even funnier is that I thought urine came out of the clitoris…When you're standing up, all you see from the front is hair. Between your legs there are two soft, cushiony things, also covered with hair, which press together when you're standing, so you can't see what's inside. They separate when you sit down and they're very red and quite fleshy on the inside. In the upper part, between the outer labia, there's a fold of skin that, on second thought, looks like a kind of blister. That's the clitoris.\\"      Response from Northville Schools:            Maurielle Lue,      Thank you for contacting me regarding a concern that was raised with you relative to the use of Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl, a book used within the seventh grade English Language Arts Curriculum. Northville Public Schools uses an established process to review concerns brought forth related to instructional materials used within our schools. Parents are considered partners in their children's learning and when concerns surface they are encouraged to communicate with the classroom teacher and building principal to resolve those issues. If the parent is not satisfied with the response at the building level, a committee consisting of parents, teachers, media specialists, and administrators will be assembled to review the concerns expressed by the parent using the Citizen's Request for Reconsideration of Materials Procedure.

The Anne Frank Diary is 'pornographic' according to one mother who has lodged a formal complaint over the book being used in school to educate her own child.      Mom, Gail Horalek, has filed a formal complaint against her daughter's school district over its use of the Anne Frank Diary, saying that many of the passages contained in the book are far too graphic for seventh graders like her daughter.      The mother highlights one part of the book in which Frank discusses discovering her genitalia, and Horalek has said it is akin to pornography, and is completely inappropriate for her child and her schoolmates.      She has complained that Meads Mill Middle School should have asked parents to sign a permission slip before they assigned the book to the children to read, due to the content.      She has said, \\"The problem is the school is giving the seventh graders inappropriate material and not explaining it to the parents,\\" according to the Northville Patch.      Horalek has explained that the school has sent permission slips home for parents to sign when they have looked to use various other books and films that may contain strong material that some could deem \\"inappropriate.\\"      The mother said, \\"If they watch any kind of movie with a swear word in it, I have to sign a permission slip.\\"      Other parents she has spoken to were unaware of the content in some of the passages, she claims. The mother admits that she only found out herself about the passages when her daughter came to her saying that she felt uncomfortable about the content of the book she was reading for school.      Horalek has now demanded that the book be removed from the curriculum: \\"It doesn't mean my child is sheltered, it doesn't mean I live in a bubble and it doesn't mean I'm trying to ban books.\\"      The Anne Frank Diary in fact comes in different versions, with an uncensored version and a full version. Horalek's school district used the uncensored version.      In another incident in 2010, Culpeper County public school in Virginia stopped assigning the uncensored version due to some of the content in the full version of the diary. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"In Northville, a mom named Gail Horalek said that her seventh-grade child's school should have asked parents for permission before giving the students a book to read.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Question 1: Should I wait thinking she was the one? It's important to understand that relationships and connections with people are complex and uncertain. Believing that someone is \\"the one\\" might create heightened expectations within the relationship, and this can lead to disappointment or dissatisfaction if these expectations are not met. Instead, it's helpful to approach relationships with an open and flexible mindset that encourages growth and adaptation. Here are a few factors you may want to consider: 1. Communication: Honest and open communication is essential for any healthy relationship. If you haven't already, discuss your feelings and expectations with the person in question, and actively listen to their perspective as well. 2. Compatibility: While it's normal for people to have differences, it's important to share values, beliefs, and interests to help foster a strong connection. Assess how compatible you are in these areas, as well as how willing you both are to compromise and grow together. 3. Emotional support: A strong relationship is built on mutual emotional support. Reflect on whether you both genuinely care for and support each other's emotional wellbeing. 4. Trust and respect: Trust and respect are crucial components of any relationship. Consider whether you can truly rely on one another and respect each other's boundaries, feelings, and decisions. 5. Timing: Sometimes, even if you believe someone is \\"the one,\\" life circumstances might make the relationship difficult or unrealistic at this point in time. Reflect on whether now is the right time for both of you to pursue a relationship or whether it might be best to wait and reassess in the future. Question 2: What are the Properties of matter waves? Matter waves, also known as de Broglie waves, are a concept from quantum mechanics that describe the wave-like behavior of particles. According to the wave-particle duality principle, particles have both wave-like and particle-like properties. The de Broglie wavelength is associated with the wave-like properties of particles, and it's inversely proportional to their momentum. Here are some key properties of matter waves: 1. Wavelength: The de Broglie wavelength (λ) of a particle is related to its momentum (p) by the following equation: λ = h/p, where h is the Planck constant. This means that the wavelength of a matter wave is inversely proportional to the momentum of the associated particle. 2. Wavefunction: Matter waves can be described by a wavefunction, which is a mathematical representation of the probability amplitude of a particle's position or other physical properties. The wavefunction provides essential information about a particle's behavior, and its square represents the probability density. 3. Interference: Like other waves, matter waves can interfere with each other, which means that they can combine to form new wave patterns (constructive and destructive interference) based on phase relationships. 4. Diffraction: Matter waves also exhibit diffraction, which is the bending or spreading of waves as they encounter obstacles or slits. This behavior is observed in experiments such as the double-slit experiment, in which particles like electrons or photons demonstrate wave-like properties. 5. Tunneling: Due to their wave-like nature, particles can also exhibit a phenomenon called quantum tunneling, wherein a particle can pass through a potential barrier that would be impossible to overcome based on classical physics. To answer your third question, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 focuses on interpersonal relationships and decision-making, while question 2 deals with a scientific concept from quantum mechanics.

In the sentence, there is a comparison being drawn between the ease of moving the desk and the dresser. To reconcile this with the options, it is logical to conclude the comparative ease of moving the desk is due to its relative lightness. Therefore, option 1 \\"desk was light\\" is the appropriate completion for the sentence. It's also essential to recognize that inserting \\"dresser was light\\" would either be irrelevant or counterintuitive to the original sentence's meaning. If the dresser was light and still more complicated to move than the desk, this would suggest another factor outside of weight influencing their moveability, such as shape or size. Furthermore, it could confuse the intended message by bringing the dresser's description into contrast with its characterization initially made. So, the most logical and contextually sound way to complete the sentence is with \\"The desk was easily able to be moved compared to the dresser, because the desk was light.\\" The interpretation appropriately clarifies why the comparison was made and develops coherence between the sentence's introduction and its completion. This clarification is essential to ensure the message effectively communicates the intended meaning and doesn't confuse the reader."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He noticed that in his own state a lake near agricultural lands has been declared as a dead zone. For his study Greg labeled this zone as zone A. Then he found near a national park in his state a lake is not declared as a dead zone. To further his study he labeled this zone as zone B.  But I can use this background: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.  What is an answer for this question: Would zone A have less or more oxygen than zone B? A:","output":"Based on the information provided, Zone A, which is declared as a dead zone near agricultural lands, would have less oxygen than Zone B. The cause of this difference in oxygen levels is the runoff from agricultural lands carrying fertilizer, specifically nitrogen, into the water bodies. In Zone A, with high levels of nitrogen, there is an overgrowth of algae. These algae consume carbon dioxide in the water, and when they eventually die, decomposers break down the dead algae. In the process of decomposition, these decomposers use up all the oxygen present in the water. This leads to the formation of dead zones, as there is too little oxygen for other organisms to survive. On the other hand, Zone B near the national park does not experience the same level of fertilizer runoff, which means less nitrogen in the water, controlling the growth of algae to a normal level. This enables the water to maintain a balanced and sufficient availability of oxygen to support aquatic life, making Zone B a healthier ecosystem compared to Zone A.

If \\"Man in brown shirt accepting a certificate.\\", can we conclude \\"A man in black shoes is getting a certificate.\\"?","output":"It is not entirely accurate to conclude that \\"A man in black shoes is getting a certificate.\\" based solely on the information provided in the statement \\"Man in brown shirt accepting a certificate.\\". This is because the initial statement focuses on the color of the man's shirt, whereas the conclusion is based on the color of his shoes. Approaching this situation requires an analysis of both the content of the statement and the conclusion. First, let us break down the information given in the initial statement: 1. A man is the subject in the scenario. 2. The man is wearing a brown shirt. 3. He is accepting a certificate. Based on these details, it is evident that the man's shirt color is relevant, but there is no information provided regarding the color of his shoes. To assume that the man is also wearing black shoes, one must rely on additional context or make an inference without solid evidence. Now let us analyze the conclusion that \\"A man in black shoes is getting a certificate.\\": 1. A man is still the subject of the scenario. 2. The man is wearing black shoes. 3. He is getting a certificate. In this case, the statement correlates the act of getting a certificate with a man wearing black shoes, which does not follow directly from the initial statement. The conclusion is based on an assumption not supported by the information provided earlier. To summarize, without further context or evidence that explicitly links the color of the man's shoes to the act of getting a certificate, one cannot accurately conclude that \\"A man in black shoes is getting a certificate.\\" based on the information in the statement \\"Man in brown shirt accepting a certificate.\\". Drawing such a conclusion would be making an unsupported assumption, which does not accurately reflect the relationship between the man's clothing and his acceptance of a certificate. A more accurate conclusion based on the initial statement would be, \\"A man in a brown shirt is getting a certificate.\\" As this directly aligns with the information provided, focusing on the color of his shirt, rather than making an assumption about the color of his shoes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Based on the premise \\"i don't know what to do about it\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"There are a lot of variables I'm not prepared for. \\" is true?","output":"To determine whether the hypothesis \\"There are a lot of variables I'm not prepared for\\" is true based on the premise \\"I don't know what to do about it,\\" we must consider various factors and potential scenarios. It is possible that the hypothesis might be accurate in some cases, but there might be alternative explanations as well. Let's analyze the premise and hypothesis in more depth. Premise: \\"I don't know what to do about it.\\" This statement suggests uncertainty, confusion, or lack of knowledge regarding an existing situation or problem. It indicates that the person is unsure about how to approach the issue at hand. There are several reasons why someone might feel this way, and they may or may not be related to unpreparedness for various variables. These reasons can include: 1. Lack of information or knowledge: The person might not have access to sufficient information about the situation or the potential consequences tied to various actions. 2. Emotional factors: Stress, anxiety, or other emotions might cloud judgment or make it difficult for the person to determine the best course of action. 3. Complexity of the problem: Some issues may be inherently complex, with multiple variables and potential solutions, making it challenging to decide on the best action to take. Hypothesis: \\"There are a lot of variables I'm not prepared for.\\" This hypothesis focuses on the idea that the person is not ready to handle several variables or factors in a given circumstance. The hypothesis might be accurate in some situations, particularly when there is a high level of uncertainty or many potential outcomes. However, in other cases, the individual may simply be struggling with one or two key variables, rather than a multitude of them. Now, let's examine the relationship between the premise and hypothesis: 1. In some cases, the hypothesis may be true; the person may be overwhelmed by numerous unexpected variables, causing them to struggle with what to do about the situation. This may be due to a lack of experience, insufficient preparation, or simply the complexity of the problem. 2. In other cases, the person's lack of knowledge or certainty about what to do might not be related to being unprepared for multiple variables. It might simply reflect a lack of understanding of the issue or an inability to grasp the critical variables at play. Alternatively, emotional factors might be causing the person to feel overwhelmed or unsure about their actions. In summary, it is possible that the hypothesis \\"There are a lot of variables I'm not prepared for\\" may be true in some instances based on the premise \\"I don't know what to do about it.\\" However, there could be alternative reasons for a person's uncertainty, such as lack of information or emotional factors, which do not necessarily imply that the person is unprepared to handle multiple variables. Therefore, while the hypothesis might hold true in certain cases, it cannot be universally concluded to be true only based on the premise provided."},{"instruction":"Q: Question: what is the internal pressure of a bomb calorimeter?

Conacher was born in Toronto, Ontario on May 24, 1900. His middle name was given after the South African city of Pretoria, where British troops were fighting the Boer War at the time of his birth. He was the eldest son of Benjamin and Elizabeth Conacher, and the third of ten children overall. He had four brothers and five sisters. Conacher scored the first goal in Pirates history on American Thanksgiving Day Thursday November 26, 1925, against the Boston Bruins. He scored nine goals in 33 games in 1925-26, then returned to Toronto to play professional baseball with the Toronto Maple Leafs. An outfielder on the team, Conacher and the Maple Leafs won the International League championship then defeated the Louisville Colonels to win the Little World Series.  He returned to Pittsburgh for the 1926-27 NHL season, but was dealt early in the year to the New York Americans in exchange for Charlie Langlois and 2,000. The trade nearly proved disastrous for Conacher. He scored 8 goals in 1926-27 and improved to 11 in 1927-28, but playing for a team owned by notorious bootlegger Bill Dwyer resulted in his becoming a heavy drinker. Conacher served as player-coach in 1929-30, but his play and health had deteriorated. Two events in that off-season saved Conacher: he swore off alcohol completely upon the birth of his first child, and his playing rights were sold to the Montreal Maroons.  Conacher periodically struggled with Montreal, and at one point was placed on waivers with no other team willing to take over his contract. Nonetheless, his overall play and point totals increased for three consecutive seasons with the Maroons, peaking at 28 points in 1932-33. He was named to the Second All-Star Team that season, but was traded to the Chicago Black Hawks in exchange for Teddy Graham. Conacher was a key figure in the club's first-ever Stanley Cup victory that season. He finished second to the Canadiens' Aurel Joliat in the voting for the Hart Trophy and earned a spot on the NHL's First All-Star Team.  On Wednesday October 3, 1934, Conacher was involved in one of the largest transactions in league history. He was dealt to the Montreal Canadiens, along with Leroy Goldsworthy and Roger Jenkins in exchange for Montreal superstar Howie Morenz, Lorne Chabot and Marty Burke. The deal was only part of a series of trades involving four teams that represented one of the biggest deals in NHL history. Immediately following the Chicago trade, Conacher was sent back to the Maroons, along with Herb Cain, in exchange for the rights to Nelson Crutchfield. Conacher spent his last three NHL seasons with the Maroons and won his second Stanley Cup in 1935. He ended his hockey career after the team was eliminated from the playoffs by the New York Rangers on April 23, 1937. That final year he was runner-up to Babe Siebert in the 1937 Hart Trophy voting and was placed on the NHL Second All-Star Team.","output":"This text is about Lionel Pretoria Conacher, a Canadian professional athlete who played both ice hockey and baseball.

One reason radiation is dangerous is that it can’t be detected with the senses. You normally can’t see it, smell it, hear it, or feel it. Fortunately, there are devices such as Geiger counters that can detect radiation. A Geiger counter, like the one in Figure below , has a tube that contains atoms of a gas. If radiation enters the tube, it turns gas atoms to ions that carry electric current. The current causes the Geiger counter to click. The faster the clicks occur, the higher the level of radiation. You can see a video about the Geiger counter and how it was invented at the URL below.  Robert and Thomas are visiting an abandoned amusement park in Russia that is rumored to emit radiation due to the materials used in the rides.  Robert visits the Ferris wheel and his Geiger counter clicks slowly. Thomas visits the merry go round and his Geiger counter begins to click rapidly.  Which person's Geiger count has less current running through it? Answer:","output":"To determine which person's Geiger counter has less current running through it, let's analyze the situation step-by-step: Step 1: Understand how a Geiger counter works As mentioned in the provided information, a Geiger counter detects radiation by turning gas atoms to ions that carry electric current within a tube. When radiation is detected, the Geiger counter clicks. Step 2: Determine the relationship between clicks and current The faster the clicks occur, the higher the level of radiation. This implies that a higher number of clicks signify a higher current running since more ions are generated due to increased radiation. Step 3: Evaluate Robert and Thomas' Geiger counters Robert's Geiger counter clicks slowly, while Thomas' Geiger counter clicks rapidly. Step 4: Compare the Geiger counter readings Since Robert's Geiger counter clicks slowly and Thomas' Geiger counter clicks rapidly, it can be inferred that Robert's Geiger counter has less current running through it compared to Thomas' Geiger counter. This is because fewer ions are being generated due to lower detected radiation levels in the area around Robert. Answer: Robert's Geiger counter has less current running through it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Various schools of Buddhism (a religion from India) flourished as represented by the Chinese Chán (or Zen) beliefs of Wang Wei (Tang dynasty) (701-761). His quatrains (jueju) describing natural scenes are world-famous examples of excellence, each couplet conventionally containing about two distinct images or thoughts per line. Tang poetrys big star is Li Bai (701-762) also pronounced and written as Li Bo, who worked in all major styles, both the more free old style verse (Gushi (poetry)) as well as the tonally regulated new style verse (Regulated verse). Regardless of genre, Tang poets notably strove to perfect a style in which poetic subjects are exposed and evident, often without directly referring to the emotional thrust at hand. The poet Du Fu (712-770) excelled at regulated verse and use of the seven-character line, writing denser poems with more allusions as he aged, experiencing hardship and writing about it. A parade of great Tang poets also includes Chen Ziang (661-702), Wang Zhihuan (688-742), Meng Haoran (689-740), Bai Juyi (772-846), Li He (790-816), Du Mu (803-852), Wen Tingyun (812-870), (listed chronologically) and Li Shangyin (813-858), whose poetry delights in allusions that often remain obscure, and whose emphasis on the seven-character line also contributed to the emerging posthumous fame of Du Fu, now ranked alongside Li Bai. The distinctively different Ci (poetry) poetry form began its development during the Tang as Central Asian and other musical influences flowed through its cosmopolitan society.

The answer to the question: What three explorers bodies were transported to Stockholm? is inside the article: The Norwegian Bratvaag expedition, studying the glaciers and seas of the Svalbard archipelago from the Norwegian sealing vessel Bratvaag of Ålesund, found the remains of the Andrée expedition on 5 August 1930. Kvitøya was usually inaccessible to the sealing or whaling ships of the time, as it is typically surrounded by a wide belt of thick polar ice and often hidden by thick ice fogs. However, summer in 1930 had been particularly warm, and the surrounding sea was practically free of ice. As Kvitøya was known to be a prime hunting ground for walrus and the fogs over the island on that day were comparatively thin, some of the crew of the Bratvaag took this rare opportunity to land on what they called the \\"inaccessible island\\".Two of the sealers in search of water, Olav Salen and Karl Tusvick, discovered Andrée's boat near a small stream, frozen under a mound of snow and full of equipment, including a boathook engraved with the words \\"Andrée's Polar Expedition, 1896\\". Presented with this hook, the Bratvaag's captain, Peder Eliassen, assigned the crew to search the site together with the expedition members. Among other finds, they uncovered a journal and two skeletons, identified as Andrée's and Strindberg's remains by monograms found on their clothing.The Bratvaag left the island to continue its scheduled hunting and observations, with the intent of coming back later to see if the ice had melted further and uncovered more artifacts. Further discoveries were made by the M/K Isbjørn of Tromsø, a sealing sloop chartered by news reporters to waylay the Bratvaag. Unsuccessful in this, the reporters and the Isbjørn crew made instead for Kvitøya, landing on the island on 5 September in fine weather and finding even less ice than the Bratvaag had.

Miguel Indurain Larraya (Spanish pronunciation: [mi'gel indu'rain la'raja]; born 16 July 1964) is a retired Spanish road racing cyclist. Indurain won five consecutive Tours de France from 1991 to 1995, the fourth, and last, to win five times. He also won the Criterium du Dauphine Libere in 1996.  Indurain aimed for a sixth victory in the 1996 Tour, but suffered from the beginning. He came seventh in the prologue. After bronchitis in a cold and wet first week, he lost time from stage seven. He said that, on the Cormet de Roseland on 6 July, \\"my legs started to feel odd but, because the speed of the group wasn't very high, I didn't take much notice. I even imagined attacking at the foot of the Arcs climbs.\\" He dropped out of the group and lost three minutes in three kilometres. Race referees penalised him 20 seconds for accepting a bottle of drink in the last kilometre. He said the 20 seconds were nothing compared to the minute he would have lost had he not taken the bottle. He later said he would stop racing. The Dane Bjarne Riis won and his teammate Jan Ullrich finished second. Indurain finished 11th and, in a stage passing through his hometown and ending in Pamplona, he finished 19th, eight minutes behind the stage winner.

Has a clipped, Bressonian quality that makes it frustrating but also increasingly fascinating. 3. The film's plot, revolving around a murder investigation that turns nasty, ticks along smoothly and efficiently. But it's ultimately more of a character drama, and a reminder that great acting often has little to do with words. 4. Basically a vivid meal of characters, plus coffee and wine and one gin tonic, Le Petit Lieutenant keeps true to its brasserie menu. 5. Beauvois makes the milieu his own, too, showing us credible and affecting human beings caught up in a world that often reveals humanity at its worst. 6. Le Petit Lieutenant looks at Antoine's life with lyricism. 7. ... one that will likely earn more respect from viewers than it will passion. 8. The movie's realism is unimpeachable, though American cops might be stunned by the idea of a half-dozen detectives being assigned to the murder of an anonymous floater. 9. Just as the French may overrate our cinema (Jerry Lewis, anyone?), we may overrate theirs. Take Le Petit Lieutenant -- please. 10. ...More than any film in recent memory, Le Petit Lieutenant conveys the relentless toll of big-city police work. Summary:","output":"The movie \\"Le Petit Lieutenant,\\" directed by Xavier Beauvois, is a well-crafted film with a strong focus on character and setting. Beauvois' direction is clean and precise, creating an immersive world that captivates the viewer. The film's unique Bressonian quality adds to its intrigue, although it may be frustrating to some. Its plot focuses on a murder investigation, which is engaging and efficient, but the true strength of the movie lies in its character development and the believable human drama that unfolds. \\"Le Petit Lieutenant\\" is centered around the life of Antoine, and the film treats its subject with a lyricism that adds depth to the character. Notably, the film manages to focus on humanity in spite of dealing with subject matter that often showcases the worst aspects of human nature. Additionally, the movie has a strong sense of realism, although this may leave some American viewers surprised at the number of detectives assigned to a singular case.

First of all, the moon is much smaller than the earth. Days and nights on the moon are very long. One day on the moon is as long as two weeks on the earth. One night is also as long as two weeks on the earth. In the daytime the moon is very hot and at night is very cold. Question: On the moon   _  . Yes or no, is the answer \\"there is no man\\"? A:","output":"Yes, the answer is \\"there is no man\\" on the moon. The idea of a \\"man in the moon\\" is a myth or folklore that has been debunked by science and exploration. The moon is Earth's natural satellite and has been subject to various studies and research. Despite the lines and circles visible through a telescope, no human-like figure or man has been found to reside on the moon. The moon's surface consists primarily of craters, dust, and rocks. It has a harsh environment characterized by extreme temperature fluctuations between day and night. A lunar day, equivalent to 29.5 Earth days, is divided into two weeks of daytime with extremely high temperatures, reaching up to 260°F (127°C), and two weeks of nighttime exhibiting frigid temperatures as low as -280°F (-173°C). Lunar exploration missions, such as the Apollo program by NASA, have landed astronauts on the moon's surface, conducted experiments, and collected rock samples. These endeavors have contributed significantly to our knowledge of the moon, its geology, and its relationship with Earth.

You have no doubt seen lightning in a rainstorm. What does lighting have to do with static electricity? As it turns out, everything! During a rainstorm, clouds develop regions of different charges.

Stunning black and white cinematography (that should have won an Oscar), a haunting Quincy Jones score and tremendous performances by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson as the oddly-matched killers. This film was 0 for 4 at the Academy Awards and wasn't even nominated for Best Picture while Dr. Doolittle was. Go Figure!  Although you don't get to know the Clutter family as well as you do in the book, it was a good decision to focus more on Perry and Dick and the pain-staking process of tracking these guys down. John Forsythe is also impressive as Alvin Dewey. There are simply no flaws in this one. 10 out of 10. Best performance = Scott Wilson with R. Blake a close second. Highly recommended!

Q: What large organelle comprised of cup-shaped discs is found close to the nucleus of the cell, where it modifies proteins that have been delivered in transport vesicles?   Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  The Golgi apparatus is a large organelle that is usually made up of five to eight cup-shaped, membrane-covered discs called cisternae, as shown in Figure above . The cisternae look a bit like a stack of deflated balloons. The Golgi apparatus modifies, sorts, and packages different substances for secretion out of the cell, or for use within the cell. The Golgi apparatus is found close to the nucleus of the cell, where it modifies proteins that have been delivered in transport vesicles from the RER. It is also involved in the transport of lipids around the cell. Pieces of the Golgi membrane pinch off to form vesicles that transport molecules around the cell. The Golgi apparatus can be thought of as similar to a post office; it packages and labels \\"items\\" and then sends them to different parts of the cell. Both plant and animal cells have a Golgi apparatus. Plant cells can have up to several hundred Golgi stacks scattered throughout the cytoplasm.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: When the Japanese attacked America's ships at Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, they did it secretly. The makers of the movie Pearl Harbor have behaved differently. The noise about Pearl Harbor, made by Disney,has reached its highest point with its premiere   before the movie opens in cinemas across the US at the start of the Memorial Day holiday weekend, a time to recall national heroes who sacrificed their lives on the battlefield. As Ben Affleck is the main star, the movie seems sure to become a success in the United States at least. At almost three hours in length, it promises to be a good old Hollywood movie. There is a love story. Affleck and his co-star, Josh Hartnett, both fall in love with the navy nurse, Kate Beckinsale and, of course, there is much human courage and love of country. It's certain that Disney will be accused of \\"changing\\" history. The showing of actual events in a movie always causes arguments. Bits of the story are deliberately not mentioned in the movie. It does not address the theory held by some historians that President Franklin Roosevelt knew about Japan's intention to attack the ships in Pearl Harbor.It is said he did nothing, as he was aware that such a blow would allow him to take America into the Second World War. Japan remains sensitive about being accused of wartime atrocities  . And Disney is sensitive about its business in Japan, where it has a theme park. Not all the reviews of the movie have been full of praise. A reviewer for Newsweek, who was given an early preview, acknowledged that the 40-minute sequence   showing the attack itself was powerful. The attack comes quite late in the movie, however, and the reviewer was less impressed with the characters and the love story. \\"Almost every line of the dialogue sounds like it comes from an old movie, \\" the reviewer wrote. Options: A The movie will cause a lot of arguments. B The movie has made the Japanese angry. C The movie truly describes the Pearl Harbor Incident.

Lynch told the city's devastated gay community, \\"We stand with you in the light.\\" She also announced a 1 million emergency grant to help Florida law enforcement pay for overtime costs related to the shooting, and she met with prosecutors, first responders and victims of the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Her visit comes as investigators continue to dig into the background of Omar Mateen, the gunman who killed 49 people and injured dozens more on June 12 at the Pulse nightclub. Lynch said it was a \\"cruel irony\\" that the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community — one defined almost entirely by love — is so often a target of hate. She told the LGBTQ community, \\"We stand with you to say that the good in the world far outweighs the evil; that our common humanity transcends our differences; and that our most effective response to terror and hatred is compassion, unity and love.\\" Also Tuesday, Orlando police reopened streets near the nightclub and wound down their investigation at the crime scene.

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the building that Viscount Grey de Wilton laid the first stone for? from the following article ?  Radcliffe Tower is all that remains of an early 15th-century stone-built manor house.  The structure is a Grade I listed building and protected as a Scheduled Monument.  The construction of a nearby tithe barn is not documented, but it was probably built between 1600 and 1720. It was used for storage of the local tithes (a tenth of a farm's produce).  Along with Radcliffe Tower, the Parish Church of St Mary is a Grade I listed building.  The town also has two Grade II* listed buildings; Dearden Fold Farmhouse, completed during the 16th century, and Radcliffe Cenotaph, built in 1922 to commemorate the First World War.  Outwood Viaduct, and Radcliffe's most visible landmark, St Thomas' Church, are Grade II listed buildings.  St Thomas' took nine years to complete. The first stone was laid by Viscount Grey de Wilton (grandson of the Countess Grosvenor) on 21 July 1862, and it was consecrated in 1864 by the first Bishop of Manchester, James Prince Lee.  Construction of the tower began in 1870 and the building was completed in 1871.  The building cost £7,273, (£670 thousand today) and the tower cost £1,800 (£160 thousand today). The first vicar was the Reverend Robert Fletcher. Radcliffe's first public ornament was a drinking fountain located at the bottom of Radcliffe New Road.  It was presented to the town by a Mrs Noah Rostron in memory of her husband, and erected in August 1896.  The fountain no longer exists at this location. Built in 1911 the town hall was on the junction of Water Street and Spring Lane.  For many years after the town lost its urban district status, the building was unoccupied.

Pedestrians struck and killed by cars often are extremely drunk. In fact, they are intoxicated  more frequently and with higher blood alcohol levels than drunken drivers who are killed in accidents, various studies have shown. Forty percent of adult pedestrians involved in fatal crashes have a blood alcohol level of at least 0.10 which by law in most states signifies intoxication compared to only 25 percent of drivers in deadly accidents, according to recent federal data. Some types of pedestrain accidents have been declining nationally, especially those involving children, but the number of adult pedestrians who are drunk when killed in traffic has remained  ly steady at 2500 a year. The total number of pedestrians killed annually in U.S. traffic accidents is at least 7000, or one of every seven highway accidents resulting in death. \\"We're dealing here, we think, with a very severe drinking problem that leads to a severe highway safety problem,\\" said Richard Blomberg, president of Dunlap and Associates Inc, in Norwalk, Coon. w.w.^w.k.&s.5*u.c.#om....

Of course, you have to decide you want to lose weight and be committed to doing so; then, you must stick to your guns and stay motivated or the goal will never be realized. There is no magic bullet, but there are two important tips that can help you reach your weight-loss goal. #1 – Take It a Week at a Time You must break your ultimate goal into smaller chunks and have bench marks that will indicate you are moving in the right direction.

News article: In Syria, Missteps by Rebels Erode Their Support Rebels firing on a man suspected of being a pro-government fighter in Idlib Province on Oct. 26. BEIRUT, Lebanon — Syria’s rebel fighters — who have long staked claim to the moral high ground for battling dictatorship — are losing crucial support from a public increasingly disgusted by the actions of some rebels, including poorly planned missions, senseless destruction, criminal behavior and the coldblooded killing of prisoners. The shift in mood presents more than just a public relations problem for the loosely knit militants of the Free Syrian Army, who rely on their supporters to survive the government’s superior firepower. A dampening of that support undermines the rebels’ ability to fight and win what has become a devastating war of attrition, perpetuating the violence that has left nearly 40,000 dead, hundreds of thousands in refugee camps and more than a million forced from their homes. The rebel shortcomings have been compounded by changes in the opposition, from a force of civilians and defected soldiers who took up arms after the government used lethal force on peaceful protesters to one that is increasingly seeded with extremist jihadis. That radicalization has divided the fighters’ supporters and made Western nations more reluctant to give rebels the arms that might help break the intensifying deadlock. Instead, foreign leaders are struggling to find indirect ways to help oust Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad. And now arrogance and missteps are draining enthusiasm from some of the fighters’ core supporters. “They were supposed to be the people on whom we depend to build a civil society,” lamented a civilian activist in Saraqib, a northern town where rebels were videotaped executing a group of unarmed Syrian soldiers, an act the United Nations has declared a likely war crime. An activist in Aleppo, Ahmed, who like some of the others who were interviewed gave only one name for security reasons, said he had begged rebels not to camp in a neighborhood telecommunications office. But they did, and government attacks knocked out phone service. One fighter shot into the air when customers at a bakery did not let him cut into a long line for bread, Ahmed recalled. Another, he said, was enraged when a man washing his car accidentally splashed him. “He shot at him,” Ahmed said. “But thank God he wasn’t a good shot, so the guy wasn’t hurt.” Twenty months into what is now a civil war, both supporters and opponents of the government are trapped in a darkening mood of despair, revulsion and fear that neither side can end the conflict. In recent months, both sides adopted more brutal — even desperate — methods to try to break the stalemate, but they achieved merely a new version of deadlock. To many Syrians, the extreme violence seems all the more pointless for the lack of results. The most significant shift is among the rebels’ supporters, who chant slogans not only condemning the government but also criticizing the rebels. “The people want the reform of the Free Syrian Army,” crowds have called out. “We love you. Correct your path.” Small acts of petty humiliation and atrocities like executions have led many more Syrians to believe that some rebels are as depraved as the government they fight. The activist from Saraqib said he saw rebels force government soldiers from a milk factory, then destroy it, even though residents needed the milk and had good relations with the owner. “They shelled the factory and stole everything,” the activist said. “Those are repulsive acts.” Even some of the uprising’s staunchest supporters are beginning to fear that Syria’s sufferings — lost lives, fraying social fabric, destroyed heritage — are for naught. “We thought freedom was so near,” said a fighter calling himself Abu Ahmed, his voice catching with grief as he spoke via Skype last month from Maarat al-Noaman, a strategic town on the Aleppo-Damascus highway. Hours earlier, a rebel victory there ended in disaster, as government airstrikes pulverized civilians returning to what they thought was safety. “This shows it was a big lie,” Abu Ahmed said of the dream of self-government that he said had inspired him to lead a small rebel fighting group from his nearby village, Sinbol. “We cannot reach it. We can’t even think of democracy — we will be sad for years. We are losing victims from both sides.” A chain of calamities has fueled disgust and frustration on all sides, dozens of interviews with Syrians show. In July, a rebel bombing killed four senior officials in a heavily guarded Damascus building, bringing new insecurity to government supporters. The rebels’ growing use of large bombs that kill bystanders spurred concerns on both sides. Poorly executed rebel offensives brought harsh consequences. In September, rebels launched an offensive in Syria’s largest city, Aleppo, an ancient town that stood for centuries as the proud legacy of all Syrians. The fighting failed to achieve the turning point the rebels had promised. Hala Droubi contributed reporting from Beirut, and an employee of The New York Times from Aleppo and Damascus, Syria. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"This news article highlights the eroding public support for the Syrian rebel fighters, primarily the Free Syrian Army, due to their questionable actions, including poorly planned missions, senseless destruction, criminal behavior, and killing of prisoners. The diminishing public support threatens the rebels' ability to continue fighting against the government's superior firepower and prolongs the violence that has led to a significant death toll and displacement of people. It also discusses the growing radicalization within the opposition, causing a division among supporters and making Western nations hesitant to provide arms that could potentially help break the deadlock. Furthermore, the article outlines instances of rebel missteps, leading to the loss of local and international sympathy, and portrays the despair, revulsion, and fear experienced by both government supporters and opponents. Finally, it sheds light on the increasing brutality of both sides to break the stalemate, only achieving a new version of deadlock and rendering the extreme violence even more pointless."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a news article: LONDON — When about 100 heavily armed police officers and soldiers took position shortly after 4 a.m. Wednesday outside the building in the Paris suburb of St.-Denis where the presumed ringleader of the Paris attacks was holed up, a young woman appeared in a window.      “Help!” she shouted, according to the reports of witnesses. “Help me!”      But Hasna Aitboulahcen, a cousin of Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the Islamic State jihadist believed to have orchestrated France’s deadliest terrorist attacks to date, did not fool the officers, who suspected a trap. Two hours and 5,000 rounds of ammunition later, this 26-year-old daughter of a Moroccan immigrant was dead, in the end not by becoming the first woman to blow herself up in a suicide vest on Western soil, as first suggested by the authorities — but by being killed in a fierce battle with the police.      Ms. Aitboulahcen has been widely portrayed in the news media as a onetime wild child, at least by fundamentalist Muslim standards: smoking, drinking, staying out late, wearing cowboy hats, having lots of boyfriends and rarely going to the mosque. A widely circulated photograph shows her lying in a bubble bath, smiling coquettishly at the camera. In short, she seemed to be the thoroughly secular antithesis of how the pious Islamic State expects its women to behave. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.      / Updated By Frédéric Huette, Donald Wood, Natasha Lebedeva and Hasani Gittens      The sister of a woman who died in an anti-terrorism raid in Paris last week told NBC News on Monday that she believes her sibling was emotionally troubled and \\"manipulated\\" — not a hard-core terrorist.      Hasna Aitboulahcen, 26, the daughter of a Moroccan immigrant, was killed Wednesday during a raid by Paris law enforcement on a suburban apartment building. Police initially said Aitboulahcen detonated a suicide vest as police stormed the apartment in the suburb of Saint-Denis, but they later said she was killed by another suspect's explosion.      Hasna had described herself in the past as a cousin of Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the suspected ringleader of the Nov. 13 terror attacks in Paris who was also killed in the raid. But her actual relationship to Abaaoud remains unclear.      Speaking to NBC News in French via text message on Monday, Hasna's 25-year-old sister, Myriam Aitboulachen, revealed that she had tried to \\"protect her from herself.\\"      Related: Who Was the Woman Killed in Terror Raid?      \\"She did not grow up in a stable home.

A French official said she had spent some time in foster care.      Former neighbors in the Paris neighborhood of Aulnay-sous-Bois told Reuters she'd been mistreated as a child, renounced Islam, and was seen drinking, smoking and doing drugs.      But earlier this year, they said, she showed up in a hijab and veil, saying she'd become a jihadi. But the neighbors said they thought she was joking.      Myriam said the police have not told her about her sister's role in the Paris attacks that killed over 100 people.      \\"They gave me no information, what I know is that she was manipulated by her cousin (Abaaoud),\\" she said. \\"I don't consider him a member of my family.\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"In November 2015, a news report emerged about a anti-terrorism police raid in the Paris suburb of St.-Denis. Heavily armed officers were searching for Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the alleged ringleader of the Paris attacks that occurred earlier that month.

Aitboulahcen had been portrayed in the media as a \\"wild child,\\" engaging in activities such as smoking, drinking, and having multiple relationships. Despite these behaviors seemingly conflicting with the Islamic State's expected conduct for women, her allegiance to the terrorist group was suspected. Reports initially claimed that she had detonated a suicide vest during the raid, but it was later clarified that she was killed by another suspect's explosion. Aitboulahcen's 25-year-old sister, Myriam, spoke to NBC News and shared her belief that her sibling was emotionally troubled and manipulated, rather than a committed terrorist. Myriam revealed their unstable upbringing and claimed Hasna often sought her help when feeling unwell or down. Friends and former neighbors described Aitboulahcen as a \\"party girl\\" who had experienced a difficult childhood. However, they also noted her sudden shift towards more radical behaviors, such as wearing a hijab and veil, and claiming that she had become a jihadi.

While a similar term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common practice period. The major time divisions of classical music are as follows: the early music period, which includes the Medieval (500–1400) and the Renaissance (1400–1600) eras; the Common practice period, which includes the Baroque (1600–1750), Classical (1750–1820), and Romantic eras (1804–1910); and the 20th century (1901–2000) which includes the modern (1890–1930) that overlaps from the late 19th-century, the high modern (mid 20th-century), and contemporary or postmodern (1975–2015) eras.[citation needed] Question: When was the modern era?","output":"The modern era in classical music is generally considered to span from around 1890 to 1930.

It also marked a shift towards more dissonance, atonality, and the incorporation of non-Western musical elements. Influential composers from the modern era include Igor Stravinsky, Claude Debussy, and Arnold Schoenberg, among others.

Harman has been an influential member of Congress for many years, representing her intelligent and politically engaged constituents, a task she admits she has found incredibly rewarding. Addressing her departure in a heartfelt email, Harman wrote, \\"This is an excruciating decision because the distinction of representing the smartest constituents on earth will never be surpassed. But shaping and leading the Wilson Center is a thrilling new challenge.\\" The congresswoman is expected to formally announce her decision tomorrow, as told by a congressional source to Roll Call, a popular political news site. Following the announcement, Harman will remain in her role \\"for some weeks\\" to ensure a smooth transition for her replacement. As the Woodrow Wilson Center is a non-partisan think tank, Harman's move to the center represents a significant change in her career, transitioning from direct political representation to spearheading policy research and discourse. Under her leadership, the prestigious organization will likely continue focusing on critical global issues in fields such as public policy, economy, and international relations. The race to replace Harman in her congressional seat will become the first test of California's new all-party primary system, where the top vote-getters, regardless of their political party, advance to the general election. This system aims to minimize the influence of political parties on election outcomes and create a more democratic and transparent process, representing the interests of all voters.

With a strong focus on national security, economic development, and social justice, Harman leaves behind a substantial legacy in Congress and embarks on a new chapter in her career at the Woodrow Wilson Center. Over the coming weeks, political insiders and the public alike will be watching for updates on Harman's transition and the race to replace her in the California congressional seat. With the implementation of the new all-party primary system, it will certainly be an interesting and potentially precedent-setting event in California politics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He graduated from Bakersfield High School. Following Gifford's death in 2015, his wife Kathie Lee Gifford said that her late husband grew up in a poverty-stricken home and that he and his family sometimes ate dog food. She said they lived in 29 places even before Gifford attended high school because his father could not find work during the Depression. After his playing days ended, Gifford became a broadcaster for CBS, covering football, golf and basketball. When Monday Night Football was launched in 1970, ABC had originally planned to have Gifford in their broadcast booth, but he still had a year remaining on his contract with CBS. He therefore recommended his friend Don Meredith, who was hired. The following year, Gifford replaced Keith Jackson as Monday Night Football's play-by-play announcer, and remained involved with the show for 27 of its next 28 years. His low-key delivery provided a perfect counterbalance to broadcast partners Meredith and Howard Cosell. In an era with only three television broadcast networks, the series became the longest-running prime-time sports program in television history, and developed into one of television's most valuable franchises. In 1986, Al Michaels took over play-by-play duties, and Gifford switched to a commentator role. However, Gifford did play-by-play for the next several years (Gifford was joined by Lynn Swann on color commentary in 1986 and by Dan Dierdorf for the rest of his run on Monday Night Football) whenever Michaels was covering post-season baseball games for the network.  Following his affair with airline flight attendant Suzen Johnson in 1997, Gifford was replaced in the broadcast booth by Boomer Esiason in 1998. That season, he was reassigned to a nominal role for ABC's Monday night pregame show, but the program was cancelled after one season. Gifford was not offered a new role by the network. Gifford was also host of British TV network Channel 4's NFL coverage with British born former New England Patriots kicker John Smith in 1986, which included coverage of Super Bowl XXI.  Gifford was also a reporter and commentator on other ABC sports programs, such as coverage of the Olympics (including the controversial men's basketball Gold Medal game between the United States and Soviet Union at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, which Gifford called alongside Bill Russell), skiing and golf. He announced Evel Knievel's jumps for ABC's Wide World of Sports in the 1970s, including when Knievel failed to clear 13 buses at Wembley Stadium in 1975. Gifford also guest hosted Good Morning America on occasion, including once when he met his future wife Kathie Lee.  In 1977, Gifford won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Sports Personality. He was given the Pete Rozelle Radio-Television Award by the Pro Football Hall of Fame In 1995 for his NFL television work.

Five months later, when Holst was in Greece, Boult introduced The Planets to the general public, at a concert in February 1919; Holst sent him a long letter full of suggestions, but failed to convince him that the suite should be played in full. The conductor believed that about half an hour of such radically new music was all the public could absorb at first hearing, and he gave only five of the seven movements on that occasion.Holst enjoyed his time in Salonica, from where he was able to visit Athens, which greatly impressed him.

Today the best jobs are still given to men.Even when women do the same work,they are often paid less than men.Some women want these things changed.They want to stand beside the men,with the same chances for success. Now many American women are earning money outside their homes.More than half of the women at the age of eighteen to sixty-five have good jobs.In general,working women have more education than those who stay at home. Among women with jobs,eight out of ten drive a car to work,and most of them often spend their holidays away from home.They like traveling by air.Women's work has made several changes in women's lives and in men's lives,too. But things are quite different from those in the Middle East countries. In the Middle East countries,women have to stay at home.They look after their families and do all the housework.They can't find work outside.When they go out in public.they cover their faces with something and walk behind their husbands. For the past few years the women's life has been changing in those countries.Many women want to play an active role in the society.Though working gives them few chances of getting married,many men still want to marry them in the old ways.

Green is common in nature, as many plants are green because of a complex chemical known as chlorophyll, which is involved in photosynthesis. Chlorophyll absorbs the long wavelengths of light (red) and short wavelengths of light (blue) much more efficiently than the wavelengths that appear green to the human eye, so light reflected by plants is enriched in green. Chlorophyll absorbs green light poorly because it first arose in organisms living in oceans where purple halobacteria were already exploiting photosynthesis. Their purple color arose because they extracted energy in the green portion of the spectrum using bacteriorhodopsin. The new organisms that then later came to dominate the extraction of light were selected to exploit those portions of the spectrum not used by the halobacteria. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Why are many plants green?","output":"Many plants are green primarily due to the presence of chlorophyll, a complex chemical that plays a crucial role in photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and certain bacteria convert sunlight into energy in the form of glucose, using carbon dioxide and water. Through photosynthesis, plants are able to generate the essential nutrients for their growth and release oxygen into the atmosphere as a byproduct. Chlorophyll, found in chloroplasts of plant cells, gives plants their green color because of its unique molecular structure that allows it to absorb the red and blue wavelengths of light efficiently, while reflecting the green wavelengths. The wavelengths that are reflected, rather than absorbed, appear as the color we perceive. Since chlorophyll absorbs red and blue light most effectively and reflects green light, plants appear green to our eyes. The reason behind chlorophyll's poor absorption of green light has an evolutionary explanation. When photosynthetic organisms first evolved, oceans were dominated by purple halobacteria that used bacteriorhodopsin to perform photosynthesis. Bacteriorhodopsin allowed these halobacteria to efficiently extract energy from the green portion of the light spectrum, giving them their purple color. As new photosynthetic organisms emerged, they had to adapt and exploit the unused portions of the light spectrum to avoid competition with these halobacteria. This led to the development of chlorophyll and the selection of these organisms to absorb more red and blue light. Thus, green light is reflected and the plants we commonly see today are green. In summary, the green color in many plants can be attributed to the presence of chlorophyll and its role in photosynthesis. The absorption and reflection of different wavelengths of light by chlorophyll, along with the evolutionary history of photosynthetic organisms, are the main reasons behind plants appearing green."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: \\"Djent\\" is an onomatopoetic word used to refer to a guitar tone and a stylized riff used in a particular strain of progressive metal music. The term was originally used by Meshuggah guitarist Fredrik Thordendal, to refer to the kind of tone he was trying to get, but it's now applied by fans (and detractors) of a particular group of bands that use that tone, specifically in main guitar riffs and breakdowns. In the metal community, there's some debate about whether or not \\"djent\\" is an actual genre or distinct style, or has any staying power as a style. Meshuggah is widely credited as the bad to popularize and coin the djent tone, though it now applies to a variety of progressive meta, pop metal, and metalcore bands who implement djent breakdowns into the songs. If you're curious about the \\"djent\\" sound, check out the following bands:  Periphery Animals as Leaders Tesseract Monuments Born of Osiris Cloudkicker Bulb If you want to hear the riff specifically to get a sense of the sound that Fredrik was originally referring to, there are a variety of \\"djent comps\\" on YouTube that stream together the heaviest and most \\"djenty\\" of the djent riffs. It's a good way to do some quick research. Again, the existence of djent as a particular genre is somewhat debatable, and it's primarily a trend that peaked in some metalcore bands between 2010 and 2012. Because of this, there aren't a lot of bands that self-identify as \\"djent\\" bands, but you might be able to hear the influence or the style in their music, since it merely refers to a particular tone and style of riff. You might find djent riffs in:  Deathcore or straight-up death metal Metalcore, pop metal, or screamo Prog metal or math rock What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article discusses the term \\"djent,\\" which refers to a specific guitar tone and riff style within the progressive metal music genre.

The air moves into the lungs: Once the air has traveled through the esophagus, it moves into the lungs, where oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange occurs. 4. The carbon dioxide is removed: As the air moves into the lungs, the red blood cells in the lungs' capillaries collect carbon dioxide waste from the body and exchange it for oxygen. 5.

Answer the following question: Information:  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - Mount Vesuvius ( also \\"Vesevus\\" or \\"Vesaevus\\" in some Roman sources) is a somma-stratovolcano located on the Gulf of Naples in Campania, Italy, about east of Naples and a short distance from the shore. It is one of several volcanoes which form the Campanian volcanic arc. Vesuvius consists of a large cone partially encircled by the steep rim of a summit caldera caused by the collapse of an earlier and originally much higher structure.  - A multi-sport event is an organized sports event, often held over multiple days, featuring competition in many different sports between organized teams of athletes from (mostly) nation states. The first major, modern, multi-sport event of international significance is the modern Olympic Games.  - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states.   - International mostly means something (a company, language, or organization) involving more than a single country. The term international as a word means involvement of, interaction between or encompassing more than one nation, or generally beyond national boundaries. For example, international law, which is applied by more than one country and usually everywhere on Earth, and international language which is a language spoken by residents of more than one country.  - The 1908 Summer Olympics, officially the Games of the IV Olympiad, were an international multi-sport event which was held in 1908 in London, England from 27 April to 31 October 1908. These games were originally scheduled to be held in Rome, but were re-located on financial grounds following a disastrous eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 1906. They were the fourth chronological modern Olympic Games in keeping with the now-accepted four-year cycle as opposed to the proposed Intercalated Games alternate four-year cycle. The IOC president for these Games was Baron Pierre de Coubertin. Lasting a total of 187 days, or 6 months and 4 days, these games were the longest in modern Olympics history.  - The Free State of Saxony is a landlocked federal state of Germany, bordering the federal states of Brandenburg, Saxony Anhalt, Thuringia, and Bavaria, as well as the countries of Poland (Lower Silesian and Lubusz Voivodeships) and the Czech Republic (Karlovy Vary, Liberec and Ústí nad Labem Regions). Its capital is Dresden, and its largest city is Leipzig.  - The Intercalated Olympic Games were to be a series of \\"International Olympic Games\\" halfway between what is now known as the Games of the Olympiad. This proposed series of games, intercalated in the Olympic Games cycle, was to always be held in Athens, and were to have equal status with the international games. However, the only such games were held in 1906.  - Karl Neumer ( 23 February 1887 in Reinhardtsgrimma -- 16 May 1984 ) was a German track cycling racer who competed in the 1908 Summer Olympics . He won two medals - bronze in the individual sprint and silver , together with his teammates Max Götze , Rudolf Katzer , and Hermann Martens , in the team pursuit . He also competed in the 5000 metres race , but was eliminated in the first round .  - Glashütte is a town in Sächsische Schweiz-Osterzgebirge, Free State of Saxony, Germany, which was the birthplace of the German watchmaking industry. The city has a population of about 7,000. Historically it was first mentioned in a document around 1445. In January 2008, the former municipality Reinhardtsgrimma was merged into Glashütte.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - Reinhardtsgrimma is a former municipality in the district of Weißeritzkreis in Saxony in Germany located near Dresden. On 2 January 2008, it merged into the town Glashütte.  - The Weißeritzkreis is a former district (\\"Kreis\\") in the south of the Free State of Saxony, Germany. Neighboring districts were (from west clockwise) Freiberg, Meißen, the district-free city Dresden, Sächsische Schweiz, and to the south it bordered the Czech Republic.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: The best way to defrost crab is to let it sit, covered, inside the refrigerator overnight. Crab legs can also be thawed by running them under cold water for a few minutes. Even if you do not need to run the crab legs under cold water to thaw them, doing so could also help remove any remaining ice crystals or slime. Pat dry with clean paper towels before using. Arrange the crab legs in even layers inside the slow cooker and add enough water to just barely cover them.  You will need to create multiple layers of crab legs, but these layers should at least be even. Due to the shape of the crab legs, an oval slow cooker usually works better than a round one. You only need enough water to cover the crabs. Too little or too much could be result in crab legs that are too dry or not sufficiently heated. Melt the butter in a small bowl and stir in the garlic powder and dill.  If you prefer a stronger garlic taste, you can use 4 cloves of minced garlic instead of concentrated garlic powder. Since the crab legs are being cooked slowly, the flavors of the seasonings have a greater opportunity to permeate the thick shell of the legs and flavor the meat beneath. Pour the melted butter mixture over the crab legs in the slow cooker. Try to spread the butter over as many of the crab legs as possible. You can toss them to coat the crab more thoroughly, but this is not necessary. Cover the slow cooker and cook the crab legs until they are steaming hot and nearly melting inside their shells. It you did not have time to thaw your crab legs and are cooking them straight from a frozen state, add another 30 minutes to the cooking time. Use tongs to remove the crab legs from the slow cooker. Transfer them to a serving platter and enjoy while hot.

I always have stayed away from hospitals. People died or were born. But now I thought I might get some idea if I went down to where it was all happening, the being born and the dying. Mostly the dying. It was the dying that interested me. I sat on a bench in a sort of waiting room. I wanted to call it a green room; it wasn't a place where the patients would wait to be called by the doctor; it was a place where the relatives would wait while the patient was in their room. It had a coffee bar, and comfortable couches, with trendy, muted colors on the walls and floor. Everything was clean and modern without being cold, a homogenized balancing act designed to keep everyone calm during their stressful time. It was a green room; patients were \\"guests\\"; their families were \\"guests\\" as well. Here was where the families would sit and be feted while they waited to be called out to perform, to smile and encourage or to don faces of appropriate mournfulness. The old ones would put on smiles, the young ones would look sad. I think I went there because it seemed to me that it was the place richest in emotional impact. It reeked of spent emotions, and the emotions were made all the stronger, here in the green room, by the efforts at suppression--the muted walls and gourmet coffees and scones, the overstuffed loveseats and couches, as if those in grief should not be permitted to sit on benches or folding chairs.

One view is that time is part of the fundamental structure of the universe, a dimension in which events occur in sequence.

An opposing view is that time does not refer to any kind of actually existing dimension that events and objects \\"move through\\", nor to any entity that \\"flows\\", but that it is instead an intellectual concept (together with space and number) that enables humans to sequence and compare events. This second view, in the tradition of Gottfried Leibniz and Immanuel Kant, holds that space and time \\"do not exist in and of themselves, but ... are the product of the way we represent things\\", because we can know objects only as they appear to us.

How might one describe the sentiment of this review? I feel like I SHOULD like these guys, given the length of time they've graced Edinburgh's curry scene. Hell, they pretty much established it. And after an initial meh experience some time back, I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt this Friday past.  That proved to be one benefit of the doubt too many.  Recommended by a friend on both occasions (hence the aforementioned benefit), who absolutely swears by them, I can only imagine how his palate would fair in the likes of Mother India Cafe or Ghurka Cafe or Kismot, where they are a little more mercilees with their spicing. Because Khushi's is blaaaaaaand!  My first visit saw me try the Lamb Karahi. My second saw the Old School Lamb Curry.... the former was weak, the latter was barely lucky to call itself a curry. On top of that the starters were nothing to write home about, chicken pakora that I've seen done better by takeaways. Just really nothing special.  I know a few folk that sing their praises, but I think something has gone missing over the years and these guys seem to be running on a decades-old reputation still.

Write a title for this article: (JEFFERSON CITY, Mo.) — A man sentenced to life without parole on a marijuana-related charge was freed Tuesday from a Missouri prison after being behind bars for more than two decades — a period in which the nation’s attitudes toward pot steadily softened. Family, friends, supporters and reporters flocked to meet Jeff Mizanskey as he stepped out of the Jefferson City Correctional Center into a sunny morning, wearing a new pair of white tennis shoes and a shirt that read “I’m Jeff & I’m free.” “I spent a third of my life in prison,” said Mizanskey, now 62, who was greeted by his infant great-granddaughter. “It’s a shame.” After a breakfast of steak and eggs with family, Mizanskey said, he planned to spend his post-prison life seeking a job and advocating for the legalization of marijuana. He criticized sentencing for some drug-related crimes as unfair and described his time behind bars as “hell.” His release followed years of lobbying by relatives, lawmakers and others who argued that the sentence was too stiff and that marijuana should not be forbidden. Mizanskey was sentenced in 1996 — the same year California became the first state to legalize marijuana for medical purposes. Medical marijuana is now legal in 23 states, and recreational marijuana has been legalized in Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, Washington state and Washington, D.C. “The reason he’s getting out is because the public clearly has changed its opinion about marijuana, and it’s just one of many ways in which that has been reflected in recent years,” said Mizanskey’s attorney, Dan Viets. Such “extreme” cases could further fuel changing perceptions of nonviolent drug crimes, said Michele Deitch, a senior lecturer at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Austin at Texas. “These cases really become exhibit A in the need for sentencing reform,” said Deitch, an attorney and expert in criminal-justice policy. Just last year, the heavily Republican Missouri Legislature passed a law to allow certain people with epilepsy to seek treatment with a marijuana extract containing little of the chemical that causes users to feel high and larger amounts of a compound called cannabidiol, or CBD. The patients can include children, Viets said. “Nobody saw that coming,” he said. “That is a pretty radical statement.” Police said Mizanskey conspired to sell 6 pounds of marijuana to a dealer connected with Mexican drug cartels. At the time, the life-with-no-parole sentence was allowed under a Missouri law for repeat drug offenders. Mizanskey already had two drug convictions — one for possession and sale of marijuana in 1984 and another for possession in 1991. He was the only Missouri inmate serving such a sentence for a nonviolent marijuana-related offense when Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon agreed in May to commute his sentence. The commutation allowed Mizanskey to argue for his freedom before a parole board, which granted the request in August. Nixon’s actions are “a reflection of political confidence in changing norms around marijuana use,” said Cecelia Klingele, a criminal justice policy expert at the University of Wisconsin Law School. The governor cited Mizanskey’s nonviolent record, noting that none of his offenses involved selling drugs to children. The law under which he was originally sentenced has been changed. Other states are re-evaluating punishments for drug possession, motivated in large part by the high cost of imprisoning low-level, nonviolent offenders. In Connecticut, a new law will make possession of small amounts of hard drugs, including heroin, cocaine and crack cocaine, a misdemeanor for a first-time offense, rather than an offense carrying up to seven years in prison. Nebraska and Alabama expect to save hundreds of millions of dollars by using new laws to cut down on the number of offenders locked up for possessing small amounts of drugs. In Missouri, backers of two ballot initiatives to legalize pot have permission from the secretary of state to begin collecting signatures to put the issue before voters in 2016. Another petition proposes reducing sentences for nonviolent drug offenders who are serving time with no opportunity for parole. Now that he’s free, Mizanskey said, he will not smoke marijuana. He’s on parole, after all. But if the drug ever becomes legal on the state and federal levels, he said, “definitely.” Title:","output":"\\"From Life Sentence to Freedom: The Story of Jeff Mizanskey and the Changing Perception of Marijuana Laws\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Background: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many days after all young men nationwide had to register for the draft did Newton D. Baker draw numbers blindfolded choosing young men for military service?","output":"Title: Newton D. Baker and the Selective Service: The Blindfolded Draw and its Lasting Impact on U.S. Military Service Introduction The Selective Service Act of 1917 was a game-changing moment in the history of the United States' military service. While the draft had been utilized in the past, primarily during the Civil War, this was the first time that a nationwide, systematic approach would be taken to conscript young men into military service. This article aims to explore the exact timeline of events that transpired around this defining act of legislation, particularly delving into the moment when Newton D. Baker, then-Secretary of War, selected numbers blindfolded to determine which young men would be chosen to serve. Selective Service Act of 1917 and Nationwide Registration The United States declared war on Germany on April 6, 1917, which necessitated a rapid increase in the size of the U.S. Armed Forces. To meet this need, the Selective Service Act was passed and signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson on May 18, 1917. This law required all young men between the ages of 21 and 30 to register for the draft. The age limit was later increased to include those between 18 and 45 years old. Nationwide registration for the draft took place on June 5, 1917. This was a significant event as it established a system in which young men could be called upon to serve their country in times of conflict. Within a few weeks, millions of young men across the country had registered for potential military service. Newton D. Baker's Blindfolded Draw Just over a month after the registration, the pivotal moment arrived when the order of the draftees needed to be determined. This was done in a rather unorthodox manner. On July 20, 1917, Secretary of War Newton D. Baker famously drew numbers while blindfolded at the War Department in Washington, D.C. The purpose of this act was to ensure a fair and random selection of the young men who would be called to serve. In total, approximately 10,000 numbers were drawn to determine the order of induction for the young men who had registered for the draft. This historic event was attended by government officials and members of the press, marking a momentous occasion in the nation's history that signified both its commitment to and the sacrifice required for the war effort. Conclusion Answering the question as to how many days elapsed between nationwide registration and Newton D. Baker's blindfolded draw, we can calculate the exact period. Registration occurred on June 5, 1917, and the blindfolded draw took place on July 20, 1917. By counting the days between these dates, we arrive at a total of 45 days. The Selective Service and subsequent draft marked a crucial turning point in the United States' participation in World War I. This process demonstrated not only the nation's dedication to the war effort but also the willingness of its citizens to step up and serve when called upon. Newton D. Baker's blindfolded draw further exhibited a commitment to impartiality and fairness in determining which young men would be conscripted into military service. Although the draft was met with mixed reactions at the time, it undoubtedly shaped the eventual outcome of the war and laid the foundation for future mobilizations of the U.S. military."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI.  - Gaul (Latin: \\"Gallia\\") was a region of Western Europe during the Iron Age that was inhabited by Celtic tribes, encompassing present day France, Luxembourg, Belgium, most of Switzerland, Northern Italy, as well as the parts of the Netherlands, Central Italy and Germany on the west bank of the Rhine. It covered an area of 190,800 mi² or 494,169 km². According to the testimony of Julius Caesar, Gaul was divided into three parts: Gallia Celtica, Belgica and Aquitania. Archaeologically, the Gauls were bearers of the La Tène culture, which extended across all of Gaul, as well as east to Raetia, Noricum, Pannonia and southwestern Germania during the 5th to 1st centuries BC. During the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, Gaul fell under Roman rule: Gallia Cisalpina was conquered in 203 BC and Gallia Narbonensis in 123 BC. Gaul was invaded after 120 BC by the Cimbri and the Teutons, who were in turn defeated by the Romans by 103 BC. Julius Caesar finally subdued the remaining parts of Gaul in his campaigns of 58 to 51 BC.  - Charlemagne (2 April 742/747/74828 January 814), also known as Charles the Great or Charles I, was King of the Franks. He united much of Europe during the early Middle Ages and laid the foundations for modern France, Germany and the Low Countries. He took the Frankish throne in 768 and became King of Italy in 774. From 800, he served as the first Holy Roman Emperorthe first recognised emperor in Western Europe since the fall of the Western Roman Empire three centuries earlier.  - The French are an ethnic group and nation who are identified with the country of France. This connection may be legal, historical, or cultural.  - A town is a human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. The size definition for what constitutes a \\"town\\" varies considerably in different parts of the world.  - In historiography, the Western Roman Empire consists of the western provinces of the Roman Empire at any one time during which they were administered by a separate independent Imperial court, coequal with (or only nominally subordinate to) that administering the eastern half. Both \\"Western Roman Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" (or \\"Byzantine Empire\\") are modern terms describing \\"de facto\\" independent entities; however, at no point did Romans consider the Empire split into two, but rather considered it a single state governed by two separate Imperial courts out of administrative expediency. The view that the Empire was impossible to govern by one emperor was established by Diocletian following the disastrous civil wars and disintegration of the Crisis of the 3rd century, and was instituted in Roman law by his introduction of the Tetrarchy in AD 285, a form of government which was legally to endure in one form or another for centuries. The Western Court was periodically abolished and recreated for the next two centuries until final abolition by the Emperor Zeno in 480, by which time there was little effective central control left in the area legally administered by the Western Court.  - A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighbourhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement.  - A dispersed settlement, also known as a scattered settlement, is one of the main types of settlement patterns used by landscape historians to classify rural settlements found in England and other parts of the world. Typically, there are a number of separate farmsteads scattered throughout the area. A dispersed settlement contrasts with a nucleated village.  - The Rhine (, , ) is a European river that begins in the Swiss canton of Graubünden in the southeastern Swiss Alps, forms part of the  Swiss-Austrian, Swiss-Liechtenstein, Swiss-German and then the Franco-German border, then flows through the Rhineland and eventually empties into the North Sea in the Netherlands.  The largest city on the river Rhine is Cologne, Germany, with a population of more than 1,050,000 people. It is the second-longest river in Central and Western Europe (after the Danube), at about , with an average discharge of about .  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Hiberni (Ireland), Pictish (northern Britain) and Britons (southern Britain) tribes, all speaking Insular Celtic, inhabited the islands at the beginning of the 1st millennium AD. Much of Brittonic-controlled Britain was conquered by the Roman Empire from AD 43. The first Anglo-Saxons arrived as Roman power waned in the 5th century and eventually dominated the bulk of what is now England. Viking invasions began in the 9th century, followed by more permanent settlements and political change—particularly in England. The subsequent Norman conquest of England in 1066 and the later Angevin partial conquest of Ireland from 1169 led to the imposition of a new Norman ruling elite across much of Britain and parts of Ireland. By the Late Middle Ages, Great Britain was separated into the Kingdoms of England and Scotland, while control in Ireland fluxed between Gaelic kingdoms, Hiberno-Norman lords and the English-dominated Lordship of Ireland, soon restricted only to The Pale. The 1603 Union of the Crowns, Acts of Union 1707 and Acts of Union 1800 attempted to consolidate Britain and Ireland into a single political unit, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands remaining as Crown Dependencies. The expansion of the British Empire and migrations following the Irish Famine and Highland Clearances resulted in the distribution of the islands' population and culture throughout the world and a rapid de-population of Ireland in the second half of the 19th century. Most of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom after the Irish War of Independence and the subsequent Anglo-Irish Treaty (1919–1922), with six counties remaining in the UK as Northern Ireland. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): The Anglo-Saxon empire was conquered by the Roman Empire from when?","output":"Remember that the Roman Empire was really big and powerful a long time ago? Well, they started taking over parts of Britain, where people called Britons lived, around the year AD 43. But the Anglo-Saxons, who were a different group of people, didn't come to Britain until later, around the 5th century. So, it's not quite right to say that the Roman Empire conquered the Anglo-Saxon Empire, because the Anglo-Saxons arrived after the Romans were already there."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The event was held at the Sun Life Stadium (currently known as the Hard Rock Stadium) in Miami Gardens, Florida.  The Who's performance during the halftime show was highly anticipated, as the iconic band had significantly influenced rock and roll music since forming in the 1960s. The band members who performed at the event included founding members Roger Daltrey (vocals) and Pete Townshend (guitar) who were accompanied by additional musicians to support their performance. The setlist for The Who's performance at Super Bowl XLIV featured a medley of some of their greatest hits, delighting both longtime fans and newer audiences alike. The band opened their performance with \\"Pinball Wizard,\\" a track from their 1969 album \\"Tommy.\\" This was followed by \\"Baba O'Riley,\\" a track from the 1971 album \\"Who's Next,\\" which is known for its distinctive synthesizer intro and the famous refrain \\"teenage wasteland.\\" Shifting to a more introspective track, the band then performed an excerpt from \\"Who Are You,\\" the titular song from their 1978 album. This song showcases Roger Daltrey's powerful vocals and Pete Townshend's emotive guitar work, making it a perfect selection for the high-energy show.

This event happened the first summer after we moved to the mountains of Colorado. Wanting to enjoy the beauty of the mountains, my wife and I planned a day hike to the Brown's Creek waterfall. The kids were excited--a day hike, a chance to experience a waterfall, and a day spent with Dad and Mom. Our hike would take us up the Brown's Creek trail   and after about 3 miles the waterfall would be on our left. After slowly climbing the first mile, the trail took us through a beautiful grassland and across the creek   a couple of times. We decided to turn back before reaching the waterfall, mostly because we were tired and still didn't know how much farther  _ was. While crossing the creek by walking on a downed tree trunk, our little Izzie fell into the creek and immediately started moving up and down in the current  . Immediately, I jumped into the creek after her. I managed to grab her and push her to the bank. But now, I was the one in need of being rescued. I thought this might be the end and I wasn't sure if I could hold on. Then, I heard the voice of the love of my life, my wife's voice. She shouted loudly--Stand up! Stand up! With the last bit of strength I had, I stood, and walked out of the creek. The kids showed little concern for my health; they were looking after Izzie, now safe in their arms. But I did hear one of the kids say: Thanks Dad, for saving Izzie. You're our HERO! As we walked back down the trail, I enjoyed a rare, but one of those sweet moments in life, that I wouldn't trade for anything on earth. I didn't care about my wet clothes, the squish   of water in my boots, or the embarrassment of nearly drowning in water; none of that mattered.

My youngest is sweet, loveable, easy-going, and finds joy in everything. My oldest we've nicknamed the \\"Evil Genius\\" is ambitious, self-confident, and suffers no fools. Whenever we mentioned Santa my husband and I were rewarded with major eye rolling and deep sighs from my oldest. At first we both tried to ignore it. We both knew that our eldest had figured out the big secret. But I'd be damned  if he was going to ruin it for his six-year-old brother who had plenty of Santa-loving years ahead of him. I looked at my husband in the eye and said, \\"I'll handle this.\\" to which he responded \\"Okay just be careful because I'm not sure he knows - he might just be acting like it.\\" But I knew. And I had it in my mind that he was about to break his younger brothers spirit and break the news to him. I was afraid he was going to take the Christmas spirit away from my sweet innocent youngest and stamp all over it. I had to protect him. I needed to control this now before it got out of control. I rushed into the play room where my oldest was playing alone. I looked him dead in the eyes and said: \\"Well you know Santa isn't real, right?\\"  And as I stared at my eight-year-old son for what seemed like a long time of silence, his eyes started to fill with tears.

She inferred this from his eye-rolling and deep sighs every time she and her husband mentioned Santa. She was also worried that he might reveal this to his younger brother, ruining the childlike Christmas joy for him. Although her conclusion was based on her son's reactions, it was mainly driven by her fear of losing the magical essence of Christmas for her younger son.

No; Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what forms secondary vascular tissues and bark?\\" is \\"tulips\\", given that  palm trees form secondary vascular tissues and bark? Answer:","output":"In order to answer the question about whether \\"tulips\\" is the right answer to the question \\"what forms secondary vascular tissues and bark?\\" and given the information about palm trees, it is important to have a comprehensive understanding of vascular tissues, bark, and the biological characteristics of tulips and palm trees. First off, we need to clarify the distinction between primary and secondary vascular tissues. Primary vascular tissues are part of the primary growth of plants, which is responsible for their elongation. These tissues include xylem (responsible for transporting water and nutrients in plants) and phloem (conveys sugars and other organic molecules). However, secondary growth is not aimed at increasing the height of the plant but rather to increase its diameter. This type of growth is typical in woody and some herbaceous plants and relies on secondary vascular tissues, which are formed by the activity of the vascular cambium, a dynamic layer of cells responsible for generating new xylem and phloem tissues. Now that we understand the key concepts behind vascular tissues let's discuss the bark. In woody plants, the bark is essentially made up of protective layers of tissue formed outside the vascular cambium, including the phloem, cork cambium, and cork cells. This complex structure serves as an important protective barrier against external pressures, such as abrasions, infections, and dehydration. With this context in mind, let us begin with palm trees. They belong to the family Arecaceae, which includes perennial, evergreen plants of varying sizes. Some species of palm trees undergo secondary growth to form secondary vascular tissues and bark, which offers support, prevents water loss, and defends against predators and pathogens. Therefore, palm trees are indeed an example of plants that form secondary vascular tissues and bark as part of their growth and development processes. On the other hand, tulips belong to the family Liliaceae, which includes a group of herbaceous perennial monocotyledonous plants. Tulips possess primary vascular tissues, such as xylem and phloem, which are critical for distributing water and nutrients within the plant's structure. However, tulips do not typically go through secondary growth and do not form secondary vascular tissues or bark. Instead, tulips primarily rely on their primary growth for support and nutrient distribution. In conclusion, given that tulips do not engage in secondary growth nor develop secondary vascular tissues and bark, the correct answer to the question \\"what forms secondary vascular tissues and bark?\\" is not \\"tulips.\\" While palm trees do form secondary vascular tissues and bark, a more encompassing and accurate answer to this question would be \\"the vascular cambium in woody plants,\\" as this layer of cells is responsible for producing these elements in a range of woody plant species, including palm trees."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Select from: i. Yes; ii. No; Answer:","output":"ii. No; The statement \\"plant growth is reduced\\" is not the correct answer to the question \\"pituitary hormones can be blamed for what?\\" given the context of pituitary hormones being associated with causing obesity in humans. To elaborate, the pituitary gland, often referred to as the \\"master gland\\", is a small pea-sized gland located at the base of the brain. It plays a central role in regulating a wide array of body functions by producing and releasing different types of hormones into the bloodstream. These hormones can impact growth, metabolic processes, reproductive function, stress response, and more in humans. One of the hormones it secretes is the growth hormone (GH), which stimulates the liver and other tissues to secrete Insulin-like Growth Factor-I (IGF-I). IGF-I stimulates the growth of bones and other tissues. Overproduction of this hormone can lead to gigantism in children and acromegaly in adults, while under-production can cause growth failure in children and abnormal body composition in adults. The pituitary gland also produces Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) which stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol – a stress-related hormone. Misregulation of ACTH can lead to Cushing's disease, a disease characterized by obesity, especially around the waist, and a round face among other symptoms. Therefore, pituitary hormones have significant effects on the human body, including obesity. However, these hormones do not directly impact plant growth. Plant growth is regulated by plant hormones (or phytohormones) such as auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, ethylene, and abscisic acid. So, it would not be accurate to claim that pituitary hormones can be blamed for reduced plant growth. The physiological systems and responses of humans and plants are fundamentally different in nature."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Seeing all kinds of recent shooting incidents,I think it should be controlled more strictly than now. Somebody said that the person who has it in mind to kill another can do it without a gun,so the causes of murders are not guns but the trend of despising   life in the US. And they also insist that there is no clear evidence that the increasing number of murders is connected with possession  of guns,so the personal rights should not be restricted  by the reason that there is not enough evidence. Several months ago,I agreed with that partly. But as we know,the private groups like NRA have used the public opinion and persuaded the government to protect their profit. Other weapons such as knives,razors ,bats are made for their own usage. But guns are made for only one reason--to kill someone. Of course,there are people who have guns to protect themselves from the criminals. But crime is getting more cruel and severe nowadays,so actually even if someone has a gun,it is impossible to guard himself completely. As a substitute ,I think,if the possession of guns is controlled more strictly,people can live safer lives than now. There are other reasons to oppose the gun control (e.g.the possession of guns is historical inheritance  and represents that people's resistance  will be against tyrannical   government),but none of them can justify and explain today's serious situation in the US.

The book is partly autobiographical. It follows the adventures of a group of people – the narrator Laurie, the eccentric Dorothea ffoulkes-Corbett (otherwise Aunt Dot), her High Anglican clergyman friend Father Hugh Chantry-Pigg (who keeps his collection of sacred relics in his pockets) – travelling from Istanbul (or Constantinople as Fr. Chantry-Pigg would have it) to Trebizond. A Turkish feminist doctor attracted to Anglicanism acts as a foil to the main characters.  On the way, they meet magicians, Turkish policemen and juvenile British travel-writers, and observe the BBC and Billy Graham on tour. Aunt Dot proposes to emancipate the women of Turkey by converting them to Anglicanism and popularising the bathing hat, while Laurie has more worldly preoccupations. Historical references (British Christianity since the Dissolution of the Monasteries, nineteenth-century travellers to the Ottoman Empire, the First World War, the Fourth Crusade, St. Paul's third missionary journey, Troy) abound.  The geographical canvas is enlarged with the two senior characters eloping to the Soviet Union and the heroine meeting her lover in Turkey, and then her semi-estranged mother in Jerusalem. The final chapters raise multiple issues such as the souls of animals, and culminate in a fatal accident and its aftermath. At another level the book, against its Anglo-Catholic backdrop, deals with the conflict between Laurie's attraction to Christianity and her adulterous love for a married man. This was a problem Macaulay had faced in her own life, having had an affair with the married novelist and former Roman Catholic priest Gerald O'Donovan (1871–1942) from 1920 until his death. The book's opening sentence is,\\"Take my camel, dear\\", said my Aunt Dot, as she climbed down from this animal on her return from High Mass.","output":"The thing that Laurie narrates is a story within the book that is partly autobiographical. In the story, Laurie, the narrator, embarks on a journey with a group of people, including the eccentric Dorothea ffoulkes-Corbett (Aunt Dot), her High Anglican clergyman friend Father Hugh Chantry-Pigg, and a Turkish feminist doctor who is attracted to Anglicanism. They travel from Istanbul (or Constantinople, as Fr. Chantry-Pigg would prefer it to be called) to Trebizond, encountering various characters and situations along the way. Throughout the journey, the group encounters magicians, Turkish policemen, juvenile British travel writers, and even crosses paths with the BBC and Billy Graham. Aunt Dot has a mission to emancipate the women of Turkey by converting them to Anglicanism and promoting the use of bathing hats. Laurie, on the other hand, is more concerned with her own personal and romantic dilemmas. The story is filled with historical references and events, such as the dissolution of the monasteries in Britain, nineteenth-century travelers to the Ottoman Empire, the First World War, the Fourth Crusade, St. Paul's third missionary journey, and the ancient city of Troy. The geographical scope of the story broadens as Aunt Dot and Father Hugh Chantry-Pigg elope to the Soviet Union, and Laurie meets her lover in Turkey and her semi-estranged mother in Jerusalem. At its core, the book explores the conflict between Laurie's attraction to Christianity and her adulterous love for a married man, reflecting the struggles that the author, Rose Macaulay, faced in her own life due to her long-term affair with the married novelist and former Roman Catholic priest, Gerald O'Donovan. Thus, the thing that Laurie narrates is a multifaceted, semi-autobiographical story that encompasses various themes ranging from love, faith, the challenges of women's emancipation, historical events, and personal struggles, all set against a vivid backdrop of Middle Eastern and European landscapes and cultures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Recently I realized that these apparently different activities are linked by the emotions provoked by the two objects of my gaze. First the dogs. When I drive from Andes, N.Y., to Delhi, N.Y., on Route 28, I end up at the Heart of the Catskills Humane Society, where I walk the perimeter looking at the dogs as they sit or move around in their outdoor pen. The moment my car door closes the dogs are alert and begin barking. As I approach the fence they present themselves in a variety of postures that express their personalities. A few won’t rise to the bait. Affecting diffidence, they hang back and don’t look my way. Others station themselves midway between the fence and the back of the pen; they might sit down, as if to say, I’m not going to beg; or they might walk back and forth, keeping their distance and declining to make eye contact. A forward few crowd the fence, tails wagging furiously; they are saying, Take me, I’ll be good, I’ll be fun, I’ll be loyal. Some older dogs who have given up lie down at the back of the enclosure. You’re not going to pick me, they are saying. I want to pick them all, but for all kinds of reasons, it really isn’t time. I have been tantalizing myself and at the same time — and this may be unforgivable — tantalizing them. On the way to Delhi and on the way back I see the cars. They are parked in driveways and on lawns and they are for sale. Like the dogs, they are positioned in ways that speak to me. I spot a sleek silver coupe practically hanging out of the driveway, one tire already on the road, raring to go. Drive me away from all this, it says. But when I stop and get out and read the sign taped to the driver’s seat window, it turns out to be a premature invitation; a key part is missing. I first stopped in July; it’s November and it’s still there, no longer hopeful. Other cars are positioned less aggressively. They aren’t in the driveway and don’t face the road. Instead they sit almost parallel to the house that is ready to bid them goodbye. They are not ready to leave; they wonder if it is something they did; they hope for a second chance; they hope their price is too high. Then there are the cars that are not positioned at all. They are strewn about, the “for sale” sign crudely lettered and as tired as they seem to be; they don’t believe that anyone would want them; they don’t want themselves; they wear the same vacant look as the houses behind them. I don’t want them either. I’m just drawn to their situations and the stories I think they tell. But I do want someone to buy them, if only because that would be some form of renewal. I don’t want them to be sent to the salvage yard just as I don’t want to think of the dogs being put down. Now that I think of it, I feel the same way about houses, especially a house with unkempt lawns, scaling paint and sagging porches. Once it was new and anticipating a glorious future. Now it knows better and wonders when the wrecking ball will be coming. I think I should buy it, fix it up, give it a new lease on life. I want it to be happy, just as I want the cars to be prized and the dogs to be chosen. And most of all I don’t want to feel guilty for not having done enough. What was this article about?","output":"This article is about the author's emotions and thoughts while observing dogs at a Humane Society and cars for sale in driveways and on lawns.

Write some highlights for the following article: Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has echoed the sentiments of new Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal in criticising the demands of their pre-season tour. Wenger said it was 'impossible' to prepare his squad properly for the upcoming Premier League campaign, which begins on August 16, given the demands of their pre-season schedule and players returning later than normal after World Cup duty. VIDEO Scroll down for US Tour not good for United - Van Gaal. Team talk: Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger chats with former Gunner Thierry Henry during a training session at Red Bull Arena. Arsenal are in the United States for a friendly against Major League Soccer (MLS) franchise New York Red Bulls, before heading to Austria for a training camp and then returning to London for the Emirates Cup. 'These training camps in the modern game are decided for commercial reasons and because of the extent of popularity of the club,' the Frenchman told a news conference on Thursday. 'We've never been to the States before and I was very happy to come to New York - a city I love. 'But for purely football reasons, the best thing to do is stay and not travel too much because of the time you waste and the jet-lag you suffer is not ideal.' Worry: Wenger is concerned about the effects of travel on his players in run-up to new season. Arsenal are without a host of internationals following the World Cup and Wenger highlighted the difficulty in players beginning the intense domestic campaign so soon after returning from the tournament. 'This season is a post-World Cup year and very difficult because the time is very short between the final, which was on July 13, and the start of the new season on August 16. 'And compulsory, from FIFA, you are obliged to give four weeks' holiday to the players, so I don't know how all that works together. It looks, to me, impossible.' Wenger's comments came days after Van Gaal said Manchester United's pre-season tour was wrongly being dictated by the club's commercial interests. Commitment: Kriss Olsson and Issac Hayden take part in training session in New Jersey on Thursday. United beat Los Angeles Galaxy 7-0 on Wednesday, and now face games in Denver, Washington and Detroit. Van Gaal's team potentially face a fifth game on August 4, less than two weeks before they kick off their Premier League season at home to Swansea City on August 16. 'More or less, yes,' Van Gaal told British media in the United States, when asked whether the demands were hindering their preparations. 'We have to prepare the season and when you have commercial activities and dreadful distances, having to fly a lot and the jet lag, it is not very positive for a good preparation.'

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. If viruses often infect prokaryotes, then what do viruses often infect?  Answer choices: - prokaryotes  - mammals  - dead h2o particles  - volume  - insects  - A computer  - the skin  - clouds The answer to this question is:","output":"prokaryotes. Viruses are infectious agents that can infect a wide range of hosts, including bacteria, archaea, protozoa, fungi, plants, and animals. However, the majority of viruses are highly host-specific, meaning they have evolved to infect only specific cells or tissues within their host organisms. Prokaryotes, which are single-celled organisms without a nucleus, are often victims of viral infections. They consist of two main groups: bacteria and archaea. Viruses that infect prokaryotes are known as bacteriophages or simply phages. Bacteriophages are highly diverse, and they can be found in various environments, such as soil, water, and the human body. Mammals, including humans, can also be infected by viruses. Some well-known examples of viruses that infect mammals are the influenza virus, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). These viruses can cause a wide range of illnesses, from mild colds to life-threatening diseases. However, mammals are not the primary target of the majority of viruses. Insects can be affected by viruses as well. These viruses may cause diseases in the insects or use them as vectors to transmit diseases to other organisms, such as plants or vertebrates. For example, the Zika virus primarily infects mosquitoes, which in turn transmit the virus to humans, causing severe neurological disorders in some cases. Viruses can also infect computers, although these are not biological viruses. Computer viruses are malicious software programs that replicate themselves and spread to other computers, often causing damage to the infected systems. The other answer choices listed – dead H2O particles, volume, the skin, and clouds – are not accurate descriptions of the primary targets of viral infections. While some viruses can affect the skin (such as the herpes simplex virus, which causes cold sores), the skin itself is not a primary target for the majority of viruses. Dead H2O particles, volume, and clouds are all non-living entities and thus cannot be infected by viruses, as viruses require living host cells to reproduce. In conclusion, the correct answer to the question is prokaryotes, as viruses often infect these single-celled organisms without a nucleus. Viruses can infect a wide range of hosts, but their primary targets vary according to their host specificity and the environments in which they thrive."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We have to find the value of 'a' in this equation: 2639 * a = 2653 * a - 42 To do that, first, let's get all the 'a' parts on one side of the equation.  So, we'll subtract 2639 * a from both sides: (2639 * a) - (2639 * a) = (2653 * a) - 42 - (2639 * a) That leaves us: 0 = (2653 * a) - (2639 * a) - 42 Now, let's subtract the 'a's from each other: 0 = (14 * a) - 42, because (2653-2639 = 14) Next, we'll add 42 to both sides to move 42 over: 42 = 14 * a Finally, we'll divide both sides by 14 to find the value of 'a': a = 42 / 14 So, after the division, we'll find that: a = 3 There you go!

The Reconquest: The aim of the Crusades in Spain was the eviction of the Muslims. After the recovery of Jerusalem in 1099, it took four hundred years of sieges and battles, treaties, betrayals, and yet more battles, before Christian kings and warlords succeeded in subduing the Moors. On 10 September 1229, a Catalan army led by King Jaume I of Aragón and Catalunya took the Mallorcan shore near the present-day resort of Santa Ponça. The defenders retreated inside the walls of Palma, but on the last day of 1229 the city fell, and pockets of resistance throughout the island were also defeated. Jaume I proved to be an enlightened ruler who profited from the talents of the Moors — converted by force to Christianity — as well as of the island's large Jewish and Genoese trading communities. Mallorca prospered. The Moors on Menorca speedily agreed to pay an annual tribute to Aragón and were left in peace. The island's tranquility lasted until 1287, when Alfonso III of Aragón, smarting over a series of humiliations at the hands of his nobles, found a pretext for invasion. The Moors were defeated and expelled or killed. In contrast to Mallorca, Menorca's economy was devastated for decades. Jaume I died after reigning in Aragón for six decades, but he made the cardinal error of dividing between his sons the lands he had fought for so long to unite. At first this resulted in an Independent Kingdom of Mallorca, under Jaume II, followed by Sanç and Jaume III. But family rivalry triggered the overthrow of Jaume III by his cousin Pedro IV, who then seized the Balearics for Aragón. Attempting a comeback, Jaume was killed in battle near Llucmajor in 1349. A newly unified Christian Spain under the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, completed the Reconquest, defeating the only Moorish enclave left on the Iberian peninsula, Granada, in 1492. However, the centralized kingdom failed to incorporate the Balearics politically or economically.

Tuesday, September 11, 2001, dawned temperate and nearly cloudless in the eastern United States. Millions of men and women readied themselves for work. Some made their way to the Twin Towers, the signature structures of the World Trade Center complex in New York City. Others went to Arlington, Virginia, to the Pentagon. Across the Potomac River, the United States Congress was back in session. At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, people began to line up for a White House tour. In Sarasota, Florida, President George W. Bush went for an early morning run. For those heading to an airport, weather conditions could not have been better for a safe and pleasant journey. Among the travelers were Mohamed Atta and Abdul Aziz al Omari, who arrived at the airport in Portland, Maine. Boston: American 11 and United 175. Atta and Omari boarded a 6:00 A.M. flight from Portland to Boston's Logan International Airport. When he checked in for his flight to Boston, Atta was selected by a computerized prescreening system known as CAPPS (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System), created to identify passengers who should be subject to special security measures. Under security rules in place at the time, the only consequence of Atta's selection by CAPPS was that his checked bags were held off the plane until it was confirmed that he had boarded the aircraft. This did not hinder Atta's plans. Atta and Omari arrived in Boston at 6:45. Seven minutes later, Atta apparently took a call from Marwan al Shehhi, a longtime colleague who was at another terminal at Logan Airport. They spoke for three minutes.

This crucial battle was fought between the Royalist army under the command of King Charles I and the Parliamentarian New Model Army, led by Sir Thomas Fairfax and Oliver Cromwell. Naseby, situated in the county of Northamptonshire, England, witnessed one of the most significant combat encounters during the 17th century. It was a turning point that ultimately shifted the tide in favor of the Parliamentarian forces, significantly weakening the Royalists. In 1645, that fateful summer day, the Parliamentarian forces emerged victorious, with the Royalists suffering heavy losses. This defeat severely curtailed King Charles I's power, marking the beginning of the end for his cause in the English Civil War. By 1646, Royalist resistance was severely diminished, and King Charles I surrendered to the Scottish forces in May of that same year. Eventually, in 1648, the conflict reignited, leading to the Second English Civil War, which in turn led to King Charles I's trial and execution in 1649. The Battle of Naseby, which took place on June 14, 1645, not only changed the course of the English Civil War but also contributed to the historical significance of the conflict, ultimately leading to the ascension of Oliver Cromwell as Lord Protector of England and the establishment of a republican Commonwealth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

So, adjusting the size of the fluffy ball should be our priority.    2. In option A, if the ball already doesn't fit inside the cap, adding more stuffing will only make it more difficult to fit the ball inside the cap. This goes against our objective. 3. In option B, placing the ball inside the cap is the first step to see if it fits. If the ball doesn't fit, it implies that it might be too big or over-stuffed. 4. The next logical step in option B is to remove some stuffing. This would help reduce the size of the fluffy ball, making it easier to fit inside the cap. 5.

Question: Process: - Blood carried into kidney by the renal artery - Nephrons in the kidney filter the blood - The waste that is filtered out mixes with water - Become urine - Ureters carry urine out of the kidneys.  Question: suppose if solid food is eaten happens, how will it affect MORE waste being removed from the body.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"If solid food is consumed, it will have an impact on waste production and removal in the body, specifically through the digestive system. However, the waste removal process in the kidneys is more related to filtering and cleaning the blood, which is not directly affected by the consumption of solid food. Therefore, we can analyze how solid food consumption affects waste production and removal in different aspects of the body. A typical meal containing solid food consists of various nutrients such as carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. These nutrients are broken down, absorbed, and used by the body to provide energy, support growth, and maintain overall health. The digestive system processes solid food by breaking it down into smaller components, which are then absorbed into the bloodstream and used by the cells. The waste generated during this process is expelled from the body through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. As more solid food is consumed, the body produces more waste in the form of feces. Consuming a higher amount of solid food can lead to an increase in waste elimination through the GI tract. Now, let us consider the impact of solid food consumption on the waste removal process in the kidneys. The main function of the kidneys is to filter the blood and remove waste products and excess water, which are combined to form urine. This urine is then carried out of the kidneys by the ureters and stored in the bladder before being excreted through the urethra. The amount of waste removed by the kidneys is influenced by factors such as fluid intake, blood pressure, and blood composition. Consuming more solid food does not directly affect these factors. Fluid intake, which can influence urine production, is primarily associated with the consumption of liquids such as water, tea, and juice. However, certain components of solid food can have an indirect effect on the kidneys. For instance, an excessive intake of sodium, which is often found in processed foods, can lead to an increase in blood pressure. This can have a negative impact on kidney function over the long term. In conclusion, consuming more solid food primarily leads to an increase in waste production and removal in the GI tract (Option A: More), but it does not have a direct effect on the waste removal process in the kidneys. However, consuming specific components in solid foods, such as excessive sodium, can have an indirect impact on kidney function and waste removal over time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If you have a rabbit with aggressive or vicious tendencies, hitting the bunny will only make it more scared and stressed out. You want to earn its trust so that it will feel more comfortable around you. Try putting your bunny and its cage into a small room, like the bathroom. Close the door, and then open the door to your bunny’s cage. Sit in the room with your rabbit, but let it decide when it wants to come out of its cage. Ignore your rabbit while you let it sniff you and hop around the room. Don’t pick your bunny up or even pet it. Try this a few times. Eventually, your rabbit will be used to you, and won’t see you as a threat. Rather than jumping right into holding or cuddling your bunny, take some time to let it warm up to you. This applies to any new people (or even other animals) that your bunny will encounter in its everyday life. If you let your bunny warm up to people at its own pace without forcing it, it will feel more relaxed and willing to interact. At first, you might try wearing gloves to protect your hands when handling your rabbit. Then, after some time and a few sessions of letting your rabbit get to know you and it hasn’t shown aggression or viciousness, you can take the gloves off. Keep an eye on your rabbit to see what things might be triggering its vicious response. It could be a certain noise, like the garbage disposal or the hair dryer, or it could be someone moving too quickly. Once you identify the things that seem to trigger the bad behavior, make sure to avoid those triggers. Stress can lead to aggression in rabbits. Aggression is their way of defending or protecting themselves when they feel threatened. If you work to avoid putting your rabbit in the situations that make it feel stressed or threatened, its aggressive and vicious behaviors will likely lessen. Children sometimes misunderstand the proper way to handle and interact with animals, and your rabbit might bite or nip a child that handles it incorrectly. Encourage children to touch your rabbit gently, speak softly, and avoid startling it.","output":"You should never hit, yell, or force your rabbit to show affection. If your rabbit acts mean, don't be rough with it, as that can make it scared and stressed. Instead, let your rabbit get to know you slowly in a safe place and avoid things that scare it.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Fred Hampton (August 30, 1948 - December 4, 1969) was an African-American activist and revolutionary, chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party (BPP), and deputy chairman of the national BPP. Hampton and fellow Black Panther Mark Clark were killed during a raid by a tactical unit of the Cook County, Illinois State's Attorney's Office, in conjunction with the Chicago Police Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in December 1969. In January 1970, a coroner's jury held an inquest and ruled the deaths of Hampton and Clark to be justifiable homicide. However, a civil lawsuit was later filed on behalf of the survivors and the relatives of Hampton and Clark. About the same time that Hampton was successfully organizing young African-Americans for the NAACP, the Black Panther Party (BPP) started rising to national prominence. Hampton was quickly attracted to the Black Panthers' approach, which was based on a ten-point program that integrated black self-determination on the basis of Maoism. Hampton joined the Party and relocated to downtown Chicago, and in November 1968 he joined the Party's nascent Illinois chapter--founded by Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) organizer Bob Brown in late 1967. Over the next year, Hampton and his associates made a number of significant achievements in Chicago. Perhaps his most important accomplishment was his brokering of a nonaggression pact between Chicago's most powerful street gangs. Emphasizing that racial and ethnic conflict between gangs would only keep its members entrenched in poverty, Hampton strove to forge a class-conscious, multi-racial alliance between the BPP, the Young Patriots Organization, and the Young Lords under the leadership of Jose Cha Cha Jimenez.  Fred Hampton met the Young Lords in the Chicago Lincoln Park Neighborhood, the day after the Young Lords were in the news after they had occupied a police community workshop meeting, held on the second floor hall of the Chicago 18th District Police Station. Later, the Rainbow Coalition was joined nationwide by the Students for a Democratic Society (\\"SDS\\"), the Brown Berets, and the Red Guard Party. In May 1969, Hampton called a press conference to announce that this \\"rainbow coalition\\" had formed. It was a phrase coined by Hampton and made popular over the years by Reverend Jesse Jackson, who eventually appropriated the name in forming his own, unrelated, coalition, Rainbow/PUSH.  Hampton's organizing skills, substantial oratorical gifts, and personal charisma allowed him to rise quickly in the Black Panthers. Once he became leader of the Chicago chapter, he organized weekly rallies, worked closely with the BPP's local People's Clinic, taught political education classes every morning at 6am, and launched a project for community supervision of the police. Hampton was also instrumental in the BPP's Free Breakfast Program. When Brown left the Party with Stokely Carmichael in the FBI-fomented SNCC/Panther split, Hampton assumed chairmanship of the Illinois state BPP, automatically making him a national BPP deputy chairman. As the Panther leadership across the country began to be decimated by the impact of the FBI's COINTELPRO, Hampton's prominence in the national hierarchy increased rapidly and dramatically. Eventually, Hampton was in line to be appointed to the Party's Central Committee's Chief of Staff. He would have achieved this position had it not been for his death on the morning of December 4, 1969. What was his position in the Black Panthers?","output":"Fred Hampton's position in the Black Panthers was the chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party (BPP) and deputy chairman of the national BPP.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less aluminum cans put into recycle bins happens, how will it affect more aluminum sorted at recycling facility.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the perturbation hypothesis you have proposed would indeed have a direct effect on the process of aluminum recycling. If fewer aluminum cans are put into recycling bins, this would result in a decrease in the amount of aluminum that is available to be sorted at the recycling facility. This reduction in aluminum supply would cause several consequences, including: 1. The recycling facility would have less aluminum to process, which could lead to reduced efficiency and lower production rates. This could potentially harm their profitability and impact their ability to operate. 2. A lower supply of recycled aluminum can lead to increased demand for virgin aluminum, which is obtained from mining and processing raw bauxite ore. This process is more energy-intensive and damaging to the environment when compared to recycling aluminum. 3. Less aluminum recycling would contribute to a higher amount of aluminum waste in landfills, which could result in negative environmental impacts such as more greenhouse gas emissions and the potential for pollutants to leach into surrounding ecosystems. 4. Aluminum recycling is a vital part of preserving our resources and lowering our environmental impact. If less aluminum is sorted at the recycling facility, this can potentially increase the costs associated with producing new aluminum products due to the higher demand for virgin aluminum. In conclusion, if less aluminum is placed into recycling bins, it will directly affect the amount of aluminum sorted at recycling facilities. This perturbation in the recycling process can have numerous consequences on the efficiency of recycling facilities, environmental impacts, and the overall demand and cost of producing aluminum products."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Allegations of vote manipulation, unfair campaign practices, and favoritism toward the PDG have significantly increased tensions between the ruling party and its critics, culminating in the boycott of the speaker's election. As per the constitution, the National Assembly Speaker holds considerable influence and responsibility in the legislative proceedings, such as setting the agenda, moderating debates, and deciding on crucial procedural questions. Boycotting the election is a powerful symbol of disapproval, as it reflects the opposition's lack of faith both in the electoral process and in the country's governance. While the Gabonese opposition has not given much hope for a reconciliation between the parties or outlined a clear course of action beyond the boycott, it has urged for increased international scrutiny and monitoring of all electoral proceedings. It is believed that this could help in deterring fraudulent practices and restoring public confidence in the democratic processes of Gabon. In response to the boycott, the Gabonese government led by President Ali Bongo Ondimba has reiterated its commitment to free and fair elections, dismissing the allegations of unfairness and bias. However, this has not convinced the opposition parties, who claim that the National Assembly's composition does not accurately represent the electorate's will, thereby making the legislative body illegitimate and unrepresentative. The political crisis in Gabon sparks concern among regional and international players for several reasons. Gabon is one of the largest oil producers in the sub-Saharan Africa, making it an essential market player in global energy. Additionally, the nation holds a strategic geopolitical position in Central Africa, which makes it an influential force in the African Union. Thus, any political unrest within the country could have wider implications both economically and diplomatically. In conclusion, the boycott of the National Assembly Speaker's election by the Gabonese opposition signifies a deeply rooted distrust in the political system and an urgent need for reform. International observers and diplomatic partners must engage with Gabon's political leadership to help address these grievances and restore stability in the country. Without constructive dialogue and credible actions towards greater transparency and inclusiveness, Gabon's political tensions will continue to escalate, potentially leading to severe consequences for the nation and the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is because the given information states that Logan got pink eye, and Option 1 explains how he was exposed to the infection while Eric, who remained clear, wasn't mentioned to be exposed in this option. Continuing the story: Logan got pink eye but Eric was clear, because Logan played with people who had been exposed. Unaware of the risk, Logan had spent time with friends who had unknowingly been in contact with someone who already had pink eye. They had all gathered at a park for a game of pickup basketball, sharing the ball and high fives as they played. The contagious nature of pink eye allowed the infection to spread easily among the group. Eric, on the other hand, had played soccer with a separate group of people on the other side of the park. Although some members of his group had been exposed to pink eye too, Eric was fortunate enough to have minimal contact with those individuals, primarily interacting with those who were unaffected. As a result, he managed to avoid catching the infection. After recognizing the connection between Logan's pink eye and his time spent with the exposed friends, both Logan and Eric took extra precautions to ensure proper hygiene, washing their hands regularly and keeping an eye out for any symptoms of the infection. Logan treated his pink eye with the necessary medications and was ultimately able to fully recover, while Eric remained clear and healthy. In the future, they both became more vigilant about their interactions and were careful to avoid such risks."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

As of 2015, Parkway Drive has released five full-length albums (\\"Killing with a Smile\\", \\"Horizons\\", \\"Deep Blue\\", \\"Atlas\\" and \\"Ire\\"), one EP, two DVDs, a split album and one book, titled \\"Ten Years of Parkway Drive\\". The band's latest four albums have reached the top 10 of the Australian ARIA Charts, with \\"Ire\\" reaching number 1 in October 2015.  - Grindcore is an extreme genre of music that originated in the early to mid-1980s. It draws inspiration from some of the most abrasive-sounding genres  including hardcore punk, thrash metal, crust punk, industrial, death metal and noise rock. Grindcore is characterized by a noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdriven bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups like Napalm Death are credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as Brutal Truth and Nasum. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and black humor.  - Pantera was an American heavy metal band from Arlington, Texas. The group was formed in 1981 by the Abbott brothers  drummer Vinnie Paul and guitarist Dimebag Darrell  along with vocalist Terry Glaze. Bassist Rex Brown joined the band the following year, replacing the original unofficial bass guitarist Tommy D. Bradford. Having started as a glam metal band, Pantera released four albums during the 1980s. Looking for a new and heavier sound, Pantera replaced Glaze with Phil Anselmo in late 1986 and released \\"Power Metal\\" in 1988. With its fifth album, 1990's \\"Cowboys from Hell\\", Pantera introduced a groove metal sound. Pantera's sixth album, 1992's \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\", exhibited an even heavier sound. \\"Far Beyond Driven\\" (1994) debuted at number one on the \\"Billboard\\" 200.  - Age of Ruin is an American metalcore band from Fairfax, Virginia. The group formed in 1998 and released a demo album the following year. The band's first full-length album was self-released in 2000.   - Metalcore is a broad fusion genre of extreme metal and hardcore punk. The word is a blend of the names of the two genres. Among other genres blending metal and hardcore, such as crust punk and grindcore, metalcore is noted for its use of breakdowns, which are slow, intense passages that are conducive to moshing. Pioneering metalcore bandssuch as Integrity, Earth Crisis and Converge, all of which had formed by 1990are described as leaning more toward hardcore, with their style sometimes being called metallic hardcore, whereas later bandssuch as Killswitch Engage, All That Remains, As I Lay Dying, Bullet for My Valentine, and Parkway Drive are described as leaning more towards metal. Pantera (who influenced Trivium, Atreyu, Bleeding Through and Unearth) and Sepultura have been particularly influential to the development of metalcore in the 2000s, which saw many bands in the genre achieve considerable commercial success.  - Bleeding Through was an American metalcore band from Orange County, California. Formed in 1999, the band blended influences stemming from modern hardcore punk, symphonic black metal, and melodic death metal. Although the band was often labeled as simply metalcore, when Brandan Schieppati was asked if he considered Bleeding Through a hardcore band, he said: \\"I think we're a hardcore band and I'll never say we are a metal band, we're all hardcore kids and we came from the hardcore scene. Ours is just a different version of hardcore, we're trying to do something which adds a different variety to the hardcore scene, which has been sounding the same way for so long.\\"  - Alveran Records was a German-based independent record label, founded in 1995 by Sascha Franzen, which releases a diverse variety of bands with different musical styles. Mainly focused on everything between metal and hardcore, there are also rock, emo and punk bands who find their way to the label's roster. Alveran is also the European partner for the US-based labels Eulogy Recordings and Hand of Hope Records. In April 2006, Alveran became the official partner of Abacus Recordings in Europe, providing Alveran the opportunity to release selected titles from the Abacus Recordings catalogue in Europe as partners.  - The Tides Of Tragedy is the second full - length album by American metalcore band Age of Ruin . It was released in the United States on June 22 , 2004 via Eulogy Records and in Europe on December 13 , 2004 via Alveran Records .  - Extreme metal is a loosely defined umbrella term for a number of related heavy metal music subgenres that have developed since the early 1980s. It has been defined as a \\"cluster of metal subgenres characterized by sonic, verbal and visual transgression\\". The term usually refers to a more abrasive, harsher, underground, non-commercialized style or sound associated with the speed metal, thrash metal, death metal, black metal and doom metal genres. With the exception of doom metal, all of these genres are characterized by fast tempos, attesting to their roots in hardcore punk, which has also fused with extreme metal in the forms of crossover thrash, crust punk, grindcore, sludge metal and metalcore. Though many extreme sub-styles are not very well known to mainstream music fans, extreme metal has influenced an array of musical performers inside and outside of heavy metal.  - Bullet for My Valentine, often abbreviated as BFMV or B4MV, are a Welsh heavy metal band from Bridgend, formed in 1998. The band is composed of Matthew Tuck (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Michael Paget (lead guitar, backing vocals), Michael Thomas (drums) and Jamie Mathias (bass guitar). Former members include Nick Crandle and Jason James; both were on bass. They were formed under the name Jeff Killed John and started their music career by covering songs by Metallica and Nirvana. Jeff Killed John recorded six songs which were not released; two of these tracks were reworked later in their career as Bullet for My Valentine. Financial difficulties dictated the name change, which was followed by a change in music direction. In 2002, the band secured a five-album deal with Sony BMG. The band has stated that their music is influenced by classic metal acts such as Metallica, Iron Maiden and Slayer. The band is part of the Cardiff music scene.  - Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics.  - Killswitch Engage is an American metalcore band from Westfield, Massachusetts, formed in 1999 after the disbanding of Overcast and Aftershock. Killswitch Engage's current lineup consists of vocalist Jesse Leach, guitarists Joel Stroetzel and Adam Dutkiewicz, bassist Mike D'Antonio, and drummer Justin Foley. The band has released seven studio albums and one DVD. Their latest album, \\"Incarnate\\", was released on March 11, 2016.

Detailed Instructions: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'.

Iceland is located closer to the North Pole, while Ecuador is located near the Equator.  Which country will feel the effects of climate change more drastically?  Hint: During the Cold War, the Arctic became a place where the United States, Canada, and the Soviet Union performed significant research that has been essential to the study of climate change in recent years. A major reason why research in the Arctic is essential for the study of climate change is because the effects of climate change will be felt more quickly and more drastically in higher latitudes of the world as above average temperatures are predicted for Northwest Canada and Alaska. From an anthropological point of view, researchers study the native Inuit peoples of Alaska as they have become extremely accustomed to adapting to ecological and climate variability.[1] Answer:","output":"Based on the given information and understanding climate change, it is suggestive that Iceland, which is situated closer to the North Pole, will feel the effects of climate change more drastically than Ecuador, which is located near the Equator.  High-latitude regions like Iceland are experiencing the effects of climate change at a faster rate because these regions tend to absorb more heat as the snow and ice, which usually reflect sunlight, melt down due to rising global temperatures. This process, known as the albedo effect, accelerates global warming. Evidence of this impact can be seen through rapid glacial melt, thawing permafrost, and shrinking sea ice in Arctic regions.  The research conducted in the Arctic during the Cold War suggests that regions situated closer to the poles are more sensitive to climate changes. For instance, studies have predicted above-average temperatures for Northwest Canada and Alaska, both high latitude regions.  The anthropology study of the native Inuit peoples of Alaska further implies the grave impact of climate change on regions closer to the poles; these communities have needed to adapt significantly to ecological and climate change because of their geographical location.  So, while both Ecuador and Iceland will indeed experience impacts from climate change, Iceland, due to its polar proximity, is likely to face those impacts more rapidly and perhaps more severely."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Problem:Passage: One of Greenway's finest works, St James' is listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate. It has been called an \\"architectural gem\\" and was featured by Dan Cruickshank in the BBC television series Around the World in 80 Treasures. From 1966 to 1993 the spire of St James' appeared on the Australian Australian ten-dollar note among other Greenway buildings. In 1973, the church appeared on a 50 cent postage stamp, one of four in a series illustrating Australian architecture issued to commemorate the opening of the Sydney Opera House. The Old Supreme Court building, also designed by Greenway with alternations by others, located next to the church is of the same date. Across the square is Greenway's \\"masterpiece\\", the UNESCO World Heritage listed-Hyde Park Barracks, designed to align with the church. Beside the barracks stands Sydney's oldest public building, part of the General Hospital built in 1811 and now known as the Mint Building. Separated from the Mint by the present-day Sydney Hospital is Parliament House, Sydney, of which the central section is a further part of the early hospital, and is now home to the New South Wales State Parliament.The church was constructed between 1820 and 1824 with later additions made in 1834 by John Verge who designed the vestries at the eastern end. Apart from these vestries, which retain the established style and proportions, the church externally remains \\"fine Georgian\\" much as Greenway conceived it. Relying on the \\"virtues of simplicity and proportion to achieve his end\\", Greenway maintained the classical tradition, unaffected by the Revivalist styles that were being promoted in London at the time he arrived in the colony. He planned the church to align with his earlier Hyde Park Barracks, constructed in 1817–19. The two buildings have similar proportions, pilasters and gables and together constitute an important example of town-planning. Before the advent of high-rise buildings, the 46-metre (150 ft) spire used to \\"serve as a guide for mariners coming up Port Jackson\\".St James' originally took the form of a simple rectangular block, without transepts or chancel, with a tower at the western end and a classical portico of the Doric order on either side. To this has been added Verge's vestry framed by two small porticos, and a similar portico as an entrance to the tower. The church is built of local brick, its walls divided by brick pilasters into a series of bays. The walls are pierced by large windows with round arched heads in a colour that separates and defines them against the walls. The roof carries over the end walls with the gable forming triangular pediments of classical proportions carrying a cornice across the eaves line. Thus the architectural treatment on the side walls is continued around the end walls.  Question: What is the name of the church constructed between 1820 and 1824 with later additions made in 1834 by John Verge who designed the vestries at the eastern end?

Question: A federal judge on Thursday rejected efforts by Texas to stop the resettlement of Syrian refugees within its borders. The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others? Millions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations. In 1951 the United Nation's Refugee Convention defined a refugee as someone who \\"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\\" By the end of 2014, there were 19.5 million refugees worldwide, according to the United Nations, 14.4 million of whom were under the mandate of the United Nations Human Rights Council. This was an increase of 2.9 million from 2013. The remaining 5.1 million refugees were registered with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. However, there are an estimated 59.5 million forcibly displaced persons around the world, according to United Nation's Global Trends report. This population not only includes refugees, but internally displaced persons, asylum-seekers and stateless people as well. President Barack Obama has set...

Question: Lawrence and Adam both wake up to find what in their pockets? Movie title: Saw Movie plot: A young man, David (Whannell), is in an interrogation room talking to an unnamed, unsympathetic police officer (Paul Moder). David is in handcuffs, and he has blood on his face and shirt. He is smoking a cigarette. He tells the officer that after he finished his work as an orderly at the hospital, he was knocked unconscious and taken to a large room. Inside the room, David was strapped to a chair with a large, rusty metal device locked onto his head. To his left was a small television, which began playing a video showing a frightening puppet that tells him that the device on his head is a \\"reverse beartrap\\", which is hooked into his jaws and will pry his face open with great force if he does not unlock it in time. The puppet tells David that the only key to unlock the device is in the stomach of his dead cellmate (Dean Francis). David is able to break free of his bonds, but by doing so he sets off a timer on the back of the device. Across the room, he finds the body that the puppet mentioned, but also finds that the man is actually alive but under paralysis. David panics and stabs his cellmate before starting to look for the key. He slices into the man's stomach and after finding the key, David unlocks the device and throws it to the ground, just as it snaps open. David begins screaming and weeping in horror. At the entrance to the room, the puppet from the video appears on a tricycle. He congratulates David on surviving, and tells him that he has proven he is no longer ungrateful for being alive. The movie ends with the police officer asking \\"Are you grateful, David?\\" causing the young man to again break down. As the end credits begin to roll, a CGI replica of the bathroom used later in the full Saw film is shown, although with some differences.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  On the day that France surrenders to Nazi Germany in 1940, Prudence \\"Pru\\" Cathaway a strong-willed young woman from the upper class, joins the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, a military organisation linked to the Royal Air Force, to her family's surprise. Her aunt Iris and uncle Wilbur disapprove since she has chosen to serve as a private rather than as an officer. However, family butler Parsons privately expresses his support. She goes off to training camp, where she makes friends with fellow WAAF Violet Worthing. As a favor to Violet, Prudence agrees to go on a double date one night; she is paired with Clive Briggs, a moody mysterious man with a dark secret. He seems to her rather bitter about something and is indifferent, even hostile, to her aristocratic background, but she likes him, and he asks her out again. Romance blooms.

Context: What do apples, pears and oranges all have in common? If you answered that they are all fruits you are absolutely correct. If you answered that they are all good for your health you are spot on again. Fruits used to be a staple in many diets, however in amongst all of the low carb and anti sugar chaos, many people are now avoiding them. In a rush to rid the diet of ‘toxic sugar’, fruit has fallen on the wayside. However, many studies have shown that fruit is not linked to any adverse health effects, quite the opposite in fact. Most recently researchers in Sweden discovered that eating a diet high in fruits could reduce the risk of an often lethal form of aortic aneurysm. The study collected data from over 80,000 people over a 13 year period and found that people eating at least two whole fruits per day, reduced the risk of developing  an abdominal aortic aneurysm by almost a third. The main fruits that were eaten were apples, pears, bananas, oranges and other citrus fruits. The fruits’ high antioxidant levels may offer protection by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Eating whole fruits can also reduced the risk of developing diabetes. Earlier this year a study published in the British Medical Journal revealed that certain whole fruits – in particular blueberries, grapes, apples and pears – could lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The study found that over an 18-year period, 6.5% of the 187,382 participants developed diabetes, but those consuming at least two serves of fruit per week reduced their risk by up to 23%. In the same study those who consumed two or more serves of fruit juice per day increased their risk of developing diabetes by as much as 21%. As Tim wrote in a previous blog post, this is reason why you should be eating your fruit, not drinking it Question: What does the author probably think? Answer: A:","output":"Based on the context, the author probably thinks that consuming whole fruits, such as apples, pears, bananas, and citrus fruits, has a positive impact on health.

Answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  the snow fort in the backyard  for the following movie plot:  Peter Beaupre, Alice Ribbons, Burton Jernigan, and Earl Unger, four internationally wanted hitmen working for a North Korean terrorist group, have stolen a US10 million missile cloaking computer chip. The thieves put it inside a remote control car to sneak it past security at San Francisco International Airport. However, a luggage mix-up occurs, causing a woman named Mrs. Hess to inadvertently take the thieves' bag containing the remote control car while returning home to Chicago. The four thieves arrive in Chicago and systematically search every house in Hess's suburban neighborhood to find the chip. Meanwhile, Alex Pruitt is given the remote control car by Hess for shoveling snow, but she lectures him for scratching numerous itches. He returns home and removes his shirt to discover that he has chickenpox, and therefore must stay out of school. While recovering at home, Alex uses his telescope and discovers the thieves on look out for the chip. Wondering what the thieves want with a remote control car, Alex opens it and discovers the stolen chip. He informs the local Air Force Recruitment Center about the chip while asking if they can forward the information about the chip to someone. The thieves conclude that Alex has been watching them and decide to pursue him. As a snowstorm hits Chicago, the thieves block off the road to the house, and Alice duct tapes Hess to a chair in her garage and leaves the door open. By this point, Alex has armed his house with booby traps and prepares to set them off with his pet rat, Doris, and the loud-mouthed pet parrot of his brother, Stan. After several break-in attempts, the thieves manage to make it into the house, despite falling into Alex's traps. They begin to search the house to find Alex. Alex runs to the attic and goes into the dumbwaiter down to the basement, and runs outside and calls to Alice, Jernigan and Unger. The thieves see Alex and notice a trampoline below them.

Please answer the following question: When I was entering my Sophomore year in High School, we had just moved from a single 4-way stop-sign town, to a bigger city with actual city buses! In order to get to school, I had to ride a city bus for the 1st time, without information/assistance! I barely managed to squeeze in and had to stand on the step of the packed bus on the way to school. BTW, smoking was STILL happening on these buses! I noticed every time we went around a corner, it seemed a bell would ring. I falsely assumed it meant HANG ON! So, when it was time to return home, the bus was not as crowded, and I actually was able to sit down. Again, every time we turned the corner, a bell would ring. So I held on tight! As we neared my bus stop to get off, the bus whizzed past it, without stopping! Panic began to set in quickly. I already had a very strange, long day in a new 3 story school building, and I smelled like cigarette smoke! I quickly moved to the empty seat behind the driver, and told him he didn’t stop where I needed to get off. He asked me if I rang the bell. I admitted to him, I had no knowledge of riding on a city bus. He was kind, explained to pull the bell pull 1 block prior to my stop. He explained he would circle back around and I could get off at my stop on the return trip. I was SO relieved! However, now I was 1/2 hour late getting home, especially stressed and tired from the new school and bus fiasco, AND I smelled like cigarette smoke! When I walked into my house, I was immediately confronted on why was I late, why did I smell like smoke, etc.!

It has a great storyline, interesting characters, and some very good acting, especially from Rosalba Neri. Her role as the evil villainess in this film is truly classic. She steals every scene she is in, and expresses so much with her face and eyes, even when she's not speaking. Her performance is very believable. She manages to be quite mesmerizing without being over the top (not that there's anything wrong with being over the top). Mark Damon is surprisingly good in this movie too. The music score is excellent, and the theme song is the kind that will be playing in your head constantly for days after seeing the movie, whether you want it to or not. There are a couple of parts that are very amusing. I especially like the part where Rosalba Neri undresses in front of the parrot. There's also lots of slick gun-play that's very well done. I would probably have given this movie 8 or 9 stars if it wasn't for two things. The first being a silly bar room brawl that occurs about 25 minutes into the film. This is one of the most ridiculous looking fights I have ever seen in a movie. It is very poorly choreographed, and looks more like a dance number from a bad musical than any kind of a real fight. One might be able to overlook this if it were a Terence Hill/Bud Spencer comedy, but this is a more serious western, and the brawl really needed to be more realistic. The other thing that annoyed me about this movie was Yuma's cowardly Mexican sidekick. I guess he was supposed to be comic relief or something, but the character was just plain stupid and unnecessary in a movie like this, and he wasn't at all funny. All I can say is where is Tuco when you need him?  All that having been said, let me assure everyone reading this that Johnny Yuma is a classic spaghetti western despite the faults I have mentioned, and all fans of the genre need to see this movie.","output":"The sentiment of the review can be categorized as generally positive with some minor negative aspects.  The reviewer appreciates the movie as a memorable spaghetti western with a great storyline, interesting characters, and very good acting. They particularly praise Rosalba Neri's performance and her ability to express emotions through her facial expressions and body language. Mark Damon's acting is also highlighted as surprisingly good. The music score and theme song receive high remarks for being catchy and impactful. Additionally, the reviewer enjoys the amusing scenes present in the movie and the slick gun-play, considering these elements as well-executed. However, the reviewer has two primary criticisms. The first one is the poorly choreographed and unrealistic bar room brawl that occurs 25 minutes into the film. They feel that the scene does not fit well with the more serious tone of the movie, as the fight appears more like a dance number than a genuine fight. The second criticism is focused on Yuma's Mexican sidekick. The reviewer finds the character unnecessary and unfunny, adding no value to the film and negatively impacting the overall experience. Despite these minor negative aspects, the reviewer is confident in labeling Johnny Yuma as a classic spaghetti western that fans of the genre need to see. They would have likely given the movie 8 or 9 stars if it weren't for the mentioned flaws."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A recent Siena College poll revealed that a significant majority of New York State voters (68%) and New York City voters (62%) are embarrassed by the national attention garnered by the two men and their campaigns.

Eliot Spitzer, on the other hand, has seen some improvement in his public image since his resignation in 2008. While he had a 79% unfavorable rating in 2008, the recent poll shows that number has decreased to 59%. Despite the efforts of Weiner and Spitzer to revive their political careers following their respective scandals, these results reveal a strong sentiment of embarrassment among New York State and City voters.

In the second quarter, the Bills went back into the lead with kicker Rian Lindell getting a 23-yard field goal.  However, Cincinnati immediately responded with WR/KR Glenn Holt returning the kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown.  Buffalo ended the half with Lindell kicking a 21-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Bills went back to work with Lindell getting a 21-yard field goal.  However, the Bengals answered with Palmer completing a 1-yard TD pass to FB Jeremi Johnson.  Fortunatenly, in the fourth quarter, Buffalo began its final assault with Lindell nailing a 38-yard field goal.  Afterwards, rookie RB Marshawn Lynch was a key player as he threw an 8-yard TD pass to TE Robert Royal on a trick play, along with getting his best run of the year with a 56-yard TD run. With the win, not only did the Bills improve to 4-4, but they have won three-straight games for the first time since 2004.

Question: Was Humpata larger than Luanda the year Couceiro arrived in the latter city? Passage:Paiva Couceiro arrived in Luanda, Angola on September 1, 1889, and was immediately appointed commander of the Irregular Cavalry Squadron in the village of Humpata (which was originally created by Artur de Paiva to combat bands of guerrillas along the plain of Moçâmedes). He did not remain at this outpost for long; apparently he was unsatisfied with his subordinates, their methods and inferior level of discipline, but was able to utilize them in a campaign to retrieve missing cattle, instead of hiring local Boer mercenaries, which had been the custom. By January he was in the village of Belmonte, in Bié, on a mission that would take him along the Cuando River, to Cuito and then to the Lialui along the Zambezi River (a trek of thousands of kilometers across savannah), in order to negotiate with Lewanika, chief of the Barotze tribe. The growth of the Portuguese occupation force in the Angolan interior was part of the administration's attempted to implement their Pink Map to explore and expand their serfdom over the peoples of the central-African interior. After some resistance, the colonial administration began a military campaign to pacify groups that had resisted initial token gestures of friendship and gifts, a process that Paiva Couceiro participated in energetically. For the chief's recognition of Portuguese sovereignty over his territories, Paiva Couceiro brought with him a colonels tunic and sword, textiles, gold, velvet, boxes of Porto wine and arms, which were to be delivered in 300 crates when the Governor of Angola canceled the project.","output":"To determine if Humpata was larger than Luanda the year Couceiro arrived in the latter city, we can focus on the sentence from the passage that provides information about his arrival in Luanda and his appointment in Humpata:  \\"Paiva Couceiro arrived in Luanda, Angola on September 1, 1889, and was immediately appointed commander of the Irregular Cavalry Squadron in the village of Humpata (which was originally created by Artur de Paiva to combat bands of guerrillas along the plain of Moçâmedes).\\" However, this sentence doesn't provide any information about the sizes of Humpata and Luanda.

Think about when you rub your hands together. It is friction that makes them warm. But why does this happen? Friction causes the molecules on rubbing surfaces to move faster. Faster moving particles have more heat energy. Heat from friction can be useful. Can you think of other places where you might find friction? Friction also lets you light a match. Heat from friction can also cause problems. It can cause a car to overheat. To reduce friction, oil is added to the engine. Oil coats the surfaces of moving parts. This coating of oil makes them slippery. When things are slippery there is less friction. Have you ever seen a sign that says, slippery when wet? This too has to do with friction.

Unlike traditional book clubs, the point of the slow reading club isn't exchanging ideas about a certain book, but to get away from electronic devices and read in a quiet, relaxed environment. According to the Journal, the Wellington book club is just one example of a movement started by book lovers who miss the old-fashioned way of reading before the Internet and smartphones. Slow readers, such as The Atlantic's Maura Kelly, say a regular reading habit sharpens the mind, improves concentration, reduces stress levels and deepens the ability to sympathize. Another study published last year in Science showed that reading novels helps people understand other's mental states and beliefs, a fundamental skill in building relationships. Yet technology has made us less attentive readers. Screens have changed our reading patterns from the straight and information.left-to-right sequence to a wild skimming and skipping pattern as we hunt for important words and information.

Few major canvases remain in private collections, making the record unlikely to be broken. One example of the demand his work has achieved is the previously lost Sketch for Lake in Algonquin Park. Discovered in an Edmonton basement in 2018, it sold for nearly half a million dollars at a Toronto auction. The increased value of his work has led to the discovery of numerous forgeries on the market.In 1967, the Tom Thomson Art Gallery opened in Owen Sound. In 1968, Thomson's shack from behind the Studio Building was moved to the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg. Many of his works are also on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario. His influence can be seen in the work of later Canadian artists, including Joyce Wieland. In 2004, another historical marker honouring Thomson was moved from its previous location near the centre of Leith to the graveyard in which he is now buried. The grave site has become popular spot for visitors to the area with many fans of his work leaving pennies or art supplies behind as tribute., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The answer to the question, \\"What is the last name of the person who is a \\"haunting presence\\" and \\"embodies the Canadian artistic identity,\\" according to Roy Kiyooka and Dennis Lee?\\" is Thomson. The person being referred to is Tom Thomson, a Canadian artist whose work has grown in value and popularity since his death. He is considered by many as a manifestation of the Canadian character and an embodiment of the Canadian artistic identity. His influence can be seen in the work of later Canadian artists, and his paintings are highly valued and sought after."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Write highlights for this article: All BlackBerry service has been restored following the largest network outage in that smartphone's history, Research in Motion executives said in a conference call on Thursday morning. \\"We've now restored full services,\\" RIM's co-CEO Mike Lazaridis told reporters. Some BlackBerry users may still see e-mails coming in slowly as the system recovers, he said. The major outage frustrated customers on nearly every continent who were unable to send and receive e-mails and text messages this week. It also comes at a bad time for RIM, which is facing increased competition from Android and Apple smartphones. The iPhone 4S is set to be released on Friday, and social media posts suggest some BlackBerry users may switch to other phones in part because of the prolonged break in services. The outage started on Monday in Europe and spread to North America, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and South America over the course of the next two days. A failure at one of the company's messaging servers in Europe, along with the subsequent failure of its backup system, led to a ripple effect that reportedly caused problems for millions of BlackBerry owners. Executives on Thursday did not answer questions about how many people were impacted by the four-day service outage, but they did say this breakdown was the largest in the company's history. \\"We've worked 12 yrs since the launch of BlackBerry to win the trust of our 70 million BlackBerry subscribers and we're going to fully commit to win that trust back -- 100%,\\" Lazaridis said during the press conference. This is not the first time RIM has faced a major service outage. \\"I have been an analyst for 25 years and have watched RIM wrestle with this same outage problem time after time. Every few years we get pinched by yet another major problem,\\" tech analyst Jeff Kagan said in a statement. This outage, however, comes at a particularly unfortunate time for RIM, since it faces increasing competition in the smart phone market, Kagan says. BlackBerry users, many of whom use the devices primarily for business purposes, took to the Web to vent their anger about the outage. Twitter and other messaging platforms have been full of complaints since the outage began almost four days ago. The CNN Wire, CNN's Erin McLaughlin and CNNMoney's Julianne Pepitone contributed to this report.","output":"A big problem with BlackBerry phones happened recently, and it made many people around the world unable to send and receive emails and text messages.

At their memorial, Grampa Simpson foresees the destruction of the town, but only Marge takes this seriously. Later that day, Homer dares his son Bart to skate naked to the Krusty Burger restaurant and Bart is arrested by Chief Wiggum. Bart considers their neighbor Ned Flanders a better father figure after Homer refuses to take responsibility for the incident. Lisa and a new Irish friend named Colin convince the entire town to clean their lake. Meanwhile, Homer adopts a pig from Krusty Burger and names it \\"Spider Pig\\" (later \\"Harry Plopper\\", and simply \\"Plopper\\"), and stores the pig's feces (and some of his own) in a silo, until Marge tells him to safely dispose of the waste. Homer intends to take his silo to the waste management plant, but after Lenny calls to tell him that Lard Lad Donuts has been shut down and is giving away free donuts, Homer impatiently dumps the silo straight into the lake, polluting it worse than before.

What are the 2 snack foods mentioned in that classic baseball song Take Me Out to the Ball Game????","output":"\\"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\\" is a classic baseball song written in 1908 by Jack Norworth and Albert Von Tilzer, typically sung during the seventh-inning stretch at American baseball games. The song is well-known for its catchy tune and its references to a few snack foods commonly associated with attending a baseball game. The two snack foods mentioned in the lyrics are: 1. Peanuts: Peanuts have been a staple snack at baseball games for over a century. They are typically sold in small bags or in the shell, and people enjoy them in a variety of ways—whether it's by cracking them open in-shell or eating them already shelled. Peanuts have become synonymous with baseball games, and the song lyric \\"buy me some peanuts\\" reflects the longstanding tradition of enjoying peanuts during a game. 2. Cracker Jack: Cracker Jack is a brand of caramel-coated popcorn and peanuts, introduced in 1896. The snack is well-known not only for its sweet, caramelized taste but also for the prize that comes inside every box, which could be a toy, temporary tattoo, or a small collectible. In the song, the lyrics \\"buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack\\" are a call to indulge in the nostalgic treats that have become synonymous with the American baseball experience. The specific verse in \\"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\\" that mentions the snack foods is: \\"Take me out to the ball game, Take me out with the crowd; Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack, I don't care if I never get back.\\" The song serves as a celebration of the excitement and camaraderie associated with going to a baseball game and enjoying classic American snack foods like peanuts and Cracker Jack."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If the U.S. were really really interested in democracy in Mexico, it would have supported the students in 1968 -- when the Mexican Army opened fire killing hundreds. Why did the U.S. close rank with a murderous government and turn its back on the democratic hopes of the Mexican people? Because the PRI promised stability -- through oppressing human rights, through frustrating democracy. Reding turns a blind eye to our complicity in prolonging the road to democracy by three decades.

(CNN) -- A federal jury convicted a California man Monday in a case in which prosecutors say he convinced a woman to bomb a federal courthouse so he could turn her and others involved the scheme in to authorities, and collect reward money.  Donny Love was found guilty on 10 charges, including the use of a weapon of mass destruction, for the role he played in the May 4, 2008, attack on San Diego's Edward J. Schwartz Federal Courthouse.  No one was injured in the blast that damaged the building's front lobby, shattered a glass door and broke a window in a building across the street.  Love could face between 30 years and life in prison, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Fred Sheppard.  During the two-week trial, prosecutors painted Love as the mastermind behind the blast.  He directed two others, Rachelle Lynette Carlock and Ella Louise Sanders to purchase explosive powder and to steal bomb-making materials, they said. Carlock was an on-again, off-again girlfriend to Love, said Sheppard.  According to testimony, Carlock and Eric Reginald Robinson then drove from Love's house to San Diego with a backpack, containing three pipe bombs. Carlock detonated the bombs at the front doors of the courthouse, prosecutors said.  Carlock, Sanders and Robinson were charged and each previously pleaded guilty for their parts in the plan.  At the time of the bombing, Love was in \\"dire financial straits,\\" prosecutors said, and faced jail time stemming from two pending criminal cases.  \\"The evidence showed that he directed the May 4, 2008, bombing for the purpose of obtaining reward money and a break on his state charges by providing information about the bombing to law enforcement,\\" prosecutors said in a statement.  1.

Alfonso died in Zamora, probably in 910. His former realm would be reunited when first García died childless and León passed to Ordoño.

Plot title: Michael Clayton Movie plot: Michael Clayton (George Clooney) is a \\"fixer\\" for a prestigious New York City law firm, using his connections and knowledge of legal loopholes for clients' benefit. After leaving an underground poker game and dealing with a wealthy client's (Denis O'Hare) hit and run, Michael drives despondently and stops at a remote field, where some horses are standing on a hill. As he climbs the hill to admire them, the car explodes behind him. The story moves back to four days earlier. Michael is 75,000 in debt from a restaurant investment he entered with his brother Timmy, which collapsed when Timmy used the restaurant's funds to fuel his drug habits. Michael, having gone to a loan shark to raise the money, refuses to give up his brother and is held responsible for the debt, given one week to come up with the money. Meanwhile, one of the firm's leading attorneys, Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson), has a manic episode in the middle of a deposition in Milwaukee involving a class action lawsuit against U-North, an agricultural products conglomerate. Michael arrives in Milwaukee and bails Arthur, who had failed to take his medication, out of jail, but Arthur escapes from their hotel room in the middle of the night. Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton), U-North's general counsel, discovers that Arthur had come into possession of a confidential U-North document detailing the company's decision to manufacture a weed killer it knew to be carcinogenic. Karen brings this to the attention of U-North's CEO Don Jeffries (Ken Howard), who puts her in contact with two men secretly on retainer (Robert Prescott and Terry Serpico). She contracts them to follow Arthur and bug his apartment and phone. When they report that Arthur is building a case to expose his own client, Karen approves of their taking drastic measures. The men murder Arthur in such a way as to make it look like an accidental drug overdose or suicide. Michael, saddened by Arthur's death, becomes suspicious upon learning that U-North was planning a settlement just a few days before... My question: What happens to Michael's car?

Almost immediately, Father Silvano (Carmen Argenziano) is killed and one of the vials of antimatter goes missing. At the same time, the Roman Catholic Church is mourning the sudden death of Pope Pius XVI in Rome and prepares for the papal conclave to elect the next Pope. The Camerlengo, Father Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor), assumes temporary control of the Vatican. Before the conclave enters seclusion, four of the \\"preferiti\\" (the favorite cardinals to be elected pope) are kidnapped by a man claiming to represent the Illuminati. In a video message, he threatens to kill one candidate every hour starting at 8pm and to destroy all of Vatican City at midnight, using the missing vial of antimatter as a bomb. The Vatican summons symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) from Harvard University and Vetra to help them save the four preferiti and locate the vial. Langdon listens to the Illuminati's message and deduces the four cardinals will die at the four altars of the \\"Path of Illumination\\", marked by statues of angels in locations relevant to the four classical elements. Over the objections of Commander Maximilian Richter, head of the Swiss Guard, but with McKenna's consent, Langdon is granted access to the Vatican Secret Archives.

Article: The New York Times announced Wednesday that it intended to charge frequent readers for access to its website, a step being debated across the industry that nearly every major newspaper has so far feared to take. Starting in early 2011, visitors to NYTimes.com will get a certain number of articles free every month before being asked to pay a standard and fixed fee for unlimited access. Subscribers to the newspaper's print edition will receive full access to the site. But executives of The New York Times Company said they could not yet answer fundamental questions about the plan, like how much it would cost or what the limit would be on free reading. They stressed that the amount of free access could change with time, in response to economic conditions and reader demand. Still, publishers fear that money from digital subscriptions would not make up for the resulting loss of audience and advertising income. NYTimes.com is by far the most popular newspaper site in the country, with more than 17 million readers a month in the United States, according to Nielsen Online, and analysts say it is the leader in advertising income, as well. That may make it better positioned than other general-interest papers to charge--and also gives The Times more to lose if the move produces an opposed result. The Times Company has been studying the matter for almost a year, searching for common ground between pro-and-anti pay campaigns--a debate mirrored in dozens of media-watching blogs-- and the system will not go into effect until January 2011. Executives said they were not bothered by the possibility of absorbing barbs  for moving cautiously. \\"There's no prize for getting it quick,\\" said Janet L. Robinson, the company's president and chief executive. \\"There's more of a prize for getting it right.\\" Question: What is the main idea about the passage? - The Times to offer free access to its web site. - The Times to increase audience to its web site. - The Times to attract advertisement to its web site - The Times to charge for frequent access to its web site.

Article: In tough economic times, school counselors   don't just wait for students to come to their offices in search of college brochures, health pamphlets or other help. These days, they are looking for at-risk kids to prevent personal or academic troubles before they arise. Nowadays, students and families need the guidance more than ever.  Counselors play a steadying role in schools as the economy weighs on families, college admission becomes even more competitive, immigration continues to reshape the population and state-testing pressures many students. They use computers to search through attendance data, grades and standardized test scores for kids who might need extra help.  Schlatter, director of guidance and counseling at Prince William County's Woodbridge Senior High School, has checked attendance records against grades and test results to start peer groups   for students who are failing classes but not skipping them. She said group counseling is another way to reach more students though it can be difficult. \\"Kids really do start helping and sharing with each other.\\"  At Fairfax High School, counselors found through surveys that students who transferred   to the school after ninth grade enjoyed school significantly less than those who had been there all four years. The counseling staff set up a special program and group for new arrivals in response, said Marcy Miller, the school's director of student services. Counseling staff members also have started small study groups for students to prepare for state Standards of Learning exams, which Miller said have helped raise test scores.

Reclaim the Power set up camp in the doorway to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) in London. Other members brought major traffic disruption to Swansea after blockading a new university building. Police have been in attendance at both sites. The campaigners from Reclaim the Power's six-day camp at Blackpool said they were reacting to the release of a UK government report last week. They claimed 63 sections on the potential impacts of shale gas exploration on rural communities had been deleted. They said the missing sections include analysis around falling house prices and failing rural services. They say the chapter examining the effect of drilling on house prices had three sections cut. At 08:00 BST on Monday in London three activists super-glued themselves to the doors, while another activist climbed the building and put up a banner which read: \\"What's to hide Defra? - Don't frack with our future.\\" One of the campaigners apparently super-glued to Defra's doors was Lindsay Alderton, from London. She said it was \\"shameful\\" the government was \\"keeping secret the impacts of shale gas extraction\\" and the public \\"has a right to know\\". \\"This morning we're here at Defra to remind them that they work for the public that pays them their wages, and that the public demands to know the facts about fracking - censoring is not an acceptable option,\\" added Ms Alderton. Some other activists wore black tape across their mouths. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said officers were called at 07:30 BST and there were about 15 protesters at the scene - some had climbed scaffolding. Meanwhile in Swansea, eight protesters shut down construction of a new Swansea University building on Fabian Way - the main route into the city from the M4. The protest began at 06:00 BST and caused chaos for commuters. The activists said they dressed as \\"mad scientists\\" to protest against fracking research. They camped outside the site and dropped a \\"No Fracking\\" banner from the top of the building while another protester was locked on to a tripod. They say they are \\"angered\\" by \\"tens of millions of public money being funnelled into research on fracking via Swansea University's new Energy Safety Research Institute\\". A spokeswoman for Swansea University confirmed the UK and Welsh governments had both funded research at the institute into \\"all types of energy, and one of those could be fracking\\". She also confirmed previous landowners BP had donated the site to the university, which the protesters have highlighted. South Wales Police said it acknowledged the campaigners' right \\"to peaceful protest\\" and tried to minimise disruption to the community during the protest - which ended at around 13.00 BST. Activists have also staged a \\"die-in\\" at the Blackpool branch of HSBC the bank providing its services to a fracking company, while a PR agency for the company had activists wearing toxic suits turn up. A UK government spokesman said: \\"There is no evidence that house prices have been affected in over half a century of oil and gas exploration in the UK or evidence that this would be the case with shale. \\"This government believes that shale has a positive part to play in our future energy mix, providing energy security, driving growth and creating jobs.\\" What is a summary of this text?","output":"Reclaim the Power, an activist group, staged protests at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) in London and a new Swansea University building construction site, responding to the release of a UK government report on the potential impacts of shale gas exploration on rural communities.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Changes of state from solid to liquid and from liquid to gas occur when matter gains energy. The energy allows individual molecules to separate and move apart from one another. It takes more energy to bring about these changes of state for polar molecules. Although hydrogen bonds are weak, they add to the energy needed for molecules to move apart from one another, so it takes higher temperatures for these changes of state to occur in polar compounds. This explains why polar compounds have relatively high melting and boiling points. The Table below compares melting and boiling points for some polar and nonpolar covalent compounds.  I am facing a new situation today: Andrew is thirsty and wants some cold water. He puts a bottle in the freezer but leaves it in too long so it freezes. Being impatient he then takes the bottle and runs it under soe hot water for a few minutes.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Will the energy of the water molecules in the bottle increase or decrease when Andrew runs hot water on the bottle? A:","output":"The energy of the water molecules in the bottle will increase when Andrew runs hot water on the bottle.  This is because, as explained in the background article, changes of state from solid to liquid (in this case, from ice to water) occur when matter gains energy. When Andrew runs hot water on the frozen bottle, the heat from the hot water transfers energy to the ice inside the bottle, causing the water molecules to gain enough energy to break the hydrogen bonds holding them in a solid state. Consequently, the ice starts to melt and transitions to a liquid state. The process of transferring energy from the hot water to the ice increases the energy of the water molecules in the bottle."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Nicholas Rodney Drake (19 June 1948 – 25 November 1974) was an English singer-songwriter and musician known for his acoustic guitar-based songs. He failed to find a wide audience during his lifetime, but his work has since achieved wider recognition.Drake signed to Island Records when he was 20, while a student at the University of Cambridge, and released his debut album, Five Leaves Left, in 1969. By 1972, he had recorded two more albums, Bryter Layter and Pink Moon. Neither sold more than 5,000 copies on initial release. His reluctance to perform live or give interviews contributed to his lack of commercial success. No footage of the adult Drake has been released, only still photographs.Drake is believed to have suffered from depression, reflected in his lyrics. After making Pink Moon, he withdrew from performance and recording, retreating to his parents' home in rural Warwickshire. At the age of 26, Drake died from an overdose of approximately 30 amitriptyline pills, a prescribed antidepressant. His cause of death was determined as suicide.The 1979 release of the retrospective album Fruit Tree triggered a reassessment of Drake's music. By the mid-1980s, he was credited as an influence by such artists as Robert Smith, David Sylvian, and Peter Buck. In 1985, the Dream Academy reached the UK and US charts with \\"Life in a Northern Town\\", a song written for and dedicated to Drake. By the early 1990s, he had come to represent a \\"doomed romantic\\" musician in the UK music press. The first Drake biography was published in 1997, followed in 1998 by the documentary film A Stranger Among Us. In 1999, his song \\"Pink Moon\\" was used in a Volkswagen commercial, resulting in an increase in his U.S. album sales.

You might watch and laugh when your dog chases its tail because it looks cute. But did you know that, even though it might appear like a fun game, it could mean your pet is sick? Researchers have found that if a dog runs after its tail, chases cars and barks  at flies that are not there, it may have obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD, ). In fact, OCD is even more common among humans. The symptoms   are varied: some people check and recheck the locks before they go out; others are extremely afraid of germs   and have to wash their hands many times a day. English soccer star David Beckham, for example, cannot stand odd numbers   of items in his fridge. So if he has three cans of drink he will throw one out, according to his wife Victoria. Hoping to better understand OCD in humans, a team of scientists from the University of Helsinki, Finland, studied 368 dogs, including those that chase their tail for several hours daily or a few times a month, according to Sciencedaily.com. They also examined dogs that had never chased their tails. Scientists took the dogs' blood sample   and asked their owners some questions about their pets' daily life. Findings showed that among all kinds of dogs, bull terriers   and German shepherds   were likely to chase their tails, which led scientists to believe that genes   can cause OCD. Diet also plays a part. It was found that dogs that eat food with certain vitamins and minerals chased their tails less. \\"Interestingly, there are indications   that vitamins and minerals are helpful in human OCD treatment,\\" said researcher Katriina Tiira. Moreover, tail-chasing is often found among dogs that were separated from their mothers too early or ones that didn't receive enough care. They are also more likely to turn out to be shyer and more afraid of loud noises at a young age. The study can help us understand the causes of OCD in humans. \\"Dogs share the same environment with humans, and large animals are physiologically   close to humans,\\" said Hannes Lohi, leader...

It is easy for us to tell who our family members are, but do plants recognize their own family? Some do, scientists say, according to a report by Science News in early 2010. Guillermo P. Murphy and Susan Dudley are two plant scientists from McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada. They did a few experiments with Jewelweeds, a kind of flower that grows in wet, shady spots. They found that the flowers seem to know their own flower family. In their experiments, Murphy and Dudley planted jewelweeds in pots with either _ or strangers. When jewelweeds were planted in pots with strangers, the plants started to grow more leaves than if they had been planted alone. This response suggests that plants are competing with strangers for sunlight, since a plant with more leaves can receive more light and make more food. Jewelweeds usually grow in the shade, where sunlight is not enough. When jewelweed seedlings were planted with siblings, they grew a few more branches than they usually would if they were alone - but they did not start growing lots of extra leaves. This behavior suggests the plants are more likely to share resources, rather than compete. According to the Science News report, Jewelweeds are not the first plants that plant scientists have studied for family recognition. In 2007, Dudley and her team studied the Great Lakes sea rocket, a plant that grows on the beach - where it may be hard to get fresh water. In that experiment, the scientists found that when sea rockets were planted with siblings, they tolerated each other. But when they were planted with strangers, the sea rockets reacted by working extra hard to grow lots of roots. Dudley says this just because sea rockets, on the beach, get plenty of sun but struggle for water - so when they're threatened, they compete for water. Jewelweeds have plenty of water but have to compete for sunshine, so they grow more leaves. Answer this series of questions: 1. Who are Guillermo P. Murphy and Susan Dudley? 2. From where? 3.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Saturday was Jacob Koscinski’s big day. His whole family, many from out of town, saw the Charleston, S.C., student graduate from his Christian-based home-school program with a 4.89 grade-point average and the coveted honor of summa cum laude.      His mother, Cara Koscinski organized a graduation party for her 18-year-old son. For the occasion, she ordered a cake online from her nearest grocery store, Publix, which lets customers build their own cakes complete with a customized inscription, which they enter into a message box marked “cake message option.”      Carefully, she typed in the words she wanted on the cake: “Congrats Jacob! Summa Cum Laude class of 2018.”      Publix’s online system was unhappy with the word “cum.”      In Latin, cum is the preposition “with,” as in summa cum laude, “with the highest distinction.” To the little box on the Publix website, however, the word meant something else and its strict algorithm, vigilant for naughty words, returned a message that said “profane/special characters not allowed.” Cum, which contains no special characters, was deemed profane.      In place of cum, three hyphens appeared, as they do for some other profanities in family newspapers: Summa ––– Laude.      The Post replicated her experience and got the same result:      But there was still hope. The Publix form included a section for “special instructions” for the bakery, in which Koscinski explained that Summa Cum Laude was a Latin term for high academic honor and was not profane. She included a link to a website explaining the meaning of summa cum laude and said she didn’t think much about it afterward.      Cake day arrived.      Koscinski said she was so busy preparing things for the celebration, that she sent her husband and sister to the store to get some last minute items and to pick up the cake.      When they returned, everyone gathered around the cake. When they opened the box, there it was: “Congrats Jacob! Summa — Laude Class of 2018.”      Jacob was “absolutely humiliated,” Koscinski said to The Post. “It was unbelievable. I ordered the special graduation edition cake. I can’t believe I’m the first one to ever write “Summa Cum Laude” on a cake.      Koscinski said she then had to explain why the grocery store censored “cum” from Jacob’s cake to her 70-year-old mother.      Ok. I didn’t want to post but I cannot resist. I ordered Jacob’s graduation cake from Publix. A 70 cake!! He earned a... Posted by Cara Koscinski on Sunday, May 20, 2018      Jacob didn’t eat much of the cake after that but his mother says the chocolate and vanilla cake was delicious.      Koscinski called Publix on Monday and explained the situation to the assistant manager. She said she doesn’t want this to happen to anyone else in the future. Publix offered to remake the cake. She declined.      “No,” she said, “you only graduate once.”      Publix gave her a 70 refund for the cake and a store gift card.      But as The Washington Post test revealed, that particular “c” word remains profane by Publix standards.      Jacob can now laugh about the situation and is focused on getting ready to attend Wingate University in North Carolina in the fall, where he received a full academic scholarship.      “Maybe I should have just gotten him his favorite mint chocolate chip ice cream instead,” Koscinski said.

Jacob graduated Saturday with the highest honors from a Christian-based home-schooling program. So, his mom ordered a cake.      \\"He did not know we were getting a cake because he's not a big cake eater. So we were all standing there waiting to see it and when we opened it, it was a huge shock to all of us,\\" said Cara Koscinski.      She explained how she ordered the 3/4 inch sheet cake online through Publix.      But when she requested the bakery include Jacob's honor, she was alerted that profane or special characters weren't allowed. Cara clarified her request with special instructions.      \\"The website had censored me and this is a website that you can refer to for the Latin term for Summa Cum Laude which means highest honors,\\" she said.      Cara said when her husband picked up the cake from Publix on Savannah Highway and Main Road, he didn't know the bakery omitted the middle Latin word. It was replaced with hyphens.      \\"The cake experience was kind of frustrating and humiliating because I had to explain to my friends and family like what that meant. And they were giggling uncontrollably. At least my friends were,\\" said Jacob Koscinski.      The Koscinskis said a manager from Publix apologized and offered a refund. For now, they're nibbling on the leftover dessert, and looking forward to Jacob's freshman year at Wingate University.      \\"It's fine for us to be compensated for the cake. We're just happy that our son graduated school and has a bright future,\\" said Cara Koscinski.      Jacob's grade point average is an impressive 4.89. He plans to major in pre-med.

Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First question: Is baking soda good for you? Baking soda, also known as sodium bicarbonate, is a commonly used ingredient in cooking and household cleaning. While it generally has many uses and benefits, whether it is specifically good for your health depends on the context in which it is being used. In small amounts, baking soda may provide some health benefits. For example, baking soda can be used as a natural antacid to help neutralize stomach acidity and relieve indigestion. Some people also use baking soda as a supplement to improve athletic performance, enhance kidney function, and maintain oral hygiene by using it as a toothpaste alternative. However, consuming large amounts of baking soda can be harmful. Overconsumption of baking soda might lead to electrolyte imbalances, such as high sodium levels or low potassium levels, which could potentially harm the heart or kidneys. Ingesting too much baking soda can also result in stomach discomfort and diarrhea. In summary, baking soda might offer some health benefits when used correctly and in moderation, but it is essential to be cautious about excessive consumption. Second question: Is baking soda good for face? Baking soda is sometimes used as a DIY skincare ingredient, primarily as an exfoliant or facial scrub. While it may appear to provide immediate results in terms of skin texture, using baking soda on the face might not be the best choice for several reasons. Baking soda is alkaline, while our skin's natural pH is slightly acidic. This difference in pH can disrupt the skin’s acid mantle, which acts as a barrier against harmful bacteria, pollutants, and free radicals. Long-term use of baking soda on the face could potentially lead to moisture loss, increased sensitivity, and even acne breakouts due to disturbance of the skin's natural balance. Moreover, the abrasive texture of baking soda can cause micro-tears in the skin, contributing to irritation and damage over time. Professional skincare products typically use rounded, uniform particles to minimize this risk, while baking soda crystals can be jagged and uneven. Are these two questions asking the same thing? No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question deals with baking soda's overall effects on health and well-being, addressing whether consuming it can provide health benefits. The second question focuses specifically on the application of baking soda to the face as a skincare product. While both questions explore the safety and potential benefits of baking soda, they address different aspects of its use."},{"instruction":"Select from: A. nervous; B. proud; C. jittery; I heard that Ash got a new Bible and took it to Church to hold.

It's gonna be a great day!!","output":"The sentiment of the specified tweet is overwhelmingly positive. Let's break down this interpretation by examining the specific components and distinct linguistic and emotional cues contained within the text, which contribute to the expression of such positivity. Firstly, the tweet begins by directly addressing the targeted user with their Twitter handle, \\"@_CrC_\\". This establishes a personal and friendly connection, highlighting the author's intent to focus their message towards the individual in question. The tweet then proceeds to wish the person a \\"Happy Birthday!!\\". The expression \\"Happy Birthday\\" itself conveys joy and well-wishes, as it is universally recognized as a phrase used to celebrate one's birth anniversary. Additionally, the inclusion of not one, but two exclamation marks after the phrase further emphasizes the author's enthusiastic and joyful sentiment. Following the birthday wish, the tweet states, \\"It's gonna be a great day!!\\". The use of the word \\"gonna\\" is a colloquial twist on \\"going to\\" and signifies a casual, informal tone. This language choice reinforces the idea that the sentiment is genuinely friendly and warm. Moreover, the words \\"great day\\" evoke images of positivity and happiness which, when combined with the assurance provided by the phrasing, demonstrate the author's sincere belief in the day's potential for greatness. Once again, the employment of two exclamation marks in this assertion accentuates the excitement and optimism projected in the sentiment. In summary, this tweet's sentiment can be characterized as highly positive. The various components – such as addressing the targeted user directly, energetically wishing them a happy birthday, and enthusiastically projecting an optimistic forecast for the day – all contribute to the creation of this affirmative and joyful tone."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who claims his adopted child is of a destitute family friend?  From her Parkville jail cell, Vergie Winters watches the funeral procession of Senator John Shadwell and remembers her twenty-year past with him: The moment young lawyer John returns to Parkville from an extended honeymoon with his social climbing wife Laura, he visits Vergie, his former lover. After a passionate embrace, John explains to the youthful milliner that he had abandoned their romance because Vergie's father had told him that she was pregnant by laborer Hugo McQueen and would be forced to marry. Vergie then tells John that, to keep her from marrying John, Laura's father had paid her father 10,000 to tell him that devastating lie. Still deeply in love, John and Vergie continue to see each other, but when John starts to campaign for Congress, Preston, a political boss, informs Vergie that, if John is to receive his vital support, she must forego their affair. Although Vergie agrees to Preston's terms, John refuses to end the relationship and spends a long evening with her before the election.  After a victorious win, John moves to Washington, D.C. with Laura, Vergie bears his child under an assumed name. John then adopts the baby, named Joan, whom he claims is the child of a destitute family friend.  At the start of World War I, John returns to Parkville and once again resumes his affair with Vergie. When one of John's late night rendezvous is witnessed by a town gossip and reported to Mike Davey, John's only political enemy, Vergie's successful millinery shop is boycotted, and she is shunned by all but the local prostitutes. In addition, Davey hires Preston's son Barry to steal from Preston's home safe a page from a hotel register on which Vergie had written her assumed name. As Barry is breaking into his father's safe, however, Preston mistakes him for a burglar and kills him, but tells his butler that a burglar shot his son.

Question: What element of monotheistic religions is not a part of the faith of the followers of the man formerly known as Siddhartha Gautama? Context: Buddhist schools vary on the exact nature of the path to liberation, the importance and canonicity of various teachings and scriptures, and especially their respective practices. Buddhism denies a creator deity and posits that mundane deities such as Mahabrahma are misperceived to be a creator. The foundations of Buddhist tradition and practice are the Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dharma (the teachings), and the Sangha (the community). Taking \\"refuge in the triple gem\\" has traditionally been a declaration and commitment to being on the Buddhist path, and in general distinguishes a Buddhist from a non-Buddhist. Other practices are Ten Meritorious Deeds including, giving charity to reduce the greediness; following ethical precepts; renouncing conventional living and becoming a monastic; the development of mindfulness and practice of meditation; cultivation of higher wisdom and discernment; study of scriptures; devotional practices; ceremonies; and in the Mahayana tradition, invocation of buddhas and bodhisattvas.

As a child, he owned a bull's pizzle, which was given to him to use as a cattle whip. He began collecting penises after a friend heard the story of the bull's penis in 1974 and gave him four new ones, three of which Sigurður gave to friends. Acquaintances at whaling stations began bringing him whale penises as well, and the collection grew from there, expanding through donations and acquisitions from various sources around Iceland.The organs of farm animals came from slaughterhouses, while fishermen supplied those of pinnipeds and the smaller whales. The penises of larger whales came from commercial whaling stations, although this source dried up after the International Whaling Commission implemented a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986. Sigurður was able to continue to collect whale penises by harvesting them from the 12–16 whales that fall victim to stranding on the Icelandic coast each year. He also obtained the penis of a polar bear shot by fishermen who found the animal drifting on drift ice off the Westfjords.Sigurður was assisted by his family, though not without some occasional embarrassment. His daughter Þorgerður recalls that she was once sent to a slaughterhouse to collect a specimen but arrived just as the workers were taking a lunch break: \\"Someone asked, 'What's in the basket?' I had to say, 'I'm collecting a frozen goat penis.' After that I said, 'I will never collect for you again.'\\" According to Sigurður, \\"Collecting penises is like collecting anything. You can never stop, you can never catch up, you can always get a new one, a better one.\\" The collection was at first housed in Sigurður's office at the college until he retired from his teaching job.

Although the Boston Center air traffic controller realized at an early stage that there was something wrong with American 11, he did not immediately interpret the plane's failure to respond as a sign that it had been hijacked. At 8:14, when the flight failed to heed his instruction to climb to 35,000 feet, the controller repeatedly tried to raise the flight. He reached out to the pilot on the emergency frequency. Though there was no response, he kept trying to contact the aircraft. At 8:21, American 11 turned off its transponder, immediately degrading the information available about the aircraft. The controller told his supervisor that he thought something was seriously wrong with the plane, although neither suspected a hijacking. The supervisor instructed the controller to follow standard procedures for handling a \\"no radio\\" aircraft. The controller checked to see if American Airlines could establish communication with American 11. He became even more concerned as its route changed, moving into another sector's airspace. Controllers immediately began to move aircraft out of its path, and asked other aircraft in the vicinity to look for American 11. At 8:24:38, the following transmission came from American 11: American 11: We have some planes. Just stay quiet, and you'll be okay. We are returning to the airport. The controller only heard something unintelligible; he did not hear the specific words \\"we have some planes.\\" The next transmission came seconds later: American 11: Nobody move.

The Puzzle of What People Expect of the Supreme Court Wherever I go these days, someone is bound to ask me how I think the Supreme Court will rule in the challenge to the Affordable Care Act, set for argument over three days during the last week in March. My response, that I expect the court to uphold the law, predictably evokes an expression of disbelief verging on pity for my display of such naïveté. “Won’t the justices just vote their politics?” my questioner invariably asks. Well, actually, I don’t think so — even assuming that I knew the conservative justices’ personal views on the individual mandate. (The idea of requiring individuals to carry health insurance was, as an article last week in The American Spectator reminds us, originally cooked up in a conservative think tank. It became anathema to the Right only after the Obama administration embraced it.) It’s not that I think that ideology is absent from the court or that it has nothing to do with how justices decide cases. But at least for most justices, most of the time, the relationship between ideology and outcome is oblique rather than straightforward. Ideology — or to use a less freighted expression, world view — is there, but it is not the only thing there. As two political scientists, James L. Gibson and Gregory A. Caldeira, put it in a recent article, “judging at the level of the Supreme Court involves a complicated blend of legal, policy, and ideological considerations.” Professor Gibson, a leading scholar of judicial behavior, expressed the idea this way in an earlier article: “Judges’ decisions are a function of what they prefer to do, tempered by what they think they ought to do, but constrained by what they perceive is feasible to do.” By “feasible,” Professor Gibson means something deeper than “what they can get away with.” He means that judges operate within the public and private norms of the judicial role and of their own institution, constrained by the need to safeguard institutional legitimacy and by “the sociopolitical environment within which the institution is located.” To the list of constraints, I would add the text of the constitutional provision or the statute at issue, along with the relevant precedents that guide the analysis. For example, in November, when Judge Laurence Silberman, one of the country’s most prominent conservative judges, rejected a challenge to the Affordable Care Act in a majority opinion for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, he concluded (with regret, for all I know) that the challenge had to fail because the plaintiffs “cannot find real support for their proposed rule in either the text of the Constitution or Supreme Court precedent.” My purpose in this column is not to analyze the health-care arguments or elaborate on my prediction for the outcome. Rather, it’s to reflect on the puzzle of how people view the Supreme Court and what they expect from it. The combination of a superfecta of blockbuster cases this term — in addition to the health-care case, there is the Arizona immigration case, a major redistricting case from Texas and, sitting in the court’s in-basket, a new challenge to affirmative action in university admissions — and the Republican presidential candidates’ ritualized attacks on the judiciary has raised the Supreme Court’s salience to a level not seen since the two weeks in December 11 years ago when Bush v. Gore held the country in thrall. And Bush v. Gore is, in fact, part of the puzzle. The dire prediction offered by Justice John Paul Stevens in his dissenting opinion that the real loser in the case would prove to be “the Nation’s confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law” did not come true. The decision did no measurable long-term damage to the court’s public standing, a fact that, while it surprises those who were infuriated by the court’s intervention in the election, did not surprise the social scientists who track public attitudes toward various government and private institutions. Although the court’s public approval rating has dropped recently to 46 percent, as measured by the Gallup Poll (down from 61 percent just two years ago), that remains a high number at a time of mounting public disenchantment with government in general. Congress ended the year with an 11 percent approval rating, its lowest in Gallup history. So why is the Supreme Court largely immune, even “bulletproof,” as one political scientist, Dion Farganis, has expressed it? Intuitively, one answer might be what scholars call the “myth of legality” — the notion that deciding cases is just a matter of “applying the law to the facts at hand,” as Sonia Sotomayor repeatedly claimed during her 2009 confirmation hearing. Politicians must assume that this description of judging as a mechanical and value-free exercise must be deeply reassuring to the public, because nominees are coached to embrace it and senators publicly insist on it. In Justice Sotomayor’s case, Republican senators invoked the mechanical standard as a bulwark against the “empathy” that President Obama had said he wanted in his judicial nominees. But the persistence of the myth of legality can’t be the explanation for the Supreme Court’s enduring public support, for the reason that most people apparently recognize it for what it is, a myth. In a survey that Professors Gibson and Caldeira conducted for their recent article, 65 percent of the respondents agreed with the statement that “Supreme Court judges have a great deal of leeway in their decisions, even when they claim to be ‘interpreting’ the Constitution.” Most people also agreed with this statement: “Judges always say that their decisions are based on law and the Constitution, but in many cases, judges are really basing their decisions on their own personal beliefs.” Thus, the authors conclude: “It appears that most Americans reject the mechanical jurisprudence model. Most believe that judges have discretion and that judges make discretionary decisions on the basis of ideology and values.” Whether that public understanding is best described as cynical or refreshingly realistic, it seems inconsistent with the broad support the Supreme Court enjoys. If the justices are just “politicians in robes,” why should the court be regarded as different from, say, the House Republican caucus? It turns out that most Americans reject the “politicians in robes” image. Yes, people recognize that judges exercise discretion. But they see it as what Professors Gibson and Caldeira call “principled discretion,” as opposed to the “self-interested decision-making” the public ascribes to politicians. The authors conclude: “It appears that this conception of principled but discretionary judicial policymaking renders realistic views compatible with judicial legitimacy.” In other words, the public is capable of holding two views at the same time: one, that judges don’t simply paint by numbers, but do bring their own values and views to bear and two, it is not simply the fact of discretion, but the way judges exercise it, that sustains the legitimacy of the judicial enterprise. Politicians who condescend to the public with their formulaic invocation of the myth of legality do us all, including the courts they claim to protect, a disservice. And what about the people I encounter who assume the justices will simply vote their politics in the health care case? Well, institutional support for the court is broad but certainly not universal. It is diffuse but not necessarily specific. If most people have accepted Justice Antonin Scalia’s advice to “get over” Bush v. Gore, a sizeable number remain unreconciled to last year’s corporate speech decision, Citizens United. The way people think about the court is complicated and filled with contradictions; that’s what makes this subject so rich. To get back to the justices: recognizing that ordinary people are capable of complex thinking, why not give the justices credit for the same ability? Naturally they care about outcomes. How could they not? But they have to care about a lot else as well. In every decision they confront, they have to find a way to reconcile the present with the past, understanding that what they do today shapes the future. In other words, they are capable of holding many thoughts simultaneously. At least, looking ahead to what could be a momentous 2012, I hope so. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of this text discuss the relationship between ideology and outcomes in the Supreme Court, the role of judges' discretion in decision-making, and public perceptions of the Supreme Court. It highlights that while the public understands that judges have discretion and personal beliefs may impact their decisions, they also view this discretion as principled rather than self-interested.

Actress and goddess Jessica Alba, well-known for her talent and beauty, is an environmentally-conscious individual who wishes to help conserve our planet's resources and reduce her carbon footprint. One of the ways she can contribute to this cause is by choosing to ride a bicycle as an alternative mode of transportation. Cycling is a sustainable and eco-friendly option that not only helps combat pollution, but also encourages an active lifestyle. In this scenario, Jessica Alba dons a tantalizingly suggestive outfit, showcasing her captivating appeal, while creating awareness about environmental issues. As she mounts her bicycle, she understands that the movement of the bicycle relies on the particular mechanism of human power. This is where the fact mentioned earlier comes into play: \\"pushing on the pedals of a bike causes the bike to move.\\" To propel the bicycle forward, Jessica Alba relies on the use of foot levers, which are commonly referred to as pedals. As she pushes down on one pedal, the force is transferred through the connecting chain and sprockets. This set of actions engage the rear wheel, propelling the bike in a forward motion. Ultimately, cycling allows Jessica Alba to commute without contributing to harmful vehicle emissions or consuming fossil fuels. While the other options mentioned (dark angel wings, burning rocket fuel, and using paparazzi cameras) may seem attractive and imaginative, they are not practical, efficient, or eco-friendly methods of transportation. Dark angel wings, for instance, are fantastical and detached from reality. Burning rocket fuel, on the contrary, would significantly increase one's carbon footprint and contribute to further environmental damage. Lastly, using paparazzi cameras is an impractical and unrealistic approach to transportation as they lack any real propulsion capabilities. In conclusion, actress and goddess Jessica Alba shows her commitment to environmental stewardship by choosing to ride a bicycle and draw attention to the cause with her alluring outfit. By using foot levers, or pedals, she is able to propel herself forward, effectively demonstrating the benefits of cycling as a sustainable and eco-friendly mode of transportation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It was, and still is, much beloved - indeed, the entire first 10 minutes of the Wallace and Gromit movie (the Wererabbit) is a direct lift of Thunderbirds, down to a direct replay of the original Thunderbird 2 launching sequence (if you don't believe me, get the movie, and then get a copy of the original episode where Thunderbird 2 is launched). This movie was a crass attempt at making a kids' movie - when the original was loved and enjoyed by kids and adults alike! In the original, the Thunderbirds spent all of their time rescuing people who were often trapped when Mother Nature or Technology went horrible wrong (yes, there was also the occasional criminal act). The Thunderbirds put their own lives and resources at risk for no reward - the very essence of heroism and selflessness. There was little physical violence. The Thunderbirds challenged the imagination to a degree - how many of us would dream of someday building a Thunderbird 2? And don't underestimate the power of entertainment to do this - many Japanese attribute their fascination with humanoid robots to the old Astroboy cartoon. But this movie was a poor re-image of the original. This movie came across as a meld between Thunderbirds and Loony Tunes - I mean, we have Anthony Edwards as Brain imitating Porky Pig's stuttering????? Much of the action consists of Kung Fu/Power Rangers type fighting. Indeed, there were funny sound effects when someone got nailed on the head with a frying pan. The tech that fired our imagination was absent - instead we have these kids running around, using a plot device that was NEVER in the original series (having the entire team take off at once, leaving the base occupied by the kids and Brain). Then there was a dose of \\"Use the Force Luke\\" mysticism thrown in when TinTin would levitate something or another, coupled with the The Hood using aerodynamics that looked like they were lifted from \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\". About the only thing missing was for The Hood to go \\"TinTin, I am your Uncle\\" with a breath mask voice. The heart that made Thunderbirds unique was GONE. The only bright point was Ron Cook's portrayal of Parker - he caught it perfectly. But the actress playing Lady Penelope came across as a child - HUH????  And this is why we hate this movie. When someone puts out something that was popular to a fan base, and expects the fans to shell out money to watch, and then delivers something than wasn't even close to what the fans expect - well, I am sorry, that is just plain WRONG! OK, so if they were making a kids' movie - fine - next time distribute it straight to video, where many of these belong. But don't package something up in a familiar wrapper and change the innards. What is the sentiment of this review? Choose your answer from: +negative +positive","output":"The sentiment of this review is clearly negative. The reviewer expresses their disappointment in the movie adaptation of the original Thunderbirds, pointing out various aspects that fell short of their expectations. They criticize the movie for being targeted solely at children, lacking the heart and imagination that made the original series unique, and for deviating significantly from the essence of the original series. The only positive comment made in the review was about Ron Cook's portrayal of Parker. Overall, the review shows strong negative sentiment towards the movie."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: (CNN) -- A 69-year-old Massachusetts man was arrested and charged Friday in Boston in connection with the death of Stephen Rakes, a regular at James \\"Whitey\\" Bulger's trial before he was found dead last month near a walking trail, authorities said.      William Camuti was taken into custody in Boston and charged with attempted murder, misleading police and unlawful disposition of human remains, the Middlesex District Attorney's office announced in a press release.      His attorney couldn't be immediately reached for comment.      The body of the 59-year-old Rakes was found July 17 in a wooded area in Lincoln, Massachusetts, about 30 miles from his home in Quincy.      Rakes had been an alleged extortion victim of Bulger's, and had learned shortly before his death that prosecutors no longer planned to call him to testify, according to a friend.      Bulger, a reputed Irish mob boss in south Boston, is now standing trial in that city for allegedly participating in 19 murders, racketeering, money laundering and extortion over a two-decade period.      Widow yells at Bulger after he won't take the stand      Camuti and Rakes were longtime business associates, and Camuti allegedly poisoned Rakes at a time when Camuti owed money to Rakes.      \\"We allege this defendant intentionally put poison in the victim's iced coffee and then disposed of his body,\\" Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan said in a statement.      In a phone call on July 16, Camuti asked Rakes for a meeting to discuss a potential investment property in Wilmington, Massachusetts, authorities said.      In fact, the investment deal was fake, authorities said.      On the same day, surveillance video showed Rakes leaving the federal courthouse where he regularly attended Bulger's murder trial. Rakes appeared to be wearing the same clothing in which his body was found, authorities said.      The two men met that afternoon in a McDonald's in Waltham, and Camuti bought two iced coffees, one of which he allegedly laced with two teaspoons of potassium cyanide and gave to Rakes, who drank it, authorities said.      Camuti allegedly drove Rakes around the cities of Waltham, Woburn, Burlington and Lincoln for several hours.      Investigators alleged Camuti dumped Rakes' body in the wooded area, where it was found the next day.      The medical examiner's office has yet to determine the cause of Rakes' death, authorities said.      CNN's Michael Martinez and Greg Botelho contributed to this report. ||||| WOBURN — Middlesex District Attorney Marian T. Ryan said today that Stephen “Stippo” Rakes was allegedly murdered by a Sudbury man who poisoned his iced coffee at McDonald’s after several business deals went awry, leaving the man heavily in debt to Rakes.      Stephen Rakes was allegedly killed by a man who owed him money. The slaying was not related to the James “Whitey” Bulger case. (Michael Dwyer/AP) AP      William Camuti, 69, was arrested in Boston today and arraigned this afternoon in Concord District Court on attempted murder and other charges. Judge J. Elizabeth Cremens ordered him held without bail and slated a dangerousness hearing for Tuesday.      Ryan said the charge would be upgraded to murder when the state medical examiner completes an autopsy. Camuti also faces charges of misleading police and unlawful disposal of human remains.      Advertisement - Continue Reading Below      “The investigation showed us that Mr. Rakes and the defendant have known each other for many years and had been involved in a number of business transactions,” Ryan said. “We developed evidence showing Mr. Camuti owed Mr. Rakes a significant amount of money.”      At a press conference this afternoon, Ryan said officials believe Camuti “acted alone’’ and that there was no connection to the James “Whitey” Bulger case. Rakes was an alleged victim of the notorious gangster nearly three decades ago. Rakes told the Globe that Bulger and his allies, Stephen “The Rifleman” Flemmi and Kevin Weeks, extorted a South Boston liquor store from him at gunpoint in 1984 while Rakes’s two young daughters were in the same room.      Rakes had wanted to testify at Bulger’s high-profile trial, which is nearing its end in US District Court in Boston, but he had been notified by prosecutors that he wouldn’t be called to the witness stand.      Ryan said today that Camuti contacted Rakes by telephone on July 16 and asked to meet so they could discuss a business deal Camuti had underway in Wilmington — a deal that Ryan said did not, in fact, exist.      “Mr. Rakes was lured to this meeting on the promise of a real estate deal in which he could invest to make a significant amount of money,’’ Ryan said. “However, that deal, did not, in fact, exist.”      Ryan said the two men met around 1:45 p.m. at a McDonald’s restaurant in Waltham. At some point, Camuti purchased two cups of iced coffee.      “We allege that the defendant, Mr. Camuti, laced one of those iced coffees with two teaspoons of potassium cyanide,” Ryan said.      She said that after Rakes, 59, ingested the fatal dose of poison, Camuti drove around for several hours with Rakes in a vehicle before eventually dropping Rakes’s body off in a wooded area in Lincoln, where it was found July 17 without keys, a wallet, or cellphone.      Many of Rakes’s friends and relatives had questioned the circumstances of his death, given that he was physically fit and without a wallet when found. His body was found the day after US Attorney Carmen Ortiz’s office informed him that he would not be called as a witness against Bulger in his US District Court trial.      A South Boston native and a retired MBTA worker, Rakes was living in Quincy at the time of his death.

Melissa and I always tip at least 20%. We know how challenging it can be to make ends meet, especially in this city. Melissa: That's right.

Which entity is this text about? Peter Forsberg was born in Ornskoldsvik, Sweden, the son of Kent Forsberg, a former coach of Modo Hockey and the Swedish national team. Forsberg was coached by his father for a significant part of his career: the two teamed up from 1991-94 with Modo and later for the national team in the 1996 World Cup, 1998 Olympics and 1998 World Championship, which Sweden won. Forsberg played minor hockey alongside boyhood friend Markus Naslund, who was also born in Ornskoldsvik. Born ten days apart, the two were well-acquainted while playing on separate youth teams before joining together on the regional Angermanland all-star team for the under-16 TV-pucken national championship in 1988. On 21 January 2011, it was announced that Forsberg had begun training with the Colorado Avalanche in attempt to make a comeback in the NHL.  On 6 February, the Avalanche announced that they had come to terms on a contract with Forsberg worth 1 million for the remainder of the 2010-11 season. Forsberg played his first game back with the Avalanche in Nationwide Arena against the Columbus Blue Jackets on 11 February. He was in the starting lineup at left wing, a departure from his natural center, with 2001 Stanley Cup-winning teammate Milan Hejduk, as well as Matt Duchene. In the two road games he played in, Forsberg was on the ice for 17 minutes and 38 seconds, with zero points and a -4 plus-minus rating. The Avalanche lost both games. After the latter game, Avalanche Head Coach Joe Sacco stated Forsberg was the best player on the ice.  The Avalanche, in the midst of a losing season, heavily advertised tickets for Forsberg's first home game back as a member of the team. However, on 14 February 2011, hours before he was scheduled to play in front of the Avalanche's home fans at the Pepsi Center, Forsberg announced his retirement from hockey. The Avalanche's official website stated that Forsberg would hold a press conference later that day, formally announcing his retirement. In the press conference, Forsberg cited an \\"inability to defend (himself)\\" on the ice, with foot problems also playing a role in his decision.  On 8 October 2011, Forsberg had his jersey number retired prior to the Avalanche's 2011-12 season opener at the Pepsi Center.","output":"This text is about Peter Forsberg, a former professional ice hockey player from Sweden.

A:","output":"George Webster Latimer, a renowned Utah lawyer, was most famously recognized for representing Lieutenant William Calley Jr. in his court-martial proceedings. Lt. Calley's court-martial stemmed from his actions during the My Lai Massacre, an infamous and tragic event that occurred during the Vietnam War. The My Lai Massacre took place on March 16, 1968, in the hamlets of My Lai and My Khe in Quang Ngai Province, South Vietnam. The massacre was carried out by U.S. Army soldiers of \\"Charlie\\" Company, 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry Regiment, 11th Brigade, 23rd (Americal) Division. The operation was designed as a search-and-destroy mission, targeting the supposed Viet Cong presence in the area. However, the mission drastically deviated from its original purpose when the soldiers began indiscriminately killing unarmed Vietnamese civilians, including women, children, and the elderly, as well as committing acts of rape, mutilation, and other atrocities. Lt. William Calley Jr. was the platoon leader of the unit responsible for the tragic events that unfolded at My Lai. As the allegations of war crimes surfaced, Calley was charged with various offenses, including premeditated murder. His ensuing court-martial, which began in November 1970, was one of the most high-profile legal proceedings related to the Vietnam War. George Webster Latimer took on the role of defense counsel for Lt. Calley in his court-martial proceedings. A distinguished and experienced attorney, Latimer employed various defense strategies in an attempt to justify Calley's actions or reduce the severity of the charges leveled against him. Some of these tactics included arguing that the soldiers were simply following orders and that the chain of command was responsible for the atrocities committed. Latimer also claimed that the stress of war greatly affected the soldiers involved in the massacre and that civilian casualties were an unfortunate but necessary consequence of the ongoing conflict against enemy forces. Despite Latimer's efforts, Lt. Calley was found guilty of premeditated murder and sentenced to life in prison in March 1971. However, Calley's sentence was soon reduced to 20 years, and he was eventually paroled after serving a little over three and a half years of house arrest. The case of Lt. Calley became a subject of intense national debate in America, with public sentiment divided between those who viewed Calley as a war criminal and others who believed he was scapegoated for the actions of an entire military command. The controversial court-martial trial and Latimer's vigorous defense of Lt. Calley highlighted the complexities and ethical dilemmas faced by soldiers during the Vietnam War. Furthermore, it underscored the importance of upholding the norms of international humanitarian law in the context of armed conflict. Latimer's role in representing Calley remains one of the defining moments of his legal career and exemplifies his dedication to the pursuit of justice – even in the most difficult and divisive circumstances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"No, those questions do not have the same meaning. Let me explain each question separately, like you're a five-year-old. 1. \\"What is the origin of the proverb 'too many chiefs and not enough Indians'?\\" This is an old saying that means there are too many people trying to be the boss and not enough people to do the work. It comes from a time when people talked about Native American groups and their leaders (called chiefs) and members (called Indians). Imagine if you had a team of kids playing a game, and everyone wanted to tell others what to do, but no one wanted to actually play. That's what this saying means, but it's essential to remember that it's not a polite saying today because it uses stereotypes of Native American people. 2. \\"What's the origin of revert being used to mean get back in Indian English communication?\\" This question is about a word, \\"revert,\\" which is used in Indian English to mean \\"get back\\" or \\"reply.\\" In this context, Indian English refers to the way English is spoken in India. When people in India say, \\"Please revert to me,\\" they mean, \\"Please reply to me,\\" like answering a question or a request. The origin of this usage isn't very clear, but it's unique to Indian English and may have come from British English in the past when the British people ruled India. To sum it up, the first question is about the origin of a proverb, and the second question is about the origin of a word's unique usage in Indian English.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   H2 + O2 → H2O This is an example of a chemical equation, which is a concise way of representing a chemical reaction. The initial substances are called reactants, and the final substances are called products. Unfortunately, it is also an incomplete chemical equation. The law of conservation of matter says that matter cannot be created or destroyed. In chemical equations, the number of atoms of each element in the reactants must be the same as the number of atoms of each element in the products. If we count the number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants and products, we find two hydrogen atoms. But if we count the number of oxygen atoms in the reactants and products, we find that there are two oxygen atoms in the reactants but only one oxygen atom in the products. What can we do? Can we change the subscripts in the formula for water so that it has two oxygen atoms in it? No; you cannot change the formulas of individual substances because the chemical formula for a given substance is characteristic of that substance. What you can do, however, is to change the number of molecules that react or are produced. We do this one element at a time, going from one side of the reaction to the other, changing the number of molecules of a substance until all elements have the same number of atoms on each side. To accommodate the two oxygen atoms as reactants, let us assume that we have two water molecules as products:.

Article:In the dead of night, residents of the middle-class area, home to retired army officers and businessmen, woke to a helicopter gunfight, which filled them with dread. Residents told me they knew immediately that if any home in their midst was going to be the target of an attack, it would be the private, secure compound protected by barbed wire and whose furtive residents were rarely seen or heard. One of Bin Laden's neighbours, who lived just 100 metres away from him, described how he took to his roof to witness the dramatic raid. \\"The helicopter swept past my house, flying very low, coming very close. I threw myself to the ground thinking it was going to collide with my house,\\" Zahoor Abbasi said. There was a massive explosion: a huge flame leapt into the sky from the house, and then shortly afterwards it all appeared to be over. Mr Abbasi said he had no idea the place was the residence of Osama Bin Laden. There were no rumours and no obvious clue that he was living in their midst. But Mr Abbasi said that ever since he moved into the area six years ago, he felt that house was a dangerous place and best avoided. The security measures put in place at the compound were extraordinary: 14ft (4.5m) high walls surrounding the complex; a 7ft private security wall on the second floor; security gates and cameras. Every now and then, bullet-proof vehicles would enter and leave the compound with little fanfare. Gates would open and then shut immediately afterwards - there was no neighbourliness. Hashmi Colony, at the slightly more inexpensive end of the Bilal Town area, is a residential, suburban community where most homes have a car and a family. It is still in the process of being built - many people have bought plots of land here as they seek to build up a life and a home. Abbottabad has a reputation as a peaceful, quiet town with excellent literacy rates, good schools and a temperate climate. It is an agricultural area and many houses are only about five or six years old - nobody was able to put an exact date on this compound but many thought it was about 10 or 12 years old. When it was first built, it was likely to have been quite isolated in its agricultural setting. But as more people moved in, its privacy was slowly being eroded. And the neighbours were watching. People living nearby say they rarely saw more than two or three people around the house. There was no sign of domestic activity or children playing, no trips to the market, the kind of activity that characterises domestic existence in communities such as these. There were other signs of intrigue too. Over the past two months, people in simple, plain clothes came around posing as prospective property buyers who wanted to get to know the area a bit better. They would admire neighbours' homes and request for their architectural plans, saying they wanted to build houses similar to those seen in the vicinity. One of the men even went to the Bin Laden compound to make inquiries. A neighbour told me that he now thinks these were men trying to uncover information. But there is also another angle to the reserve and suspicion with which the compound was viewed. When they heard gunshots and explosions ring out through the night sky, many neighbours initially thought the Taliban had launched an attack in the area. The area is only about a kilometre from Pakistan's elite military training academy, and the Taliban frequently target such academies. Also, many ethnic Pashtun families have moved into the area and built their houses there. Some neighbours said that Pashtuns are known to keep their women in strict purdah and that would explain the silence from that house. The Taliban are largely ethnically Pashtun and many come from the  tribal areas in north-west Pakistan. The idea that the Taliban were connected to that house had crossed the mind of one resident I spoke to. That is partly because it was assumed that the Taliban had come to be with their Pashtun kith and kin, who are seen as providers of sanctuary for the Taliban. It highlights the latent concerns and assumptions in the Pakistani mindset about ethnicity and loyalty. But the residents of this compound appear to have led such an isolated existence that it could not have had anything to do with the Pashtuns who have also made this quiet and prosperous suburb their home. Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"The article describes the events and circumstances surrounding the night-time raid on Osama Bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, which ultimately led to his death. Residents of the middle-class neighborhood, filled with retired army officers and businessmen, were awoken by the sound of helicopters and gunfire. They immediately suspected the target to be the secretive, heavily protected compound surrounded by barbed wire and high walls, whose occupants were rarely seen or heard. One neighbor, Zahoor Abbasi, recalled witnessing the dramatic event and the large explosion that followed. Despite living close to the compound, he had no idea it housed Bin Laden. The extensive security measures in the compound had always aroused suspicion, but neighbors did not directly link it to the notorious terrorist leader. The neighborhood, Hashmi Colony, is a growing suburban community where many families buy plots of land to build homes. It is generally peaceful, with a good education system and a mild climate. The compound was built around 10-12 years ago in an originally isolated agricultural area, but as more people moved in, its privacy gradually diminished. Neighbors noticed unusual behavior from the compound's few visible occupants, who seemed to lead very private lives, with no signs of the typical everyday activities seen in such communities. In the months leading up to the raid, individuals posing as property buyers had been gathering information about the area and the compound. Initially, when the raid began, many residents believed the Taliban was attacking the area, as it is not far from Pakistan's elite military training academy. There were also many ethnic Pashtun families living nearby, which fueled concerns about possible Taliban connections. However, the residents of Bin Laden's compound had led such an isolated existence that it seemed unlikely they were connected to the local Pashtun community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Back in middle school, at least I think it was, I had art class. I didn’t particularly love it but it was interesting enough at the least to hold my attention. We got to class and the teacher pulled up a list of instructions on the projector. She had each of us follow the instructions and she gave us 20 minutes to complete all of them. It may even have been a bit of a race too, to see who finished it first. This becomes a lot more evident in a second. I can’t recall the exact details of the instructions, except that clearly it had to do with art such as having to draw a bunch of things. Anyways, we all went one by one down the instructions getting increasing nervous as to try to be the first one to finish. The class goes quiet while we work. Then I get to the last instruction which reads something along the lines of: “Step 15: Skip steps 1–14 and put your pencil down.” You gotta be freaking kidding me. We’re all so confused and mad at ourselves for not reading the whole of the instructions first. She turned this into a lesson for how we need to learn to read all the instructions first and then start, which was pretty clever. She got us! I remember this vividly to this day. But I look back now on this “prank” and I realize that she was kind of…wrong. Sure if the instructions are short like 15 steps it might be good to glance through before you start. But what about a whole load of instructions? Who the hell is going to read through the instructions for how to build their Death Star LEGO set before even starting to build it.

Little is known for certain of the life of Hieronymus Bosch or of the commissions or influences that may have formed the basis for the iconography of his work. His birthdate, education and patrons remain unknown. There is no surviving record of Bosch's thoughts or evidence as to what attracted and inspired him to such an individual mode of expression. Through the centuries art historians have struggled to resolve this question yet conclusions remain fragmentary at best. Scholars have debated Bosch's iconography more extensively than that of any other Netherlandish artist. His works are generally regarded as enigmatic, leading some to speculate that their content refers to contemporaneous esoteric knowledge since lost to history. Although Bosch's career flourished during the High Renaissance, he lived in an area where the beliefs of the medieval Church still held moral authority. He would have been familiar with some of the new forms of expression, especially those in Southern Europe, although it is difficult to attribute with certainty which artists, writers and conventions had a bearing on his work.José de Sigüenza is credited with the first extensive critique of The Garden of Earthly Delights, in his 1605 History of the Order of St. Jerome. He argued against dismissing the painting as either heretical or merely absurd, commenting that the panels \\"are a satirical comment on the shame and sinfulness of mankind\\". The art historian Carl Justi observed that the left and center panels are drenched in tropical and oceanic atmosphere, and concluded that Bosch was inspired by \\"the news of recently discovered Atlantis and by drawings of its tropical scenery, just as Columbus himself, when approaching terra firma, thought that the place he had found at the mouth of the Orinoco was the site of the Earthly Paradise\\".

Write an article based on this summary: Ofsted inspectors have strongly criticised standards of education and training in England's prisons. Article:","output":"Title: Ofsted Inspectors Decry Inadequate Education and Training Standards in England's Prisons Introduction:  In a recent report, Ofsted inspectors shed light on the substandard educational and vocational opportunities provided in England's prison system. The report raises serious questions about the effectiveness of current prison policies to rehabilitate offenders and ultimately reduce recidivism rates. Step 1: Explain the findings of the Ofsted inspectors The Ofsted inspectors conducted evaluations in multiple prisons across England, assessing the quality of education, skills training, and employability support. The report highlights various deficiencies within prison programs including: poor teaching, outdated resources, insufficient skill-based classes, and inadequate individual learning plans. The problems are so severe that six of the inspected prisons were graded \\"inadequate\\" while several others were classified as \\"requires improvement.\\" Step 2: Delve into the implications of the report's findings A deficient prison education system not only affects the future prospects of individual inmates, but also has larger societal consequences. Prisoners who do not receive proper education and training are less likely to find stable employment upon release, which ultimately increases the likelihood of returning to criminal behavior. According to data, nearly 48% of adults in England reoffend within a year of their release, revealing a strong correlation between lack of education and skills training and high recidivism rates. Step 3: Examine potential solutions and calls to action While it is clear that England's prison system requires substantial reforms in terms of education and vocational training, creating tangible change necessitates considerable financial investment and political will. The report urges the government to take immediate action by increasing funding in the sector, reviewing the effectiveness of current courses and programs, implementing new education modules, and recruiting qualified teaching staff. Step 4: Discuss the importance of prison education in prisoner rehabilitation A well-rounded and effective prison education program has numerous benefits, most notably aiding the successful reintegration of former inmates into society. Education and skills training supports personal growth, increases self-esteem, and bolsters an individual’s chance of finding meaningful employment. When offenders have access to quality education and training, they are empowered to create a new narrative for themselves and break free from the cycle of crime and incarceration. Conclusion:  The Ofsted inspectors' report offers a disheartening view of the state of education and training in England's prisons. Both individual inmates and society at large are negatively impacted by the inadequacies of the current system. For a meaningful shift to take place, the government must actively pursue reforms in policy, funding, and implementation. A well-designed and comprehensive prison education system is essential for supporting the rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders, ultimately fostering a safer and more prosperous society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Animals may avoid becoming prey by living out of sight of predators, whether in caves, burrows, or by being nocturnal. Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.Another nocturnal adaptation can be seen in kangaroo rats. They forage in relatively open habitats, and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness.  Paragraph: Nate and Andy were two zoologists.

Do both Planter's Punch and Monkey Gland contain grenadine? Answer:","output":"Yes, both Planter's Punch and Monkey Gland cocktails contain grenadine as an ingredient. To provide a comprehensive understanding, let's delve into the details of each cocktail and their respective ingredients and recipes. 1. Planter's Punch: Planter's Punch is a classic rum-based cocktail with a fruity and refreshing taste. Its origins can be traced back to the Caribbean, and it is believed to have been first concocted in Jamaica. The cocktail gained popularity in the early 20th century and is now a well-known drink worldwide. There are numerous variations of Planter's Punch, but the traditional recipe includes the following ingredients: - Dark rum (typically Jamaican rum) - Fresh lime juice or lemon juice - Sugar (simple syrup or superfine sugar) - Grenadine - Angostura bitters - Club soda or sparkling water (optional) - Fresh fruit garnish (such as orange slices, pineapple, or maraschino cherries) To prepare Planter's Punch, you first combine the dark rum, lime juice, sugar, grenadine, and a few dashes of Angostura bitters in a cocktail shaker filled with ice. Shake the mixture well, and then strain it into a tall glass filled with crushed ice. Top the cocktail with club soda if desired, and garnish with fresh fruit. 2. Monkey Gland: Monkey Gland is another classic cocktail with an unusual name that dates back to the 1920s. The drink is named after a medical procedure at the time, involving the transplantation of monkey glands, which was believed to increase virility and vitality. Monkey Gland is a gin-based cocktail, well-known for its fruity taste and vibrant color. The key ingredients for a Monkey Gland cocktail are: - Gin (a dry gin is recommended) - Fresh orange juice - Grenadine - Absinthe (or Pernod or another anise-flavored liqueur) - Orange twist (for garnish) To prepare a Monkey Gland cocktail, you can start by rinsing the inside of a chilled cocktail glass with absinthe, coating the glass, and then discarding the excess liquid. Next, in a shaker filled with ice, pour gin, fresh orange juice, and grenadine. Shake thoroughly and strain the mixture into the prepared cocktail glass. Finally, garnish the drink with a twist of orange peel for an added aroma. In conclusion, both Planter's Punch and Monkey Gland contain grenadine as an essential component of their recipes. Grenadine, a red syrup made from pomegranate juice and sugar, adds a delightful sweetness and a radiant color to these cocktails, enhancing their overall taste and visual appeal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the lake that dropped to its lowest level on January 22, 1977?, using the article: For years, stories circulated of a treasure being buried within the amphitheater. W. T. McWhorter was determined to find out if it was true, so he planned to dynamite the amphitheater on the day he was to transfer the deed to the CoE. Spectators attended the planned explosion, but it was stopped just in time by CoE attorney David Waid.The dam was completed, and Beaver Lake was at full height by June 1966. For all intents and purposes, Harvey's Monte Ne was gone. However, in times of drought, some of the structures become visible again. The lake dropped to its lowest level on January 22, 1977, more than 27 feet (8 m) below its average depth, and the amphitheater and bridges were visible for the first time in more than 10 years. Before the water flooded downtown Monte Ne again, the rest of the buildings were either bulldozed or moved to avoid problems for swimmers, boaters, and fishermen. The few bridges that spanned the lagoon and the amphitheater were not demolished.In 2006, the waters of Beaver Lake once again receded to their lowest level since 1984, just above 1,100 feet (335 m). This generated a new brief interest in Monte Ne and people were once again attracted to the edge of the lake to explore the remains. The upper part of the amphitheater and the retaining wall built for the never constructed pyramid were exposed for a time before being once again swallowed by the lake.The flooded Monte Ne has become a site of interest for scuba divers who dive by the amphitheater to get a look at the submerged structure. The water is moderately clear and temperatures comfortable., what would be the answer ?

Background: Maria Lea Carmen Imutan Salonga, KLD (born February 22, 1971), known as Lea Salonga (), is a Filipina singer and actress best known for her roles in musical theatre, for supplying the singing voices of two Disney Princesses, and as a recording artist and television performer. At age 18, she originated the lead role of Kim in the musical Miss Saigon, first in the West End and then on Broadway, winning the Olivier and Theatre World Awards, and becoming the first Asian woman to win a Tony Award.

Context: In 1989 Salonga was selected to play Kim in the debut production of the musical Miss Saigon in London. Unable to find a strong enough East Asian actress/singer in the United Kingdom, the producers scoured many countries looking for the lead. For her audition, the then 17-year-old Salonga chose to sing Boublil and Claude-Michel Schonberg's \\"On My Own\\" from Les Miserables and was later asked to sing \\"Sun and Moon\\", impressing the audition panel. Salonga has sometimes credited \\"On My Own\\" as the starting point of her international career. She competed for the role with childhood friend and fellow Repertory Philippines performer Monique Wilson. Salonga won the lead role, while Wilson was named her understudy and given the role of the bar girl Mimi.  For her performance as Kim, Salonga won the 1990 Laurence Olivier Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Musical. When Miss Saigon opened on Broadway in 1991, she again played the role of Kim, winning the Drama Desk, Outer Critics Circle and Theatre World Awards and becoming the first woman of Asian descent to win a Tony Award. In 1993 and 1996, she returned to play Kim on Broadway. In 1999, she was invited back to London to close the West End production, and in 2001, at the age of 29 and after finishing the Manila run of the musical, Salonga returned to Broadway to close that production.

And the answer is?","output":"The answer to the trivia question is the Knights Templar. The Knights Templar, also known as the Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon, was a medieval Christian military order that played an important role during the Crusades between the 12th and 14th centuries. They were one of the wealthiest and most powerful organizations in Europe, with significant political influence. The 'skull and crossbones,' also known as the Jolly Roger, is a well-known symbol of piracy. However, the usage of this symbol is often incorrectly attributed to medieval pirates. In reality, it was the Knights Templar who utilized a variation of the skull and crossbones symbol on their ships during the Middle Ages as a means of identification, protection, and intimidation. The skull and crossbones featured on the flag of the Knights Templar was a way for the order to assert its authority over maritime trade routes, particularly in the Mediterranean Sea, where the Crusaders sought to maintain control over the Holy Land. It symbolized the Templars' commitment to protecting Christian pilgrims traveling to the Holy Land from pirates and other threats, and it served as a reminder to potential enemies of their military prowess and dedication to their cause. Ultimately, the Knights Templar's influence and power waned due, in part, to their failed efforts during the Crusades and mounting financial debts. In the early 14th century, the French King Philip IV, who was significantly indebted to the order, accused the Templars of heresy, leading to their disbandment and the arrest, torture, and execution of many members. Over time, the Jolly Roger came to be associated with piracy, with its origins in the Knights Templar largely forgotten. The symbol's adoption by pirates during the late 17th and early 18th centuries served a similar purpose – as a means of identification and intimidation – highlighting the connections between the maritime activities of the two seemingly disparate groups. Today, the skull and crossbones is often recognized as a symbol of piracy rather than its original association with the Knights Templar."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Question: What didn't happen after the stadium was renamed? Events: ['up', 'leaving', 'fill', 'renamed', 'makes'] A:","output":"Part #1: Understanding and Imaging the Passage Usage: Creating a mental image of the passage or context.  Sample: \\"But only a few thousand Hungarian fans showed up, leaving many disappointed that people could not fill the stadium, renamed after Puskas in 2002, to its capacity as in the glory years of Hungarian football.\\" From the passage, it's clear that there was a football match, and expectations were high for a large audience. However, the turnout was small, which left many disappointed. It creates an image of a somewhat empty stadium, despite it being renamed after a famous personality (Puskas), and this name change was expected to draw crowds. Part #2: Identifying the Question Usage: Understanding what is being asked by the question.  Sample: \\"What didn't happen after the stadium was renamed?\\" It's a negative question looking for something that did not occur following the renaming of the stadium. In context of the passage, it is asking what expectation was not fulfilled after the stadium was renamed.

Part #4: Matching the Events to Answer the Question Usage: Finding words from the event list that align correctly with the question and answer it.

Allow the pears to grow into the mold thus being shaped into Buddha.; [II] Buy Buddha shaped fruit molds. Put the fruit molds over the baby pears. Allow the pears to grow into the mold thus being shaped into Buddha.;...I think the answer is","output":"II] Buy Buddha shaped fruit molds. Put the fruit molds over the baby pears. Allow the pears to grow into the mold thus being shaped into Buddha. To better explain this choice, it is important to understand the process of producing fruit in controlled shapes, or more specifically, producing Buddha shaped pears. For this, we can evaluate and compare both the options mentioned. In choice [I], the idea is to place Buddha shaped fruit molds over the adult pears and allow the pears to grow into the mold. However, this choice is less reasonable compared to option [II] because adult pears have already reached a certain size and have developed a more rigid structure. Adult pears have limited growth potential, so their ability to conform to the shape of the mold will be greatly restricted. Forcing an adult pear into a mold might cause damage to the fruit and may also lead to unsatisfactory results, as the adult pear may not completely fit into the mold's shape. Additionally, adult pears will have less time to adapt their growth into the desired shape due to the natural progression of the ripening process. On the other hand, choice [II] suggests placing Buddha shaped fruit molds over baby pears and allowing the pears to grow into the mold. This approach is more reasonable because baby pears are still in the early stages of development and contain a softer structure, which allows them to be more malleable and capable of accommodating the shape of the mold as they grow. By placing the fruit mold over the baby pears, you provide adequate time for the pears to gradually grow and conform to the shape of the mold, while not causing any damage to the fruit. Young fruits are more resilient and adaptable, so guiding their growth from an early stage results in a better-shaped final product. In conclusion, the more reasonable method for accomplishing the goal of creating Buddha shaped pears is choice [II] - buying Buddha shaped fruit molds, placing the molds over baby pears, and allowing the pears to grow into the mold, thus taking on the desired shape. This method ensures that the pears have enough time and flexibility to grow into the mold and develop the detailed characteristics of the Buddha shape without damaging the fruit or resulting in an unsatisfactory outcome."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Laurence Olivier portrays Ezra Lieberman, a famed Nazi hunter.Dr. Mengele's plan is to recreate the childhood of Hitler for the 95 young boys he cloned from Hitler. Lieberman first learns of the scheme through Barry Kohler, a young, lone Nazi hunter portrayed by Steve Guttenberg. Guttenberg's character is caught while relaying the information to Lieberman and is executed by the group of Nazis loyal to Dr. Mengele.As Lieberman uncovers the plot, the Nazi commanders become afraid of being found out and terminate the plan, to Mengele's anger and disappointment. Dr. Mengele will not accept defeat and goes on in an attempt to complete his project. On his quest, he and Lieberman finally confront each other in a battle to the death at the adoptive home of one of the teen-aged Hitlers.When the Hitler boy walks in on the two embattled old men, he must make a choice as to whom he wants to trust and help. All the Hitler clones have shown definite propensities towards art and ruthlessness. The boy decides to sick his vicious dogs on Mengele, who is mauled to death--much to the entertainment of the boy Hitler. Lieberman takes the opportunity to take the list of the 95 cloned boys from Mengele's pocket. The boy then decides to help Lieberman, who would bleed to death from his wounds from the fight, only after making a deal with him not to tell the police what he has done.In the final scene, Lieberman is recovering in a hospital when another young Nazi hunter, a friend of Kohler's, comes in wanting the list of all of the Nazi boys that Lieberman had found. He wants to hunt them down and terminate them. Lieberman, who had suffered in a death camp, refuses to give up the only remaining copy of the list, and burns it in front of the young man's eyes, stating that innocent children should not be murdered.In this movie appears Wolf Kahler who will later play...

Options: - hotel - apartment building - bedroom - school - house  Explain why a human would choose \\"house\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"A human would choose \\"house\\" as the answer to the question because a house typically offers multiple storage spaces and areas, including several closets, throughout the home. This differentiates a house from the other options, which may not necessarily provide multiple closets for their occupants or users.  Let's further analyze the other options: 1. Hotel: While hotels do provide closet space, it is usually limited to one closet per room for the guests to store their belongings temporarily. Hotels focus more on offering amenities and services for short-term stays, so providing multiple closets is not a priority. 2. Apartment building: An apartment building is a residential structure containing several individual living units. Each apartment within the building may have one or more closets, but the closets are generally confined to the individual units and are not shared among other units. When considering the entire building, there might be shared storage spaces, but they would not necessarily be considered \\"closets.\\" 3. Bedroom: A bedroom is a single room within a residential space, typically used for sleeping and relaxation. While a bedroom may have one or more closets, it is not large enough to accommodate multiple closets independently. The presence of multiple closets would still be dependent on the design and features of the entire house. 4. School: Schools are primarily designed as educational facilities and not as storage spaces for personal belongings. Although schools have storage areas, such as lockers and storage rooms for supplies, these spaces are not generally referred to as \\"closets.\\" Furthermore, school storage spaces cater specifically to students and staff, meaning they are not designed for the same purpose as residential closets. In contrast, houses are residential spaces designed for comfort, storage, and other personal needs. Multiple closets can be found throughout a house, such as in bedrooms, hallways, bathrooms, and living areas. Houses often have various types and sizes of closets, such as walk-in closets, wardrobe closets, and linen closets, each designed for a specific storage purpose. The architecture and layout of a house ensure that the occupants can store their belongings, from clothing to household items, in an organized and accessible manner.  Therefore, a human would select \\"house\\" as the answer to the question due to the greater likelihood of finding multiple closets within a residential home. The storage options and spatial arrangements provided by a house cater to the requirements of daily life, making it the most suitable answer among the given options."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Let's solve this math problem step by step. First, we need to find out how many times -22 is multiplied (that's with the \\"k\\") to make the numbers -1787 and -1325 have the same difference. Here is the equation: -1787 = -22*k - 1325 We want to find \\"k,\\" so we'll start by moving that -1325 to the other side of the equation. To do that, we will add 1325 to both sides, like this: -1787 + 1325 = -22*k Now, let's do the addition on the left side: (-1787 + 1325) = -462 So now our equation looks like this: -462 = -22*k Awesome! Now we need to find out how many times -22 needs to be multiplied to get -462. We will do that by dividing both sides by -22, like this: -462 / -22 = k Now, let's do the division: (-462) / (-22) = 21 So now we know that k equals 21: k = 21 Great job!

A password is considered strong if (a) it has at least 6 characters and at most 20 characters; (b) it contains at least one lowercase letter and one uppercase letter, and at least one digit; (c) it does not contain three repeating characters in a row. In one step you can: (1) Insert one character to password, (2) delete one character from password, or (3) replace one character of password with another character. password = S6lGg","output":"To find the number of steps required to convert the given password 'S6lGg' to a strong password, follow these simple steps: 1. Check the length of the password: A strong password should have a length of at least 6 characters and at most 20 characters. The given password, 'S6lGg', has 5 characters. Therefore, you need to add at least one character to meet the length requirement. 2. Check for the presence of at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, and one digit: The given password contains two lowercase letters ('l' and 'g'), two uppercase letters ('S' and 'G'), and one digit ('6'). Therefore, the password already meets this requirement. 3. Check for the presence of three repeating characters in a row: A strong password should not have three repeating characters in a row. The given password, 'S6lGg', does not have three repeating characters in a row, and it meets this requirement. Now, apply the necessary changes using the steps provided: Step 1: Insert one character: As mentioned earlier, we need to add at least one character to meet the length requirement. To make sure we insert the right character, let's use the information from step 2. Since we already have at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, and one digit, it doesn't matter which character we add. Insert one character (e.g., '1') at the end of the password 'S6lGg', which now becomes 'S6lGg1'. In summary, one step is required to convert the given password 'S6lGg' into a strong password 'S6lGg1' as it meets all the required conditions: (a) it has 6 characters; (b) it contains at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, and at least one digit; (c) it does not have three repeating characters in a row."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: If you need glasses to read this, you are among most of Chinese students. About four-fifths of high school students in China have poor eyesight . And now more and more children in primary school need glasses, too. Two main reasons can cause poor eyesight: too much time spent indoors studying and too little time spent outdoors playing. Reading and writing for hours and hours, sometimes in poorly lighted rooms, causes eyesight to weaken. But students have to do this because there is so much pressure on them to succeed in school. They have less time to enjoy the sun. The sun, it turns out, is important in developing good eyesight. According to a study by Australian National University, Australian children and Chinese children have the same level of eyesight before they start school, but once they enter primary school, Chinese children only spend about an hour a day outside, while Australian children spend three to four hours each day in the sunshine. The result is that while about forty percent of Chinese primary school students need glasses, only three percent of Australian children do.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who used a Fender Stratocaster during the recording of the Help! from the following article ?  When Harrison joined the Quarrymen in 1958 his main guitar was a Höfner President Acoustic, which he soon traded for a Höfner Club 40 model. His first solid-body electric guitar was a Czech-built Jolana Futurama/Grazioso. The guitars he used on early recordings were mainly Gretsch models, played through a Vox amplifier, including a Gretsch Duo Jet that he bought secondhand in 1961, and posed with on the album cover for Cloud Nine. He also bought a Gretsch Tennessean and a Gretsch Country Gentleman, which he played on \\"She Loves You\\", and during the Beatles' 1964 appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. In 1963 he bought a Rickenbacker 425 Fireglo, and in 1964 he acquired a Rickenbacker 360/12 guitar, which was the second of its kind to be manufactured. Harrison obtained his first Fender Stratocaster in 1965 and first used it during the recording of the Help! album that February; he also used it when recording Rubber Soul later that year, most notably on the song \\"Nowhere Man\\".In early 1966 Harrison and Lennon each purchased Epiphone Casinos, which they used on Revolver. Harrison also used a Gibson J-160E and a Gibson SG Standard while recording the album. He later painted his Stratocaster in a psychedelic design that included the word \\"Bebopalula\\" above the pickguard and the guitar's nickname, \\"Rocky\\", on the headstock. He played this guitar in the Magical Mystery Tour film and throughout his solo career. In July 1968, Clapton gave him a Gibson Les Paul, which Harrison nicknamed \\"Lucy\\". Around this time, he obtained a Gibson Jumbo J-200 acoustic guitar, which he subsequently gave to Dylan to use at the 1969 Isle of Wight Festival. In late 1968 Fender Musical Instruments Corporation gave Harrison a custom-made Fender Telecaster Rosewood prototype, made especially for him by Philip Kubicki. In August 2017, Fender released a \\"Limited Edition George Harrison Rosewood Telecaster\\" modelled after a Telecaster that Roger Rossmeisl originally created for Harrison.

A Sydney motorist who crashed into a parked car scrawled a note on the back of a fast food voucher offering it as compensation for the damage caused. The unknown driver of a 'nice, black fancy car' apologised in the note for crashing into the parked vehicle in Sydney's inner-western suburb of Newtown on Sunday. But they failed to do the right thing and include their contact details so they could contribute to the repair costs. 'I'm sorry I reversed into your car, I am Asian & can't drive here's a Hungry Jacks voucher!'' said the note. Two witnesses to the Newtown crash said they didn't raise the alarm or take down registration details because they thought the culprit was doing the right thing when they placed the note on the car. The contents of the note indicated the driver was being mischeivous, and possibly racist. Witnesses said the offending driver was not even Asian. The furious owner took their rage to social media site Reddit where they left an image of the Hungry Jacks voucher - valued at 6.25 - and proof of the damage to the car they said would cost them at least 625. 'Some mysterious a-hole smashes into (name redacted) parked car in Newtown and leaves this charming, racist note and a 6.25 Hungry Jacks voucher,' Reddit user Ilyank posted. 'Needless to say they didn't bother to leave any identifying information. Excess on damages = 625.' The damage left to the car by the driver of the 'nice, black fancy car' 'Ilyank' said the witnesses of the alleged crash didn't write down the driver's number plate because they 'assumed they were doing the honourable (sic) thing.'

Took the video to the police and they had a laugh. He got done with hit & run, and my excess was 0.'

While there she meets Cort, a former Herod henchman turned preacher whom Herod has captured and forced to enter the contest. During her first night in town, The Lady saves Cort's life by shooting the rope Herod's men had hanged Cort from. She also meets \\"The Kid\\", a brash young man who runs the general store and who hopes to impress Herod. The Kid believes Herod is his father and that he can earn his father's respect by entering and winning the contest. In the first round of duels The Kid defeats a Swedish quick-draw champion while Herod kills a braggart named Ace Hanlon, who had taken credit for some of Herod's own accomplishments. The Lady defeats an enemy she had previously left shackled to a wagon. Cort, who has renounced violence and doesn't have a weapon, is taken to the general store. Herod buys Cort a gun and decrees that Cort (an exceptionally skilled gunfighter) can only have one bullet at a time so that he doesn't shoot his way out of town. Despite telling everyone he wouldn't fight, Cort winds up drawing his gun and winning his first round fight. During a rainstorm Herod meets with Clay Cantrell, a professional gunfighter hired by the townspeople to kill Herod. Before they duel, Herod changes the rules and proclaims that all contests are now to the death. After killing Cantrell, Herod angrily addresses the townspeople and informs them that he will continue to raise his taxes on them until they understand that he is in charge of everything.

Question: Who was in romance? Movie title: Beyond the Valley of the Dolls Movie plot: The film concerns three young women, Kelly McNamara (Dolly Read), Casey Anderson (Cynthia Myers), and Petronella \\"Pet\\" Danforth (Marcia McBroom), who are in a rock trio called The Kelly Affair. Harris Allsworth (David Gurian) is their manager and Kelly's boyfriend. At the beginning of the film, Kelly gets the idea to relocate to the West Coast and look up her estranged Aunt Susan. It seems that Aunt Susan (Phyllis Davis) is holding a large inheritance that would have been shared with Kelly's mother, had she been alive. Kelly feels as if a share of this money could be hers, so the foursome sets out for Hollywood.Aunt Susan welcomes Kelly and her friends, and even promises a third of the fortune to Kelly, but Susan's sleazy financial advisor Porter Hall looks down on the girls, deeming them \\"hippies\\". Meanwhile, Susan introduces The Kelly Affair to a flamboyant and well-connected rock producer named Ronnie \\"Z-Man\\" Barzell (John LaZar), who urges the girls to give an impromptu performance at one of his outrageous parties. The number goes over so well that Z-Man takes the band under his wing, changing their name to The Carrie Nations, much to the chagrin of Harris. Harris is even further demeaned when Kelly gets involved with a gigolo named Lance Rocke (Michael Blodgett), who knows about her inheritance and wants her to claim as much of it as possible so that he can bleed her financially. Harris has a fling with porn star Ashley St. Ives (Edy Williams). Casey, who clearly mistrusts men, is pursued by lesbian clothes designer Roxanne (Erica Gavin). Meanwhile, Petronella has a very sweet, proper romance with law student Emerson Thorne (Harrison Page).The Carrie Nations take off as rock stars, but their personal lives begin to unravel.

Answer:","output":"In the movie Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, there are several romantic relationships and entanglements among the characters. The main romantic storylines involve: 1. Kelly McNamara (Dolly Read) and Harris Allsworth (David Gurian): Kelly and Harris are in a relationship at the beginning of the movie, with Harris also acting as the band's manager. However, their relationship becomes strained as they move to Hollywood, with Kelly eventually getting involved with a gigolo named Lance Rocke (Michael Blodgett). 2. Kelly McNamara (Dolly Read) and Lance Rocke (Michael Blodgett): Kelly becomes involved with Lance, who is aware of her potential inheritance and aims to use her for financial gain. This puts additional strain on her relationship with Harris, who disapproves of Lance. 3. Petronella \\"Pet\\" Danforth (Marcia McBroom) and Emerson Thorne (Harrison Page): Pet has a more traditional and sweet romance with law student Emerson Thorne. Their relationship appears to be less complicated and more genuine compared to the other romantic entanglements in the film. 4. Casey Anderson (Cynthia Myers) and Roxanne (Erica Gavin): Casey, who is wary of men, is pursued by lesbian clothes designer Roxanne. This storyline explores a same-sex relationship within the context of the 1970s film industry and represents a different facet of the romantic connections in the movie. 5. Harris Allsworth (David Gurian) and Ashley St. Ives (Edy Williams): After being demeaned by the changes in the band's management and Kelly's involvement with Lance, Harris has a fling with adult film actress Ashley St. Ives. While there are several romantic relationships throughout the film, not all of them are central to the main plot. The primary focus remains on the three young women in the rock trio and their navigation of the complexities of Hollywood culture, fame, and personal relationships, as well as their quest for success and financial stability. As you consider investing in this film proposal, it may be helpful to weigh the appeal of the various storylines, characters, and romantic relationships, along with the overall tone and genre of the film in the context of today's audiences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Such special dialects, or jargon, are necessary in technical discussion of any kind. Being universally understood by the devotees of the particular science or art, they have the precision of a mathematical formula . Besides, they save time, for it is much more economical to name a process than to describe it. Thousands of these technical terms are very properly included in every large dictionary, yet, as a whole,  _  Different professions, however, differ widely in the character of their special vocabularies. In trades and handicrafts and other professions, such as farming and fishing, that have occupied great numbers of men from remote times, the technical vocabulary is very old. It consists largely of native words, or of borrowed words that have worked themselves into the very fiber of our language, hence, though highly technical in many particulars, these vocabularies are more familiar in sound, and more generally understood than most other technicalities. The special dialects of law, medicine, and philosophy have also become pretty familiar to cultivated person, and have contributed much to the popular vocabulary. Yet, every profession still possesses a large body of technical terms that remain essentially foreign, even to educated speech. And the proportion has been much increased in the last fifty years, particularly in the various departments of natural and political sciences and in the mechanic arts. So new terms are coined with the greatest freedom, and abandoned with indifference when they have served their turn.

Question: suppose less carbon atoms rearrange into a new substance happens, how will it affect less of the new substance will be formed.

In this process, plants and animals that died long ago are buried under layers of soil. Over time, pressure builds up and causes the remains to liquefy. The carbon atoms in these remains then rearrange to become a new substance. If fewer carbon atoms rearrange into the new substance, it implies that less of the new substance will be formed. The supposed perturbation (i.e., fewer carbon atoms rearranging) will have a less effect on the second mentioned effect (less of the new substance being formed). This is because when fewer carbon atoms rearrange, less of the new substance can be produced. In other words, the amount of the new substance formed is directly proportional to the number of carbon atoms that rearrange.

Why did only 53.95 percent of eligible Americans cast ballots in the Presidential election last November? Why, since the modern high of 62.8 percent in the Nixon-Kennedy contest of 1960, has voter turnout dropped in every succeeding Presidential election? Why, as a consequence, does the United States rank last among 15 democracies - those in which voting is not compulsory - in mean voter turnout in elections since 1945? Many theories have been advanced but few answers given. And such questions have to be asked with special force in view of these recent events: In the first round of the French presidential election, with 10 candidates competing, turnout reached 81.09 percent of the total of registered voters - admittedly a smaller group than ''those eligible to vote.'' In the runoff round between President Valery Giscard d'Estaing and his opponent, Francois Mitterrand, 85.87 percent of those registered cast ballots. This figure was almost as high as the record 87.34 percent turnout in the second round of the 1974 French presidential election. But actually, the lowest voting percentage the Fifth Republic has ever recorded was 68.86 percent in l969 - an enormous turnout, by American standards. Nearer home this month, San Diego, Calif. - the eighth largest city in the nation - rejected a proposed 224 million bond issue to build a downtown convention center. The turnout of 6l.7 percent of registered voters, twice as large as in any previous San Diego special election, was startling. But it isn't just the turnout figures that make these elections notable; it's also the circumstances under which they were recorded. In France, as usual, both rounds of voting took place on Sundays. In San Diego, the ballots were cast by mail. In both, please note, voting was made easier than in American Presidential elections. In San Diego, ballots were mailed to registered voters on April 22, together with a postage-paid return envelope. The watermarked and numbered ballots had to be returned by midnight, May 5. To prevent fraud, voters signed the envelope and each signature was compared with voter registration records; but to preserve privacy, the ballots were then removed from the envelopes before being counted as secret ballots. The count was made by computer in two hours, and the city estimates that it saved half the half-million-dollar cost of a conventional election at the polls. As a consequence, mail-order elections are likely to become more numerous, in San Diego and elsewhere, and as City Clerk Charles Abdelnour said: ''The next step is to vote at home over a communications hookup .... If we can pick up the phone and vote, then we have arrived.'' No doubt ubiquitous Ma Bell is already at the drawing board. But even pending electronic referendums, the point seems clear that making it easier for voters to vote is likely to mean that more of them will. No one will claim that this is a comprehensive solution to the turnout problem. But why not take the modest steps available? Representative Mario Biaggi of New York has already proposed a bill to shift all general elections to Sundays during a six-year trial period from 1982 to 1988, which would cover the next two Presidential and four Congressional elections. Records of turnout and voting patterns could then be studied to determine whether to make the change permanent. Former Presidents Nixon, Ford and Carter have all lent some measure of support to this idea, although Mr. Nixon raised the question of possible religious objection. That does not, however, seem to be a problem in the numerous nations that already vote on Sunday. Judging from the San Diego experience, Mr. Biaggi or someone might well go a step further and propose that, during the same six years, the Federal Government foot the postage bill for any state that wanted to make mail balloting available to its registered voters for, say, two weeks before any general election. Conventional polling places could be provided as usual, offering the widest possible opportunity to vote. Mr. Biaggi's bill attempts to deal also with the possibility that network victory projections cause late potential voters to stay home in the Western states. He would have the polls open everywhere for the same nine hours, all closing simultaneously. But such poll hours would greatly inconvenience many voters, which appears to be the wrong thing to do if turnout is a concern. Far better would be the proposal advanced in this column last Nov. 9 for a uniform 24-hour national voting period on a weekend, with all polls closing at the equivalent of 8 P.M. Eastern standard time or any other agreed-upon hour. That would have polls in California open from, say, 5 P.M. Saturday to 5 P.M. Sunday, the equivalent of 8 P.M. Saturday to 8 P.M. Sunday in the East - both easing things everywhere for voters with odd working hours and eliminating the projection problem, if there is one. What was this article about?","output":"This article is about the low voter turnout in the United States and how making voting easier might increase the number of people who vote. It compares the voter turnout in the US with other democracies and explores ways to improve the situation, such as holding elections on Sundays, allowing mail-in voting, and having a uniform 24-hour national voting period.

Ripper (Sterling Hayden) is commander of Burpelson Air Force Base, which houses the Strategic Air Command 843rd Bomb Wing, equipped with B-52 bombers and nuclear bombs. The 843rd is currently in-flight on airborne alert, two hours from their targets inside Russia.     General Ripper explains to Group Captain Mandrake how he first discovered the Communist plot to pollute Americans' \\"precious bodily fluids.\\" General Ripper orders his executive officer, Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) of the UK Royal Air Force, to put the base on alert. Ripper also issues \\"Wing Attack Plan R\\" to the patrolling aircraft, one of which is commanded by Major T. J. \\"King\\" Kong (Slim Pickens). All of the aircraft commence an attack flight on Russia and set their radios to allow communications only through the CRM 114 discriminator, which is programmed to accept only communications preceded by a secret three-letter code known only to General Ripper. Mandrake discovers that no war order has been issued by the Pentagon and tries to stop Ripper, who locks them both in his office. Ripper tells Mandrake that he believes the Soviets have been using fluoridation of United States water supplies to pollute the \\"precious bodily fluids\\" of Americans; Mandrake now realizes that Ripper is insane. At the Pentagon, General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) briefs President Merkin Muffley (also Peter Sellers) and other officers and aides about the attack in the \\"War Room\\". President Muffley is shocked to learn that such orders could be given without his authorization, but Turgidson reminds him that Plan R, enabling a senior officer to launch a strike against the Soviets if all superiors have been killed in a first strike on Washington, DC, allows such an action.

How do the Subaru Legacy GT and the Super GT differ? What are some stigmas associated with GT classes? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"To answer your questions, I will perform the following steps: 1. Research the differences between Subaru Legacy GT and Super GT. 2. Identify common stigmas associated with GT classes. 3. Analyze if the two questions you asked are paraphrases of each other. Step 1: Research the differences between Subaru Legacy GT and Super GT The Subaru Legacy GT is a specific model of the Subaru Legacy, which is a midsize car produced by the Japanese automobile manufacturer Subaru. The Legacy GT is a sporty version with a turbocharged engine and upgraded suspension, making it more performance-oriented than the standard Legacy. The Super GT, on the other hand, is not a specific car model but rather a racing championship series in Japan. It features a range of vehicles from various manufacturers, including Subaru, which are modified to compete in this top-level racing series. The cars in Super GT are typically more powerful and significantly modified for racing purposes compared to their road-going counterparts. Step 2: Identify common stigmas associated with GT classes Here are some common stigmas associated with GT classes: 1. Expensive: Many people believe that GT class cars are always costly because they feature high-performance engines, upgraded suspension, and other performance-related enhancements. 2. Unpractical for daily use: GT class cars are often viewed as impractical for everyday driving due to their performance-oriented nature. They may have stiffer suspensions, which can make them less comfortable on regular roads. 3. Fuel efficiency: GT class cars may be perceived as fuel guzzlers because they typically have powerful engines built for performance, which could lead to increased fuel consumption. 4. Exclusivity: Some people see GT class cars as exclusive or elitist, as they are often priced beyond the reach of many consumers and associated with prestige or luxury. Step 3: Analyze if the two questions you asked are paraphrases of each other The two questions are: 1. How do the Subaru Legacy GT and Super GT differ? 2. What are some stigmas associated with GT classes? After analyzing these questions, I can see that they are not paraphrases of each other. The first question seeks to find the differences between a specific Subaru model and a racing series, while the second question explores the common stigmas associated with GT classes of cars in general. These questions address different aspects of GT classes and are not rephrased versions of the same question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It is also mentioned that the first Freefall experience was developed by Intamin. The primary focus of this sentence is on Giovanola's marketing activities, with Intamin's role mentioned as additional information related to the Freefall experience. **(2) Intamin also marketed the first freefall-experience (developed by Giovanola) and the first drop tower.** In this sentence, the roles of Giovanola and Intamin are reversed compared to the first sentence.

Review: The first time I played this I wasn't all that crazy about it, butafter the second time I listened to it, I started to notice that Iwas suddenly hearing the keyboard quality that I had so loved byTony when doing Genesis albums. Perhaps not for all Genesis fans,but anyone who likes beautiful melodies and, on this album, sweet vocals(even though Tony only sings on one song...)Of all of Tony Banks' solo works, I'd say this album is absolutelyhis best (I know some of you will disagree and say 'A Curious Feeling'is his best)... but I stand by this one. Answer:","output":"Based on the review provided by the customer, they initially did not seem to be satisfied with the product after their first experience. However, after giving it a second chance and paying closer attention to the details, their perspective changed. They began to appreciate the keyboard quality that reminded them of the music they loved from Tony and Genesis albums.  The customer does acknowledge that the album might not be for all Genesis fans, but they do appreciate the beautiful melodies and sweet vocals present in the album. Furthermore, they make a bold statement by considering this album as the best one among all of Tony Banks' solo works, although they admit that some people might have a different opinion. In conclusion, the customer appears to be satisfied with the product after giving it a second chance. Though they were initially uncertain about it, they eventually discovered aspects of the album that they truly appreciated. Their satisfaction is evident from the fact that they regard it as their favorite among all of Tony Banks' solo works."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Between 1900 and 1915 additional tracks were built for local traffic with the existing tracks being reserved for through trains .","output":"To determine if these two sentences mean the same, let's break them down step-by-step and analyze the content and structure. 1. Identify the time frame: Both sentences refer to the same time period, \\"Between 1900 and 1915\\". 2. Identify the action: Both sentences describe \\"additional tracks\\" being built. 3. Identify the purpose of the action: Both sentences indicate that the additional tracks were built \\"for local traffic\\". 4. Identify the status of existing tracks: Both sentences mention that the \\"existing tracks\\" were affected by this change. 5. Identify the reservation policy for existing tracks: Both sentences state that the existing tracks were \\"reserved\\". However, the first sentence uses the term \\"transit trains\\" while the second uses \\"through trains\\". Mainly, the difference lies in the terminology used for the type of trains the existing tracks would be reserved for. To determine if they mean the same, we need to understand whether \\"transit trains\\" and \\"through trains\\" can be used interchangeably.  \\"Transit trains\\" usually refer to trains that pass through an area without stopping or with limited stops, while \\"through trains\\" are trains that do not require passengers to transfer to another train to continue their journey.  Given that \\"through trains\\" and \\"transit trains\\" have similar meanings in that they both generally pass through an area without making many stops, it can be inferred that the two sentences essentially mean the same. The difference in wording is likely due to variation in usage and context."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer. You are given a question.

Pakistan's eunuch community campaigns for proper recognition. In Pakistan the term covers transsexuals, transvestites, hermaphrodites. Shazia, a hermaphrodite, tells how her penis was removed at 17. She says she feels she is a woman, but her identity card calls her male. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Pakistan's Eunuch Community Fights for Proper Recognition and Identity Introduction: Pakistan's eunuch community is striving for proper recognition and legal protection, as members are often marginalized and face severe discrimination in the socio-economic spheres. The term eunuch encompasses a variety of individuals, including transsexuals, transvestites, and hermaphrodites. In a recent interview with Shazia, a hermaphrodite, she shares her experiences and struggle for proper recognition in Pakistan's society. Shazia's Story: Shazia, a hermaphrodite and member of Pakistan's eunuch community, shares her harrowing journey towards self-acceptance and validation in the face of societal discrimination. At the age of 17, she underwent a life-altering procedure during which her penis was removed. Shazia always identified as a woman, but the identity card issued by the Pakistani Government recognizes her as a male. This discrepancy in official identification has led to numerous problems and is a constant source of emotional turmoil for her. The Plight of the Eunuch Community: Members of the eunuch community in Pakistan face a variety of challenges due to the lack of proper legal recognition and social acceptance. These issues persist due to a general lack of knowledge and awareness surrounding their unique identities. As a result, they often experience prejudice and discrimination, leading to limited access to healthcare, education, and employment opportunities. Furthermore, the absence of proper identification documents makes it incredibly difficult for the eunuch community to access essential services, further exacerbating their marginalized status.  Campaign for Recognition and Rights: Pakistan's eunuch community is fighting for their rights and the proper acknowledgment of their unique identities. This campaign aims to educate the general public about the diverse nature of the community, dispelling myths and misconceptions that have led to discrimination. It also aspires to advocate for policy changes so that members of the eunuch community can receive proper identification documents that reflect their accurate gender identity. Conclusion: The fight for recognition and rights by Pakistan's eunuch community demonstrates the need for a more inclusive and compassionate society. As individuals like Shazia share their stories, it becomes apparent that ignorance and prejudice are the root causes of marginalization and oppression. The campaign for proper recognition must continue so that members of the eunuch community can live their lives with dignity and access the same rights and opportunities as their fellow citizens. It is crucial that awareness is raised, biases are dismantled, and policy changes are made to support these marginalized individuals in their journey towards acceptance and equality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

His glamorous life takes an unexpected turn when he is approached by former President Richard Nixon. Nixon, hoping to rebuild his image and cement his legacy, wants Swifty to find the perfect ghostwriter for his memoirs. Swifty, sensing the potential for a hit, takes on the project but soon realizes that he has unwittingly become entangled in a web of political intrigue and dark secrets. Act 1: The movie begins with a montage of Swifty's glamorous life, showing him attending parties with Hollywood celebrities and closing big deals for his clients. One day, he receives a mysterious phone call from Nixon, who arranges a secret meeting. During their meeting, Nixon asks Swifty to find a ghostwriter to write his memoirs and insists on the utmost confidentiality. Intrigued and sensing an opportunity to score his biggest deal yet, Swifty agrees. Act 2: Swifty starts researching potential ghostwriters and finds a young, ambitious journalist named Karen Mitchell. Impressed by her work, Swifty approaches Karen and offers her the job. Karen, who is hesitant at first, eventually agrees only after Swifty promises to help her land her dream job at a prestigious newspaper. As they work together, Karen starts uncovering dark secrets and shocking revelations about Nixon's time in office, including a previously unknown scandal that could change history. Despite the risks, she becomes determined to include the truth in the memoirs. Act 3: Swifty, realizing that the memoirs could destroy not only Nixon's reputation but also his own career, attempts to persuade Karen to keep the bombshell revelations hidden. However, Karen is adamant about exposing the truth. Swifty is faced with a moral dilemma: support Karen in her quest for the truth or protect his career and the reputation of his powerful client. Meanwhile, Nixon's team, who have discovered Karen's findings, start applying pressure on Swifty and threatening his career and personal life. Act 4: In a climactic confrontation, Swifty finally decides to stand by Karen, defying Nixon and his team. The memoir is published, revealing the scandal and confirming Nixon's role in it. The fallout is explosive, further tarnishing Nixon's legacy and leaving his reputation in tatters. Swifty's career also takes a hit as some of his clients distance themselves from him. Epilogue: Despite losing some of his prestige, Swifty continues working in the industry, committed to doing things the right way. Karen, thanks to Swifty's connections, lands her dream job at a prestigious newspaper and continues to break important stories.

Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, onaverage, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).","output":"The Rose farm, which produced organic milk, had milk production that potentially reduced leaching of phosphates."},{"instruction":"\`\`Oh, my poor Folly...

The protocol is aimed at enabling the free movement of goods within the region, reducing trade barriers, and enhancing regional trade. The EAC member states, including Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Uganda, and Tanzania, have been working towards the creation of a common market through the implementation of the Customs Union. The Customs Union Protocol will establish a common external tariff, which will be applied to goods imported from outside the EAC region. This will promote trade within the region and create a level playing field for all member states. The EAC has already made significant progress towards economic integration, with the establishment of a common market and the signing of the Protocol on the Establishment of the East African Community Customs Union in 2004. However, there have been some challenges in implementing the Customs Union, including the need to harmonize various national laws and regulations. The signing of the Customs Union Protocol is expected to encourage further integration and cooperation among member states, leading to increased regional trade and economic growth. It will also pave the way for the implementation of other initiatives, such as the East African Monetary Union and the East African Political Federation. The EAC Summit is expected to be attended by a high-level delegation of government officials, business leaders, and other stakeholders. The event will provide an opportunity for member states to showcase their products and services, as well as to discuss strategies for boosting regional trade and investment. In conclusion, the signing of the Customs Union Protocol in Tanzania is a significant step towards achieving regional economic integration and promoting regional trade. The EAC member states are urged to work towards the implementation of the protocol in order to unlock the full potential of regional economic cooperation."},{"instruction":"Given Justin Smith (born 9 August 1977 in Narromine, New South Wales) is an Australian former rugby league footballer.

During the Enlightenment, some societies created or retained links to universities. However, contemporary sources distinguished universities from scientific societies by claiming that the university's utility was in the transmission of knowledge, while societies functioned to create knowledge. As the role of universities in institutionalized science began to diminish, learned societies became the cornerstone of organized science. Official scientific societies were chartered by the state in order to provide technical expertise. Most societies were granted permission to oversee their own publications, control the election of new members, and the administration of the society. After 1700, a tremendous number of official academies and societies were founded in Europe, and by 1789 there were over seventy official scientific societies. In reference to this growth, Bernard de Fontenelle coined the term the Age of Academies to describe the 18th century.","output":"By 1789, there were over seventy official scientific societies, so the year 1700 had less scientific societies."},{"instruction":"ere's a question and a few possible answers: Q: Where is the mailbox that the residents use?

However, in recent times, the trade balance between both nations has been in favor of China, as Egypt's exports do not match up to its imports from China. To balance this trade deficit, the two countries have decided to look into ways to improve their trade relations. In 2018, the China-Egypt Business Council was established, which is a platform for businesses from both countries to discuss trade and investment opportunities. In addition, the two countries have signed several agreements to increase their bilateral trade. One such agreement is the Belt and Road Initiative, which seeks to connect China with countries in Asia, Europe, and Africa through trade and infrastructure projects. Egypt, being a crucial geographical location for this initiative, has signed up to be a partner in the project. Furthermore, China has also been investing in various sectors in Egypt, such as the construction of the Central Business District in the new administrative capital, as well as the establishment of an industrial zone close to the Suez Canal. These investments will not only create job opportunities for Egyptians but also increase the country's exports to China. On the other hand, Egypt has been exporting more goods to China in the past year, particularly agricultural products such as cherries and oranges. This is a significant improvement, as China is a massive market for agricultural products and could be an area where Egypt could increase its exports. In summary, the trade relationship between China and Egypt has been evolving over the years, and both countries are exploring ways to balance their trade deficit. With the establishment of the China-Egypt Business Council and the Belt and Road Initiative, as well as various investments in Egypt's infrastructure, it is expected that trade between both countries will continue to grow and become more balanced in the future."},{"instruction":"They phoned hoping to place her in the management team.

In the dish marked Cell Y, Gary sees substances coming together and moving into close proximity to one another. Is cell X using more or less ATP than cell Y? Hint: Active transport occurs when a substance passes through the cell membrane with the help of extra energy. This happens when a substance moves from an area where it is less concentrated to an area where it is more concentrated. This is the opposite of diffusion. The substance moves up, instead of down, the concentration gradient. Like rolling a ball uphill, this requires an input of energy. The energy comes from the molecule named ATP (adenosine triphosphate). The energy allows special transport proteins called pumps to move substances to areas of higher concentration. An example is the sodiumpotassium pump.","output":"Cell X is using less ATP than cell Y, as substances are spreading apart from each other, indicating passive transport, which does not require energy input from ATP."},{"instruction":"Joyce Summers The premise of the series is that Buffy is the latest Slayer, a young woman endowed by mystical forces with superhuman powers to fight and defeat vampires, demons, and other evil forces in the fictional town of Sunnydale.

These historians were generally unsympathetic to John's behaviour under Richard's rule, but slightly more positive towards the very earliest years of John's reign. Reliable accounts of the middle and later parts of John's reign are more limited, with Gervase of Canterbury and Ralph of Coggeshall writing the main accounts; neither of them were positive about John's performance as king. Much of John's later, negative reputation was established by two chroniclers writing after the king's death, Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris, the latter claiming that John attempted conversion to Islam in exchange for military aid from the Almohad ruler Muhammad alNasir a story which is considered to be untrue by modern historians.

The plebeians seceded to the Janiculum hill. To end the secession, a dictator was appointed. The dictator passed a law (the Lex Hortensia), which ended the requirement that the patrician senators must agree before any bill could be considered by the Plebeian Council. This was not the first law to require that an act of the Plebeian Council have the full force of law. The Plebeian Council acquired this power during a modification to the original Valerian law in 449 BC.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage As an electromagnetic wave travels through the different parts of the antenna system (radio, feed line, antenna, free space) it may encounter differences in impedance (E/H, V/I, etc.). At each interface, depending on the impedance match, some fraction of the wave's energy will reflect back to the source, forming a standing wave in the feed line. The ratio of maximum power to minimum power in the wave can be measured and is called the standing wave ratio (SWR). A SWR of 1:1 is ideal. A SWR of 1.5:1 is considered to be marginally acceptable in low power applications where power loss is more critical, although an SWR as high as 6:1 may still be usable with the right equipment.

Familiar examples include pumping of the water in a swimming pool to homogenize the water temperature, and the stirring of pancake batter to eliminate lumps (deagglomeration). Mixing is performed to allow heat and/or mass transfer to occur between one or more streams, components or phases. Modern industrial processing almost always involves some form of mixing. Some classes of chemical reactors are also mixers. With the right equipment, it is possible to mix a solid, liquid or gas into another solid, liquid or gas. A biofuel fermenter may require the mixing of microbes, gases and liquid medium for optimal yield; organic nitration requires concentrated (liquid) nitric and sulfuric acids to be mixed with a hydrophobic organic phase; production of pharmaceutical tablets requires blending of solid powders.

But despite great actors and bestselling source material, it definitely doesn’t: The film “seemed so promising given its pedigree,” which includes Anne Hathaway, Jim Sturgess, and director Lone Scherfig, writes Betsy Sharkey in the Los Angeles Times. “But as so often happens with love, what you hope for is not even close to what you get, and in this case we are left with a heartbreaking disappointment of a film.” It’s “an appallingly bad movie made by talented people who could and should have done much better, but somehow all drove off the cliff together,” agrees Andrew O’Hehir in Salon. One Day is “tearjerking twaddle” that’s “nearly as bad as Anne Hathaway's British accent, which is heading for infamy,” writes Peter Travers in Rolling Stone.

Betsy Sharkey, writing for the Los Angeles Times, explained that the film had an excellent cast and solid source material, yet it failed to resonate with viewers. She lamented that the experience felt “like a heartbreaking disappointment of a film.” Meanwhile, Andrew O’Hehir of Salon described One Day as “an appallingly bad movie made by talented people who could and should have done much better, but somehow all drove off the cliff together.” One of the major criticisms of the film was Hathaway's British accent, which was described as \\"nearly as bad\\" as the overall production. In fact, Peter Travers writing for Rolling Stone suggested that the actor’s accent could become “infamous.” However, not all of the reviews were entirely negative. In the New York Times, AO Scott acknowledged that One Day transformed an “episodic story into an anthology of feelings and associations, many familiar, a few surprising, some embarrassing and one or two worth holding onto.” Despite the difference of opinions, it is clear that One Day fell far short of expectations, leaving moviegoers feeling disappointed with the final result."},{"instruction":"5440 is a Canadian alternative rock group from Vancouver, British Columbia, who take their name from the slogan FiftyFour Forty or Fight!, coined to express the unsuccessful expansionist agenda of James K.
