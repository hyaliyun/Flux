Parents die, leaving kids devastated and unable to speak for days. Parents get deported, leaving kids despondent and hopeless. Children endure emotional, sexual, physical abuse. And more. The saddest story I ever heard was from the kid in my AP Lit class who had taken her senior year to accept invitations from education reform groups to speak around the country, which she did, without doing any of her homework. She waited until after grades were turned in at the end of the year to contest the “D” on her report card because it meant not going to UC Berkeley. She brought her mother with her, and her two sisters. After going around and around for a while with me and the principal, her mother said that her divorce had really affected this girl, and she had been fighting so hard all her life to get into Berkeley, and what did I have against her daughter? She deserved to go to Cal! They were all in tears. The principal found a way to change her 64% to a 70.01%, and off she went. This young woman full of potential and energy, learned from her mother and my boss, that excuses rule the day. She appears to think that “social justice” means fighting to get your way because the deck is stacked against you, instead of doing the right thing. This is sad. I know this isn’t what you were after, and that this memory says more about me than it does about her. Many other kids I have counseled, who are getting through something life-changing, seem to understand that life is in session, there will always be challenges to rise above, and that focusing in the classroom is a great way to get one’s mind off one’s troubles, if the environment is supportive and the spirit is willing.

His father, Orville Willis Forte III, is a financial broker, and his mother, Patricia C. (nee Stivers), is an artist and former schoolteacher. He was raised in Moraga, before moving to Lafayette. He went by Billy in his early years until he was teased at school for it also being a girl's name, at which point he decided he would from there on be known as Will. Context: He began taking classes at the Groundlings in Los Angeles, an improvisational and sketch comedy troupe and school, while tutoring children to make ends meet. Forte's first successful foray into comedy was 101 Things to Definitely Not Do If You Want to Get a Chick, a comic book he produced that details incompetent men. The comics landed him his first professional job writing for The Jenny McCarthy Show, a short-lived variety show starring Jenny McCarthy. Shortly thereafter, he was asked to submit a packet to the Late Show with David Letterman and was told Letterman responded favorably to animation. After only nine months at Letterman, he was \\"let go\\" from the job. He recalled his stint on the program as unpleasant, noting that he did not have enough experience in writing. \\"What an honor to work at that show but I don't think I was fully mentally prepared. [...] I always wonder what it would be like if I'd had a couple more years of experience before going there.\\" Forte returned to Los Angeles and began performing with the Groundlings' Main Company, with Cheryl Hines, Jim Rash and Maya Rudolph. He tried stand-up comedy three times, mostly at open mic nights, but quit after being voted into the Main Company. He joined the writing teams of two failed sitcoms, including The Army Show and Action. Forte got jobs writing for 3rd Rock from the Sun and That '70s Show, two successful programs. He loved writing but had mostly given up on acting, aside from acting with the Groundlings. While performing with the troupe in 2001, he was spotted by Lorne Michaels, the creator of Saturday Night Live (SNL). Forte felt his confidence was higher than usual, as That '70s Show had been picked up for two more years. He was invited to audition for SNL, which he regarded as unexpected. At his audition for SNL, he performed multiple original characters, including Tim Calhoun, a speed reader, a prison guard, in addition to impressions of singer Michael McDonald and actor Martin Sheen. His final character was an older piece from his days with the Groundlings, in which he portrays a gold-painted street performer who performs fellatio to pay for his face paint, which devolves into a song needlessly uttering the words \\"cock\\" and \\"face paint\\" dozens of times. He felt his time to shine as a performer was already over, as he was in his thirties when he auditioned. To his surprise, he was offered a chance to be on the show, but declined, opting instead for the financial stability of his work at That '70s Show. He felt working for SNL could not live up to the idealized version he had dreamed of, but he later realized he would be making a mistake. Question: what did he do next? Answer:","output":"After realizing that he would be making a mistake by not accepting the offer to join Saturday Night Live (SNL), Will Forte decided to take a leap of faith and join the iconic show. He left his stable job at That '70s Show and became a cast member on SNL. This marked an important turning point in his career as it allowed him to showcase his acting and comedic talents on a national platform. During his tenure on SNL from 2002 to 2010, Forte became known for his unique characters and impressions. He created memorable sketches such as the popular \\"MacGruber,\\" a parody of the action-adventure television series \\"MacGyver,\\" which eventually turned into a full-length feature film in 2010. He also mastered impressions of various celebrities and political figures like George W. Bush and John Edwards, further setting himself apart as a versatile comedic actor. Being part of SNL also opened up more opportunities for Forte in television and film. He started making guest appearances on popular TV shows such as How I Met Your Mother, 30 Rock, Parks and Recreation, and several others. Furthermore, he expanded his career in the film industry by landing roles in movies like Baby Mama, Beerfest, and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. Forte's decision to join SNL, despite initial doubts, proved to be a stepping stone to a successful acting career in the entertainment industry. It allowed him to demonstrate his comedy and acting prowess and put him on the path to becoming the accomplished writer, actor, and comedian that he is today."},{"instruction":"Q:Q: Tar sands are rocky materials mixed with what?

Movie title: The Matrix Reloaded Movie plot: Six months after the events of the first film, Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) are now a couple. Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) receives a message from Captain Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith) of the Logos calling an emergency meeting of all of Zion's ships. Zion has confirmed the last transmission of the Osiris: an army of Sentinels is tunneling towards Zion and will reach it within 72 hours. Commander Lock (Harry Lennix) orders all ships to return to Zion to prepare for the onslaught, but Morpheus asks one ship to remain in order to contact the Oracle (Gloria Foster). The Caduceus receives a message from the Oracle, and the Nebuchadnezzar ventures out so Neo can contact her. One of the Caduceus crew, Bane (Ian Bliss), encounters Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), who takes over Bane's avatar. Smith then uses this avatar to leave the Matrix, gaining control of Bane's real body. In Zion, Morpheus announces the news of the advancing machines to the people. Neo receives a message from the Oracle and returns to the Matrix to meet her bodyguard Seraph (Collin Chou), who then leads him to her. After realizing that the Oracle is part of the Matrix, Neo asks how he can trust her; she replies that it is his decision. The Oracle instructs Neo to reach the Source of the Matrix by finding the Keymaker (Randall Duk Kim), a prisoner of the Merovingian (Lambert Wilson). As the Oracle departs, Smith appears, telling Neo that after being defeated, he refused to be deleted, and is now a rogue program. He demonstrates his ability to clone himself using other inhabitants of the Matrix, including other Agents, as hosts. He then tries to absorb Neo as a host, but fails, prompting a battle between Smith's clones and Neo. Neo manages to defend himself, but is forced to retreat from the increasingly overwhelming numbers.

Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"The Matrix Reloaded,\\" the Oracle's bodyguard is a character named Seraph, portrayed by actor Collin Chou. Seraph is a skilled martial artist and serves as a protector for the Oracle. He is often referred to as the \\"guardian of the Oracle\\" and is shown to be highly skilled in hand-to-hand combat. When Neo first encounters Seraph, he is initially tested by him through a fight in order to prove his status as the One. Seraph's purpose in the movie is to ensure that the Oracle remains safe from any harm, as she is a crucial part of the overall Matrix system. The Oracle is an intuitive program designed to analyze the human psyche and predict the choices that individuals will make. She has a significant role in the events of both \\"The Matrix\\" and \\"The Matrix Reloaded,\\" as she provides guidance and crucial information to the main characters, particularly Neo. In deciding whether or not to invest in this film proposal, it is essential to consider factors such as the popularity of the original film, the cast and crew involved in the sequel, and the potential for the film's success based on its plot and characters, including the Oracle and Seraph. \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" is the second installment in a highly acclaimed and successful franchise, which makes it worth considering as a potential investment.

Fragments of Freedom (2000) 4. Charango (2002) 5. The Antidote (2005) 6. Dive Deep (2008) 7. Blood Like Lemonade (2010) 8. Head Up High (2013) 9. Blaze Away (2018) 10. Blackest Blue (2021) Morcheeba has released a total of 10 studio albums throughout their career. A comprehensive analysis of both band's studio discographies indicates that Zebrahead has released more studio albums than Morcheeba, with a count of 14 versus Morcheeba's 10. It is important to note that this difference is partially influenced by Zebrahead's inclusion of a demo album, an EP, a cover album, and an album with re-recorded material; however, even without these, the band would still lead by one album. In conclusion, Zebrahead has released more studio albums than Morcheeba."},{"instruction":"Americans think a great deal about time. From childhood they learn to value time.

The second child needs to be strapped down in his high chair due to his apparently violent nature, and is compared negatively to the other child.The present. Six youngsters are on their way to a highly anticipated football game. Carly Jones (Elisha Cuthbert) is an ambitious young woman who is planning to move to New York. Her boyfriend Wade (Jared Padalecki) is a small-town boy who is hesitant about moving to the big city. They are joined on their trip by Carly's friend Paige Edwards (Paris Hilton) who may be pregnant with her boyfriend Blake's (Robert Ri'chard) child, although she hasn't told him yet.

It is a distinction without a difference. City Attorney Feldman apparently didn’t bother to check a dictionary (any dictionary will do) which describes “sermons” as “religious discourse or speech.” Pastors are therefore still required to turn over to the city their sermons. Feldman is fooling no one. “Mr. Jarrett… did you bring your toothbrush?” Those were the words of the Honorable Ira Brown as the imperious “law and motion” judge stared down at me from his bench. I was shaking in my discount loafers. You see, I was being taken to task for issuing a subpoena for documents which I likely had no right to have. That’s when I started groveling. “Upon reflection, Your Honor, I realize now that I have overstepped my authority and would like to withdraw my subpoena duces tecum. With Your Honor’s permission, of course… uh, respectfully, sir.” My voice was cracking, and opposing counsel was quietly cracking up with laughter. It was 1980 and I was fresh out of law school. I didn’t know any better. But my humiliation was a lesson well learned. Do not, under any circumstances, exceed the bounds of your power as an attorney to issue subpoenas. After a painful scolding on the responsibilities of a lawyer, Judge Brown allowed me to crawl out of his San Francisco courtroom without holding me in contempt of court and tossing me in the hoosegow overnight. If the late Judge Brown were presiding over the current litigation involving Houston’s new non-discrimination ordinance (Woodfill v. Parker), the city attorney would be well advised to bring his toothbrush. And a lot of toothpaste. In my view, he has blatantly abused his power and discretion. How? By issuing subpoenas to a group of pastors demanding they cough up the contents of their sermons. On subjects like gender identity, homosexuality or Houston’s openly lesbian mayor. But here’s the problem: whatever was preached from a pulpit has nothing whatsoever to do with a lawsuit challenging the city’s decision to invalidate a referendum petition. The sermons are not even tangential to whether signatures are valid. To argue otherwise is inane. Let’s begin with the basics. Lawyers have the power, granted by court process, to issue subpoenas involving civil cases in which they represent one or more of the parties. They do not have to go running to a judge or court clerk every time they want to force someone to turn over documents and appear for deposition or in court. However, there is an important caveat. The subpoena may only seek information that is reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. In other words, you can’t just demand anything and everything. The information you seek has to be directly relevant to the case. Something that would lead to acceptable evidence at trial. So-called “fishing expeditions” are strictly prohibited. The case which gives the Houston lawyers subpoena power is a lawsuit that, put simply, claims Houston’s mayor and city attorney were wrong in declaring petition signatures invalid. So the question before the court is whether the petitioners met the terms, conditions and requirements under the city charter. All the political posturing and war of words from pulpits to street corners is utterly irrelevant. It would never be admissible as evidence in court. If some pastors have voiced an opinion on the city’s new law which the referendum seeks to overturn, so what? Their words are legally unrelated and immaterial to the case. Moreover, their speech is protected by the First Amendment. Thus, when the city attorney started demanding the content of sermons he overstepped the bounds of his authority. Some of these pastors are not even parties to the litigation. This is a serious abuse of power. When a lawyer abuses the court’s process by the misuse of subpoenas, the punishment can be a finding of contempt of court. What then? It’s up to the judge. Usually it is a fine or the paying of the other side’s attorney’s fees. In extreme cases, a lawyer may find himself behind bars. I wonder what the city attorney and mayor are trying to do with their erroneous subpoenas. Silence critics? Intimidate or “chill” dissent? Deprive people of their free speech rights? That’s the stuff of bullies. But using the court process is against the law. Mayor Annise Parker now claims she knew nothing about the subpoena. The City Attorney, David Feldman, is blaming outside counsel for writing it. Really? Good luck with that one. We’ll see if the judge presiding over the case is buying any of this nonsense. One thing is certain: Feldman is lucky it’s not Judge Ira Brown up there on the bench peering down. Trust me, Mr. City Attorney, you’d be shaking in your loafers and packing a toothbrush.

They also are preyed on by many animals and even certain fungi. Some arthropod species spend part of their lives within ant nests, either preying on ants, their larvae, and eggs, consuming the food stores of the ants, or avoiding predators. These inquilines may bear a close resemblance to ants. The nature of this ant mimicry (myrmecomorphy) varies, with some cases involving Batesian mimicry, where the mimic reduces the risk of predation. Others show Wasmannian mimicry, a form of mimicry seen only in inquilines. I am facing a new situation today: Greg was studying behavior of different organisms. He noticed that some organisms were showing inquiline behavior. He noted that behavior as case A. Then he noticed some other organisms didn't show any inquiline behavior. He noted that behavior as case B. He was astonished by the complicated interactions among organisms. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Would case A see greater or smaller opportunity for food sources than case B? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation, I would answer the question as follows: Case A, which represents organisms showing inquiline behavior, would likely see greater opportunity for food sources than case B (organisms not showing inquiline behavior). Step 1: Identify the nature of inquiline behavior Inquiline organisms live within the ant nests and have access to the ants, their larvae, and eggs, as well as the ants' food stores. This behavior involves a high degree of interaction and adaptation, making these organisms specially equipped to exploit the resources available within ant colonies. Step 2: Analyze the food source opportunities Organisms with inquiline behavior (case A) have access to various food sources inside the ant colony, including ants, their larvae, and eggs, as well as the ants' stored food. This provides them a consistent and diverse array of nutritional resources. On the other hand, organisms that do not show inquiline behavior (case B) must rely on other sources of food available in their environment, which can be more scarce or less consistent. Step 3: Compare the two cases Comparing the food source opportunities, organisms with inquiline behavior (case A) have a broader and more consistent access to food sources, directly benefiting from living within the ant colony. Organisms without inquiline behavior (case B) may need to invest more energy in finding and utilizing their food sources. Conclusion: Therefore, case A (organisms showing inquiline behavior) would see greater opportunity for food sources than case B (organisms not showing inquiline behavior)."},{"instruction":"Question: Build a movie plot around this: How many people does Perkins kidnap 14 Answer:","output":"Title: \\"Perkins' Prey\\" Plot Summary: Frank Perkins, a brilliant but twisted mathematician, develops an obsession with the number 14. Driven by the belief that achieving a life-changing discovery relies on his experiments with this number, Perkins resorts to kidnapping 14 unsuspecting victims in order to see how far he can push the human spirit and achieve what he believes to be a monumental breakthrough in his mathematical theory. As the victims struggle to survive and escape, a determined detective, Alice Eastwood, works against the clock to unravel the mystery to save them. Act 1: The movie opens by introducing Frank Perkins, a middle-aged man with a seemingly normal life. He has a regular job, a few friends, yet his life is somber and lacks any true connection to others. What people don't know is that Perkins has an unhealthy obsession with the number 14, believing it to hold the secret to unlocking a groundbreaking mathematical formula. To prove his theory, Perkins starts identifying his victims – individuals from various backgrounds and age ranges, each representing a unique element of the number 14. He meticulously plans each abduction, making sure he leaves no trace behind. He abducts each victim one by one, carefully hiding their whereabouts and imprisoning them in a concealed, abandoned warehouse. Act 2: Meanwhile, Alice Eastwood, a highly skilled but secretly emotionally broken detective with a troubled past, is assigned to the missing persons case. As more people go missing, the case becomes even more perplexing. Despite her personal struggles, Alice begins to connect the dots and finds all the missing persons are somehow related to the number 14. She delves deeper into the case and grows increasingly obsessed with cracking it. As the tension builds, Perkins' captives learn about his obsession with the number 14 and are forced to partake in mentally and physically challenging experiments to prove his theory. Each victim is assigned a task symbolizing a unique aspect of the number, pushing them to their limits and threatening their lives. Perkins watches them closely, meticulously documenting their progress, and coldly punishing those who fail his tests. Act 3: Over time, the victims must overcome their differences and work together to survive the escalating trials and escape from captivity. They devise plans to avoid the tasks and manipulate them in ways that ultimately make Perkins begin to question the very foundation of his beliefs. Alice's investigation starts to take its toll on her personal life, yet she remains undeterred. Eventually, her resilience and determination lead her to uncover clues leading to the warehouse's location. Racing against time, Alice arrives at the warehouse just as Perkins begins to lose control and becomes more unhinged. In a final act of desperation, Perkins triggers a self-destruct mechanism in the warehouse, intending to wipe out all evidence of his experiments, including the victims. However, with their newfound teamwork and determination, the victims break free of their restraints, confront Perkins, and manage to escape just as the warehouse inundates in flames. Epilogue: The movie wraps up with Alice apprehending Perkins, who, reunited with his captives, faces the consequences of his horrifying actions. The victims, forever connected by their shared ordeal, try to rebuild their lives and find solace in their newfound friendships that arose in the darkest of times. Alice, on the other hand, finds a sense of purpose and closure as she solves the case that tested her limits and helped her come to terms with her own demons."},{"instruction":"Pick from: (I). yes.

In Einstein's e=mc ,what does the 'c' represent?","output":"In Einstein's famous equation, E=mc², the 'c' signifies the speed of light in a vacuum. This groundbreaking formula, which was brought forward as part of Einstein's groundbreaking theory of relativity in 1905, establishes a direct connection between energy (E) and mass (m) through the constant of the speed of light (c). To appreciate the role that 'c' plays in this equation, it's essential to have a basic understanding of the theory of relativity. This theory primarily revolves around the idea that the laws of physics remain constant for all observers in an inertial frame of reference. Moreover, it unearths the idea that the speed of light is the same for all such observers, regardless of their relative motion or that of the light source. Digging a bit deeper, the speed of light (c) is approximately 299,792 kilometers per second (or around 186,282 miles per second). From a practical standpoint, this means that light can travel seven and a half times around Earth's equator in just one second. In the context of Einstein's equation, the speed of light plays a pivotal role for several reasons: 1. Universal Constant: As mentioned earlier, the speed of light remains constant for all observers, making it a fundamental quantity in physicists' understanding of space-time. By incorporating this quantity in the equation, Einstein connected universal physical constants with the principles underpinning matter and energy. 2. Conversion Factor: By introducing 'c' as part of the equation, Einstein establishes a direct correlation between mass and energy. 'c' serves as a conversion factor that helps calculate how much energy can be obtained from a mass and vice versa. Intuitively, the equation suggests that a small amount of mass can be converted into an enormous amount of energy since 'c' is a large number, and the energy is related to the square of 'c'. 3. Linking Mass and Energy: Scientists can now analyze the mass-energy equivalence through this equation. 'c' operates as a binding parameter connecting two previously disconnected entities, warranting an entirely new perspective on the relationship between mass and energy. This connection has significant implications on various scientific fields, such as nuclear physics, cosmology, and astrophysics. To sum up, the 'c' in Einstein's E=mc² equation represents the speed of light in a vacuum, serving as a universal constant, conversion factor, and the linking component between mass and energy. This equation has had a profound impact on our comprehension of the universe, the atom, and the dynamic relationship between matter and energy."},{"instruction":"Question: You are presented with the question \\"What can be a source of food for many species of fish?\\" and the following answer choices: - Fully cooking the oysters - Organic compounds - beef - fishing poles - sessile organisms - barnacles - grass - gastropod shells Now knowing that sponges are a source of food for many species of fish and most sponges are sessile, choose the best answer.

From the maple trees, she will make 24 * 300 = 7,200. From the pine trees, she will make 600 * 200 = 120,000. Now, let's sum up all the money she has: 150 (cash) + 2,000 (cypress) + 7,200 (maple) + 120,000 (pine) = 129,350. Now, let's subtract the cost of the cabin from the total amount she has: 129,350 - 129,000 = 350. After buying the cabin, Gloria will have 350 left."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - Release them into the air by process of sporulation - Spores are carried by the wind - Land in a hospitable growing environment - The spores germinate into the soil - The mushroom starts growing - The adult mushroom produce spores of its own to repeat the process. Answer:","output":"The missing first step of the process is: Fungal mycelium develops and forms a fruiting body, which is the structure that will eventually produce and release spores. So, the revised and complete process of mushroom reproduction would be as follows: 1. Fungal mycelium develops and forms a fruiting body: Mushroom reproduction begins with the growth of mycelium, a network of thread-like structures called hyphae. Mycelium is the vegetative part of the fungus and plays a crucial role in the mushroom's growth and development. As the mycelium absorbs nutrients from the environment, it starts to form a fruiting body, which is the visible part of the mushroom that we typically recognize. 2. Release them into the air by the process of sporulation: When the fruiting body is fully developed, often in response to specific environmental conditions, it undergoes sporulation. During this process, the fruiting body releases millions of microscopic reproductive spores into the air. 3. Spores are carried by the wind: Once released, spores are carried by air currents, which can transport them significant distances from their original location. This dispersal mechanism helps ensure that the fungi can colonize new environments and prevents overcrowding in the existing location. 4. Land in a hospitable growing environment: As spores drift through the air, they eventually land in diverse locations. Only the spores that find a suitable environment, with the proper nutrients, temperature, and moisture levels, will be able to continue the life cycle. 5. The spores germinate into the soil: When conditions are favorable, the spores that have landed in a suitable habitat will germinate, and the hyphae will begin to grow. The new hyphae branch out into the soil, seeking out nutrients, and eventually forming more mycelium. 6. The mushroom starts growing: As the mycelium network grows and absorbs nutrients, it eventually forms a new fruiting body. The fruiting body emerges from the ground and becomes the visible part of the mushroom, undergoing growth and maturation. 7. The adult mushroom produces spores of its own to repeat the process: Once mature, the new mushroom's fruiting body undergoes sporulation, releasing spores into the air to continue the cycle. This ongoing process allows the mushroom species to reproduce and propagate throughout the environment, ensuring its survival and dispersal over time. In summary, the missing first step in the process of mushroom reproduction is the development of fungal mycelium and the formation of a fruiting body, which initiates the life cycle and leads to the production and dispersal of spores."},{"instruction":"Multi-choice problem: Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: The man finishes the sauce and pours it in a pot.

By William Boyd. 342 pages. William Morrow and Company Inc. 14.50. MORGAN LEAFY has problems. The First Secretary of the British Deputy Commission in the West African country of Kinjanja, he is being blackmailed by a local politician. His plans to rig the country's elections have somehow gone awry and a coup is slowly brewing. To make matters worse, his black mistress, Hazel, is cheating on him. The luscious Priscilla Fanshawe, daughter of his boss and object of his ambitious lusts, has just announced her engagement to his hated rival. And her father is threatening to dismiss him - unless Morgan can promptly dispose of a smelly corpse, which, according to local beliefs, must be left to rot under the hot African sun. With his first book, ''A Good Man in Africa,'' William Boyd has made a fine and very funny contribution to that now familiar genre of the English comic novel. The plot is quick; the prose - for the most part - smooth; the humor, relentlessly black. Indeed ''Good Man'' frequently recalls the manner and tone perfected by such masters as Evelyn Waugh and Kingsley Amis - it is as though Lucky Jim had been suddenly transported to the mythical kingdom of Azania in ''Black Mischief.'' Yet if Mr. Boyd's style is somewhat derivative, his protagonist, Morgan Leafy, still deserves a place of his own in the pantheon of modern British anti-heroes. He is not, at first glance, a terribly likable fellow: as he himself points out, he is frequently ''rude, sulky, bullying, selfish, unpleasant, hypocritical, cowardly, conceited.'' He resents his social betters for wearing Old School ties and for being the favored sons of ''a bourgeois, ex-public school God,'' and he is dismissive of his inferiors, relishing any opportunity to catch his servants napping. His person seems as blemished as his soul. Pale, fat and balding, Morgan is the unfortunate prisoner of his flesh, indulging whenever he can in women and drink. ''There were two good things about living in Africa,'' he says to himself. ''Beer and sex.'' ''They were the only things in his life that didn't consistently let him down. They sometimes did, but not in the randomly cruel and arbitrary way that the other features of the world conspired to confuse and frustrate him.'' Why do we care about such a loser? In part, because we have become accustomed to rooting for the underdog. In part because Mr. Boyd writes with such energetic irony. And in part because Morgan experiences something of a spiritual awakening: although this change is not, to my mind, clearly enough delineated, the title phrase ''Good Man'' undergoes a transformation of sorts by the end of the novel, from a derisively used rugger-club expression to an acknowledgement of real moral worth. The supporting cast of ''Good Man'' is sketched in with less detail, but just as much brio. To be sure, many of the characters are familiar comic types - the dim-witted, demanding boss and the voluptuous coquette; the bored, snooty British expatriates and the rhetoric-loving revolutionaries -but Mr. Boyd manages to invest many of them with memorable eccentricity. There is Deputy High Commissioner Fanshawe, who deals with his posting in this ''Godforsaken insignificant spot'' by nostalgically recalling his past assignments in the Far East and decorating his Commission residence as a cross between a Buddhist temple and a Chinese restaurant. And there is Sam Adekunle, the Harvard Business School-educated chieftain who employs such Western techniques as blackmail to pull off one of his country's biggest real estate scams. Although Mr. Boyd's Africa is not quite so outrageous a place as Waugh's - none of the satiric capers in ''Good Man'' comes close to the ''Birth Control Gala'' in ''Black Mischief'' - it possesses a similar emotional geography. It is an absurd and eminently corrupt place, Kinjanja -a place where both the natives and post-colonial Britons are opportunists, bent on taking advantage of the country's ''dangerous languor.'' Thanks to the author's first-hand knowledge of the continent - he grew up in Nigeria and Ghana - the fictional landscape is also well grounded in particulars of time and place. There are, of course, things a reader might quarrel with: Mr. Boyd's penchant for broad humor and narrative pratfalls makes, at times, for an irritating glibness; and his technical mastery of the novel form obscures the fact that he has yet to develop a voice that is truly his own - the echoes of his predecessors haunt the achievement of this book. Still, this remains a precocious debut indeed, and I eagerly await Mr. Boyd's next novel.","output":"\\"A Good Man in Africa\\" by William Boyd is a darkly humorous novel set in the West African nation of Kinjanja. The book explores the tormented life of its central character, Morgan Leafy, a First Secretary of the British Deputy Commission who finds himself entangled in political blackmail, a faltering love life, duplicitous election-rigging plans, and a looming coup. Morgan, who's revealed as an unlikable, flawed character battling personal and professional crises, eventually experiences a form of spiritual awakening. Despite drawing comparisons with other British comic novels and having a style reminiscent of Evelyn Waugh and Kingsley Amis, Boyd's work distinguishes itself with his vivid portrayal of a corrupt and absurd Africa grounded in details of time and place due to the author's own upbringing there. The supporting cast of characters adds a layer of eccentricity to the narrative, combining familiar comic archetypes with unique personalities contributing to the tangled chaos in Kinjanja. Though critique could be levied on the author's broad humor and over-bearing echoes of his predecessors, the book is seen as a promising debut offering from Boyd."},{"instruction":"Given the following passage \\"Red is one of the most common colors used on national flags. The use of red has similar connotations from country to country: the blood, sacrifice, and courage of those who defended their country; the sun and the hope and warmth it brings; and the sacrifice of Christ's blood (in some historically Christian nations) are a few examples. Red is the color of the flags of several countries that once belonged to the former British Empire. The British flag bears the colors red, white, and blue; it includes the cross of Saint George, patron saint of England, and the saltire of Saint Patrick, patron saint of Ireland, both of which are red on white. The flag of the United States bears the colors of Britain, the colors of the French tricolore include red as part of the old Paris coat of arms, and other countries' flags, such as those of Australia, New Zealand, and Fiji, carry a small inset of the British flag in memory of their ties to that country. Many former colonies of Spain, such as Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Peru, and Venezuela, also feature red-one of the colors of the Spanish flag-on their own banners.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Like all creeks in Lycoming County, Larrys Creek served as an area for settlers to establish homesteads and farms. As logging became a major industry in the mid-19th century, the creek was a source of power for sawmills and other mills. The first sawmill on the creek, in what is now Mifflin Township, was built in 1799. The relatively low flow of water in the creek did not allow rafts of logs to be floated downstream to the river and the lumber boom at Williamsport (as they were on Pine Creek to the west).This and the lack of logging railroads along the creek led to the development of many small sawmills: the Larrys Creek watershed once had 53 sawmills within 22 miles (35 km) of the mouth (as well as other industries of the time). No other stream in the country had so many sawmills in so small a territory. Twelve sawmills were on the Second Fork, six on the First Fork, one each on Canoe Run and Lawshe Run, and the rest were on Larrys Creek itself. Eight were structures rebuilt on the site of previous sawmills, and only four were steam powered (the rest were water powered). The earliest of these sawmills was built in 1796 (near Seeley Run), the last in 1902 (on Lawshe Run), and by 1903 just two mills were still standing and only one of those was operating.Lumbering removed the tree trunks, but left many flammable limbs, branches, and stumps behind. On May 2, 1872, a large forest fire destroyed the villages of Carter and Gould, 6 miles (9.7 km) north of Salladasburg on Larrys Creek in Mifflin Township. There are large tracts of second growth forest and small lumber companies still operate in the watershed today.

Six days later, rescue teams found five dead miners and the comatose Harry Warden (Richard John Walters), who survived by killing the other miners with a pickaxe, allowing himself to breathe. Tom Hanniger (Jensen Ackles) the owner's son, was blamed for the mine disaster because he forgot to vent the methane lines and caused a cave-in, but also Harry Warden for killing the miners. A year later, Valentine's Day, Warden wakes from his coma in the hospital, and goes on a murderous rampage. Soon after, Sheriff Burke (Tom Atkins) arrives, finding multiple mutilated bodies many of which have been severed in half and the heart of a nurse inside a candy box. Burke and his partner come to the conclusion that Warden had awoken from his coma and, realizing they don't have much time left, they try to figure out where he's headed. Meanwhile, at the abandoned mine shaft that was the site of the disaster, a party is in full swing, attended by many teens, including Axel Palmer (Kerr Smith), his girlfriend, Irene (Betsy Rue), Tom Hanniger and his girlfriend, Sarah (Jaime King).

Eight subspecies have been described, including two sometimes considered to be independent species. A large antelope, the hartebeest stands just over 1 m (3.3 ft) at the shoulder, and has a typical head-and-body length of 200 to 250 cm (79 to 98 in). The weight ranges from 100 to 200 kg (220 to 440 lb). It has a particularly elongated forehead and oddly shaped horns, short neck, and pointed ears. Its legs, which often have black markings, are unusually long. The coat is generally short and shiny. Coat colour varies by the subspecies, from the sandy brown of the western hartebeest to the chocolate brown of the Swayne's hartebeest. Both sexes of all subspecies have horns, with those of females being more slender. Horns can reach lengths of 45–70 cm (18–28 in). Apart from its long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back differentiate the hartebeest from other antelopes. Gregarious animals, hartebeest form herds of 20 to 300 individuals. They are very alert and non-aggressive. They are primarily grazers, with their diets consisting mainly of grasses. Mating in hartebeest takes place throughout the year with one or two peaks, and depends upon the subspecies and local factors. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Gestation is eight to nine months long, after which a single calf is born. Births usually peak in the dry season. The lifespan is 12 to 15 years. Guess a valid title for it!

The Rathers moved to Houston, where Dan attended Love Elementary School and Hamilton Middle School. He graduated in 1950 from John H. Reagan High School in Houston. In 1953, he earned a bachelor's degree in journalism from Sam Houston State University where he was editor of the school newspaper, The Houstonian. On September 8, 2004, Rather reported on 60 Minutes Wednesday that a series of memos critical of President George W. Bush's Texas Air National Guard service record had been discovered in the personal files of Lt. Bush's former commanding officer, Lt. Col. Jerry B. Killian. Once copies of the documents were made available on the Internet, their authenticity was quickly called into question. Much of this was based on the fact that the documents were proportionally printed and displayed using other modern typographic conventions usually unavailable on military typewriters of the 1970s. The font used on the documents has characteristics that exactly match standard font features of Microsoft Word. This led to claims that the memos were forgeries. The accusations then spread over the following days into mainstream media outlets including The Washington Post, The New York Times, and the Chicago Sun-Times. Rather and CBS initially defended the story, insisting that the documents had been authenticated by experts. CBS was contradicted by some of the experts it originally cited, and later reported that its source for the documents - former Texas Army National Guard officer Lt. Col. Bill Burkett - had misled the network about how he had obtained them. On September 20, CBS retracted the story. Rather stated, \\"If I knew then what I know now, I would not have gone ahead with the story as it was aired, and I certainly would not have used the documents in question.\\" The controversy has been referred to by some as \\"Memogate\\" and \\"Rathergate.\\" Following an investigation commissioned by CBS, CBS fired story producer Mary Mapes and asked three other producers connected with the story to resign. Many believe Rather's retirement was hastened by this incident. On September 20, 2007, Rather was interviewed on Larry King Live commenting \\"Nobody has proved that they were fraudulent, much less a forgery. ...

Harbison suggests the work's small scale indicates that it functioned as a portable altarpiece rather than as a private devotional work, and thus was commissioned by or for a member of the clergy. Other art historians have argued that the donor may have been a Genoese merchant. This belief has been fed by the triptych's similarity to Giovanni Mazone's Virgin and Child altarpiece in Pontremoli, Tuscany, which may place it in the Italian region of Liguria at latest by the end of the 15th century. Damaged coats of arms on the inner frames have been linked to the Giustiniani family, known for establishing trade links with Bruges in the 14th and 15th centuries. If not commissioned by that family, historical record place the work at least in their possession by the end of the century. In the early 1800s, Frances Weale attempted to place Michele Giustiniani as the donor, however later historical research has been unable to verify his presence in Bruges around 1437, and he seems to have returned to Italy by 1430.Mid-twentieth century technical examination revealed the Giustiniani coats of arms may have been painted over an earlier heraldic design, perhaps as early as the 15th century, whose signifiance and history is now lost. Dhanens theorises that a member of the Giustiniani family may have established other associations with St. Michael and St. Catherine, advancing that they were a member of the Italian Rapondi family, whose trading house in Paris was named after St. Catherine. Their daughter, also named Catherine, married the Italian merchant Michel Burlamacchi (Bollemard in Flemish) from Lucca, who was active in Bruges. From this Dhanens theorises the piece was commissioned as a wedding gift for the couple. Documents show weavers in Wervik paid taxes to Catherine Rapondi and in September 1434, when Michele Burlamacchi was tax collector in that town, van Eyck received a stipend funded..., what would be the answer ? A:","output":"The first name of the person that historical research has been unable to verify his presence in Bruges around 1437 is Michele. This refers to Michele Giustiniani."},{"instruction":"Alex Lee, Former Chef at Daniel, Joins Starr Restaurants When Alex Lee resigned his pressure-cooker position as executive chef at Daniel in 2003 to become the executive chef at Glen Oaks country club in Old Westbury, N.Y., he may as well have gone to Mars. A high-profile star seemed to have left the picture. Now he is back in the restaurant world as the culinary director of Starr Restaurants, Stephen Starr’s fast-growing group of 34 restaurants, most in Philadelphia and New York. Mr. Lee, who started last week, will oversee all of them and the other corporate chefs in the organization. Mr. Starr said he expected Mr. Lee to concentrate on the company’s new restaurants. When Mr. Lee left Daniel, he said wanted a simpler life, more time with his family and a garden. “I wanted something different, but above all to be able to spend more time with my kids,” he said in a telephone interview on Friday. The Glen Oaks landscape was familiar to him since he had grown up in the area, in Nassau County on Long Island. In recent years, he has been cultivating a large garden with 4,000 heirloom plants, mostly from seed. “I love to nurture things,” he said. Now Mr. Lee, 52, is leaving this comfort zone. “I felt it was the right time to get back into the game, so to speak,” he said. “I did miss the energy of the city. And my kids are older and more independent.” Mr. Lee also said he was looking forward to the opportunity to mentor young chefs. Hiring Mr. Lee is yet another example of Mr. Starr’s ability to attract marquee chefs. His roster already includes Masaharu Morimoto, Douglas Rodriguez, Justin Smillie, Jason Atherton from London and Daniel Rose from Paris. “It’s tough for an individual chef to open a restaurant, and I think that having an organization that supports them, not just financially but with infrastructure, is part of it,” Mr. Starr said. He prides himself on being a hands-on restaurateur, regularly visiting his restaurants. Mr. Lee said he was impressed with his boss’s palate. While at Glen Oaks, Mr. Lee, who worked in European kitchens like Arzak in Spain, Dal Pescatore in Italy and Alain Ducasse at Louis XV in Monte Carlo, has kept in touch with the New York scene. He was among the chefs who cooked at the 20th anniversary party for Daniel that was held in 2013 to benefit Citymeals on Wheels. He will not move to Philadelphia for his new job. Mr. Starr said he had not known Mr. Lee before the job came up. “His knowledge of food and the food world blew me away,” Mr. Starr said. “Maybe one day he’ll be doing his own restaurant.” An earlier version of this article misstated the year that Alex Lee left Daniel. It was 2003, not 2004. The article also misstated Mr. Lee’s education. He did not attend the Culinary Institute of America. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"1.

Here are possible answers to this question: - full of people - safety - lie - secure - being safe I believe the correct choice is \\"secure\\", here's why: The answer is:","output":"\\"secure\\", and let me provide a detailed explanation of why this is the most appropriate choice among the provided options. First, let's analyze the context of the question. The soldiers are on the run and in danger, which suggests that they are likely in a combat situation or escaping from enemy forces. Their objective is to find a suitable location to hide, recover, or protect themselves from any further threats. Now, let's consider each response and evaluate which one best aligns with the soldiers' objective: 1. Full of people: While finding refuge in a crowd could potentially offer anonymity or temporary camouflage, it comes with significant risks. Placing the soldiers among a group of civilians not only increases the likelihood of collateral damage and civilian casualties but also goes against the principle of distinction in armed conflict, which separates combatants from non-combatants. Therefore, this option is not the most appropriate choice in terms of ensuring the soldiers' safety. 2. Safety: Although this term is general and may seem like an attractive option, it is redundant with the concept of \\"being safe\\", which is also listed as an option. In this context, \\"safety\\" refers to the broader objective of finding a secure location. However, the question specifically asks what the soldiers need to ensure once they have entered the building. Therefore, this option does not directly address the question at hand. 3. Lie: The term \\"lie\\" is not relevant to the soldiers' immediate need for security and safety. Since they are on the run and in danger, their priority is to secure their position, not to deceive someone or hide the truth. 4. Secure: This option is the most appropriate because it directly addresses the soldiers' need to verify that the building is a safe space where they can take necessary precautions and defend themselves against any potential threats. Ensuring that the building is secure implies that they will be checking for any vulnerabilities, such as entry points for enemy forces, and taking steps to prevent their discovery or access. 5. Being safe: While \\"being safe\\" is indeed a priority for the soldiers, this option is not as specific as \\"secure\\" and does not explicitly address their need to confirm the safety of the building once they've entered it. In conclusion, the most appropriate answer to the question is \\"secure\\" because it directly relates to the soldiers' primary concern of ensuring that the building they've entered can provide adequate protection and defense against any potential threats. The other options provided, although somewhat relevant, do not address this concern as explicitly and accurately as the term \\"secure\\" does. Ensuring the building is secure would include assessing its structural integrity, monitoring any entry points, and potentially setting up temporary fortifications to improve their defensive position, ultimately allowing them to maintain their safety and carry out their mission effectively."},{"instruction":"Q:Kendall was asked if he wanted to try sky diving but Kendall erred on the side of caution.

For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species . These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem. In this example, the wolves would be a keystone species. Large birds are natural predators of rodents. Unfortunately, rodents consume crops in farmlands. In recent years, use of chemicals in agriculture has seen reduced number of large birds in Germany. But in some places in France farmers are cautions about using chemicals in agriculture. As a result, large bird population had been stable in France. Which country would see less crops produced, France or Germany?","output":"Based on the given information, it is likely that Germany would see less crops produced due to the reduced number of large birds caused by the use of chemicals in agriculture. The decreased population of large birds means there would be fewer natural predators for rodents, leading to increased crop loss from the higher rodent population. Meanwhile, in France, the stable population of large birds should help keep the rodent population in check, resulting in less crop damage and more crops produced."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question. Who abdicated on 30 April 1980, the day of her 71st birthday, and was succeeded by Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands?","output":"On 30 April 1980, Queen Juliana of the Netherlands abdicated her throne on the occasion of her 71st birthday and was succeeded by her eldest daughter, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands. Queen Juliana, born Juliana Louise Emma Marie Wilhelmina on April 30, 1909, was the daughter of Queen Wilhelmina and Prince Hendrik of the Netherlands. She ascended to the throne on September 4, 1948, following her mother's abdication. Queen Juliana's reign was marked by a progressive and humanitarian approach, and she was beloved by the Dutch people for her down-to-earth nature and genuine concern for their well-being. Throughout her reign, Queen Juliana focused on social issues and played a significant role in rebuilding the country after the devastation of World War II. She worked to enhance the welfare state, championed social and economic equality, and strived for international peace and cooperation. Queen Juliana was a strong advocate of decolonization, and during her tenure, several territories gained independence, including Indonesia, Suriname, and the Netherlands Antilles. On April 30, 1980, Queen Juliana chose to abdicate the throne in favor of her eldest daughter, Beatrix, as part of a long-standing Dutch tradition of abdication in favor of the next generation. The day marked not only her 71st birthday but also the national holiday known as Queen's Day, a day for celebration and connection with the Dutch people. By abdicating at this time, Juliana ensured that the Dutch people would continue to associate this festive occasion with the monarchy. Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, born Beatrix Wilhelmina Armgard on January 31, 1938, was educated in the Netherlands and abroad. Like her mother, she studied at Leiden University, where she majored in law, economics, and sociology. Her reign, which lasted from 1980 to 2013, was characterized by strong support for European integration, commitment to environmental issues, and a continued focus on social welfare. Queen Beatrix also played a vital role in promoting Dutch culture and maintaining close relationships with other European royals. Continuing the tradition, Queen Beatrix abdicated the throne herself on April 30, 2013, in favor of her son, King Willem-Alexander. He became the first male monarch of the Netherlands in over a century and has continued the legacy of his mother and grandmother by advocating for social and environmental issues and strengthening Dutch international relations."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"I hate this app but i wanted to use it because my youtube donot run without this app\\" A:","output":"To rate this review properly, it's crucial to examine various components within the text, such as the clarity of the message, the feedback provided, the balance between pros and cons, and the overall tone of the statement. Based on these factors, I would assign this review a score of 2.5. Let's break down the components that lead to this rating: 1. Clarity of the message: In this review, the user expresses their frustration by mentioning that they \\"hate this app\\" while also conveying their dependence on it because their \\"YouTube doesn't run without this app.\\" The inherent contradiction in the user's feelings towards the app is quite clear. 2. Feedback provided: While the reviewer doesn't give any specific information about what they dislike about the app, they do highlight that it's a necessary tool for their YouTube experience. This indicates that the app plays an essential role for certain users, despite their overall displeasure. 3. Balance between pros and cons: The reviewer does not provide much balance in their evaluation, focusing solely on their negative opinion of the app without elaborating on specific issues they have encountered. The lack of information makes it challenging to understand the reviewer's experience fully. 4. Overall tone: The tone of the review is quite negative and terse. However, the user does implicitly acknowledge the app's necessity for their YouTube usage, which adds a slight positive element to their criticism. In conclusion, the review falls in the middle of the rating scale at a 2.5 mainly because it offers limited feedback on specific problems the user has faced and is mainly negative in tone. While it might slightly discourage potential users from downloading the app, it also highlights the app's vital function for certain users. The ideal review would offer more balanced insights and specific examples of issues the user encountered, making it easier to address their concerns and improve the user experience."},{"instruction":"Write the last sentence in this story.

My wife walked out of our 9 year marriage and into relationship on the same day with a (so-called) friend of mine that I had known for 25 years. I was completely blindsided and in shock. I was devastated, I was lost, and I was grieving terribly. I had not only lost my wife, but I had also lost my best friend (her, not the asshole so-called friend), and her family. While I was not particularly close to her family (most did not like me according to my ex-wife) I did care about them and they were are part of my life. I absolutely loved her sister and always enjoyed hanging out with her, as well as one of her cousins. Luckily they are both still friends with me on FB so I get to keep in touch. Anyway, I am not proud of the fact that I created a fake FB account to check her page and even talked to her through IM’s. I thought that if I could just talk to her, even if not as me, that I would be okay. However, seeing photos of her with someone else just about broke me. It was a very stupid thing to do and only made matters worse. One day I forgot to block my location and she figured out it was me. I felt so stupid, but I had loved her so much that I needed her in my life. She called me out on it. I was busted. I was the grieving idiot that did not want to give up.

The writer himself speculates that he was \\"not an easy person to love\\", implying that his behavior or personality may have contributed to the end of the marriage. However, this is a somewhat subjective observation and doesn't provide a concrete reason for the dissolution of the marriage. The narrative also indicates the wife became involved with a friend of the writer on the same day she left the marriage, which could suggest that she developed feelings for this person while she was still married. However, without clear confirmation or further details, this remains speculative. The writer does not mention any unhappiness in the marriage prior to his wife leaving, and there's no indication that her family had any influence over her decision. Hence, those reasons seem unlikely based on the given information. Therefore, the most accurate answer from the given options would be \\"not enough information\\" as we don't have a definitive explanation from the wife herself about her motivations for leaving the marriage.

Throughout the seventh and eighth centuries numerous Japanese monks, scholars, and artists made the perilous trip west across the Sea of Japan to study Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and painting — later to be brought back for further development in Japan.

He also established relations with the Sui dynasty in China. Through him, the Japanese imperial court developed Chinese patterns of centralized government, with its formal bureaucracy of eight court ranks. The Chinese calendar was used to calculate the year of Japan's foundation by counting back the 1,260 years of the Chinese cosmological cycle. Thus, 660 b.c. is still the official date celebrated nationwide. At this early stage in its history Japan was already (for the most part) only nominally ruled by the emperor. De facto power was exercised by the militarily and economically strongest family. The Sogas had promoted Buddhism as an imperially sanctioned counterweight to the native Shinto religion, along with the new Chinese customs, to weaken the influence of their more conservative rivals. But they in turn were ousted in a.d. 645 by Nakatomi Kamatari, founder of the great Fujiwara clan, which was to rule Japanese affairs for hundreds of years and provide prominent advisers to the emperor even up to the 19th century.

Answer:","output":"The title \\"Armstrong Whitworth A.W.52\\" belongs to the category \\"mean of transportation.\\" Going into more detail, the Armstrong Whitworth A.W.52 was a British experimental jet aircraft built in the mid-20th century. More specifically, it was a tailless glider aircraft, meaning that it didn't have a separate vertical stabilizer at the end of the fuselage. The A.W.52 was built by Sir W.G. Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft Limited, which was, at that time, one of the largest aircraft manufacturing companies in the UK. The design of the A.W.52 was heavily influenced by research into tailless aircraft conducted during the 1930s and 1940s, primarily in Germany. The goal of constructing this aircraft was to research the principles and potential benefits of jet-propelled flight and tailless designs. Development of the A.W.52 began around the time of the Second World War, and the aircraft made its first successful flight in November 1947. Built in a sleek, streamlined configuration, the A.W.52 was remarkable not just for its unconventional tailless shape but also because it was one of the first British aircraft to be powered by a jet engine. The A.W.52 used a turbojet engine, which was relatively new technology at the time. This type of engine uses the flow of exhaust gases to create force and propel the aircraft forward. However, the A.W.52 project was closed in 1954 and only two prototypes were manufactured. So in summary, the \\"Armstrong Whitworth A.W.52\\" isn't a company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work.

(iStock) Indian food, with its hodgepodge of ingredients and intoxicating aromas, is coveted around the world. The labor-intensive cuisine and its mix of spices is more often than not a revelation for those who sit down to eat it for the first time. Heavy doses of cardamom, cayenne, tamarind and other flavors can overwhelm an unfamiliar palate. Together, they help form the pillars of what tastes so good to so many people. But behind the appeal of Indian food — what makes it so novel and so delicious — is also a stranger and subtler truth. In a large new analysis of more than 2,000 popular recipes, data scientists have discovered perhaps the key reason why Indian food tastes so unique: It does something radical with flavors, something very different from what we tend to do in the United States and the rest of Western culture. And it does it at the molecular level. [Why delicious Indian food is surprisingly unpopular in the United States] Before we go further, let's take a step back and consider what flavors are and how they interact. If you were to hold a microscope to most Western dishes, you would find an interesting but not all-too-surprising trend. Popular food pairings in this part of the world combine ingredients that share like flavors, which food chemists have broken down into their molecular parts — precise chemical compounds that, when combined, give off a distinct taste. [This surprisingly tough quiz will make you second guess how well you know food] Most of the compounds have scientific names, though one of the simpler compounds is acetal, which, as the food chemist George Burdock has written, is \\"refreshing, pleasant, and [has a] fruity-green odor,\\" and can be found in whiskey, apple juice, orange juice and raw beets. On average, there are just over 50 flavor compounds in each food ingredient. A nifty chart shared by Scientific American in 2013 shows which foods share the most flavor compounds with others and which food pairings have the most flavor compounds in common. Peanut butter and roasted peanuts have one of the most significant overlaps (no surprise there). But there are connections that are more difficult to predict: strawberries, for instance, have more in common with white wine than they do with apples, oranges or honey. Data crunching Indian recipes Chefs in the West like to make dishes with ingredients that have overlapping flavors. But not all cuisines adhere to the same rule. Many Asian cuisines have been shown to belie the trend by favoring dishes with ingredients that don't overlap in flavor. And Indian food, in particular, is one of the most powerful counterexamples. [Why many restaurants don't actually want you to order dessert] Researchers at the Indian Institute for Technology in Jodhpur crunched data on several thousand recipes from a popular online recipe site called TarlaDalal.com. They broke each dish down to its ingredients, and then compared how often and heavily ingredients share flavor compounds. The answer? Not too often. Here's an easy way to make sense of what they did, through the lens of a single, theoretical dish. Say you have a dish with 4 different ingredients, like the one below: Each one of those ingredients has its own list of flavor compounds. And any two of those ingredients' lists might have some overlap. Take the coconut and onion, for instance. We can all agree that these two things are pretty different, but we can also see (in the Venn diagram below) that there's some overlap in their flavor make-up. (Ignore the math symbols.) You could create the same diagram for all the ingredients with overlapping flavor compounds, as in this diagram. There are six that have overlap. (Again, ignore the math.) The researchers did this for each of the several thousand recipes, which used a total of 200 ingredients. They examined how much the underlying flavor compounds overlapped in single dishes and discovered something very different from Western cuisines. Indian cuisine tended to mix ingredients whose flavors don't overlap at all. \\"We found that average flavor sharing in Indian cuisine was significantly lesser than expected,\\" the researchers wrote. In other words, the more overlap two ingredients have in flavor, the less likely they are to appear in the same Indian dish. [It's official: Americans should drink more coffee] The unique makeup of Indian cuisine can be seen in some dishes more than others, and it seems to be tied to the use of specific ingredients. Spices usually indicate dishes with flavors that have no chemical common ground. More specifically, many Indian recipes contain cayenne, the basis of curry powder that is in just about any Indian curry. And when a dish contains cayenne, the researchers found, it's unlikely to have other ingredients that share similar flavors. The same can be said of green bell pepper, coriander and garam masala, which are nearly as ubiquitous in Indian cuisine. \\"Each of the spices is uniquely placed in its recipe to shape the flavor sharing pattern with rest of the ingredients,\\" the researchers noted. [Where people around the world eat the most sugar and fat] Milk, butter, bread, and rice, meanwhile—all of which are hallmarks of Western cuisine—were found to be associated with just the opposite: flavor pairings that match. When any of those ingredients appeared in an Indian dish, there was a good chance there would be a lot of flavor overlap. A lesson for all chefs The takeaway is that part of what makes Indian food so appealing is the way flavors rub up against each other. The cuisine is complicated, no doubt: the average Indian dish, after all, contains at least 7 ingredients, and the total number of ingredients observed by the researchers amounted to almost 200 out of the roughly 381 observed around the world. But all those ingredients — and the spices especially — are all uniquely important because in any single dish, each one brings a unique flavor. [Why Chipotle's pork problem is a bad sign for its future] But the upshot should also be a thought that we might be approaching food from the wrong angle. Combining ingredients with like flavors is a useful (and often delicious) strategy, but it might be a somewhat misleading rule of thumb. Indian cuisine, after all, is cherished globally, and yet hinges on a decidedly different ingredient pairing logic. ||||| Julia Child famously said that fat carries flavor, but perhaps instead we should give thanks to 4-methylpentanoic acid. Unique combinations of such chemical compounds give foods their characteristic flavors. Science-minded chefs have gone so far as to suggest that seemingly incongruous ingredients—chocolate and blue cheese, for example—will taste great together as long as they have enough flavor compounds in common. Scientists recently put this hypothesis to the test by creating a flavor map, a variant of which we have reproduced here. Lines connect foods that have components in common; thick lines mean many components are shared. By comparing the flavor network with various recipe databases, the researchers conclude that chefs do tend to pair ingredients with shared flavor compounds—but only in Western cuisine. Dishes from a database of recipes from East Asia tend to combine ingredients with few overlapping flavors. ||||| When I die, bury me inside a vat of saag paneer. Indian food is categorically delicious: its flavors are complex, oscillating between sweet, savory, and spicy; its textures meld creamy sauces with doughy breads and tender meat and vegetables to make the slop of dreams. It’s a divine synthesis that is aromatic and sophisticated without being bougie. Hell, you can get a better-than-decent plate of it for nary more than the cost of a deli sandwich. But what is it that makes Indian food so endlessly rich and tasty? Scientists were wondering, too, and recently performed an analysis of 2,500 recipes to find out, as first observed in the Washington Post. Researchers Anupam Jaina, Rakhi N Kb, and Ganesh Bagler from the Indian Institute for Technology in Jodhpur ran a fine-tooth comb through TarlaDalal.com—a recipe database of more than 17,000 dishes that self-identifies as “India’s #1 food site”—in attempts to decode the magic of your chicken tikka masala or aloo gobi. Sure, there are commonalities in seasoning that run through Indian cuisine as a whole, but just how varied are they? The answer is more complicated than you might expect. While many Western cuisines attempt to pair ingredients that share “flavor compounds”—the minute timbres that indicate something like types of sweetness or sourness or spiciness—Indian food’s signature is that it combines ingredients that don’t share these qualities at all. “We study food pairing in recipes of Indian cuisine to show that, in contrast to positive food pairing reported in some Western cuisines, Indian cuisine has a strong signature of negative food pairing,” the researchers wrote. “[The] more the extent of flavor-sharing between any two ingredients, [the] lesser their co-occurrence.” For example, if you find cayenne in an Indian dish, you’re unlikely to find another ingredient that shares the same compounds—though you may find other spices that have complementary, but not identical, attributes. This is true across the eight different types of sub-cuisines studied, from Bengali to Punjabi to South Indian. A total of 194 unique ingredients were identified in the recipes, and subdivided into 15 categories: spices, seeds, herbs, meats, etc. But—rather unsurprisingly—the spices, and their methods of pairing and combination, emerged as the character-defining attributes of Indian cuisine. That like flavors should be combined for better dishes—an unspoken but popular hypothesis stipulated by recipe-building in North American, Western European, and Latin American cultures—is an idea essentially reversed in Indian cuisine. In the words of the study, “Each of the spices is uniquely placed in its recipe to shape the flavor-sharing pattern with [the] rest of the ingredients, and is sensitive to replacement even with other spices.” In other words, each spice serves a very specific role in the dish it inhabits, from the warm sweetness of ginger to the slight bitterness of tamarind to the zingy freshness of cilantro. And it is the combination of many of these components—a typical Indian dish can incorporate a dozen different herbs and spices—that creates the flavor fingerprint that we’ve come to associate with a good plate of chana masala. So while instincts may say to pile sweet on sweet or hot ‘n’ spicy on even more hot ‘n’ spicy, keep in mind that opposites sometimes attract with delicious results. |||||","output":"Indian food is known for its blend of spices and unique flavors, and a recent study analyzing over 2,000 popular recipes has found that this distinct taste comes from the unconventional pairing of ingredients that do not share overlapping flavors.

The text also details how university is colloquially called \\"uni\\" in several countries, such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Nigeria, the Netherlands, Spain, and the German-speaking countries. In Ghana, New Zealand, and South Africa, the term \\"varsity\\" is sometimes used, although its usage has become less frequent in recent years, particularly in New Zealand. Furthermore, the text reveals that \\"varsity\\" was common in 19th century UK and is still in common usage in Scotland today. Thus, based on the information provided, the word \\"college\\" is not used to refer to a university in South Africa.

Hypothesis: The items are in a junky room .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","output":"Yes, if the premise is true and it states that umbrellas and junk are sitting in a messy room, we can conclude that the items are in a junky room. To thoroughly explain this conclusion, let's break down the premise and hypothesis and analyze them. Premise: Umbrellas and junk sitting in a messy room The premise provides a description of a situation where two kinds of items, umbrellas and junk, are present in a room. Additionally, the room is characterized as messy. A messy room typically implies that the items within it are disorganized, cluttered, or strewn about in a chaotic manner. This characteristic is important to understanding the overall scenario, as it provides context for the state of the room and helps justify the hypothesis. Hypothesis: The items are in a junky room The hypothesis suggests that the items, which are the umbrellas and junk identified in the premise, are in a room that is described as junky. The term \\"junky\\" can be synonymous with messy, cluttered, or disorganized. In this context, a \\"junky room\\" implies a room filled with items in a disorderly and chaotic state. When comparing the description of the room in the premise (messy) and in the hypothesis (junky), they both convey a similar state of disarray and disorganization. With this understanding, we can logically conclude that if the premise is true and umbrellas and junk are indeed sitting in a messy room, the items are in a junky room as described by the hypothesis. However, the given premise alone doesn't provide a complete picture of all possible factors contributing to the room's messiness or junkiness. There might be additional reasons why a room appears cluttered or disorganized, other items in the room could also contribute to the overall messiness. In this case, umbrellas and junk are only two contributing elements to the messiness of the room, but the hypothesis is still true when considering the given premise."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Process: - Magma comes up to the surface of the earth - The magma cools - Particles inside the magma move closer together - Crystals are formed - The crystals contain minerals. Question: suppose less butterflies around happens, how will it affect If more magma comes out of a volcano. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer is:","output":"C: No effect To fully understand why there is no effect on the amount of magma coming out of a volcano when there are fewer butterflies, let us first discuss the processes involved in both volcanic activity and the presence of butterflies, and then analyze the relationship between the two phenomena. 1. Volcanic activity: The formation of magma and its movement towards Earth's surface involve a series of geologic processes. Magma is formed when temperatures and pressures in the Earth's mantle cause rocks to partially melt, creating a molten mixture of minerals at extremely high temperatures (around 700°C to 1300°C). This magma rises to the surface due to the difference in density between the solid rock in Earth's crust and the molten mixture in the mantle. As the magma approaches the surface, it may encounter structural weaknesses or fractures, which can lead to the formation of volcanic conduits and ultimately an eruption. When magma reaches the surface, it can cool to form solid rock, depending on how fast the cooling process takes place. The cooling mechanism affects the crystal formation of minerals in the rock. 2. Butterfly population: Butterflies are insects belonging to the order Lepidoptera. They play an essential role in pollination, as they help transfer pollen between plants while feeding on nectar, thereby enabling reproduction in a wide range of plant species. The butterfly population can be affected by numerous factors, such as habitat loss, climate change, pesticides, and the availability of food sources (nectar-producing plants). These factors can lead to fluctuations in butterfly numbers, resulting in more or fewer butterflies in a specific environment. Now, let us analyze the relationship between volcanic activity and butterfly populations. Geologic processes, such as plate tectonics and mantle convection, drive the creation, movement, and eruption of magma. These processes occur independently of biological systems, including butterfly populations. The presence or absence of butterflies has no direct impact on geological processes and would not affect the amount of magma coming out of a volcano. In summary, considering both volcanic activity and butterfly populations, we can conclude that the number of butterflies in the environment has no direct effect on the amount or rate of magma emerging from a volcano. Therefore, the answer is C: No effect."},{"instruction":"Information: - Myanmar, officially the Republic of the Union of Myanmar and also known as Burma, is a sovereign state in South East Asia bordered by Bangladesh, India, China, Laos and Thailand.

They have also released vehicles and serve heavy weapons in scale 1 : 6 .","output":"Though the two sentences are fairly similar and discuss a similar subject matter, they do not have the exact same meaning due to differences in verb usage and the order of concepts. 1. \\"They have also served vehicles and crew-released heavy weapons in 1 : 6 scale.\\" In this sentence, serving seems to denote supporting or carrying out a function for the vehicles and the crew-released heavy weapons in a 1:6 scale. Here, \\"served\\" could potentially suggest a variety of actions depending on context, such as manufacturing, maintenance, or operation. It indicates some form of support or execution of duties. The adjective \\"crew-released\\" indicates that the heavy weapons were released by a crew. The provided scale (1:6) means the objects in consideration, which are vehicles and heavy-weapons, are significantly smaller than their real-life counterparts. The ratio indicates the model's size relative to the real thing. If, for example, the model is 1 foot long and the real vehicle is 6 feet long, the ratio is 1:6. 2. \\"They have also released vehicles and serve heavy weapons in scale 1 : 6 .\\" This sentence suggests they have released (perhaps meaning manufactured or marketed) both vehicles and heavy weapons in a 1:6 scale. Here, the term \\"serve\\" is used in association only with heavy weapons. This separation from the vehicles might suggest two different sets of actions—perhaps they manufacture vehicles and use or operate heavy weapons. Again, \\"scale 1:6\\" refers to the size of the vehicles and heavy weapons, which are significantly smaller than their real-life counterparts. In summary, the two sentences cannot be seen as interchangeable because they convey different roles that \\"they\\" seem to fulfill, particularly whether \\"they\\" are serving both vehicles and heavy weapons or releasing vehicles and serving heavy weapons. Additionally, the first sentence insinuates that the crew releases the heavy weapons, but the second sentence does not specify who does the releasing.

Answer: The time taken to cover the total distance is 48 seconds. Explanation: 1. The given data mentions that the car travels an distance, D, after accelerating uniformly and then goes an additional 180 meters. So, the total distance covered is D + 180 meters. 2. We are given that the car covers a total distance, S, at a constant speed of 54 km/h.

Although thoroughly institutionalized, Karl is deemed fit to be released into the outside world. Prior to his release, he is interviewed by a local college newspaper reporter, to whom he recounts committing the murders with a Kaiser blade, saying, \\"Some folks call it a sling blade. I call it a kaiser blade.\\" Karl says he thought the man was raping his mother. When he discovered that his mother was a willing participant in the affair, he killed her also. Thanks to the doctor in charge of his institutionalization (James Hampton), Karl lands a job at a repair shop in the small town where he was born and raised. He befriends 12-year-old Frank Wheatley (Lucas Black) and shares some of the details of his past, including the killings. Frank reveals that his father was killed - hit by a train - leaving him and his mother on their own. He later admits that he lied, and that his father committed suicide. Frank introduces Karl to his mother, Linda (Natalie Canerday), as well as her gay friend, Vaughan Cunningham (John Ritter), the manager of the dollar store where she is employed. Despite Vaughan's concerns about Karl's history in the mental hospital, Linda allows him to move into her garage, which angers Linda's abusive alcoholic boyfriend, Doyle Hargraves (Dwight Yoakam). Karl bonds with Linda, who makes him biscuits to eat, and also with Vaughan, who tells Karl that a gay man and a mentally challenged man face similar obstacles of intolerance and ridicule in small-town America.

In the early 1880s Sardou began a collaboration with actress Sarah Bernhardt, whom he provided with a series of historical melodramas. His third Bernhardt play, La Tosca, which premiered in Paris on 24 November 1887, and in which she starred throughout Europe, was an outstanding success, with more than 3,000 performances in France alone.Puccini had seen La Tosca at least twice, in Milan and Turin. On 7 May 1889 he wrote to his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, begging him to get Sardou's permission for the work to be made into an opera: \\"I see in this Tosca the opera I need, with no overblown proportions, no elaborate spectacle, nor will it call for the usual excessive amount of music.\\"Ricordi sent his agent in Paris, Emanuele Muzio, to negotiate with Sardou, who preferred that his play be adapted by a French composer. He complained about the reception La Tosca had received in Italy, particularly in Milan, and warned that other composers were interested in the piece. Nonetheless, Ricordi reached terms with Sardou and assigned the librettist Luigi Illica to write a scenario for an adaptation.In 1891, Illica advised Puccini against the project, most likely because he felt the play could not be successfully adapted to a musical form. When Sardou expressed his unease at entrusting his most successful work to a relatively new composer whose music he did not like, Puccini took offence. He withdrew from the agreement, which Ricordi then assigned to the composer Alberto Franchetti. Illica wrote a libretto for Franchetti, who was never at ease with the assignment. When Puccini once again became interested in Tosca, Ricordi was able to get Franchetti to surrender the rights so he could recommission Puccini. One story relates that Ricordi convinced Franchetti that the work was too violent to be successfully staged. A Franchetti family tradition holds that Franchetti gave the work back as a grand..., can you guess it ?

But taking even five to ten minutes a day to do something for yourself can make a big difference in your physical and mental state. Maybe you have your partner watch the baby while you take a 10 minute soak in the tub. Or maybe you arrange for child care for an hour so you can spend time at a friend’s home and have a spa night. Try to find time in your busy schedule to reconnect with your body and take care of yourself. Sometimes even doing the most basic grooming can make you feel much better. Many new moms struggle to fit in time to even wash their hair or put on makeup. Try to set aside five to ten minutes in the day to groom yourself in small ways so you can feel more positive about your appearance. Ask other moms how they keep their babies occupied and safe while they do these things. It is important to maintain your self-care routine during this time. Doing exercise can make you feel better and improve your body image overall. As a busy new mom, you may not have time to do an hour long fitness class at the gym or intense workouts. Instead, try fitting in quick and easy exercises at home while the baby is napping or while a caregiver is watching the baby. Doing a little bit of exercise can make you feel more positive about your body. For example, you may do a series of lunges and side stretches every morning while the baby is down for a nap. Or maybe you go for a walk or a light jog while your partner watches the baby. You can also take the baby on walks with you. Spending time outside is good for their temperament and sleep. Just make sure your baby is protected from the sun and wind. Another option is to find a gym with child care, if you are comfortable with it and if it is in your price range. Another big element of self-care is giving yourself the time and space to do something that you find relaxing or calming. This could be a hobby such as painting, drawing, singing, or knitting. Or you may do a calming activity like light yoga stretches or meditation. Make an effort to set aside time in your busy day for even five to ten minutes to do something that will help you relax. For example, you may do a five minute meditation while the baby sleeps. Or you may try painting a small picture throughout the week in five to ten minute increments, whenever you have time off from caring for the baby. You should also focus on boosting your self-confidence as part of self-care. To boost your confidence you may focus on skills that you are good at, such as your mothering skills or your ability to simply get through the day successfully with a newborn. Take the time to acknowledge how hard you are working and how rewarding it is to be a new parent. Remember that it takes perseverance and patience to be a good mother. Giving yourself some credit as a new parent can help to increase your confidence level. One way you can boost your confidence is to take a mental note of all the responsibilities you are juggling as a new mother. Try writing down everything you have accomplished at the end of the day. Tell yourself, \\"I'm doing a great job despite all that I have to do today\\" or \\"I need to give myself more credit for tackling motherhood head on.\\" What is a summary?","output":"In summary, self-care is crucial for new mothers, even amidst the challenges and busy schedule of caring for a newborn. To support your physical and mental well-being, try to find 5-10 minutes each day for grooming, exercise, relaxation, and hobbies. Enlist the help of your partner or caregiver to ensure you have some time for yourself. Engaging in a variety of activities, such as light exercises, walking with your baby, performing calming hobbies, and finding ways to boost your self-confidence can help keep you healthy and happy. Acknowledge your hard work and accomplishments in motherhood, and give yourself credit for the effort you put in every day."},{"instruction":"What is the solution to this math problem?

Article: When an NBA player is young he thinks he can win the championship by himself. It is only later when he has aged and been through many battles that he learns an important lesson: there is no \\"I \\" in \\"team\\". There is no better example of the value of teamwork than the Boston Celtics. Paul Pierce, Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett were all superstars on three different teams. Yet, none of them had any titles to show for it. Then, last season, they decided to sacrifice money and individual statistics to play together. Garnett and Allen joined Pierce on the Celtics and changed the NBA in the process. It started in simple ways. Garnett and Allen are two of the most intense athletes in the world. They treat every second of every practice like it is the NBA championship. If you want to play alongside them then you will have to do the same. So, the young guys on the Celtics started giving their full effort too. Pierce had been the star of the Celtics for many years. He used to shoot the ball many times a game. But with the addition of Allen and Garnett he shot less and focused on defense. His selflessness showed the young players that doing what made the team better was the only thing that mattered. When the Celtics were winning and the game was almost over, Garnett, Pierce and Allen would come out of the game. But they wouldn't just sit on the bench. Instead, they stood and cheered and screamed for their teammates. They wanted to support their friends and teammates. Now, the guys who don't play know they can still affect the game by cheering so they scream and cheer when Garnett, Allen and Pierce are playing. The Celtics have developed a strong relationship. They are more than just teammates. They are brothers. The result: the Boston Celtics won the championship and are considered the favorites to win the Eastern Conference championship again this year. There is a saying that goes, \\"A successful team beats with one heart.\\" If that is the case, the Celtics may have the biggest heart in the NBA. Question: Which of the following didn't contribute to the success of the Boston Celtics?

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"The two questions refer to the duration methamphetamine, or meth, remains detectable in a person's system and how long it stays in a person's system if injected. While these questions are related, they are not the same. The first question asks about meth's detectability in testing, while the second question specifically asks about the duration in the system when injected. Detection time of methamphetamine will depend on several factors, like the type of test used, dosage, individual metabolism, and other variables. Now, let's dive into the specific time frames dictated by different drug tests. 1. Urine Test: Meth can be detected in urine between 1-4 days after the last use. Most commonly, urine tests are used to detect the presence of meth because they are non-invasive and have a relatively long detection window. 2. Saliva Test: Methamphetamine can be detected in saliva within 10 minutes to 72 hours after the last use. Saliva tests are also non-invasive, and they are becoming more popular, although the detection window is shorter than that of urine tests. 3. Blood Test: The detection window for meth in a blood test is relatively short, ranging from 12 hours to 3 days after the last use. Blood tests are invasive but provide a high level of accuracy in detecting recent drug use. 4. Hair Test: Hair tests have the longest detection window, with the ability to detect methamphetamine use up to 90 days or even longer after the last use. Hair tests are less common due to the high cost and the requirement of a hair sample of appropriate length. Regarding your second question, the route of administration, such as injecting, does have an impact on the duration meth stays in your system. In general, injecting meth directly into the bloodstream leads to a rapid onset of effects but also a faster clearance from the system. However, this does not significantly alter the detection time frames mentioned above. Keep in mind that individual factors such as metabolic rate, overall health, frequency of use, and the purity of the substance can influence how long meth stays in the body. To summarize, the two questions are related but not the same. The first question asks about meth's detection window in the system through testing, while the second asks about the duration in the system when injected. Methamphetamine can be detected in the body for varying time frames depending on the type of test used. The method of administration, like injecting, can influence the duration of meth in the system, but the detection windows for different tests will remain relatively consistent."},{"instruction":"This is some data: Bhajji, country, India; Bhajji, region, Karnataka; Bhajji, alternativeName, \\"Bhaji, bajji\\"; Bhajji, ingredient, Vegetable.

Broad shallow seas advanced across central North America (the Western Interior Seaway) and Europe, then receded late in the period, leaving thick marine deposits sandwiched between coal beds. At the peak of the Cretaceous transgression, one-third of Earth's present land area was submerged. The Cretaceous is justly famous for its chalk; indeed, more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the Phanerozoic. Mid-ocean ridge activity—or rather, the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges—enriched the oceans in calcium; this made the oceans more saturated, as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for calcareous nanoplankton. These widespread carbonates and other sedimentary deposits make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine. Famous formations from North America include the rich marine fossils of Kansas's Smoky Hill Chalk Member and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation. Other important Cretaceous exposures occur in Europe and China. In the area that is now India, massive lava beds called the Deccan Traps were laid down in the very late Cretaceous and early Paleocene.\\" Answer: Answer:","output":"An interesting fact about the Cretaceous period, also known as \\"the age of chalk,\\" is that it witnessed the most extensive chalk formation in Earth's history. This unique geological phenomenon occurred due to the interplay of various factors, including shifting tectonic plates, changes in ocean chemistry, and the evolution of calcareous nanoplankton, which significantly contributed to the massive chalk deposits. During the Cretaceous period, the Tethys Sea continued to narrow as shallow seas advanced across central North America and Europe. At its peak, one-third of Earth's present land area was submerged underwater, leaving marine deposits and coal beds as evidence of the transgression. As the continents underwent significant changes in their positions and shapes, the shifting of tectonic plates resulted in the emergence of mid-ocean ridges. These mid-ocean ridges played a crucial role in the formation of chalk by allowing seawater to circulate through them, enriching the oceans with calcium. This increase in calcium saturation not only created ideal conditions for chalk formation but also enhanced the bioavailability of the element for calcareous nanoplankton – microscopic marine organisms that use calcium to build their shells. These nanoplankton thrived in the Cretaceous oceans and, upon their death, their calcareous shells sank to the seafloor and accumulated, ultimately creating massive chalk deposits over time. The extensive chalk formations from the Cretaceous period have contributed significantly to the rich geological record preserved in various locations across the globe. Famous examples include Kansas's Smoky Hill Chalk Member, teeming with marine fossils, and the Hell Creek Formation, which contains fossils of terrestrial fauna. In addition to North America, the Cretaceous chalk formations are also evident in Europe and China. Another noteworthy geological event that occurred during the late Cretaceous and early Paleocene was the formation of the Deccan Traps in present-day India. Massive lava flows covered the region, creating layers of basaltic rock that still remain today. These volcanic eruptions may have played a role in the mass extinction event marking the end of the Cretaceous period. In conclusion, the Cretaceous period holds significant importance as the age of chalk, with more chalk formations occurring during this time than in any other period of Earth's Phanerozoic history. This fascinating fact can be attributed to the interplay of tectonic movements, changes in ocean chemistry, and the proliferation of calcareous nanoplankton – a remarkable testament to the dynamic geological processes that shaped our planet during this era."},{"instruction":"You are considering whether to buy a product.

Around 1880, two young British officers arrive to join a regiment in India. One, Lieutenant Drake, from a middle-class background, is extremely eager to fit in while the other, Lieutenant Millington, the son of a general, is keen to get out as soon as possible and deliberately antagonizes his fellow officers. The two newcomers learn the traditions of the regiment, one of which is a mess game in which they chase a wooden pig on wheels, attempting to pierce its anus with their swords. Mrs Scarlett, the flirtatious and attractive widow of a captain who was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, is a constant presence in the regiment. One night at a mess dance, Millington gets drunk and tries to seduce Mrs Scarlett in the garden. She repels him, but moments later runs back into the mess wounded and in shock, claiming the culprit was Millington. An informal court martial -more a mock trial than anything else- is organized with Drake ordered to be Millington's defending officer. Although Drake is pressured by his superior officer to plead guilty for Millington and close the case quickly, he begins to challenge the orders in order to give the defendant a fair trial. Drake learns from an Indian servant that another widow suffered a similar attack with a sword six months earlier, before he and Millington joined. After irrefutable evidence, Mrs Scarlett finally admits it was not Millington who attacked her but will not say who the culprit is. Millington, now indisputably proved innocent, is welcomed back by his brother officers; but Drake, disgusted by the truth he's uncovered, resigns.

But Olympic officials said that after extensive tests, they had finally pinpointed the reason: a chemical imbalance caused by too many people using the water. There had been speculation Tuesday that algae was the cause, but that theory was dismissed by officials. “Midafternoon, there was a sudden decrease in the alkalinity in the diving pool, and that’s the main reason the color changed,” Mario Andrada, a Rio 2016 spokesman, said Wednesday morning. He noted that a lot of people had been in the pools in the past week at the Maria Lenk Aquatic Center, and that their presence had touched off changes in the water’s chemical balance. “We probably failed to note that with more athletes, the water could be affected,” Andrada said. He said, too, that the water had not been monitored as carefully as it should have been and that the trouble was apparently exacerbated by Wednesday morning’s rain. CreditJeffrey Furticella/The New York Times “The people in charge of the pool should have done more intensive tests,” he said. “We brought in a team of independent experts to check.” Andrada said that there was no health risk to the athletes and that “the pool should go back to its classic blue colors during the day.” The alarmingly swift transformation of the diving pool from aqua to swamp green on Tuesday spurred the usual social media hilarity, with much of the speculation focusing on the possibility of athletes’ using the pool for a bodily function generally frowned upon at pools. Nope, said Nate Hernandez, director of aquatic solutions at VivoAquatics, a pool care company based in California whose clients include hotels and resorts. “To be honest, people pee in the pool all the time — this wouldn’t affect it,” he said via email.

Pool experts said that with decent pool maintenance, water in a pool should not change color so drastically and quickly. “If the pool’s systems are properly sized with adequate filtration and using appropriate chemical distribution, they should be able to maintain clarity and sanitation even during peak use,” Jamie Novak, a brand manager at NC Brands, a swimming pool and spa chemical manufacturer in Connecticut, said in an email. Hernandez said that failing to anticipate and plan for a large number of swimmers at an event like the Olympics, which by definition attracts a large number of swimmers, seemed a weird sort of mistake. “Take a pool like the Hard Rock in Las Vegas,” he said. “On a Sunday in the summertime, we’ll put 5,000 people in that water at one time. The most we’ve ever had is about 8,200, and it has never turned green.” The Rio Games have had their share of water-related troubles, particularly at the rowing and sailing venues, where the water is contaminated by a toxic stew of bacteria and pathogens. A visit Wednesday afternoon showed that the diving pool was still a fairly dark shade of green while the pool for water polo and synchronized swimming was somewhat lighter, more of a sea glass green.

The NFL announced its highly anticipated ruling Tuesday morning, stating that the Minnesota Vikings' star running back will not be considered for reinstatement before April 15, 2015, for violating the league's personal conduct policy. Editor's Picks Goessling: Peterson's time in Minnesota likely over The NFL's punishment of Adrian Peterson was so thorough it likely means the end of Peterson's time in Minnesota, Ben Goessling writes. The league said it informed Peterson of the ruling in a letter from commissioner Roger Goodell, who spelled out a path for his return to the field. The Vikings have six games left this season. The league's enhanced disciplinary policy calls for a six-game suspension for first offenses of assault, battery or domestic violence. Aggravating circumstances warrant higher levels of discipline, and Goodell's letter to Peterson spelled that out. But a league source told ESPN's Ed Werder that it is \\"very possible\\" that Peterson could return to the field for this Sunday's game against the Green Bay Packers, pending a ruling by the independent arbitrator in Monday's grievance hearing. The NFL Players Association quickly announced its plan to appeal and sharply rebuked what it calls the league's inconsistency and unfairness in the process. If arbitrator Shyam Das rules in favor of Peterson, he could play while his appeal of Tuesday's suspension is heard, according to rules laid out in the NFL's collective bargaining agreement. Goodell, under the CBA, would decide who hears Peterson's appeal. Another source told ESPN's Chris Mortensen that if Das decides Peterson should be reinstated, the issue will become more complex and \\"there will be many lawyers involved.\\" \\"You have shown no meaningful remorse for your conduct. When indicted, you acknowledged what you did but said that you would not 'eliminate whooping my kids' and defended your conduct in numerous published text messages to the child's mother. You also said that you felt 'very confident with my actions because I know my intent.' These comments raise the serious concern that you do not fully appreciate the seriousness of your conduct, or even worse, that you may feel free to engage in similar conduct in the future.\\" Excerpt from NFL commissioner Roger Goodell's letter to Adrian Peterson Peterson was indicted in September on a felony charge of injury to a child for using a wooden switch to discipline his 4-year-old son earlier this year. The All-Pro pleaded no contest to a lesser charge of misdemeanor reckless assault Nov. 4, setting the stage for the NFL's ruling. Peterson was placed on a special exempt list at the sole discretion of Goodell on Sept. 18, essentially paid leave while his case went through the legal system. The NFLPA said Peterson was told that would count as time served for any suspension levied, citing an unnamed NFL executive. League spokesman Brian McCarthy told The Associated Press in an email that Peterson's stay on the exempt list was taken into account. \\"There were aggravating circumstances that led to the discipline announced,\\" McCarthy told the AP. The league's statement included excerpts of the letter written by Goodell, who has required that Peterson undergo counseling and treatment in order to be reinstated. \\"We are prepared to put in place a program that can help you to succeed, but no program can succeed without your genuine and continuing engagement,\\" Goodell wrote in the letter. \\"You must commit yourself to your counseling and rehabilitative effort, properly care for your children, and have no further violations of law or league policy.\\" The Vikings also released a statement, saying they \\"respect the league's decision and will have no further comment at this time.\\" Peterson's case revived a debate about corporal punishment, which is on the decline in the U.S. but still widely practiced in homes and schools. Peterson has repeatedly claimed that he never intended to harm his son and was disciplining him in the same way he had been as a child growing up in East Texas. Goodell, however, expressed concern in his letter that Peterson does not \\"fully appreciate the seriousness\\" of his conduct. \\"You have shown no meaningful remorse for your conduct,\\" Goodell's letter said. \\"When indicted, you acknowledged what you did but said that you would not 'eliminate whooping my kids' and defended your conduct in numerous published text messages to the child's mother. You also said that you felt 'very confident with my actions because I know my intent.' \\"These comments raise the serious concern that you do not fully appreciate the seriousness of your conduct, or even worse, that you may feel free to engage in similar conduct in the future.\\" ||||| MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Adrian Peterson's potential return to the Minnesota Vikings is at the heart of a dispute between the NFL and the players' association, and the star running back thinks the league is being unfair. Peterson criticized the NFL on Sunday over the process of being activated from a special exempt list after he pleaded no contest Nov. 4 to misdemeanor reckless assault in Texas for hitting his 4-year-old son with a wooden switch. The union filed a grievance with the league, demanding Peterson be allowed to rejoin the Vikings until the determination of any punishment under the personal conduct policy. The NFL, however, ruled Peterson must remain on paid leave in the meantime. Commissioner Roger Goodell has the sole power to remove him from the special exempt list. \\"At this point, I've resolved my matter in the criminal court; I've worked to make amends for what I've done; I've missed most of the season, and I stand ready to be candid and forthcoming with Mr. Goodell about what happened,\\" Peterson said in a statement issued by the NFL Players Association. \\"However, I will not allow the NFL to impose a new process of discipline on me, ignore the CBA, ignore the deal they agreed to with me, and behave without fairness or accountability. The process they are pushing is arbitrary, inconsistent, and contrary to what they agreed to do, and for those reasons, I never agreed to the hearing.\\" The NFL offered Peterson the hearing, but a hearing is only required by the CBA if a player elects to appeal a punishment. In this case, no decision has been made yet on discipline. The NFL's enhanced penalty for players involved in domestic violence, announced by Goodell in August, is a six-game suspension. The injuries to Peterson's son occurred in May. Peterson said he meant no harm in his attempt to discipline the boy. The league had no further comment Sunday, referring to its statement from the previous day that it offered three days in advance a hearing for Peterson that would have been held Friday to review the case. The union then informed the league Thursday of its refusal to meet. In the statement, Peterson said the NFLPA sent repeated questions to the NFL about the nature and purpose of the hearing that went unanswered. \\"After consulting with the union, I told the NFL that I will attend the standard meeting with the Commissioner prior to possible imposition of discipline, as has been the long-term practice under the CBA, but I wouldn't participate in a newly created and non-collectively bargained pre-discipline 'hearing' that would include outside people I don't know and who would have roles in the process that the NFL wouldn't disclose,\\" Peterson said. Regarding the grievance, an arbitrator was scheduled to hear arguments from both sides Monday. That's only to determine whether Peterson should be immediately reinstated prior to the league's issuance of any discipline. He could, in theory, be ordered back to the team only to be suspended soon after. But as Minnesota played Chicago Sunday, time was running out on this season for the 2012 NFL MVP. The Vikings have six games left after this weekend. ___ AP NFL websites: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL |||||Summary:","output":"Adrian Peterson, the Minnesota Vikings' star running back, has been suspended without pay for at least the remainder of this season.

In 1986, what was the name of the European data gathering spacecraft that intercepted the path of Halley's Comet?","output":"In 1986, the European data gathering spacecraft that intercepted the path of Halley's Comet was named Giotto. Launched by the European Space Agency (ESA) on July 2, 1985, Giotto was a part of the larger international effort called the Halley Armada to study the famous comet as it made its closest approach to Earth in 75-76 years. Giotto, named after the Italian Renaissance artist Giotto di Bondone, who portrayed the comet in his 1305 painting \\"Adoration of the Magi,\\" was pioneering in various aspects. It was the first deep space mission by the ESA, and the first robotic spacecraft to make a close flyby of a comet. Giotto's primary objectives were to image the nucleus of Halley's Comet, study the surrounding coma, analyze the composition of the solid nucleus and volatile components, and study plasma, dust particles, and cosmic rays in the comet's vicinity. The spacecraft carried ten scientific instruments, including cameras, spectrometers, and magnetometers, which allowed it to gather various data and take images of the comet's heart during its closest approach of roughly 596 kilometers. On March 13, 1986, Giotto made its closest pass to Halley's Comet, enduring dust impacts that momentarily caused it to tumble but still managing to achieve the majority of its mission objectives and gather valuable data. The findings from Giotto's flyby revolutionized scientists' understanding of comets. Among the mission's most notable discoveries was the revelation that Halley's nucleus had an irregular, potato-like shape with a dark surface, was approximately 15 kilometers long, and had active jet-like features spewing ices, dust, and various chemical compounds. Giotto's data also indicated that water was the primary volatile constituent of Halley's Comet, with smaller amounts of carbon monoxide and other gases. After its encounter with Halley's Comet, Giotto went on to study another comet, Grigg-Skjellerup, in 1992, making it the first spacecraft to visit two comets. Giotto's mission was considered a remarkable success, providing valuable insights into the nature and composition of comets and setting the stage for future deep space exploration."},{"instruction":"Consider the question. One of the following sentences is nonsensical. Which one is it? Options: - Sentence A: \\"Children use backpacks to carry their school supplies\\" - Sentence B: \\"Children use leather bags to carry their school supplies\\" What is the step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the answer: Sentence B?","output":"The question states that one of the sentences is nonsensical, which means it doesn't make logical sense. To determine which sentence is nonsensical, we must evaluate each option and their content. Let's consider both sentences A and B. Step 1: Understand the context of the sentences, which is about children carrying their school supplies. Step 2: Analyze the key concepts in both sentences. In Sentence A, \\"Children use backpacks to carry their school supplies.\\" the key concept is that children are using backpacks for their school supplies. In Sentence B, \\"Children use leather bags to carry their school supplies.\\" the key concept is that children are using leather bags for their school supplies. Step 3: Evaluate the logical consistency of both sentences. Sentence A is logically consistent as it is common and reasonable for children to use backpacks for carrying their school supplies. Backpacks are designed for this purpose, providing adequate space and compartments for items such as books, stationery, and other learning materials. Sentence B, on the other hand, is not necessarily nonsensical; it simply mentions a less common or less practical option for carrying school supplies. A leather bag may not be as useful or practical as a backpack, particularly for young children who might struggle with organization, durability concerns, or shoulder discomfort. However, it is still possible for some children to use leather bags as a method of carrying their school materials. Therefore, Sentence B is not nonsensical, but rather uncommon or less practical. In conclusion, neither Sentence A nor Sentence B can be considered nonsensical. Both sentences describe potential methods that children can use to carry their school supplies, even if one method is more common or practical than the other. The question itself is flawed in assuming that one of the sentences must be nonsensical."},{"instruction":"Us Conductors accounts the relationship between Clara Rockmore and this inventor who is most famous for his invention of what? The answer to this question is:","output":"Us Conductors is a historical fiction novel written by Sean Michaels that tells the story of Lev Sergeyevich Termen, also known as Léon Theremin, a Russian inventor and pioneer of electronic music. The novel accounts the extraordinary relationship between Lev Termen and Clara Rockmore, a talented theremin virtuoso who was once his student and became a renowned performer. Lev Termen is most famous for his invention of the theremin, an electronic musical instrument that is played without any physical contact. The theremin, patented in 1928, consists of two antennas that sense the position of the performer's hands and control the pitch and volume of the sound produced. It works based on the principle of heterodyning, where two high-frequency signals are combined to produce a lower-frequency audible tone, which creates the instrument's unique sound. The relationship between Lev Termen and Clara Rockmore is central to the narrative in Us Conductors. They met in New York City in the 1920s, with the inventor teaching Rockmore to play the theremin when she was just a teenager. As Rockmore's talent emerged and her career took off, their relationship evolved into a deep bond, marked by passion, admiration, and a mutual love for music. Throughout the novel, the reader follows the dynamics of their relationship, as they face numerous obstacles, including political turmoil, personal challenges, and the realities of their evolving lives. In Us Conductors, the story of Lev Termen and Clara Rockmore serves as a backdrop for exploring the life and career of Termen, as he navigates through different social and political environments in both the United States and the Soviet Union. The novel delves into Termen's involvement with the Soviet intelligence agency and his eventual arrest and imprisonment in Russia. Amidst these historical events, the unwavering connection between Termen and Rockmore is a constant thread, illuminating the power of music and the human spirit. In summary, the historical fiction novel Us Conductors by Sean Michaels centers around the relationship between Lev Termen (Léon Theremin) and Clara Rockmore. The Russian inventor Lev Termen is most famous for his creation of the theremin, an electronic musical instrument that is played without any physical contact. The theremin's unique sound is achieved through the heterodyning principle, which establishes the foundation of this extraordinary instrument, as well as the bond between Termen and Rockmore throughout the novel."},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to German: The bar is also a great place for an informal diner.

For the most part, jogging can be a healthy way to stay fit. However, problems can also develop for those who jog in the heat. Excessive sweating can lead to electrolyte loss that could be life-threatening. Early symptoms of electrolyte deficiency can include nausea, fatugue, and dizziness. If not treated, individuals can experience muscle weakness and increased heart rate (which could lead to a heart attack). Many sports drinks can be consumed to restore electrolytes quickly in the body. Paragraph: Kevin and his cousin Darlene both enjoy jogging for exercise. One day, Kevin goes out for a jog in his local neighborhood when the amount of heat outside is quite high, and he begins to sweat a lot and starts to feel a bit dizzy. On the same day, Darlene goes jogging in her neighborhood when the amount of heat outside is low and she feels perfectly normal as she continues to jog. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who is more likely to be experiencing electrolyte deficiency? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Kevin is more likely to be experiencing electrolyte deficiency. This is due to several factors that are present in his situation, compared to Darlene's. Firstly, the amount of heat outside is quite high when Kevin goes for a jog. This can contribute to excessive sweating as his body tries to cool itself down in response to the increased temperature. When a person sweats a lot, it leads to a loss of electrolytes, which are essential minerals like sodium, potassium, and magnesium that play vital roles in regulating various body functions, including muscle contractions and maintaining fluid balance. The paragraph also mentions that Kevin starts to feel dizzy during his jog. Dizziness is one of the early symptoms of electrolyte deficiency, which can result from excessive sweating and subsequent loss of electrolytes. This further supports the likelihood of Kevin experiencing electrolyte deficiency. On the other hand, Darlene goes jogging in her neighborhood when the amount of heat outside is low. This implies that Darlene is less likely to be sweating excessively and consequently, she has a lower risk of losing significant amounts of electrolytes. Moreover, she feels perfectly normal while jogging, which indicates that she doesn't appear to be experiencing any symptoms of electrolyte deficiency, such as nausea, fatigue, or dizziness. In conclusion, considering the various factors and symptoms present in the given paragraph, Kevin is more likely to be experiencing electrolyte deficiency when compared to Darlene. Proper intervention, such as consuming sports drinks or electrolyte supplements, would be necessary to quickly restore the electrolytes in Kevin's body and prevent further complications, such as muscle weakness or a potentially life-threatening impact on his heart rate."},{"instruction":"How is \\"Firstly, the problem of Community legislation.\\" said in Finnish?","output":"To translate the phrase \\"Firstly, the problem of Community legislation\\" into Finnish, I will follow these steps: 1.

This is all lower case. Can you fix that?","output":"Certainly! Here is the revised passage with corrected capitalization: The purpose is to disseminate the knowledge of the live-bearing fishes and ensure their sustainability. Live-bearing fishes are a diverse group of aquatic organisms that reproduce by giving birth to fully-formed juveniles, as opposed to laying eggs like many other fish species. The preservation and understanding of live-bearing fishes is essential for several reasons, which can be discussed in detail below. 1. Biodiversity: Live-bearing fishes contribute to the Earth's biodiversity, and maintaining diverse ecosystems is crucial for global ecological balance. Some of the well-known live-bearing fish species are guppies, mollies, platies, and swordtails, which are commonly found in home aquariums. These fish not only enrich underwater habitats, but they also provide important ecosystem services for humans and other organisms. 2. Ecological Indicator Species: Live-bearing fishes can serve as ecological indicators, helping scientists to monitor changes in water quality and overall ecosystem health. Several live-bearing fish species are sensitive to pollution, and as such, their overall health, reproduction, and population levels can provide valuable insights into the state of the environment. 3. Fishing and Aquaculture: Many live-bearing fishes are popular in the fishing and aquaculture industries, serving as a vital source of food and income to communities around the world. Ensuring the sustainability of these fish stocks helps to secure reliable food sources for human consumption and supports the livelihoods of those involved in these industries. 4. Aquarium Hobby: As mentioned earlier, live-bearing fishes are popular additions to home aquariums. By promoting responsible fishkeeping and breeding practices, enthusiasts can help conserve these amazing fish species, ensuring that future generations can continue to enjoy them. 5. Scientific Research: Live-bearing fishes are important subjects in scientific research. They provide valuable insights into various fields, such as genetics, behavior, and evolution. For example, the guppy fish (Poecilia reticulata) has long been studied for its rapid adaptation to environmental changes and its intriguing mating behaviors. Preserving these species aids in the ongoing advancement of our knowledge pertaining to life on Earth. The dissemination of knowledge about live-bearing fishes is essential to ensure their sustainability and conservation. By raising awareness, promoting sustainable fishing practices, and supporting scientific research, we can protect these unique and fascinating organisms for generations to come. Educating the public, stakeholders, and policy-makers can lead to the development of comprehensive conservation strategies, ultimately safeguarding this important component of our Earth's biodiversity."},{"instruction":"Article: Tweet with a location You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

In the context of the question, the other options provided can be ruled out by applying basic knowledge and common sense about humans and cats: 1. Bodies: Both humans and cats possess bodies, so this cannot be the distinguishing feature. 2. Tongues: Both humans and cats have tongues, even though their textures and functions might be somewhat different. 3. Muscles: Both humans and cats have muscles, which are essential for their various movements and functions. 4. Bones: Both humans and cats have skeletal structures comprising bones for support and protection. In comparison, the presence of tails is a much more distinct feature that sets cats apart from humans and some other animals.

Liechtenstein is a small principality located in the heart of Europe, situated between Switzerland and Austria. With a total area of only 160 square kilometers (around 62 square miles), it is one of the smallest countries in the world. Despite its small size, Liechtenstein is a highly developed nation and is known for its strong economy, beautiful scenery, and historic castles. The country is predominantly mountainous, with the majority of its landscape dominated by the Alps. The eastern part of the country is relatively more flat and is where most of the population resides. Liechtenstein has a population of around 38,000, making it one of the least populated countries in Europe. The primary language spoken in Liechtenstein is German, and the country's official name is Fürstentum Liechtenstein, which translates to \\"Principality of Liechtenstein\\" in English. The nation is a constitutional monarchy, with the reigning prince, currently Prince Hans-Adam II, holding a significant amount of political power. Liechtenstein is unique in that it is one of the only two double landlocked countries in the world, the other one being Uzbekistan in Central Asia. This means that not only is Liechtenstein a landlocked country with no direct access to oceans, but it is also surrounded by countries that are landlocked themselves. In Liechtenstein's case, these surrounding countries are Switzerland to the west and Austria to the east. Both of these neighbors are landlocked, making Liechtenstein a double landlocked nation.

For roughly the billionth time, we learned this past week that politics and social media are often (always?) a toxic combo. The latest chapter in the “How not to use social media” book, which will have roughly an infinite number of entries before it’s all said and done, was written by Elizabeth Lauten, communications director for Rep. Stephen Fincher (R-Tenn.). Lauten, having watched Malia and Sasha Obama looking less than enthused at the White House’s annual Thanksgiving turkey pardoning, took to Facebook, writing in part: “Dear Sasha and Malia, I get you’re both in those awful teen years, but you’re a part of the First Family, try showing a little class. . . . Rise to the occasion. Act like being in the White House matters to you. Dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar.” Knowingly or not, Lauten violated one of the few adhered-to commandments of political Washington: Thou shalt not talk about politicians’ children. After a predictable media backlash, she apologized — via Facebook, natch. “I quickly judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager,” she wrote. Too late. By Monday, Lauten had resigned. By Tuesday, conservatives had begun attacking the press for its allegedly over-the-top coverage of a junior staffer for a backbench member — evidence, they insisted, of the media’s liberal bias. The end result of this now-familiar outrage cycle was heightened disgust — if that’s even possible — with everyone and everything in Washington. Elizabeth Lauten, for bringing us all back to high school, you had the worst week in Washington. Congrats, or something. Each week, Chris Cillizza awards the worst week in Washington to an inhabitant of Planet Beltway who stands out for all the wrong reasons.

Undefeated in battle, Alexander had conquered the Persian Empire in its entirety by 330 BC. By the time of his death in 323 BC, he had created one of the largest empires in history, stretching from Greece to India. His empire split into several kingdoms upon his death, the most famous of which were the Seleucid Empire, Ptolemaic Egypt, the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and the Indo-Greek Kingdom. Many Greeks migrated to Alexandria, Antioch, Seleucia and the many other new Hellenistic cities in Asia and Africa. Although the political unity of Alexander's empire could not be maintained, it resulted in the Hellenistic civilization and spread the Greek language and Greek culture in the territories conquered by Alexander. Greek science, technology and mathematics are generally considered to have reached their peak during the Hellenistic period.\\" Answer: A:","output":"Alexander the Great's father was Philip II of Macedon. Philip II was the king of Macedon from 359 BC until his assassination in 336 BC.

Now, let's consider the provided options: 1. Yes - This answer would imply that the sentence definitely states that the dog is trailing a leash. However, as we've analyzed, the sentence does not mention anything about a leash. 2. It is not possible to tell - This answer would mean that based on the given sentence, we cannot determine whether or not the dog is trailing a leash. Since there is no mention of the leash in the sentence, this seems like a plausible answer. 3. No - This answer states that the sentence does not suggest the dog is trailing a leash. While it is true that the sentence doesn't mention a leash, choosing \\"no\\" might lead to the conclusion that the dog is definitely not trailing a leash, which we cannot determine for sure, given the information provided in the sentence.

Usually some things have changed--new houses, new buildings, sometimes even a new road. The bus driver has a style of driving and it's fun to try to figure it out the first hour or so. If the driver is particularly daring, the ride can be as exciting as a suspense story. Will the driver pass the truck in time? Will the driver move into the right or the left-hand lane?After a while, of course, the excitement dies down. Sleeping for a while helps pass the middle hours of the ride. Food always makes bus rides more interesting. But you've got to be careful of what kind of food you eat. Too much salty food can make you very thirsty between stops. The end of the ride is somewhat like the beginning. You know it will soon be over and there's a kind of expectation and excitement in that.

Given the sentence \\"The skier is going down a large mountain.\\" is it true that \\"A skier going down a mountain.\\"? What is the step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the answer: yes?","output":"Step 1: Identify the main components of both sentences. In the first sentence, \\"The skier is going down a large mountain,\\" the main components are \\"skier,\\" \\"going down,\\" and \\"large mountain.\\" In the second sentence, \\"A skier going down a mountain,\\" the main components are \\"skier,\\" \\"going down,\\" and \\"mountain.\\" Step 2: Compare the actions in both sentences. In the first sentence, the action is \\"going down,\\" and in the second sentence, the action is also \\"going down.\\" Since both actions are the same, we can proceed to the next step. Step 3: Compare the subjects of both sentences. In the first sentence, the subject is \\"the skier,\\" and in the second sentence, the subject is \\"a skier.\\" Though the first subject uses a definite article \\"the\\" and the second subject uses an indefinite article \\"a\\", the underlying subject – the skier – remains the same. So, this part of the two sentences also matches. Step 4: Compare the objects of both sentences. In the first sentence, the object is \\"a large mountain,\\" and in the second sentence, the object is \\"a mountain.\\" Although the first sentence specifies the size of the mountain as \\"large,\\" the second sentence refers to a mountain in general. Since a large mountain is still a mountain, this part of the two sentences aligns as well. Step 5: Bring together the results of the previous steps. We have established that both sentences describe a skier performing the same action of going down and that this action involves a mountain. The only difference is the specified size of the mountain in the first sentence, but this does not change the overall meaning of the second sentence. Conclusion: Based on the step-by-step reasoning process, it is true that \\"A skier going down a mountain\\" when given the sentence \\"The skier is going down a large mountain.\\""},{"instruction":"Given the fact \\"as the available water in an environment increases , the populations of organisms in that environment will increase\\", what is the answer to the question or completion \\"If a lake begins to overflow after swelling from a storm, species within that water source likely\\" Choose from: a). propagate b). stagnate c). crash d). stall","output":"If a lake begins to overflow after swelling from a storm, species within that water source will likely propagate (option a). As the available water in an environment increases, it can create favorable conditions for many organisms. More water leads to increased resources, which promotes growth, reproduction, and proliferation of organisms. When a lake swells due to a storm, there are several factors contributing to the population increase of organisms: 1. Increased habitat: The expanded area of the water body provides more space for various species to establish their habitat. This additional space reduces competition for territories, allowing many species to thrive and reproduce. 2. More resources: As the amount of water increases, the nutrient supply and food availability also increases. When food resources are abundant, it supports a larger and diverse population of organisms. The presence of sufficient resources often leads to better nourishment, enhancing the growth and reproduction rates of these organisms. 3. Improved water quality: Storms can replenish water bodies, improving water quality by providing fresh water through precipitation. This improved water quality can enhance the living conditions for many aquatic organisms, leading to increased growth and survival rates. 4. Enhanced connectivity among ecosystems: An overflowing lake can lead to enhanced connectivity between different ecosystems, including aquatic and terrestrial habitats. This connectivity promotes the exchange of genetic material, fostering increased genetic diversity, which can further boost the populations and resilience of various species. 5. Increased sediment deposition and habitat complexity: Sediments carried by storms can be deposited in the lake, increasing nutrient availability and creating new substrates for organisms to colonize. Increased habitat complexity may provide shelter, breeding sites, and other resources that organisms need to thrive, further promoting propagation. However, it is important to note that if the lake's overflow is excessive, it can result in some negative consequences such as habitat destruction, water pollution, and increased risk of predation. These negative effects could offset some of the benefits mentioned earlier, which might cause variations in population growth among different species. In summary, when a lake begins to overflow after swelling from a storm, species within that water source are likely to have a population increase due to factors such as increased habitat, more resources, improved water quality, enhanced connectivity among ecosystems, and increased sediment deposition and habitat complexity. Therefore, option a (propagate) is the most accurate answer."},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to Finnish: In other words, if a Spanish company applies for a European patent, it will be able to use it without being discriminated against if Spain does not participate in enhanced cooperation straight away.

The company in question is launching a new technology that will enable users to have control over what information is displayed during an incoming call on phones with Caller ID features. Caller ID is a standard function on most modern devices that allow the recipient to view relevant details like the caller's name and phone number. With the introduction of this technology, users will have the ability to customize and potentially enhance their overall call experience. From a broader perspective, this innovation could have several implications for personal and business communication. For instance, users may be able to tailor their Caller ID appearances to different contacts, adding a touch of personalization to routine phone calls. Similarly, businesses may use this technology to customize their appearance on clients' Caller IDs, potentially increasing trust and recall value. Moreover, the technology could offer privacy benefits by allowing users to hide or modify their identifying information while making a call. This functionality could be particularly helpful in sensitive situations where anonymity is crucial.

The man is drunk what does he do after the bar closes? Options: - raise hell - throw up - appear ridiculous - obesity - walk off","output":"As an AI, I can't predict human behavior with certainty, but I can provide a likely outcome based on the given options. Step 1: Analyze the given options in relation to a drunk man after a bar closes. Option 1: Raise hell - This option suggests that the man might engage in rowdy behavior or cause trouble. Option 2: Throw up - This option suggests that the man might vomit, which could be a result of excessive alcohol consumption. Option 3: Appear ridiculous - This option suggests that the man might behave in a foolish or silly way due to his intoxication. Option 4: Obesity - This option seems unrelated to the drunk man's immediate actions after a bar closing and can be disregarded. Option 5: Walk off - This option suggests that the man might attempt to leave the area where the bar is located, whether walking or stumbling. Step 2: Identify the most likely actions based on the context. Given that the man is drunk, it's reasonable to assume that some level of impaired judgment or motor functions will be present. Therefore, options 1, 2, and 3 could potentially occur, depending on the individual and the extent of their intoxication. Step 3: Choose the most probable option. Of the three options deemed possible (raise hell, throw up, and appear ridiculous), it's difficult to say for sure which action the man will take. Each individual reacts differently to intoxication, and without more information, it's impossible to definitively predict his behavior. However, considering the most common reaction to excessive alcohol consumption is likely to be a combination of impaired judgment and physical discomfort, I would lean towards Option 3: Appear ridiculous. This option covers a broad range of behaviors that could result from the man's intoxication.

Step 4: Weigh the review against other factors In this step, I would consider other factors, such as the overall rating, the number of reviews, other potential issues with the product, and the price, in order to make a well-informed decision. Conclusion: Based on the given review, the chances of buying the product would likely decrease. The concerns raised by the reviewer regarding the difficulty of opening and closing the mailbox and the potential issue with its longevity could negatively affect the user experience and ultimately deter me from purchasing the product. However, the decision would depend on the overall context and other factors."},{"instruction":"Q:Information: - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows: European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity. - Ayreon is a musical project by Dutch songwriter, singer, multi-instrumentalist musician and record producer Arjen Anthony Lucassen. Ayreon's music is described as progressive rock, progressive metal and power metal sometimes combined with genres such as folk, electronica, experimental and classical music. The majority of Ayreon's albums are dubbed \\"rock operas\\" (or \\"metal operas\\") because the albums contain complex storylines featuring a host of characters, usually with each one being represented by a unique vocalist. - A bass-baritone is a high-lying bass or low-lying \\"classical\\" baritone voice type which shares certain qualities with the true baritone voice. The term arose in the late 19th century to describe the particular type of voice required to sing three Wagnerian roles: the Dutchman in \\"Der fliegende Holländer\\", Wotan/Der Wanderer in the \\"Ring Cycle\\" and Hans Sachs in \\"Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg\\". Wagner labelled these roles as \\"Hoher Bass\\" (\\"high bass\\")see fach for more details. - A choir (also known as a chorale or chorus) is a musical ensemble of singers. Choral music, in turn, is the music written specifically for such an ensemble to perform. Choirs may perform music from the classical music repertoire, which spans from the Medieval era to the present, and/or popular music repertoire. Most choirs are led by a conductor, who leads the performances with arm and face gestures. - Tenor is a type of classical male singing voice whose vocal range is one of the highest of the male voice types. The tenor's vocal range (in choral music) lies between C, the C one octave below middle C, and A, the A above middle C. In solo work, this range extends up to C, or \\"tenor high C\\". The low extreme for tenors is roughly A (two As below middle C). At the highest extreme, some tenors can sing up to two Fs above middle C (F). The tenor voice type is generally divided into the \\"leggero\\" tenor, lyric tenor, spinto tenor, dramatic tenor, heldentenor, and tenor buffo or spieltenor. - Vocal range is the measure of the breadth of pitches that a human voice can phonate. Although the study of vocal range has little practical application in terms of speech, it is a topic of study within linguistics, phonetics, and speech and language pathology, particularly in relation to the study of tonal languages and certain types of vocal disorders. However, the most common application of the term \\"vocal range\\" is within the context of singing, where it is used as one of the major defining characteristics for classifying singing voices into groups known as voice types. - Progressive rock (shortened as \\"prog\\"; sometimes \\"art rock\\", \\"classical rock\\" or \\"symphonic rock\\") is a broad subgenre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing. - Shadow Project was an alt-rock/goth metal band formed in 1987 featuring former members of Los Angeles deathrock groups Christian Death and Super Heroines. After recording two LP records the group experienced a three-year hiatus, reconvening for a third and final album. Shadow Project definitively folded after vocalist Rozz Williams committed suicide in April 1, 1998. - Thrash metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music characterized by its fast tempo and overall aggression. The songs usually use fast percussive beats and low-register guitar riffs, overlaid with shredding-style lead work. The lyrics often deal with social issues and reproach for The Establishment, using direct and denunciatory language, an approach borrowed from hardcore punk. - Eric Clayton ( born December 1 , 1967 ) is an American singer - songwriter and musician , best known for his work in the influential gothic symphonic metal group Saviour Machine which he formed with his brother Jeff Clayton in 1989 . Eric Clayton is notable for his deep baritone operatic vocals , and he has done guest vocals on Ayreon 's album The Human Equation , Divinefire 's album Glory Thy Name , Narnia 's album The Great Fall , Wedding Party 's album Anthems , and Eva O 's album Damnation ( Ride the Madness ) as well as Seventh Circle 's album \`\` The Struggle . '' Clayton also produced the two aforementioned albums as well as many Saviour Machine albums . In September 2015 he performed in The Human Equation Theater Experience by Ayreon in the Netherlands , reprising his role as \`\` Reason '' from the 2004 Ayreon - album . Clayton is known for his theatrical live performances and dark , peculiar appearances and masks . - Per Christian Liljegren (born 3 February 1971), is best known as the lead vocalist, and primary lyricist, for the Swedish Christian melodic power metal band, Narnia. - Rozz Williams (born Roger Alan Painter, November 6, 1963 April 1, 1998) was an American vocalist and musician most known for his work with the bands Christian Death, Shadow Project (with musician Eva O), and with the industrial project Premature Ejaculation. Christian Death is cited by some as a pioneer of the American gothic rock scene as well as deathrock. Williams was also involved with Daucus Karota, Heltir, and EXP; he also recorded several solo albums. - Damnation (Ride the Madness) is the 1999 studio solo album of the American deathrock veteran musician Eva O, released on the German label Massacre Records. The album was announced as the first half of a two album set, but the sequel, to be titled \\"Salvation (Are You Ready to Die?)\\", was not released. Her 2005 album \\"Damnation/Salvation\\" includes rerecorded versions of songs from this album along with the \\"Salvation (Are You Ready to Die?)\\" songs. - The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings, usually having six. The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument. - Electronica is an umbrella term that encompasses a broad group of electronic-based styles such as techno, house, ambient, drum and bass, jungle, and industrial dance, among others. It has been used to describe the rise of electronic music styles intended not just for dancing but also concentrated listening. - Delain is a Dutch symphonic metal band formed in 2002 by former Within Temptation keyboardist Martijn Westerholt, and Charlotte Wessels. The name of the band comes from the Kingdom of Delain in Stephen King's novel, \\"The Eyes of the Dragon\\". - Divinefire is a symphonic power/thrash metal group founded in the spring of 2004 by Finnish guitarist Jani Stefanovic, and Swedish singer Christian Liljegren. Liljegren is the former frontman of the band Narnia. - Christian Death is an American deathrock band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1979 by Rozz Williams. They became a highly influential act, heralding the American gothic rock and deathrock movements. - Eva Ortiz (born January 11, 1961), better known as Eva O, is a music artist most notable for her previous works in Christian Death and a band she formed with her then-husband Rozz Williams called Shadow Project. Regarded as a veteran and \\"one of the most striking figures of the American Gothic scene,\\" Eva O has had a significant influence on the emerging deathrock movement, which garnered her the \\"Queen of Darkness\\" title from the press and audience. She is known for her heavy guitar playing style and dramatic, authoritative vocals. - A baritone is a type of classical male singing voice whose vocal range lies between the bass and the tenor voice types. It is the most common male voice. Originally from the Greek , meaning \\"deep (or heavy) sounding\\", music for this voice is typically written in the range from the second F below middle C to the F above middle C (i.e. FF) in choral music, and from the second A below middle C to the A above middle C (A to A) in operatic music, but can be extended at either end. The baritone voice type is generally divided into the baryton-Martin baritone (light baritone), lyric baritone, \\"Kavalierbariton\\", Verdi baritone, dramatic baritone, \\"baryton-noble\\" baritone, and the bass-baritone. - Singing is the act of producing musical sounds with the voice, and augments regular speech by the use of sustained tonality, rhythm, and a variety of vocal techniques. A person who sings is called a singer or vocalist. Singers perform music (arias, recitatives, songs, etc.) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments. Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir of singers or a band of instrumentalists. Singers may perform as soloists, or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in art song or some jazz styles) up to a symphony orchestra or big band. Different singing styles include art music such as opera and Chinese opera, religious music styles such as gospel, traditional music styles, world music, jazz, blues and popular music styles such as pop and rock. - Arjen Anthony Lucassen (born 3 April 1960, Netherlands) is a Dutch progressive metal/rock songwriter, singer, multi-instrumentalist musician and record producer, best known for his long-running progressive opera project titled Ayreon. - Devin Garrett Townsend (born May 5, 1972) is a Canadian musician, songwriter and record producer. He was the founder, songwriter, vocalist, and guitarist in extreme metal band Strapping Young Lad from 1994 to 2007 and has an extensive career as a solo artist. - Jani Stefanovic (Born May 23, 1979) is a Swedish multi-instrumentalist that primarily plays Swedish death metal. Jani started playing around the age of 1314 years old. - The Human Equation is the sixth album from the progressive rock project Ayreon by Dutch musician Arjen Anthony Lucassen, released on 25 May 2004 via InsideOut Music. As with other Ayreon albums, it features guest appearances from several musicians previously unrelated to the project, including James LaBrie of Dream Theater, Mikael Åkerfeldt of Opeth, Eric Clayton of Saviour Machine, and Devin Townsend, performing music arranged and written by Lucassen. - Massacre Records is an independent record label based in Abstatt, Germany. - Within Temptation is a Dutch symphonic metal band founded in April 1995 by vocalist Sharon den Adel and guitarist Robert Westerholt. They have always been classified by critics as gothic metal, although the \\"gothic\\" influence varies with each album. Their most prominent and well-known sound is described as symphonic metal, although their earlier material, such as debut album \\"Enter\\", was mostly gothic metal. \\"Enter\\" even had a hint of doom metal. In an interview, Den Adel said they fell into a symphonic rock genre with various influences. In a later interview with Dutch music platform 3VOOR12, den Adel stated that \\"we consider ourselves more a symphonic rock band ... in my opinion, we are no gothic band\\". - Nightwish is a symphonic power metal band from Kitee, Finland. The band was formed in 1996 by lead songwriter and keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen, and lead singer Tarja Turunen. The band soon picked up drummer Jukka Nevalainen, and then bassist Sami Vänskä after the release of their debut album, \\"Angels Fall First\\" (1997). In 2002, Vänskä was replaced by Marco Hietala, who also took over the male vocalist role previously filled by Holopainen or guest singers. - A voice type is a particular human singing voice identified as having certain qualities or characteristics of vocal range, vocal weight, tessitura, vocal timbre, and vocal transition points (\\"passaggio\\"), such as breaks and lifts within the voice. Other considerations are physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and vocal register. A singer's voice type is identified by a process known as voice classification, by which the human voice is evaluated and thereby designated into a particular voice type. The discipline of voice classification developed within European classical music and is not generally applicable to other forms of singing. Voice classification is often used within opera to associate possible roles with potential voices. Several different voice classification systems are available to identify voice types, including the German \\"Fach\\" system and the choral music system among many others; no system is universally applied or accepted. - Progressive metal (sometimes known as prog metal or technical metal) is a fusion genre melding heavy metal and progressive rock which combines the loud \\"aggression\\" and amplified guitar-driven sound of the former with the more experimental, cerebral or \\"pseudo-classical\\" compositions of the latter. Whilst the genre emerged towards the late-1980s, it was not until the 1990s that progressive metal achieved commercial success. Dream Theater, Queensrÿche, Tool, Symphony X and Fates Warning are a few examples of progressive metal bands who achieved commercial success; additionally, many other thrash and death metal bands started to incorporate elements of progressive music in their work. Progressive metal's popularity started to decline towards the end of the 1990s, but it still remains a largely diffused underground genre with a committed fan base. - A film score (also sometimes called background score, background music, movie soundtrack, film music or incidental music) is original music written specifically to accompany a film. The score forms part of the film's soundtrack, which also usually includes dialogue and sound effects, and comprises a number of orchestral, instrumental, or choral pieces called cues, which are timed to begin and end at specific points during the film in order to enhance the dramatic narrative and the emotional impact of the scene in question. Scores are written by one or more composers, under the guidance of, or in collaboration with, the film's director or producer and are then usually performed by an ensemble of musicians most often comprising an orchestra or band, instrumental soloists, and choir or vocalists and recorded by a sound engineer. - Kevin James LaBrie (born May 5, 1963) is a Canadian vocalist and songwriter, who is best known as the lead singer of the American progressive metal band Dream Theater. - Lars Mikael Åkerfeldt (born 17 April 1974) is a Swedish musician, prominently known as the lead vocalist, guitarist, and primary songwriter of progressive death metal band Opeth, as well as being the former vocalist of death metal supergroup Bloodbath. He was also guitarist for the \\"one-off\\" band Steel, and is part of the collaboration Storm Corrosion with Steven Wilson. - Power metal is a subgenre of heavy metal combining characteristics of traditional metal with speed metal, often within symphonic context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a more uplifting sound, instead of the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in styles such as doom metal and death metal. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally \\"powerful\\" sound. The term was first used in the middle of the 1980s and refers to two different but related styles: the first pioneered and largely practiced in North America with a harder sound similar to speed metal, and a later more widespread and popular style based in Europe (especially Scandinavia, Germany, Greece and Italy), South America (especially Brazil and Argentina) and Japan, with a lighter, more melodic sound and frequent use of keyboards. - Symphonic metal is a subgenre of metal music which combines the characteristics of this genre, such as heavy drums and guitars, with different elements of classical music including symphonic instruments, choirs and on occasion, a full symphony orchestra. Keyboards reminiscent of power metal also often find a dominant place in this subgenre. Symphonic metal bands often feature classically trained female vocalists, giving rise to the nickname opera metal or operatic metal, and it is not uncommon for them to feature a second vocalist performing growls, a more common characteristic of gothic metal. Perhaps the most typical and prominent examples of symphonic metal bands are Finnish band Nightwish, Dutch bands Within Temptation, Delain and Epica, and Swedish band Therion, all four of which place a large focus on elements prevalent in film scores on top of the more basic classical components utilized more widely in the genre. - Deathrock is a subgenre of punk rock incorporating horror elements and spooky atmospherics, that emerged on the West Coast of the United States in the early 1980s. - Dream Theater is an American progressive metal band formed in 1985 under the name Majesty by John Petrucci, John Myung, and Mike Portnoy while they attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. They subsequently dropped out of their studies to concentrate further on the band that would ultimately become Dream Theater. Though a number of lineup changes followed, the three original members remained together along with James LaBrie and Jordan Rudess until September 8, 2010, when Portnoy left the band. In October 2010, the band held auditions for a drummer to replace Portnoy. Mike Mangini was announced as the new permanent drummer on April 29, 2011. - Christian metal, also known as white metal or heavenly metal, is a form of heavy metal music usually defined by its message using song lyrics as well as the dedication of the band members to Christianity. Christian metal is typically performed by professed Christians sometimes principally for Christians who listen to heavy metal music and often produced and distributed through various Christian networks. - Gothic metal (or goth metal) is a fusion genre combining the heaviness of heavy metal with the dark atmospheres of gothic rock. The music of gothic metal is diverse with bands known to adopt the gothic approach to different styles of heavy metal music. The genre originated during the early 1990s in Europe originally as an outgrowth of death-doom, a fusion of death metal and doom metal. Lyrics are generally dark and introspective with inspiration from gothic fiction as well as personal experiences. - Opeth is a Swedish heavy metal band from Stockholm, formed in 1989. The group has been through several personnel changes, but singer, guitarist and songwriter Mikael Åkerfeldt has remained Opeth's primary driving force throughout the years. Opeth has consistently incorporated progressive, folk, blues, classical and jazz influences into its usually lengthy compositions, as well as strong influences from death metal, especially in their early works. Many songs include acoustic guitar passages and strong dynamic shifts, as well as both death growls and clean vocals. Opeth is also well known for their incorporation of Mellotrons in their work. Opeth rarely made live appearances supporting their first four albums; but since conducting their first world tour after the 2001 release of \\"Blackwater Park\\", they have led several major world tours. - Saviour Machine was an American Christian metal band that formed in 1989. They have released five studio albums and two live albums on Frontline and subsequently on MCM Music, distributed through Massacre Records. Saviour Machine's music and lyrics deal with war, death, and personal introspection as it relates to prophecy and divine revelation. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - Damnation/Salvation is the 2005 studio solo album of the American deathrock veteran musician Eva O, released on the Dark Dimensions and Alice In... labels.

The premise specifies that the subjects are walking on a \\"sidewalk,\\" which is an outdoor location, whereas the hypothesis states that the event is happening \\"inside,\\" which refers to an indoor setting. Due to these differences, it is clear that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."},{"instruction":"What would someone be if he or she is not normal? Options: - unconventional - orthodox - ill - reverse - tangential Hmmm, let me think.","output":"To determine what someone would be if he or she is not normal, we can examine each option: 1. Unconventional: This term can be used to describe someone or something that does not follow conventional or traditional patterns, customs, or rules. If a person is not considered \\"normal\\" in terms of societal norms, they could be considered unconventional. 2. Orthodox: This term typically refers to someone following established or traditional customs, beliefs, or doctrines. If the person is not \\"normal,\\" it is unlikely that they would be considered orthodox, as \\"normal\\" usually implies adherence to established norms. 3. Ill: This term refers to someone who is not in good health or suffering from a physical or mental ailment. If a person is not considered normal due to a health condition, they could be described as ill. 4. Reverse: This term usually means moving, acting, or organized in a manner contrary to what is usual. It is often used in the context of actions or processes. \\"Reverse\\" doesn't fit as a description for a person who is not normal, as it does not offer an explanation for their deviation from norms. 5. Tangential: This term typically means relating to something, but only slightly connected or relevant. It is often used in the context of ideas or subjects and not usually used to describe individuals. Based on the analysis of each option, the most suitable answer would be: - unconventional: as it directly relates to someone who deviates from societal norms and expectations. Although \\"ill\\" could also describe someone who is not normal in some sense (due to health conditions), \\"unconventional\\" is more suitable because it is not limited to health-related factors only."},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to Russian: D Database Activity Auditing A system that uses the tracing capabilities of Microsoft SQL server to record all activity within an archive database.","output":"Отслеживание активности базы данных D - система, которая использует возможности трассировки Microsoft SQL Server для записи всей активности в архивной базе данных."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: The Plakobranchacea are a taxonomic family of sea slugs marine gastropod molluscs in the clade Sacoglossa.

Here's a step-by-step description of a task that will achieve this goal: Task: Design a simple tower-building challenge using wooden blocks 1. Define the objective: The objective of the tower-building challenge is to create a stable tower of wooden blocks that reaches a certain height (e.g., 1 meter) within a time limit (e.g., 10 minutes). 2. Gather materials: Choose wooden blocks with different shapes and sizes, such as rectangular prisms, cubes, and triangular prisms. Ensure that there are enough blocks for the participant to reach the target height. 3. Prepare the environment: Select a flat and stable surface where the participant will build the tower, such as a table or a hard floor. 4. Explain the rules: Tell the participant that they need to use the provided wooden blocks to build a tower that reaches the target height. The tower must remain standing for at least 10 seconds after they've added the final block. They may not use any adhesive or additional supporting materials. If the tower falls, they must start over. 5. Monitor the activity: Observe the participant as they build the tower, and take note of their strategies, problem-solving abilities, and understanding of the physical properties of the blocks. 6. Analyze the results: After the task is complete, discuss the strategies used, any difficulties experienced, and evaluate the participant's physical reasoning ability. Consider factors such as their understanding of balance, leverage, weight distribution, and block placement. This tower-building challenge requires the participant to apply their knowledge of physics, such as gravity, friction, and center of mass, in order to create a stable structure. Additionally, they must utilize their problem-solving skills and spatial awareness, making this an effective task to assess physical reasoning abilities."},{"instruction":"Answer the questions at the end based on the text.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process","output":"The supposed perturbation of hormones producing less correct insulin, causing sugars to be turned into less energy, would indirectly impact a step of the recycling process. This is because the recycling process itself is not directly affected by the hormonal imbalance or reduced energy conversion from sugars. However, the individuals who are responsible for carrying out the recycling process might be affected by this hormonal issue, leading to reduced efficiency or productivity in their ability to manage the recycling efforts. This could, in turn, have an indirect impact on the overall recycling process. In more detail, when hormones produce less correct insulin, sugars are not correctly converted into energy, which is necessary for maintaining several bodily functions, including the proper functioning of the nervous system, and providing enough energy for daily activities. This may cause fatigue, muscle weakness, and other health issues in the affected person, impacting energy reserves and ability to perform tasks. If an individual involved in the recycling process, be it a truck driver, plant worker, or someone participating in sorting and breaking down materials, experiences these health issues, it might lead to a decline in the effectiveness and speed with which they perform their duties. As a result, their capability to process recycling materials may become compromised, and the overall recycling process may experience a slowdown. Nevertheless, it is crucial to remember that this effect on the recycling process is indirect and results from the physical limitations of the affected individuals, rather than a direct issue with the recycling process itself. In conclusion, the hormone imbalance causing less efficient sugar conversion and thereby reducing energy can indirectly impact the recycling process, primarily through its effect on the individuals involved in the various stages of the recycling system."},{"instruction":"What concepts are described in the following sentence? \\"The Waterman is a pub in the riverside area which serves Italian meals with a high customer rating.\\" Return the answer as pairs of triples.","output":"Concept 1: The Waterman - Triple 1: (The Waterman, is a, pub) - Triple 2: (The Waterman, located at, the riverside area) - Triple 3: (The Waterman, has, high customer rating) Concept 2: Pub - Triple 1: (Pub, is called, The Waterman) - Triple 2: (Pub, serves, meals) - Triple 3: (Pub, is in, the riverside area) Concept 3: Riverside Area - Triple 1: (Riverside Area, contains, The Waterman) - Triple 2: (Riverside Area, is the location of, a pub) - Triple 3: (Riverside Area, has, pubs that serve meals) Concept 4: Italian meals - Triple 1: (Italian meals, are served at, The Waterman) - Triple 2: (Italian meals, are a type of, meals served at the pub) - Triple 3: (Italian meals, part of, pub's service) Concept 5: High Customer Rating - Triple 1: (High Customer Rating, is given to, The Waterman) - Triple 2: (High Customer Rating, is for, The Waterman's service) - Triple 3: (High Customer Rating, indicates, quality of the pub's service)"},{"instruction":"Here is a news article: Police say some of the sexual assaults of an 11-year-old girl occurred at this abandoned trailer house in a part of Cleveland called \\"the Hood.\\" CLEVELAND - All Maria wanted was to see her 11-year-old daughter. Weeks ago, the girl had been hushed away to a \\"safe house\\" for her own protection - after the phone calls started, and the disturbing, sexually explicit videos began surfacing in this town of 9,000 about 50 miles north of downtown Houston. Seventeen men and boys, including a middle school student and adults in their 20s, have been charged with sexually assaulting Maria's daughter, a sixth-grader, in a dingy trailer. That number could grow to 28. Last week, while hospitalized for an illness, Maria finally received a brief visit from the girl. \\"My daughter was crying and crying and hugging on me,\\" Maria said. \\"She didn't want to leave. She misses her family and wants to come home.\\" But the family's tiny gray wooden home off a long, dark forested road on the outskirts of town is no longer considered safe for the 11-year-old. Child Protective Services put the girl in a foster home for her protection and restricted her family from even speaking to her, the family said. Local officials say the attack has devastated this close-knit community, leaving many to wonder who will be charged next. There's talk that a star athlete at Cleveland High School was seen sexually assaulting the girl on the video. The son of a local school board member is involved, too. Someone has been making phone calls to Maria's house. Police fear they're coming from people seeking retribution. \\"They keep calling and asking for her,\\" said Maria, whose last name is not being printed to protect her daughter's identity. \\"They don't believe me when I say she's not here and cuss us out. They're trying to find her. This is the time when she needs us the most.\\" Music blaring Cleveland, a town whose history dates to 1836, is nestled near the picturesque Sam Houston National Forest. Timber, cattle, farming and oil fuel the town's economy. Normally a quiet place, the community recently has been in an uproar over a looming election to recall three City Council members accused of mismanagement. When the sex assault story broke wide open in recent weeks, the town gained further unwanted attention. The editor of the Cleveland Advocate, Vanesa Brashier, who has kept her hand on the pulse of this community, said, “Feelings are raw as these things keep happening and then there’s no time to heal. Our town has been in the spotlight too much lately.” Some Cleveland residents, like Kisha Williams, are critical of the 11-year-old’s parents. “Where were they when this girl was seen wandering at all hours with no supervision and pretending to be much older?” she asked. Several churches have organized special prayer events for the town. Carter Williams, 64, seated at a small card table playing dominoes inside a local grocery, does not think laying blame is the right response to the sex assault. “This is a praying time for the young men and the young girl,” Williams said. “Seems like everyone in this whole town needs some God in their life.” Inside a trailer Over the Thanksgiving holiday, retiree Joe Harrison noticed an 11-year-old girl as he walked past an abandoned trailer to play dominoes with friends in what locals call \\"the Hood.\\" He thought the girl looked older than her years with her long hair and dark makeup. She was standing near the aging brown trailer, which was partially covered by a blue tarp and had remained unoccupied since Hurricane Ike except for an occasional drug user who would sneak inside to smoke crack. Later, Harrison heard loud music blaring from that same trailer on Ross Street. But he thought the girl had already been picked up by her mother. He never realized anything horrible might have happened until weeks later when the arrests started. \\"I have a granddaughter that age and can't imagine anything like that happening to her,\\" he said. \\"Whoever did this should pay for it.\\" Cleveland police say the 11-year-old was sexually assaulted inside that trailer and a small blue house with white trim around the corner. The assaults happened Nov. 28 after a 19-year-old with prior drug convictions persuaded the young girl to leave her house and go \\"riding around\\" with him and two other young men, according to a Cleveland police officer's sworn statement. They first went to the blue house, where she was ordered to disrobe. If she refused, the statement said, she was warned other girls would beat her up and she would never get a ride back home. Soon she was having sex with multiple young men there, the statement said. Someone used a phone to invite four more men, who soon arrived. Not long afterward, the group fled through a back window when they heard a relative of one of the teens arriving at the blue house. The 11-year-old left behind her bra and panties as the group moved to the nearby abandoned trailer, where the assaults continued. As the men had sex with the girl, others used their cell phones to take photographs and video, police said. Familiar faces in video Over the next two days, the recordings went viral around school. One student who recognized the girl and several of the young men, including star athletes, in the videos, alerted school authorities and triggered the investigation. So far, 17 suspects have been charged, ranging in age from a middle-schooler to a 27-year-old. Seven are high school students, including two members of Cleveland's state-ranked basketball team. Another is the 21-year-old son of a school board member. Several have prior criminal records for drug sales, aggravated robbery and manslaughter. James D. Evans III, an attorney who represents three of the defendants, insists: \\"This is not a case of a child who was enslaved or taken advantage of.\\" Investigators note an 11-year-old can never legally give consent. On her Facebook page, the 11-year-old tells whomever she befriends that she's aware people have probably heard about her, but she doesn't care what they think. \\"If you dislike me, deal with it,\\" she wrote. Sometimes she comes across like a little girl, such as when she talks of her special talent for making \\"weird sound effects\\" and \\"running in circles\\" to overcome nervousness. But she also makes flamboyant statements about drinking, smoking and sex. Yet her vulnerability pokes through the tough veneer as she tells of \\"being hurt many times,\\" where she \\"settled for less\\" and \\"let people take advantage\\" and \\"walk all over\\" her. She vows to learn from her mistakes. While Maria said she never saw any of her daughter's Internet postings, she believes her 11-year-old might have been seeking misguided attention. Earlier signs of trouble Shortly before the video recordings surfaced at school, there was a sign of trouble. Her daughter had borrowed her father's cell phone, and afterward Maria discovered a lurid photo of a young man that had been e-mailed to it. \\"I asked about it, and she said she knew nothing. So I told her I was taking it to the police, and I did,\\" Maria said. \\"They still have the phone. And I've not heard anything back.\\" Meanwhile, not only has the girl been forced from the town where she was born, but authorities also want the entire family to relocate. \\"The police think we may be in danger. Because if they can't get my 11-year-old, they might take out their revenge on us,\\" said Maria, as extra patrols are making rounds down her street. Neither Cleveland police nor Child Protective Services would discuss the safety issue or a closed-door hearing with the family held Friday in Coldspring. State District Judge Elizabeth Coker said a gag order has been issued. Struggle for children Maria's two older daughters, who are in advanced placement classes and the band, and her 9-year-old son have all cried about being uprooted. However, the 11-year-old, who was withdrawn from Cleveland schools when the videos surfaced, is enrolled in gifted and talented classes at her new school and is \\"doing fine,\\" Maria said. Yet life for the children has been a struggle, as their father cannot find carpentry work and their mother earns very little by cleaning houses. The mortgage holder recently notified the family that they were being evicted but gave them extra time because of the family crisis. The stress has grown so intense, the 16-year-old daughter said, that her parents considered separating, while the 11-year-old is having regrets about following through with the case. But Maria wants those who stole her daughter's childhood prosecuted. She said her daughter was threatened with beatings or death if she refused to cooperate. \\"These guys knew she was in middle school,\\" Maria said. \\"You could tell that whenever you talked to her. She still loves stuffed bears.\\" cindy.horswell@chron.com ||||| There are many reasons why one might reach for a tube of lip balm.

No; b. Yes; Q: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: how is rfid tag powered Suggested answer: Some tags are powered and read at short ranges (a few meters) via magnetic fields ( electromagnetic induction ). Should I validate this answer? A:","output":"Based on the information provided, I would suggest validating the answer, as it correctly addresses the question of how RFID tags are powered. However, I would recommend expanding on the response to provide a more comprehensive view of the powering mechanisms involved in RFID tags. Here is a more detailed answer: RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tags consist of two primary types: passive and active. The power source for each type of tag differs, as explained below: 1. Passive RFID tags: These tags do not have their own power source. Instead, they draw energy from the RFID reader's electromagnetic field, as mentioned in the suggested answer. The reader generates a magnetic field when it is within close proximity to the tag, usually a few meters or less, depending on the tag's frequency and strength. Through electromagnetic induction, the tag's antenna captures the magnetic field's energy, which then powers the microchip in the tag, allowing it to transmit its stored information back to the reader. 2. Active RFID tags: In contrast to passive tags, active RFID tags have their own power source, typically in the form of a small battery. This internal power source allows active tags to have longer read ranges, increased storage capacity, and faster data transmission capabilities compared to passive tags. However, active tags are generally larger in size and more expensive than their passive counterparts due to the need for a battery. In conclusion, the initial suggested answer is correct in stating that some RFID tags are powered via magnetic fields through electromagnetic induction. However, it is essential to note that this powering mechanism applies primarily to passive RFID tags, whereas active RFID tags rely on an internal power source, usually a battery."},{"instruction":"Q: Decide the language of that sentence.

The term is used to contrast with offices at state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government and also to supranational government which deals with governing institutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government. In federal states, local government generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions. - A metropolitan borough is a type of local government district in England, and is a subdivision of a metropolitan county. Created in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972, metropolitan boroughs are defined in English law as metropolitan districts. However, all of them have been granted or regranted royal charters to give them borough status (as well as, in some cases, city status). Metropolitan boroughs have been effectively unitary authority areas since the abolition of the metropolitan county councils by the Local Government Act 1985. However, metropolitan boroughs pool much of their authority in joint boards and other arrangements that cover whole metropolitan counties, such as combined authorities. - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek. - A \\"metropolitan area\\", sometimes referred to as a \\"metro area\\" or just \\"metro\\", is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing. A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns. - Birmingham is a major city and metropolitan borough of West Midlands, England. It is the largest and most populous British city outside London, with a population in 2014 of 1,101,360. The city is in the West Midlands Built-up Area, the third most populous urban area in the United Kingdom, with a population of 2,440,986 at the 2011 census. Birmingham's metropolitan area is the second most populous in the UK with a population of 3.8 million. This also makes Birmingham the 9th most populous metropolitan area in Europe. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - A Councillor is a member of a local government council. - Females typically have a special ovipositor for inserting eggs into hosts or otherwise inaccessible places. The ovipositor is often modified into a stinger. The young develop through holometabolism (complete metamorphosis)that is, they have a worm-like larval stage and an inactive pupal stage before they mature. - Sir George Hamilton Kenrick FRES ( 1850 -- 28 May 1939 ) was an English entomologist who specialised in Lepidoptera especially those of New Guinea and he was a councillor in Birmingham . - Moths comprise a group of insects related to butterflies, belonging to the order Lepidoptera. Most lepidopterans are moths; and there are thought to be approximately 160,000 species of moth, many of which are yet to be described. Most species of moth are nocturnal, but there are also crepuscular and diurnal species. - Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \\"cut into sections\\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans. - In computing, WinG (pronounced \\"Win Gee\\") is an application programming interface that is a port of Windows 95's Device Independent Bitmaps to provide faster graphics performance on Windows 3.x operating environments, and was initially positioned as a way to help game developers more easily port their DOS games to Microsoft Windows, although it was quickly discontinued in favor of DirectX. - New Guinea (or, historically, \\"\\") is a large Island in the South West Pacific region. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists. - The Lepidoptera is an order of insects that includes moths and butterflies (both called lepidopterans). 180,000 species of Lepidoptera are described, in 126 families and 46 superfamilies, 10% of the total described species of living organisms. It is one of the most widespread and widely recognizable insect orders in the world. The term was coined by Linnaeus in 1735 and is derived from Ancient Greek (scale) and (wing). The Lepidoptera show many variations of the basic body structure that have evolved to gain advantages in lifestyle and distribution. Recent estimates suggest the order may have more species than earlier thought, and is among the four most speciose orders, along with the Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Coleoptera.

A: Answer:","output":"Some parasitic fungi are considered pests."},{"instruction":"Sentence 1: But not now. Sentence 2: But they wouldn't be leaving right now. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"To determine the truth of the second sentence based on the first, it's crucial to understand the context in which these sentences are used, as the sentences given are fairly ambiguous. The two sentences do not stipulate explicit subjects or events involved, making it difficult to define their correlation based only on the information provided. In the first sentence, \\"But not now,\\" it could imply a variety of situations postponed or not occurring at the current moment - it could apply to any event, action, or state of affairs. Likewise, the second sentence, \\"But they wouldn't be leaving right now,\\" is more specific; establishing that a group of people (they) is not departing at the present moment. However, without prior context or additional information, there is no straightforward way to connect these two sentences in a cause-effect relationship. Nonetheless, suppose the first sentence suggests a delay or postponement of an event, and this event is the departure of 'they' mentioned in the second sentence. In that case, it is certainly possible for the second sentence to be true if the first one is. If 'not now' is referred to the 'leaving' action, then the first sentence being true (the action is not happening now) would make the second sentence true (they wouldn't be leaving right now). Conversely, if the first sentence \\"not now\\" refers to something entirely unrelated to the 'leaving' in the second sentence, the truth of the first sentence wouldn't necessarily make the second sentence true. For example, if the first sentence is talking about not eating now, it doesn't affect the truth of whether 'they are leaving now or not.' In summary, the truth of Sentence 2 based on Sentence 1 depends largely on the context: if 'not now' in Sentence 1 and 'leaving now' in Sentence 2 are referring to the same event, then the second sentence is likely to be true if the first one is. In contrast, if the two sentences pertain to two completely different events, the truth of Sentence 1 does not guarantee the truth of Sentence 2."},{"instruction":"I know that the answer to the question \\"What happened to Ongjin?\\" is in \\"By mid-1950, North Korean forces numbered between 150,000 and 200,000 troops, organized into 10 infantry divisions, one tank division, and one air force division, with 210 fighter planes and 280 tanks, who captured scheduled objectives and territory, among them Kaesong, Chuncheon, Uijeongbu, and Ongjin.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose System weakened by more stress happens, how will it affect material will pass through stomach quickly. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis supposes that the digestive system may be weakened by more stress, which could potentially affect the rate at which material passes through the stomach. If this were to happen, changes in the overall digestive process could be observed. Stress can have various impacts on the human body, and the digestive system is no exception. When the body experiences stress, it triggers the release of stress hormones, such as cortisol and adrenaline, to respond to the perceived threat. This response is commonly called the \\"fight or flight\\" response. These hormones can cause a range of physiological changes like increased heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing rate. As a result, the body's main priority shifts from digesting food to addressing the source of stress. In the context of the digestive process, an increase in stress can cause the stomach to release more acid, which may result in various symptoms like heartburn, indigestion, or stomach pain. However, stress may also affect the speed at which the stomach empties its contents. In some cases, stress can cause the stomach to empty its contents more quickly than usual, which means that food might not be adequately broken down before it enters the small intestine. This rapid gastric emptying could lead to malabsorption of nutrients and poorer digestion. On the other hand, stress could also slow down the movement of food through the stomach. This is caused by the stress response's effect on the production of certain hormones responsible for the proper functioning of the digestive system. In this scenario, stress might lead to a delay in stomach emptying, causing food to sit in the stomach for longer periods. This can give rise to uncomfortable symptoms like bloating and feelings of fullness. Moreover, prolonged exposure to stomach acid might cause irritation and inflammation of the stomach lining, leading to gastritis. Besides its direct impact on the digestive process, stress has indirect effects. Stress can alter the balance of gut bacteria, known as the gut microbiota. An imbalance in gut bacteria can have far-reaching consequences on digestive health, leading to symptoms like diarrhea, constipation, or bloating. Given all these factors, it is evident that stress can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of digestion. While the perturbation hypothesis suggests that material may pass through the stomach more quickly due to stress, other possibilities, such as delayed stomach emptying and alterations in gut microbiota, are also of concern. It's crucial to address stress and maintain proper digestive health in order to avoid complications and ensure efficient digestive processes."},{"instruction":"Given those answer options, answer the question: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: OUR KITTIES LOVE THESE.

Due to its lack of fear of humans and inability to fly, the dodo was easy prey, and thus became known for its apparent stupidity. The film attempts to determine who the real \\"dodos\\" are in a constantly evolving world: the scientists who are failing to effectively promote evolution as a scientifically accepted fact, the intelligent design advocates, or the American public who get fooled by the \\"salesmanship\\" of evolution critics. The film gives equal air time to both sides of the argument, including intelligent design proponent Michael Behe and several of his colleagues. While Randy Olson ultimately sides with the scientists who accept evolution, the scientists are criticized for their elitism and inability to efficiently present science to the general public, which ultimately contributes to the spread of misconceptions.[2] The film begins by going over the history of intelligent design thought from Plato and Paley to the present-day incarnation promoted by the Discovery Institute. Olson mixes in humorous cartoons of squawking dodos with commentary from his mother and interviews with proponents on both sides of the intelligent design/evolution debate. On the intelligent design side, Olson interviews Behe, John Calvart (founder of the Access Research Network) and a member of the Kansas school board.[3] Olson also unsuccessfully tries to interview Kansas Board of Education member Connie Morris (associated with Kansas evolution hearings) and members of the Discovery Institute.

Charles Lyell recognised the implications of Wallace's paper and its possible connection to Darwin's work, although Darwin did not, and in a letter written on 1–2 May 1856 Lyell urged Darwin to publish his theory to establish priority. Darwin was torn between the desire to set out a full and convincing account and the pressure to quickly produce a short paper. He met Lyell, and in correspondence with Joseph Dalton Hooker affirmed that he did not want to expose his ideas to review by an editor as would have been required to publish in an academic journal. He began a \\"sketch\\" account on 14 May 1856, and by July had decided to produce a full technical treatise on species. His theory including the principle of divergence was complete by 5 September 1857 when he sent Asa Gray a brief but detailed abstract of his ideas. What is the answer to this question: How did Wallace claim that patterns in the distribution of species could be explained?","output":"Alfred Russel Wallace claimed that patterns in the geographical distribution of species, both living and fossil, could be explained by the principle that every new species always came into existence near an already existing, closely related species. According to Wallace's 1855 paper on the \\"introduction\\" of species, this proximity between new species and their closely related counterparts allowed for a better understanding of the distribution patterns observed in nature. Wallace's hypothesis suggested that when a new species arises, it does so in close geographic proximity to a species with which it shares numerous characteristics and traits. This idea was rooted in the belief that species evolve from common ancestors and that the emergence of new species is influenced by factors such as environmental conditions, natural selection, and genetic variation within populations. This concept of new species originating near existing, closely related species helps explain certain observable patterns in the distribution of species, as geographic barriers and other environmental factors would play a significant role in isolating populations and allowing for the development of distinct species over time. Wallace's paper caught the attention of Charles Lyell, who recognized the implications of the idea and its possible connection to Charles Darwin's work on evolution. This prompted Lyell to encourage Darwin to publish his theory in order to establish priority. Darwin, however, was hesitant to publish a short paper without providing a comprehensive and convincing account. Eventually, he began working on a full technical treatise on species, which included the principle of divergence, a concept similar to Wallace's idea that new species emerge in close proximity to other species that they share common traits with. This concept would later become central to the understanding of evolution, as Darwin and Wallace independently developed the theory of evolution by natural selection."},{"instruction":"Facts: - imagesize: frameless - party: polish people 's party - office: member of the sejm - constituency: 33 -- kielce - term start: 25 september 2005 - birth date: 1942 - name: mirosław pawlak - nationality: polish Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of mirosław pawlak .

Macdonald Mayor of Lewiston It’s time for a major overhaul of the many laws and policies dealing with confidentiality, laws that dictate how federal, state and local government are run. A person’s medical records, financial statements and other personal information should be blocked from busybodies who seek it out of curiosity. This type of information should remain protected. Recently, a friend asked if it would be possible to locate a gentleman he had known for many years and was now terminally ill. He sought to contact the man with the hope of providing him help and comfort in his final days. I called an organization I felt could locate the man. I was told, correctly, that they could not give out that information. I asked if I left my friend’s name and number, could it be passed along to the person if, in fact, they knew him. I was told, again correctly, this would not be possible. I bring this to the reader’s attention in an attempt not only to show the foolishness of these laws, but the fear they strike into the average law-abiding citizen. In Maine there is a website that lists the pension amounts received by everyone who is issued a monthly check by the State of Maine. No privacy here because this is being paid out by the State; accordingly, taxpayers have a right to know. Yet other recipients of state revenues are shielded. Yes, I am referring to those known as welfare recipients. Why are they treated differently than pensioners? (A rhetorical question). The answer: our liberal, progressive legislators and their social-service allies have made them a victimized, protected class. It’s none of your business how much of your money they get and spend. Who are you to question it? Just shut up and pay! Well, the days of being quiet are gone. We will be submitting a bill to the next legislative session asking that a website be created containing the names, addresses, length of time on assistance and the benefits being collected by every individual on the dole. After all, the public has a right to know how its money is being spent. Along with this bill, we will be resubmitting HR 368, which will bring local General Assistance into compliance with federal laws that limit General Assistance to a 60-month total lifetime benefit. Additionally, we will be submitting a bill similar to one in Massachusetts, prohibiting the state from paying benefits for any additional child born after the recipient has been accepted into General Assistance. Following up on last week’s column, these bills will be submitted to the Legislature for consideration and passage: A bill that would make it a Class E Crime for a tenant to remove or disable a fire or CO2 detector in an apartment under the tenant’s control. This would result in a fine. If a removal results in injury or death, the tenant would be charged with a Class C Crime (a felony). A city ordinance making the tenant responsible for keeping the hallway outside their apartment free of personal property and trash. We will further seek a state law that would make a tenant criminally liable if their property or trash is blocking an exit preventing passage in the hallway that results in injury or death. Lastly, we will also be seeking language to be added to the current criminal mischief statue, clearly stating that tenants who intentionally damage an apartment under their control will be held criminally liable for the damage. Next week, we will talk about our progressive liberal friends’ war on the elderly. ||||| Lewiston Mayor Robert Macdonald, a longtime critic of public assistance programs, wants to publicize the names and addresses of Mainers on welfare by creating an online registry of recipients. Writing in his regular column in the Twin City Times, a Lewiston-Auburn weekly newspaper, Macdonald said if the public can get information about people who receive public pensions, they should be able to do the same for welfare recipients. Lewiston Mayor Robert Macdonald says if the public can get information about people who receive public pensions, they should be able to do the same for welfare recipients. 2012 Associated Press file photo AP Today's Poll Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → “We will be submitting a bill to the next legislative session asking that a website be created containing the names, addresses, length of time on assistance and the benefits being collected by every individual on the dole,” he wrote. “After all, the public has a right to know how its money is being spent.” Macdonald, a Republican who is running for re-election in November, also wrote that he plans to resubmit a bill that would limit General Assistance, an emergency benefit program administered by cities and towns, to 60 months over a person’s lifetime, and another bill that would prohibit the state from paying benefits for any child born after the recipient has been accepted into General Assistance. Macdonald is not a lawmaker and would have to find a member of the Legislature to sponsor his proposals. He said he already has appealed to two lawmakers. Macdonald said in an interview Wednesday that he has no concerns about how the column might be perceived. “Go into a grocery store. They flaunt it,” he said, referring to people who receive welfare benefits. “I’m not sorry. I hope this makes people think twice about applying for welfare.” BLAMES ‘LIBERAL LEGISLATORS’ Macdonald also said that putting names and addresses out there might encourage neighbors to “make a call.” “Then we can go after all these people who are gaming the system,” he said. Asked if that might hurt other people receiving benefits, Macdonald said, “I don’t care. Some people are going to get harmed, but if it’s for the good of everybody, that’s the way it is.” The mayor, whose blunt talk has raised eyebrows before, appeared to put blame on Democrats for coddling welfare recipients. “Our liberal, progressive legislators and their social-service allies have made them a victimized, protected class,” he wrote. “It’s none of your business how much of your money they get and spend. Who are you to question it? Just shut up and pay!” He wrote that he would still keep medical records, financial statements and other personal information blocked from “busybodies who seek it out of curiosity.” A former police officer, Macdonald had no political experience when he won the mayor’s seat in 2011. He was re-elected two years later and is now seeking a third term. His challenger is Democrat Ben Chin, a former Maine People’s Alliance organizer. Chin called Macdonald’s plan a “completely political stunt.” “Mayor Macdonald has been in office for four years and he’s done nothing to lower our poverty rate and make our city better,” Chin said. “Instead, he likes to scapegoat and publicly embarrass people.” ‘GOOD AT GRABBING HEADLINES’ Chin said he wants to talk about ways to improve Lewiston – creating more affordable housing and an office of immigrant integration. “He’s good at grabbing headlines, but not at delivering and I think his supporters should look closely at that,” he said. Macdonald came under fire in 2012 when he made a comment to a documentary filmmaker that immigrants should “leave their culture at the door” when they arrive in this country. Lewiston at the time was experiencing an influx of immigrants from Somalia who were resettling in the city from Portland and other locations. Macdonald has made similar provocative comments in his weekly column in the Twin City Times. The newspaper is published by Laurie Steele, the wife of Peter Steele, Gov. Paul LePage’s communications director. The couple founded the paper in 1999. Macdonald has been a longtime ally of the governor, especially on welfare issues. Oamshri Amarasingham, public policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, said she’s never heard of a proposal like Macdonald’s online welfare registry before, but said it raises constitutional concerns. “It’s not clear to me what purpose this would serve other than to shame people,” she said.

Macdonald said that by putting names and addresses out there, it might encourage neighbours to report on \\"people who are gaming the system\\". However, critics argue that this is a violation of privacy and it is unclear what purpose this serves other than to shame people."},{"instruction":"Tweet: the hangover is soldout going on an adventure with @lilibaby. Predict the sentiment of this tweet.","output":"Step 1: Identify the key elements and emotions in the tweet - hangover is soldout: this might be interpreted as slightly negative, as the user may have wanted to attend the event or buy the product - going on an adventure: this suggests excitement, which is a positive emotion - @lilibaby: mentioning a friend indicates a shared experience, which is generally positive Step 2: Weigh the positive and negative elements in the tweet - There is one slightly negative element (hangover is soldout) and two positive elements (going on an adventure and mentioning a friend). The positive elements seem to outweigh the negative one. Step 3: Make a prediction based on the overall sentiment - Since the tweet contains more positive elements than negative and the excitement from going on an adventure with a friend seems particularly strong, I predict the sentiment of this tweet to be mostly positive."},{"instruction":"Question: Give me a possible correct answer to the question \\"what is the political system of the us?\\" Answer:","output":"The political system of the United States is a federal democratic republic. This means the U.S. is governed by representatives chosen by citizens through elections. At its core, it consists of three separate branches: the executive, the legislative, and the judicial, each of which has distinct roles and responsibilities. The executive branch is headed by the President, who is both the chief of state and the head of government. The President is responsible for implementing and enforcing laws written by Congress, and also acts as the commander-in-chief of the military. The legislative branch is bicameral, comprising the House of Representatives and the Senate, collectively known as the Congress. Congressional representatives create legislation (laws), declare war, and have the power of the purse, or control over the country's budget. The judicial branch interprets the constitutionality of laws and is made up of the Supreme Court and other federal courts. The Supreme Court acts as the final arbitrator in legal disputes and its decisions set precedents that all other courts within the US must follow. Underlying this is the U.S. Constitution, a foundational document that lays out the system of government and protects various rights of individual citizens, such as freedom of speech and religion. It is also pertinent to mention that the US political scene is dominated by two major parties - the Democrats and the Republicans. These parties have different ideological underpinnings and policy priorities which influence the nature of legislation and governance in the country. States also have their own governments, mirroring the federal structure. Governors execute state laws, while state legislatures enact them. State courts interpret these laws. The responsibilities not designated to the federal government by the U.S. Constitution fall to state governments. So, the political system of U.S. is intricate and involves multi-tiered levels of government, each with its specific duties and checks and balances. Its primary goal is to ensure democratic governance, representation of citizens, and the protection of their rights as outlined in the U.S. Constitution."},{"instruction":"Possible review types: pick from the following. *negative *positive.

The instructions say that for every kilogram of weight the child must be given 5 ml of medicine. The doctor knows that the child weighs 30 kilograms and that also the full dose has to be given in 3 equal parts. How many milligrams will each part of the dose be?. Explanation:","output":"1. To find the total amount of medicine needed for the child, we need to multiply their weight (30 kg) by the recommended dosage per kilogram (5 ml). 30 kg × 5 ml/kg = 150 ml So, the child needs a total of 150 ml of medicine. 2. The doctor needs to divide this total dosage into 3 equal parts. To do so, we will divide the total amount of medicine (150 ml) by the number of parts (3). 150 ml ÷ 3 = 50 ml 3. Therefore, each part of the dose will be 50 ml.

We want to find the value of \\"s\\" in the equation: 1824 * s - 104386 = 334 * s - 1056 * s First, let's simplify the equation by combining the terms with \\"s\\" on both sides: Step 1: Combine 334s and -1056s on the right side. 334 * s - 1056 * s = (334 - 1056) * s = -722 * s So now the equation is: 1824 * s - 104386 = -722 * s Next, let's move all the \\"s\\" terms to one side and the constant terms (the numbers without \\"s\\") to the other side: Step 2: Add 722s to both sides of the equation: 1824 * s + 722 * s = -722 * s + 722 * s -104386 (1824 + 722) * s = -104386 2546 * s = -104386 Now we have the simplified equation: 2546 * s = -104386 Finally, to find the value of \\"s\\", we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2546: Step 3: Divide by 2546: s = -104386 / 2546 Step 4: Solve for s: s = -41 So, the value of s in the equation is -41.

Answer. yes What step-by-step reasoning justifies that answer?","output":"Yes, it is true that \\"Groups of people are walking.\\" Here is the step-by-step reasoning justifying that answer: 1. Analyze the sentence: The given sentence states that \\"Two groups of people are walking by a statue.\\" 2. Identify the main action: In the given sentence, the action is that the groups of people are walking - \\"are walking\\" is the verb phrase in the sentence. 3. Focus on the subject: The sentence is talking about \\"groups of people\\" (plural) that are performing the action of walking. The number of groups (two in this case) doesn't change the fact that the groups of people are walking. 4. Simplify the sentence: We can simplify the sentence by removing the additional information, which in this case is the location \\"by a statue.\\" This leaves us with the statement \\"Two groups of people are walking.\\" 5.

Here's a breakdown of the translation: 1. \\"I'm really sorry to have to do this\\" - \\"Omlouvám se, že to musím udělat\\" In this part of the sentence, the expression of regret is translated to \\"Omlouvám se,\\" which is a polite way to apologize in Czech.

A mountain system or system of mountain ranges, sometimes is used to combine several geological features that are geographically (regionally) related. On Earth, most significant mountain ranges are the result of plate tectonics, though mountain ranges are formed by a range of processes, are found on many planetary mass objects in the Solar System and are likely a feature of most terrestrial planets. - In earth science, erosion is the action of surface processes (such as water flow or wind) that remove soil, rock, or dissolved material from one location on the Earth's crust, then transport it away to another location. The particulate breakdown of rock or soil into clastic sediment is referred to as \\"physical\\" or \\"mechanical\\" erosion; this contrasts with \\"chemical\\" erosion, where soil or rock material is removed from an area by its dissolving into a solvent (typically water), followed by the flow away of that solution. Eroded sediment or solutes may be transported just a few millimetres, or for thousands of kilometres. - A valley is a low area between hills, often with a river running through it. - The Vettones (Greek: \\"Ouettones\\") were a pre-Roman people of the Iberian Peninsula of possibly Celtic ethnicity. - A cirque (French, from the Latin word \\"circus\\") is an amphitheatre-like valley formed by glacial erosion. Alternative names for this landform are corrie (from Scottish Gaelic \\"coire\\" meaning a pot or cauldron) and cwm (Welsh for \\"valley\\", pronounced \\"coom\\"). A cirque may also be a similarly shaped landform arising from fluvial erosion. - An amphitheatre or amphitheater is an open-air venue used for entertainment, performances, and sports. The term derives from the ancient Greek (\\"amphitheatron\\"), from (\\"amphi\\"), meaning \\"on both sides\\" or \\"around\\" and (\\"thétron\\"), meaning \\"place for viewing\\". - Fluvial is a term used in geography and geology to refer to the processes associated with rivers and streams and the deposits and landforms created by them. When the stream or rivers are associated with glaciers, ice sheets, or ice caps, the term glaciofluvial or fluvioglacial is used. - The Iberian Peninsula , also known as Iberia , is located in the southwest corner of Europe. The peninsula is principally divided between Portugal and Spain, comprising most of their territory. It also includes Andorra and a small part of France along the peninsula's northeastern edge, as well as Gibraltar on its south coast, a small peninsula which forms an overseas territory of the United Kingdom. With an area of approximately , it is the second largest European peninsula, after the Scandinavian. - Castile and León (Leonese: \\"Castiella y Llión\\" ) is an autonomous community in north-western Spain. It was constituted in 1983, although it existed for the first time during the First Spanish Republic in the 19th century. León first appeared as a Kingdom in 910, whilst the Kingdom of Castile gained an independent identity in 1065 and was intermittently held in personal union with León before merging with it permanently in 1230. It is the largest autonomous community in Spain and the third largest region of the European Union, covering an area of with an official population of around 2.5 million (2011). - The Central System, Spanish and , is one of the main systems of mountain ranges in the Iberian Peninsula. 2,592 m high Pico Almanzor is its highest summit. - The Sierra de Gredos is a mountain range in central Spain that spans the provinces of Ávila, Salamanca, Cáceres, Madrid, and Toledo. It is part of the much larger Central System of mountain ranges. Its highest point is Pico Almanzor, at 2,592 metres and it has been declared a natural park by the Autonomous Community of Castile and León. The Sierra de Gredos is one of the most extensive mountain ranges of the Central System; it comprises five river valleys: the Alto Tormes, the Alto Alberche, the Tiétar Oriental, the Tiétar Occidental y la Vera, and the Valle del Ambroz. The first known inhabitants were the Vettones, a pre-Roman Celtic people. The central part of the range encomprises the Sierra de Gredos Regional Park. - The Circo de Gredos is a glacial cirque situated in the central part of the northern slope of the Sierra de Gredos ( the main range in the Sistema Central mountains in central Spain ) . It is one of the most important areas in the Parque Regional de la Sierra de Gredos . It is the most significant glacial cirque of the Sierra de Gredos , and of the entire Sistema Central , approximately 33 hectares ( 330,000 square meters ) in area . At the East edge of the cirque is the summit Pico Almanzor , the highest of the range at 2,592 meters . At the North - East edge , the bottom of the cirque , there is the Laguna Grande de Gredos at a height of 1,940 metres . Next to this lake is the mountain refuge Elola , much frequented by mountaineers who intend to climb Pico Almanzor . The cirque is within the basin of the river Tormes , a tributary of the river Duero . It is part of the Sierra de Gredos Regional Park . There is a route that leads to the cirque which is very busy with tourists and mountaineers , particularly in the summer . This path starts from parking that is known as the Plataforma de Gredos at 1,770 meters . The well defined route climbs South - West from here , and then across a grassy boggy moor to arrive at the Barrerones ( 2,210 metres ) . From here , the path descends south until reaching the Laguna Grande ( or great lake ) de Gredos , and the refuge Elola . - A cauldron (or caldron) is a large metal pot (kettle) for cooking and/or boiling over an open fire, with a large mouth and frequently with an arc-shaped hanger. - Pico Almanzor is the highest mountain in central Spain.

Yes Answer:","output":"Title: The Secrets of the Musketeers Genre: Adventure, Drama, Mystery Plot: In 17th century France, a highly skilled and cunning swordsman named Gerard (played by Jude Law) seeks vengeance against the legendary d'Artagnan (played by Chris Hemsworth), one of the members of the illustrious group known as the Three Musketeers. Gerard's pursuit begins when he discovers that d'Artagnan, now retired and no longer part of the famed trio, is in possession of a secret that could shift the balance of power in the nation. While working as a coachman for a wealthy financier, Robert Colbert (played by Ralph Fiennes), d'Artagnan comes across a letter revealing a nefarious plot against the King of France. The conspirators aim to use a secret weapon hidden in a remote monastery to overthrow the monarch and establish their rule. Determined to thwart their plans, d'Artagnan comes out of retirement to enlist the help of his former Musketeers comrades, Athos (played by Michael Fassbender), Porthos (played by Idris Elba), and Aramis (played by Matthias Schoenaerts). As the adventurous quartet sets out on their swashbuckling journey to uncover the location of the weapon, Gerard follows their every move. Obsessed with besting d'Artagnan and driven by his personal vendetta, Gerard secretly sabotages the group's progress while steadily gaining their trust as a reliable informant. Events escalate as Gerard sabotages the group multiple times, driven by his thirst for revenge. In an unexpected twist, d'Artagnan discovers Gerard's true identity and motive through a series of enigmatic events, including finding a portrait of Gerard and his family brutally killed on the order of the previous monarch. Realizing that Gerard blames d'Artagnan for not preventing the murder, d'Artagnan confronts him in a dramatic showdown, revealing that he himself was unaware of the atrocity and had even helped bring justice to the ones responsible. While d'Artagnan and Gerard engage in an intense duel, the other three Musketeers race against time to stop the weapon's activation. Upon realizing that the financier, Colbert, is the mastermind behind the conspiracy, they confront him in a climactic battle at the monastery that results in the destruction of his weapon and capture of his henchmen. Simultaneously, Gerard and d'Artagnan's duel concludes when they both realize the futility of fighting each other. Instead, they draw strength from their shared integrity and commitment to protect the Kingdom. In unison, they return to the rest of the group and together, bring Colbert to justice and expose the corruption he has spread throughout France. The film ends with a heartfelt scene as Gerard, now absolved of his resentment towards d'Artagnan, joins the fabled Four Musketeers. Together, they renew their pledge to protect the crown and the people of France, taking up the mantle as the guardians of the nation."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

The cross-beams remained, after which he'd finally be done. He took a white handkerchief from his shirt pocket and wiped his forehead. The task had been lengthened considerably, although Justin refused to admit it, by incessant thinking, an activity which often stopped him with his hammer in mid-air. But now, he would soon be able to think all he wanted from the comfort of his porch as the cattle wandered from shade to shade. After he bought some cattle, he reminded himself. Under the entirely blue vault of sky, Justin felt something pass between himself and the morning sun. His leathered face turned up to see nothing but ubiquitous light, curving toward him in all directions. He arched his aging back, feeling the popping and hating it more than usual, before wiping his neck and replacing the handkerchief. He had that feeling that he'd better drink something and sit down or he'd end up in that damn hospital again. Twice last year, whether he needed it or not, he went in for a check-up, and twice a year, some intern treated him like the village idiot. Truth be told, everyone who knew about him had treated him that way for nearly eleven years, except his niece.

Carl Wayne Anderson is a homeless, deaf-mute Vietnam veteran accused of murdering Elizabeth Quinn, a file clerk at the Justice Department. Kathleen Riley is the beleaguered Federal Public Defender assigned to represent Anderson. An agribusiness lobbyist who normally works on Capitol Hill, Eddie Sanger, is made a member of the jury and begins investigating the details of the murder himself, eventually teaming up with Riley to solve the case. We see some early scenes of Sanger's work as a lobbyist on Capitol Hill, including his efforts to win passage of a bill by seducing a Congresswoman. While not relevant to the movie's plot, these scenes are establishing shots giving us a sense for Sanger as a charming, though somewhat ruthless, person.The movie begins around Christmas with the suicide of a United States Supreme Court Justice, for which no explanation or context is given. We only see the Justice making a tape recording and then shooting himself. Shortly after the Justice's suicide, Elizabeth Quinn's body is found floating in the Potomac river, and Carl Wayne Anderson is arrested for the crime, based almost entirely on the fact that he was found sleeping in Quinn's car, which was abandoned in the parking lot where she worked (and was mostly deserted at night). Anderson explains that he found it unlocked and was just looking for a warm place to sleep since it was the dead of winter. But since he was homeless, had no alibi, and was found in Quinn's car, he was arrested for her murder. The establishing scenes show Riley trying to communicate with Anderson and realizing that he is a deaf-mute. Over time, she begins to penetrate his hard exterior and he tries to cooperate with her efforts to mount a defense for him.In the District of Columbia, all crimes are tried in the federal courts, so a murder trial that would normally be in state court was in federal court instead.

Step 2: Check for traffic I will check if the truck is moving or stationary to further assess if the child is in any potential danger. Step 3: Observe the child I will observe whether or not the child is aware of the truck's presence to determine if he might accidentally step into its path.

You can go to your local craft store, convenience store, or office depot to find more paper clips if you ran out. Use different color paper clips to make your hoop piercing more creative. Depending on how thick you want your piercing, you may want to use multiple paper clips. Two paper clip hoops can be placed together to create a thicker hoop. With one pair of flat nose pliers, pull the paper clip out of its original shape. Then use the pliers to help you straighten it out completely by pulling each end flat. Cut the straightened paper clip using scissors or diagonal cutting pliers, if you want to make it smaller. The length of the straightened paper clip will affect the size of the hoop piercing. The size of the cylinder object depends on how wide you want your hoop piercing. Pens, markers, and highlighters can work for this step. Take one end of your straightened paper clip and curve it around your cylinder object. Roll the object to make the entire straightened paper clip curved into a hoop. Depending on how long your straightened paper clip was, you may have to gently pull apart the ends of your “hoop” so you have a gap for your skin. Figuring out where you want your piercing will help you decide how wide of a gap to leave between the two ends of the paper clip, so your skin can fit inside. Hoop piercings are usually worn on the lip, nose, septum, or eyebrow. Apply a small amount of eyelash glue to the ends of the paper clip(s). Eyelash glue is the best adhesive for fake facial piercings because it is already made for the skin, so it will last the longest and not be harmful. Choose an eyelash glue with a small applicator. Let the glue set on the ends for 20-30 seconds before applying to the skin. Tweezers are the most effective when handling paper clips. You will be able to hold them steady and not get any glue on unwanted areas of your face. Place your paper clip hoop where you want your piercing.","output":"This article teaches you how to make fake hoop piercings using paper clips, tools, and eyelash glue, so you can wear them on your face without actually getting pierced."},{"instruction":"Q: You are given a sentence in Arabic. Your job is to translate the Arabic sentence into Spanish. إنه في الواقع... A:","output":"Es en realidad..."},{"instruction":"Q: Is the following statement true? \\"Homer invented the catapult and used it to defend Carthage against the invading Mongol Hordes.\\" A: no Explain how we arrive at this answer:","output":"The statement is not true, and there are several reasons why we arrive at this answer: 1. Homer: Homer was an ancient Greek author and poet, who is credited with composing the works, the Iliad, and the Odyssey. He lived around the 8th century BCE, long before the invention of the catapult. He was not an inventor or an engineer who could have been involved in the creation of military technology like the catapult. 2. The catapult: The catapult is believed to have been invented by the ancient Greeks around the 4th century BCE, as documented in the writings of the engineer Philo of Byzantium. This is centuries after Homer's time. While there is some dispute over when exactly the catapult was first used, it is clear that Homer could not have been involved in its invention. 3. Carthage: Carthage was an ancient city-state located in modern-day Tunisia, North Africa. It was founded by Phoenician settlers in the 9th century BCE and became a powerful rival to Rome during the Punic Wars. Carthage and its civilization existed long before the invention of the catapult and had no connections with Homer or ancient Greece. 4. Mongol Hordes: The Mongol Empire was established in the 13th century by Genghis Khan. It rapidly expanded and became one of the largest empires in history, spanning from Europe to Asia. The Mongols had no direct involvement or conflict with Carthage, as Carthage was already destroyed by Rome in 146 BCE during the Third Punic War, over a thousand years before the Mongol Empire existed. In conclusion, the statement is false because Homer was not an inventor and lived centuries before the invention of the catapult. Additionally, Carthage and the Mongol Horde had no historical relationship, as they existed in different time periods and locations."},{"instruction":"What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the character whose loyalty is tested by a former boss? from the following article ?

One day, we went on a trip. It was all fun and games and laughing. I had the best time of my life. We were walking on the beach of a lake during sunset. We were talking and suddenly, I felt her tone getting more and more depressed. At some point, she concluded that “we need to take a break.” Trying to understand her arguments for that, the break turned into a breakup. Now, one-week-into-a-relationship-with-awesome-girl me couldn’t handle this sudden change of affairs. I spent weeks reliving this day, especially the conversation on the beach, and trying to figure out where it went wrong. I even got into an episode of mania. Having to see her every day in college was torture. It was probably the worst breakup in my life. I seriously considered transferring to another university. Several weeks into the breakup, I decided, with the aid of my friends, that I have to move on. To be honest, I relapsed a lot. One time, I actually sat down with her and said I still have feelings for her. What really helped me to get out of this was the thing I hated the most at that time: taking a break. I avoided her, in real life and on social media, and eventually, I forgot that she even existed. I developed new hobbies and made new friends. Now, I healed properly and we’re back to being friends (Yes, it’s possible to stay friends with your ex).

Burger King Brand proposed on Monday, and Joel Burger and Ashley King accepted. The company is paying the expenses and providing gifts for the July 17 wedding of Joel and Ashley in Jacksonville, aka the Burger-King nuptials. Friday's column was about how Joel and Ashley have been Burger-King since they were in the fifth grade together in New Berlin. When they announced their engagement this spring, they had their picture taken next to the BK restaurant logo in Springfield. They flipped their names so that Joel's would be first in the announcement. Normally the woman's name is first. But then it wouldn't have been Burger-King, would it? Friday's column was pretty well-read locally. And then it went viral. The New York Daily News posted it. The Huffington Post reposted it. Soon I was hearing from BuzzFeed, the Daily Mail in the U.K. and a producer from Australia’s #1 Radio Show, which happens to be The Kyle and Jackie O Show. (But, then, you knew that.) They all wanted to contact Joel and Ashley. The media crush is threatening to become overwhelming. It will only gain momentum now that Burger King is on board and will be promoting the Burger King, Burger-King connection nationally. I hope it stays fun for Joel and Ashley. \\"Oh my God, it's going to be crazy,\\" Ashley said. She knew over the weekend that the column had gone viral. She said, sure, they'll talk with Australia's number one radio show. I expect more will be calling. > UPDATE (April 8, 10:15 a.m.): Burger King has released a video about the couple on YouTube: This all began innocently enough with SJ-R business editor Tim Landis. He spotted the unique Burger-King engagement announcement and photograph in the Chatham Clarion. He put it on my desk in case I thought it could make a column. For my part, all I had to do was recognize it as one. Since Ashley had already tried to reach out to the Burger King company, but unsuccessfully, I sent an email to the company's media relations representative. I soon heard from Alison Brod Public Relations in New York City, the company that has the Burger King account. I sent them an email about the wedding, they contacted the company, and Burger King took it from there. Which culminated Monday afternoon when Joel and Ashley got the big news from Burger King via Skype. The connection was between New Berlin and New York City and we can't say that very often, can we? Ashley's dad, Vince King, was there to help celebrate, as was Joel's mom, Cindy Burger. \\"When we heard about the happy, Burger-King couple, we felt an overwhelming urge to celebrate their upcoming marriage,\\" said Eric Hirschhorn, Burger King Brand spokesman. \\"On so many levels it felt like fate; they found each other and their story found us.\\" The company, as we say in the newspaper business \\"buried the lede\\" when giving Joel and Ashley the news Monday afternoon. Burger King didn't tell them they were picking up the tab for the wedding until near the end. It was a huge surprise. \\"We were just blown away,\\" Joel said. \\"We were shaking,\\" Ashley added. Shaking and blown away and crying, but in a good way. Since Friday's column described how the Burger-King name was given Joel and Ashley by a motivational speaker who used yo-yos at a fifth-grade assembly, the Burger King company is providing personalized yo-yos to the wedding guests. The company also is providing gift bags, Mason Jars and Burger King crowns, all personalized for Joel and Ashley's wedding. But paying for the entire thing is huge. \\"We knew deep in our hearts that we wanted to honor the union of Mr. Burger and Ms. King,\\" says Hirschhorn. \\"In an unforgettable way. Everyone at Burger King Brand agreed and, as Dave Bakke said, we knew we wanted to create a 'whopper of a wedding' that's uniquely their own. \\"And now we hope we've swept them off their feet.

Elizabeth Masterson, a young emergency medicine physician whose work is her whole life, is in a serious car accident while on her way to a blind date. Three months later, David Abbott, a landscape architect recovering from the sudden death of his wife, moves into the apartment that had been Elizabeth's, after 'discovering' it in what seems to be a fateful happenstance. Elizabeth's spirit begins to appear to David in the apartment with ghostly properties and abilities that make it clear that something is not right. She can suddenly appear and disappear, walk or move through walls and objects, and once takes over his actions. When they meet, they are both surprised, as Elizabeth is still unaware of her recent history and refuses to think she is dead. David tries to have her spirit exorcised from the apartment, but to no avail. Since only David can see and hear her, others think that he is hallucinating and talking to himself. David and Elizabeth begin to bond, as much as that is possible, and he takes her out of town to a beautiful landscaped garden he designed. Elizabeth tells him she senses she has been there before, and in fact, the garden was something she was dreaming of in the opening scenes of the film, where she was awakened by a colleague from cat-napping after working a 23-hour shift in the hospital. Together, assisted by a psychic bookstore clerk, Darryl, Elizabeth and David find out who she is, what happened to her, and why they are connected. She is not dead, but in a coma, her body being kept on life support at the hospital where she used to work. When David discovers that in accordance with her living will, she will soon be allowed to die, he tries to prevent this by telling Elizabeth's sister, Abby, that he can see her and what the situation involves.

The words \\"nervy\\" and \\"memorable\\" have generally positive connotations and can be interpreted to describe a movie from a favorable perspective. The term \\"nervy\\" is commonly used to describe something that is bold or shows a willingness to take risks. In the context of a movie, such a description may refer to its innovative or unconventional approach to storytelling, direction, or performance.

Similarly, the term \\"memorable\\" is frequently used to indicate something that is worth remembering or leaves a lasting impression on the viewer. This implies that the movie is impactful and resonates with audiences, either through its emotional depth, visual style, or strong performances. Being \\"memorable\\" is an important quality in any film, as it highlights the movie's ability to remain relevant and spark conversation or thought beyond the viewing experience itself.

This occurred mainly during times of persecution against Christians, when they were used as scapegoats for various societal issues or seen as a threat to traditional Roman religious practices. One of the most well-known instances of Christians being thrown to wild beasts and killed for entertainment in the Roman arenas was during the reign of Emperor Nero following the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD. Nero blamed the Christians for the fire to divert attention from rumors that he had secretly ordered the fire. As a result, many Christians were arrested, tortured, and killed, often being fed to wild animals in the Roman Colosseum and other arenas as a form of public spectacle. There were other periods of persecution against Christians as well, such as during the reigns of Emperors Decius and Diocletian in the 3rd century AD. During these times, Christians were again subjected to various forms of torture and execution, including being thrown to wild animals in the arenas or forced to fight as gladiators. It's important to note that not all Roman Emperors were hostile to Christians, and the persecution of Christians varied in intensity throughout the history of the Roman Empire.

Solve this instance: Paragraph- Sent 1: The Legal Services Corp. (LSC), a quasi-governmental agency that provides legal aid for the poor, would receive 329 million in fiscal 2004 under President Bush's proposal - the same amount requested in 2003 and approved for 2002 and 2001. Sent 2: If approved, the hold-the-line request for LSC means its budget would erode with inflation for another year, but it could be worse for the organization: Many conservatives fought for years to do away with the LSC altogether, saying legal services attorneys were spending too much time fighting for liberal causes or pursuing politically charged cases against the government instead of representing the needy. Sent 3: Opposition to the organization has cooled since 1996, when Congress approved restrictions (PL 104-134) on the sorts of cases federally funded legal aid attorneys can take. Sent 4: (1996 Almanac, p. Sent 5: 5-36) Republicans cut the organization's budget deeply in 1996, but its funding has recovered slowly. Sent 6: Last month, in the omnibus spending bill for fiscal 2003, the Senate added a onetime increase of 19 million, which, if approved in the final version, would bring the LSC budget to 348 million. Sent 7: The money would go to help states, such as Michigan and Ohio, that lost money when the organization redistributed its funding based on census counts made in 2000 of poor households. Sent 8: If the extra money survives a conference with the House and makes it to the president's desk, LSC supporters may try to include it in the organization's fiscal 2004 funding. Sent 9: The federal government began funding some programs to provide legal assistance to the poor in the late 1960s; the Legal Services Corporation was created in 1974 (PL 93-355). Sent 10: LSC gives nearly all its money to state and local agencies, which provide civil legal assistance to those whose income is less than 125 percent of the federal poverty level - 11,075 a year for an individual and 22,625 for a family of four. Sent 11: Funding for legal services goes to defend needy clients in domestic violence cases, custody cases and other such matters, according to LSC. Sent 12: Since 1996, lawyers who receive money from Legal Services have been prohibited from such activities as lobbying legislatures, filing class-action suits, participating in political demonstrations or strikes, pursuing abortion-related litigation, representing illegal aliens or prisoners, or defending public housing tenants evicted because they were charged with selling drugs.

However, the incorrect answer is close to the correct answer, posing a challenge for students to distinguish between the two. Part #3: Prevent those who skip the paragraph from answering the question. Usage: The current budget of the LSC is 390 million, and with the onetime increase, it will be 409 million. Explanation: This response is incorrect and not closely related to the actual figures mentioned in the paragraph. Therefore, if someone skips the paragraph, they might find this answer plausible. Part #4: Incorrect answer should not be trivial, i.e., they should not be easily eliminated without reading the paragraph. Usage: The current budget of the LSC is 100 million, and with the onetime increase, it will be 190 million. Explanation: This response is incorrect, but the numbers are so far off from the actual figures that they might be easily eliminated without even reading the paragraph, making it a trivial option."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"fast and lightweight BUT can't move song progress bar to bottom doesn't play automatically whole folder when you tap on first song in folder view and few other annoyances\\" Answer:","output":"To rate this review, I will analyze the pros and cons mentioned and assign a score. 1.

But here's a tip: You'd be wise not to expect much gratitude from them for what they receive. Gratitude can make us happier, healthier, and even fitter. But do the kids show their gratitude for the stuff we buy them? All the research I've done has convinced me that it won't happen. One mom told me that when she asked her 16-year-old son to thank her for buying him a cellphone, he said, \\"But that's what moms should do.\\" From a teenager's angle, it's a parent's responsibility to take care of the family. According to Dunham, Yale's assistant professor of psychology, \\"When teenagers code it that way, a gift is no longer something given freely and voluntarily\\"--it's just mom and dad living up to their obligation. Parents do have the right to demand good manners and children should thank sincerely whoever gives them something. But kids can't know how blessed they are unless they have a basis for comparison. And they don't learn that by a parent complaining that they're ungrateful. We need to give our children the gift of a wider world view. Show by example that gratitude isn't aboutstuff--which ultimately can't make any of us happy anyway.It's about realizing how lucky you are and paying your good fortune forward. You can collect all the charitable appeals and sit down together with the kids to go through them. You set the budget for giving and the kids decide how it's distributed. Once the conversation about gratitude gets started, it's much easier to continue all year. Also you can set up a family routine at bedtime where kids describe three things that have made them grateful. When kids go off to college, you can text them a picture each week of something that inspires your appreciation. Teaching children to focus on the positive and appreciate the good in their lives is perhaps the greatest gift we can give them. And we can all learn together that the things that really...

A:","output":"Children's response when receiving gifts from their parents can vary, but it is often observed that they may take their parents' gifts for granted. This is because teenagers might view it as their parents' responsibility to provide for them, and thus may not always express gratitude. So, the answer is \\"yes\\" - they sometimes take their parents' gifts for granted. However, parents can teach them gratitude by setting examples and engaging in meaningful conversations about appreciation and giving."},{"instruction":"Question: I've had two. Both happened in Newport RI when I was in the US Navy. First, I lived in a cottage that was in an old motel. It had a cottage in front where the landlady lived and there were ten little cottages in a half-moon configuration around it. Ours was a party place and we didn't have a phone. This was in the early 1970's. The landlady was in her 50's I'd guess. The only phone was a pay-phone outside her cottage and it was o party line with her phone. When we used it, she would try to listen, especially if we were talking to a girl. We could tell and sometimes we'd ask he to hang up, but other times we'd talk about sexy stuff and let her listen. We could hear her breathing heavy when we did. When we'd be parting, she'd come to the door wearing sexy clothes that were completely inappropriate and want to be invited in. Though we were a bunch of horny sailors, no one wanted any part of that. We never let her come in. I got married and moved into an apartment that was three rooms in a huge old house. They closed that Navy base and all of the sailors were transferred elsewhere. There were bumper-stickers that said, \\"Will the last sailor to leave, please turn out the lights.\\" In those days, Newport was a small town that leached off of sailors. My landlord said that when my wife and I were completely out and it was completely clean, he'd refund my deposit. We left the apartment immaculately clean and he wouldn't refund my deposit.

A grand jury has already been impaneled in Virginia to investigate Michael Flynn and his work in the private sector on behalf of foreign interests. The new grand jury apparently will focus on Russia and the 2016 election and, quite possibly, on claims of obstruction of justice. The existence of the D.C. grand jury is a sure sign that Mueller is pressing hard. As one expert told the Journal: This doesn’t mean [Mueller] is going to bring charges, but it shows he is very serious. He wouldn’t do this if it were winding down. It didn’t require the impaneling of the new grand jury to tell us this, though. We already knew it from the way Mueller has staffed this case — excessively and with plenty of Hillary-supporting Democrats. Indeed, the Journal also reports that Mueller recently added Greg Andres, a top partner in a big New York law firm, to his team. Andres is a former top Justice Department official who also oversaw the criminal division of the U.S. attorney’s office in Brooklyn. No one believes he would leave his law firm to participate in a low-level, short-lived investigation. The impaneling of the new grand jury means that Mueller’s team will be subpoenaing records and taking testimony from witnesses. This process likely will tip off Trump’s legal team where the investigation is headed and whether it has taken on what the president views as the characteristics of a witch hunt. Trump will then be in a better position to decide whether to fire Mueller. For example, Trump told the New York Times that if Mueller looks at his finances and those of his family “unrelated to Russia” this would cross a “red line.” If the grand jury probe goes in this direction, Trump will be sorely tempted to cut it off. I will be sorely tempted not to blame him. For now, the Trump administration is saying politically correct things. Ty Cobb, special counsel to the president, said “the White House favors anything that accelerates the conclusion of his work fairly [and]. . .is committed to fully cooperating with Mr. Mueller.” This could change on a dime, as anyone who has been following the Trump presidency, even casually, knows. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. / Updated By Ali Vitali WASHINGTON — More than eight months after winning the election, President Donald Trump on Thursday declared Hillary Clinton's defeat \\"the greatest loss in the history of American politics,\\" while painting the Russia investigation as a \\"total fabrication\\" by Democrats to distract from their failure to win the White House and lack of message. \\"The reason why Democrats only talk about the totally made-up Russia story is because they have no message, no agenda and no vision,\\" Trump told a raucous crowd of supporters gathered for a campaign rally-style event in Huntington, West Virginia. The president called probes into alleged collusion between his campaign and Russia during the 2016 election \\"demeaning\\" and \\"fake.\\" \\"Most people know there were no Russians in our campaign — there never were,\\" Trump said. \\"We didn't win because of Russia. We won because of you, that I can tell you.\\" \\"Have you seen any Russians in West Virginia or Ohio or Pennsylvania?\\" Trump continued, listing states he won last year before quizzing the crowd: \\"Are there any Russians here tonight? Any Russians?\\" The president had another target in mind for those looking to investigate something: Hillary Clinton's missing emails. \\"What the prosecutors should be looking at are Hillary Clinton's 33,000 deleted emails,\\" Trump said, prompting chants of \\"Lock her up! Lock her up!\\" from the crowd, a common occurrence during the 2016 campaign. Democrats, he said, \\"can't beat us at the voting booths so they're trying to cheat you out of the future and the future that you want.\\" President Donald Trump holds a sign as he arrives at a rally on August 3, 2017, in Huntington, West Virginia. Carlos Barria / Reuters Just as during the campaign Trump primed his supporters to doubt the election results if he lost — he repeatedly deemed the system then as \\"rigged\\" — the president planted seeds of doubt about the integrity of the investigations into Russian meddling. \\"I just hope the final determination is a truly honest one, which is what the millions of people who gave us our big win in November deserve and what all Americans who want a better future want and deserve,\\" Trump said. His fiery rebuke comes hours after a report that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has impaneled a grand jury in Washington to investigate alleged ties between the campaign and Moscow. The president's personal lawyer, John Dowd, told NBC News that \\"with respect to news of a federal grand jury being impaneled, we have no reason to believe President Trump is under investigation.\\" Making good on a promise earlier in the day for a \\"big announcement\\" during the rally, Trump invited West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a Democrat, on stage for a \\"very, very large announcement\\" — a point the president drove home by gesturing with his hands to show the governor’s size. Supporters cheer as President Donald Trump speaks during a Make America Great Again Rally on August 3, 2017 in Huntington, West Virginia.

The president lamented the unsuccessful attempts as \\"incredible,\\" and demanded of lawmakers, \\"You have to do it. Nothing in life is easy, but Congress must not give in.\\" \\"Call everybody,\\" Trump told the crowd. \\"Get them to have the guts to vote to repeal and replace Obamacare — which is a disaster.\\" ||||| WASHINGTON — Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russia’s attempts to disrupt last year’s presidential election, has issued subpoenas from a Washington-based grand jury in recent weeks, according to several lawyers involved in the case. At least some of the subpoenas were for documents related to the business dealings of Michael T. Flynn, the retired general who briefly served as President Trump’s national security adviser. Mr. Flynn is under investigation for foreign lobbying work, as well as for conversations he had during the transition with Sergey I. Kislyak, who was Russia’s ambassador to the United States. Mr. Mueller’s team is broadly investigating whether any Trump associates colluded with the Russian government in its attempts to disrupt the election. It is unclear whether the subpoenas issued in recent weeks relate to other members of Mr. Trump’s campaign who have been a focus of the Mueller investigation, including Paul J. Manafort, the former campaign chairman. A grand jury based in Alexandria, Va., began issuing subpoenas in the Flynn case months ago. Mr. Mueller took over the investigation in May and assembled a team of prosecutors in an office in downtown Washington. Mr. Mueller has not impaneled a special grand jury, the lawyers involved in the case said, and has decided instead to use one of several grand juries that regularly sit in Washington. ||||| The increased financial focus hasn't gone unnoticed by Trump, who warned Mueller, via an interview with The New York Times , that his financial dealings were a red line that investigators shouldn't cross. But the order establishing the special counsel makes clear Mueller is authorized to investigate any matters that \\"arose or may arise directly from the investigation.\\" In response to this CNN story, the President's attorney, Jay Sekulow, said, \\"President's outside counsel has not received any requests for documentation or information about this. Any inquiry from the special counsel that goes beyond the mandate specified in the appointment we would object to.\\" In 2015, the FBI began investigating cyber breaches targeting US political organizations, including the Democratic National Committee. In the summer of 2016, US intelligence agencies noticed a spate of curious contacts between Trump campaign associates and suspected Russian intelligence, according to current and former US officials briefed on the investigation. James Comey, in his Senate testimony, said the FBI opened an investigation into Trump campaign-Russia connections in July 2016. The strands of the two investigations began to merge. In the months that followed, investigators turned up intercepted communications appearing to show efforts by Russian operatives to coordinate with Trump associates on damaging Hillary Clinton's election prospects, officials said. CNN has learned those communications included references to campaign chairman Paul Manafort. A year later, the FBI is reviewing financial records related to the Trump Organization, as well as Trump, his family members, including Donald Trump Jr., and campaign associates. They've combed through the list of shell companies and buyers of Trump-branded real estate properties and scrutinized the roster of tenants at Trump Tower reaching back more than a half-dozen years. They've looked at the backgrounds of Russian business associates connected to Trump surrounding the 2013 Miss Universe pageant. CNN could not determine whether the review has included his tax returns. In recent weeks, investigators have also started looking into the June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower and how the White House responded to news of that meeting. The session included Trump Jr., Manafort, Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, and a Russian attorney. Trump has denied any collusion and maintains that his business empire has \\"no involvement with Russia\\" and that he has \\"no loans, no nothing\\" from Russia. His lawyers have detailed a few exceptions, including the Miss Universe pageant he held in Moscow and the Florida mansion he sold to a Russian oligarch in 2008. Trump earned more than 100 million from those deals, according to his lawyers. \\"This is like any investigation,\\" says one person briefed on the probe. \\"You start at the core and then move to the periphery. You have to explore the finances. Where this is going is no different from any investigation.\\" The Mueller Team Since his appointment in May, Mueller has quietly gathered a team of more than three dozen attorneys, investigators and other staff in a nondescript office in Washington. Officials familiar with the probe describe it as akin to a small US attorney's office, with FBI agents and prosecutors assigned to separate groups looking into various aspects of the investigation. These include groups of investigators and lawyers focused separately on Russian collusion and obstruction of justice, as well as the investigations focused on Manafort and former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, according to a US official briefed on the investigation. Some of the investigators have been pulled from field offices across the country to join the Mueller team in Washington. Others left high-paying jobs at law firms. Many of the investigators have backgrounds in investigating fraud and financial crimes. There are 16 attorneys assigned to the probe, according to a spokesman for Mueller. Mueller reports to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, but there's a measure of separation from Justice Department headquarters to keep the probe independent. CNN has learned some of the investigators involved in the probe are buying liability insurance out of concern they could become targets of lawsuits from those who are being investigated, according to one of the people familiar with the probe. The Justice Department covers legal fees for employees sued in the course of their duties, but some of the lawyers want extra protection. The Justice Department and special counsel's office both declined to comment on the liability concerns. Bait and Switch The possible financial ties between Trump and Russia were part of the concerns for US intelligence and law enforcement officials from the beginning, according to one current law enforcement official and one former US intelligence official. In some cases, the FBI was pursuing others who did business with the Trump organization, including alleged mobsters who controlled key contractors used by many real estate developers in New York during the 1980s. The flow of Russian money in real estate -- and concerns that some buyers were making the purchases to illegally launder money -- had also drawn some attention by US authorities to the Trump business. The international real estate business is a part of the global economy where foreigners can still use cash with fewer questions asked about the sources of money. Terrorism financing concerns long ago put more stringent rules on banking and other businesses. But the rules are looser in the business of buying and selling high-end real estate, US officials say. Investigators are looking both at whether financial laws were broken and whether there are any dealings that could put the President or his associates in a compromising position. \\"There's always been a concern about his exposure to blackmail in his financial dealings,\\" says the person briefed on the investigation. Trump has repeatedly insisted that he has no enduring financial ties to Russian interests. But some of the people who are now under scrutiny by Mueller see a bait and switch. Instead of collusion, many believe the Mueller probe will instead end up being about past financial troubles. \\"They launch an investigation into collusion in the election,\\" says one person whose client is among those being scrutinized by the Mueller investigators. \\"Then they go after people because of old business matters that have nothing to do with collusion.\\" Missing Links Even at the FBI, there's a measure of frustration over the investigation. After a highly contentious year investigating Hillary Clinton's private email servers and being accused of swinging the election against her, the FBI finds itself again where officials tried not to be: amid a politically treacherous investigation that has hobbled a new President. Worse yet, some FBI officials fear the question of whether there was any criminal coordination or collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia may never be answered. One challenge is that tantalizing pieces of intelligence are missing key links because they did not develop long enough for investigators to determine their significance. These include intercepts monitored by US intelligence that showed suggestions of illegal coordination but nothing overt. Those missing links mean that the FBI and Mueller's prosecution team may not have enough evidence to bring charges related to possible illegal coordination with a foreign intelligence service. Instead, prosecutors could pursue financial crime charges unrelated to the election. Investigators also face a big hurdle: those participating in the intercepted communications were foreigners, outside the reach of the FBI, who may be exaggerating or lying about events. Some FBI officials also blame media coverage dating back to last summer for prompting some communications to cease, and making it more difficult for investigators to monitor the interactions of Russians and campaign associates. Scrambling to react By last July when Russian intelligence began releasing troves of stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee, the FBI had been aware of the DNC intrusion about a year. Until the stolen emails were weaponized in their release via WikiLeaks and the Russian intelligence's own site DCLeaks, intelligence and law enforcement officials believed the cyber-intrusion was an intelligence-gathering effort, like many of those that occurred before past elections. Over the next four months, the Obama administration officials and law enforcement and intelligence agencies debated how to respond. \\"You had an administration that didn't want to look heavy-handed\\" in favor of Hillary Clinton, one senior former US official involved in investigation said. At the White House, Obama officials scrambled last summer for a strategy on how to respond to what they already knew were Russian actions, well before the administration was willing to point the finger publicly. Michael Daniel, the White House cyber-security coordinator, ordered staff in August to draw up a list of possible retaliatory measures, according to a former administration official briefed on the matter. These included planting malware in Russian infrastructure that could be activated if the Russian actions escalated, according to the former official. But shortly after Daniel gave the order, White House officials raised other concerns. Top officials including Susan Rice, national security adviser, and Lisa Monaco, homeland security adviser, led efforts by the White House to make sure the government could prevent any move by Russian intelligence to tamper with the voting infrastructure and sow chaos on Election Day. Daniel, in an interview, declined to discuss specifics about measures considered in response, because much of the information remains classified. But he said one top concern for White House officials was \\"it not appear we were trying to be partisan in what we were doing.\\" The partisan concerns were exacerbated by interactions between the White House and congressional leaders. Monaco traveled to Capitol Hill to try to get top leaders of both parties to send a letter to state governors to urge shoring up of their defenses of election infrastructure. But they were rebuffed by Republican leaders, who viewed the request as partisan, according to current and former officials briefed on the discussions. Daniel told CNN he and his cyber-response group worked quietly, reducing the number of people allowed in meetings to avoid leaks. \\"We didn't need to do the Russians work for them,\\" Daniel said. \\"We needed to develop diplomatic options first, and we [put] the other options on the back-burner.\\" After the election, the Obama administration unveiled a series of measures , including expulsion of diplomats and seizure of Russian diplomatic compounds allegedly used for espionage. The technical staff also released a trove of information on Russian cyber-intrusion techniques and malware that current and former officials say forced the Russians to spend time and money coming up with new methods. Four Targets The approach to the Manafort and Flynn probes may offer a template for how investigators' focus on possible financial crimes could help gain leverage and cooperation in the investigation. CNN has learned that investigators became more suspicious when they turned up intercepted communications that US intelligence agencies collected among suspected Russian operatives discussing their efforts to work with Manafort, who served as campaign chairman for three months, to coordinate information that could damage Hillary Clinton's election prospects, the US officials say. The suspected operatives relayed what they claimed were conversations with Manafort, encouraging help from the Russians. Manafort faces potential real troubles in the probe, according to current and former officials. Decades of doing business with foreign regimes with reputations for corruption, from the Philippines to Ukraine, had led to messy finances The focus now for investigators is whether Manafort was involved in money laundering or tax violations in his business dealings with pro-Russia parties in Ukraine. He's also been drawn into a related investigation of his son-in-law's real estate business dealings, some of which he invested in. Manafort has not been accused of any wrongdoing. In response to questions about CNN's reporting, his spokesman, Jason Maloni, says it \\"is becoming increasingly apparent that there was no collusion between the campaign and the Russian government.\\" Maloni offered further comment to CNN after the initial publication of this story, saying: \\"Paul Manafort did not collude with the Russian government to undermine the 2016 election or to hack the DNC. Other than that comment, we aren't going to respond to anonymous officials illegally peddling second hand conspiracy theories. But the Justice Department, and the courts if necessary, should hold someone to account for the flood of unlawful government leaks targeting Mr. Manafort.\\" Flynn drew suspicions in late 2016 when US spy agencies collecting the communications of Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak found Flynn, the incoming national security adviser, discussing the subject of US sanctions on Russia. That appeared to contradict White House claims that Flynn had not discussed sanctions in his talks with Kislyak. On January 24, Andrew McCabe, then the deputy FBI director, called Flynn at his White House office. He told the retired lieutenant general that he was sending a couple of FBI agents to discuss a matter with him, according to people familiar with what unfolded. Flynn spoke to McCabe without his lawyer present. At the FBI, the decision to approach Flynn was debated at the highest levels, including by Comey, according to sources familiar with those discussions. FBI officials considered the visit by agents a \\"duty to warn\\" matter, a not-uncommon effort by the FBI to warn a US official that foreign spies may be trying to target them. The agents asked Flynn about the Kislyak calls, in part out of concern that Flynn could be vulnerable to blackmail over the content of the conversations. Flynn gave a wobbly explanation of events. He initially denied the sanctions discussions, then later claimed he couldn't remember. Despite the conflicting accounts, FBI investigators have leaned against seeking charges over the Kislyak discussions. The investigators don't consider Flynn's answers to be intentionally dishonest. Flynn's lawyers have criticized media reports about his connection to the Russia investigation as peddling \\"unfounded allegations\\" and \\"outrageous claims.\\" More troublesome for Flynn, investigators have focused on his lobbying work for the Turkish government , which the former Defense Intelligence Agency chief didn't initially disclose as required by law. Flynn's lawyers have since retroactively registered his lobbying. Page had been the subject of a secret intelligence surveillance warrant since 2014, earlier than had been previously reported, US officials briefed on the probe told CNN. When information emerged last summer suggesting that the Russians were attempting to cultivate Page as a way to gain an entrée into the Trump campaign , the FBI renewed its interest in him. Initially, FBI counterintelligence investigators saw the campaign as possible victims being targeted by Russian intelligence. Page denies working with any Russians as part of the Kremlin's election meddling, though he admits interacting with some Russians during the campaign. Stone denies collusion and says his conversations with Guccifer 2.0, which he since posted online, were innocuous. Editor's note: This story has been updated with additional comments from Manafort's spokesman, Jason Maloni, that were given to CNN after the initial publication. ||||| Summary:","output":"The article discusses how a special investigator named Mr. Mueller is looking into whether President Trump's associates worked with Russia to interfere in the U.S. election. However, the article says that this is difficult to prove. Some people who are being investigated are worried because they think Mr. Mueller might instead look into their financial histories, even if those aren't related to the election. The article also notes that President Trump and others have denied working with Russia during the election, saying that they won because of voters' support. The President pointed out that such claims seem to distract from the fact that the Democrats lost the election. In simpler terms, it's like a teacher trying to find out if one student copied another's homework. However, it's hard to prove, and now some students are worried the teacher might instead get them in trouble for unrelated things.

Rep. Mike Christian, R-Oklahoma City, will present his findings at a legislative interim study hearing Tuesday. “We’re going to have to find something else because I think lethal injection, most would agree, is probably on its way out,” said Christian, a former Oklahoma Highway Patrol trooper. Pharmaceutical companies have become reluctant to provide drugs for lethal injections and many doctors don’t want to participate in the process. Some lethal injections have gone awry, with the condemned man seemingly suffering or taking longer than expected to die, as was case in the April execution of Clayton Lockett at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary. He was pronounced dead about 43 minutes after his execution began and seemed to strain, grimace and moan during the procedure. The state Public Safety Department studied the Lockett execution and concluded the intravenous line was not placed properly. Although there’s no indication nitrogen has ever been used for an execution, Christian said it seems like a humane approach. Some who have received an accidental excess of the gas have even said the effect was mildly euphoric. “For lack of a better term, it’s innovative for what we’re looking at,” Christian said. “It’s going to be a very interesting study (Tuesday). I think it will lead to legislation. I think in the end most of the members would say they’d vote for something like this.” ||||| Following a string of stories that placed the United States' reliance on capital punishment, which is unique among nations in the developed world, at the forefront of the national consciousness, state officials took a step Friday to advance a proposal to allow Wyoming to execute prisoners via firing squad if the necessary drugs for a lethal injection are not available. According to a report from the Associated Press, Wyoming's Joint Judiciary Legislative Committee voted to further the bill, which would cause the state to join only two others, Utah and Oklahoma, in allowing the firing squad practice. Oklahoma allows firing squad only in situations where lethal injection and the electric chair have been deemed unconstitutional, while Utah lets prisoners be killed by a firing squad if they so choose (which few do, though one did as recently as 2010). Now that the measure has advanced, the firing squad proposal will go before the Wyoming Legislature during January of 2015. The state's Senate took up a similar measure earlier this year, but it failed to secure enough votes to pass. The bill will likely fare better than it would in a less-conservative state, but still faces major hurdles. Republican Rep. Stephen Watt, for example, is opposed, and cites his own experience being shot as a reason. \\"We're all operating under the assumption that this is going to be instantaneous death,\\" Watt said to the Associated Press. \\"What happens if everyone misses?\\" ||||| Following a series of botched executions in the US, one lawmaker in the state of Oklahoma is now trying to gather support behind a new form of capital punishment. Mike Christian, a Republican in the Oklahoma House of Representatives, would like to see nitrogen asphyxiation introduced as a method to execute death row inmates. Nitrogen and noble gases such as helium are seen by proponents of assisted suicide as offering a reliable, quick and painless way to die. Christian plans to introduce his proposal this week at a House hearing on the future of the death penalty. By December, Christian told SPIEGEL, he hopes to be able to present a draft law. Should it receive the requisite support, nitrogen asphyxiation could replace lethal injection as the primary execution method used sometime next year. \\"It's the most humane way to die. You just sit there and a few minutes later, you're dead.\\" Christian says. \\"I think it will definitely meet the standards (set) by the United States Supreme Court that it is definitely not cruel and inhumane.\\" Video SPIEGEL ONLINE For nitrogen asphyxiation executions, convicts would be placed in an airtight chamber or under a large plastic sack. The introduction of nitrogen, and the absence of oxygen, leads to a rapid loss of consciousness and, ultimately, to death. The method has never been used for capital punishment cases in the US. And there is disagreement as to whether it is as painless as Christian suggests, with some reports claiming that it is an agonizing way to die. Of the 38 US states in which executions are carried out, 37 currently use lethal injection. The procedure was developed by a medical examiner from Oklahoma in 1977 and was long considered to be more effective and less painful than previous methods such as hanging, the electric chair or the gas chamber. \\"Back then, it was Oklahoma that came up with an innovation, and today we should take the lead again and come up with an innovative method,\\" Christian says. Dr. Michael Copeland, assistant professor at East Central University in Oklahoma City, has been tasked by Christian with providing an expert opinion on the issue. \\"Nitrogen is the most humane, cheapest and easiest way to execute people,\\" Copeland says. In contrast with gases used previously for capital punishment, he says that convicts executed with noble gases such as nitrogen would not feel as though they were suffocating. Video SPIEGEL ONLINE \\"With nitrogen we won't have the problem of drug shortage that we've witnessed recently,\\" Copeland says. \\"It's ubiquitous.\\" Unlike with lethal injections, little can go wrong, he says. \\"You don't need a doctor or other medical personnel to find a vein.\\" And the method is extremely affordable, Christian adds, saying you only need a bottle of gas and a small plastic tent. \\"It's even cheaper than the bullets you need for the firing squad,\\" Christian says. The only details that must be clarified, he insists, is whether convicts would be fitted with a mask, a bag or a small tent over their heads. Among advocates of the death penalty, the willingness to search for new methods of execution is greater than ever. This year, there have been a number of botched lethal injection procedures. It took 25 minutes of visible and audible agony, for example, for Dennis McGuire to die in an Ohio execution chamber in January. The State of Arizona took two hours to kill Joseph Wood via lethal injection in late June. In Oklahoma, serious glitches occurred in two executions this spring. The April 29 execution of Clayton Lockett is considered one of the most gruesome in American history. The problems were blamed on the execution team's lack of qualifications. In addition, though, authorities have had trouble obtaining the compounds long used for lethal injections. Since the EU began controlling the export of some substances three years ago to prevent them from being used for capital punishment, US states have run out of the time-tested drugs Pentobarbital and Thiopental. Ill advised experiments have been the result. Some US editorialists have described 2014 as the worst year in the history of lethal injection. 'We Will Put These Beasts to Death' There are reasons to doubt whether law-and-order politicians like Christian are really worried about making executions more painless. They are much more interested preventing the now widely criticized death penalty from being abolished. Even after the botched Lockett execution, Christian said he didn't care how executions are carried out, whether by \\"lethal injection, the guillotine or if we feed them to lions.\\" Now, Christian says he doesn't want the media to further harm Oklahoma's image. \\"We live in a great state. We don't want the New York Times or SPIEGEL to write that Oklahoma is a barbaric state. We're not barbaric.\\" Nearly 80 percent of Oklahomans support the death penalty, compared to two-thirds of Americans overall. Christian has spoken with other lawmakers in the Oklahoma capital about the nitrogen method, and is now certain: \\"I will get a majority for this. One year from now, Oklahoma won't execute by lethal injection anymore.\\" One thing, though, remains certain, says Chrisitan: \\"We will put these beasts to death.\\" ||||| What is a summary?","output":"A lawmaker in Oklahoma is considering a new way to execute people called \\"death by nitrogen gas\\" because many people think that execution by injection is not working well. This new method has never been used before, but some people believe it could be a more gentle way to carry out executions. In other states, they are looking at different ways to execute people too, such as firing squads in Wyoming. This is because there have been some problems with executions and many doctors don't want to participate in them."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence, and then tell me the concepts included in that sentence.","output":"Sentence: The fluffy dog jumped over the colorful fence. Explanation: In this sentence, there are a few concepts that are important to understand. 1. Fluffy dog - A dog is a type of friendly animal that many people have as pets. Fluffy refers to the dog's fur, which is soft and thick, like the cozy warm stuffing inside your teddy bear. 2. Jumped - Jumping means to push yourself off the ground with your legs so that you can go up into the air for a short amount of time. Imagine when you see a frog or a kangaroo hopping; that's also called jumping. 3. Over - The word \\"over\\" tells us that something is going above something else, like when you throw a ball over a table. In this case, the fluffy dog is going over the fence. 4. Colorful fence - A fence is a barrier made of wood, metal, or other materials, which is used to divide or outline an area. Lots of times, you see them around a yard, playground, or farm. Colorful means that the fence has many bright and cheerful colors, like the colors of a rainbow. So, the whole sentence means that the dog, which is furry and soft, is leaping in the air across a fence that is covered in many different beautiful colors."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this summary: Open https://github.com/alexzielenski/Mousecape/releases/tag/0.0.6b2.

As the song's lyrics had not yet been entirely written, there are notable differences between it and the final version. For example, the first performance started with \\"Come out and play, make up the rules\\" instead of the eventual opening of \\"Load up on guns, bring your friends\\". A recording of the earlier version appears on With the Lights Out and again on Sliver: The Best of the Box. A similar early live performance of the song is found in the documentary 1991: The Year Punk Broke, filmed during a 1991 summer tour in Europe with Sonic Youth. Nirvana often altered the song's lyrics and tempo for live performances. Some live performances of the song had the line \\"our little group has always been\\" changed to \\"our little tribe has always been\\", which can be heard on the 1996 live album From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah. Rolling Stone remarked that the Wishkah version of \\"Teen Spirit\\" \\"[found] Cobain's guitar reeling outside the song's melodic boundaries and sparking new life in that nearly played-out hit\\". A notable alternate performance of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" occurred on BBC's Top of the Pops in 1991, during which the band refused to mime to the pre-recorded backing track and Cobain sang in a deliberately low voice and altered numerous lyrics in the song (for example, \\"Load up on guns, bring your friends\\" became \\"Load up on drugs, kill your friends\\"). Cobain later said he was trying to sound like former Smiths frontman Morrissey. When Top of the Pops was cancelled in 2006, The Observer listed Nirvana's performance of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" as the third greatest in the show's history.

What is VC funding and how can a start up get VC funding? Do those questions have the same meaning? Available options: [+] no; [+] yes;","output":"[+] no; The two questions are related, but do not have the exact same meaning. The first question asks how one can get venture capital (VC) or angel funding for a start-up idea, while the second question asks what VC funding is and how a start-up can get it. Although both questions are about VC funding, the first question also includes angel funding, which is different from VC funding. To answer both questions: 1. What is VC funding and how can a start up get VC funding? Venture capital (VC) is a type of financing that is provided by institutional investors to start-ups and early-stage companies perceived to have high growth potential in exchange for equity or a stake in the company. To get VC funding: A. Refine your start-up idea - Develop a clear, well-defined business plan with a strong value proposition, target customer base, and revenue model. B. Develop a pitch deck - Prepare a concise, engaging presentation that showcases the problem your start-up solves, the unique value of the product or service, and the growth potential of the market. C. Build a network - Establish connections with VC firms and investors through industry events, local start-up communities, online forums, and entrepreneurial groups. D. Research suitable VC firms - Research VC firms that have experience and interest in your industry, and that align with your start-up's stage and requirements. E. Initiate contact - Reach out to VC firms and arrange for pitch meetings, either through introductions from mutual contacts or by directly contacting the firms. F. Present your pitch and negotiate - When meeting with VC firms, present your pitch deck and be prepared to answer questions, engage in discussions, and negotiate terms if they show interest in investing. G. Due diligence and deal closing - If a VC firm decides to invest in your start-up, they will conduct due diligence, which could include verifying financials, conducting background checks, and assessing the start-up's legal structure. After due diligence, the final deal terms will be negotiated, and the investment process will be closed. 2. How do you get VC or angel funding for a start-up idea? Angel funding is financing provided by individual investors who have the financial capacity to invest in small businesses or start-ups in exchange for equity or a stake in the company. The process of obtaining angel funding is similar to that of VC funding: A. Refine your start-up idea B. Develop a pitch deck C. Build a network - In the case of angel funding, networking should focus on building connections with potential angel investors, accelerators, and incubators. D. Research suitable angel investors - Identify angel investors with a track record of investing in your industry and at your start-up's stage. E. Initiate contact - Reach out to angel investors and arrange for pitch meetings. F. Present your pitch and negotiate G. Due diligence and deal closing Overall, the primary difference between the two questions is that the first question asks about obtaining funding from both venture capital firms and angel investors, while the second question focuses solely on obtaining VC funding."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: What's the answer to that question: what time does barnes and noble close on saturday?

Context: The collaborative process between me and Claire Bridge has been good so far. Upon finding out her email address we had a brief email exchange culminating in me sending her a list of potential questions for the interview. Claire quite liked a lot of the questions, but overall there were too many, so we proceeded to reduce the number of questions to six main questions. These questions would then form the basis of the artist portrait, with an attempt to limit answers to no more than a minute, so little had to be cut for the final edit. The six questions we arrived at are as follows: How would you define creativity? What does it mean to you to be an artist? Do you feel a painting or piece of art can house an energy/a feeling from the original artist? Do you feel that your own works house this energy? Change and transformation are recurrent themes in your work. What are you exploring and why do these fascinate you? And recently we saw a change in your medium too, incorporating video works and photography. You seem to draw on many influences in your work, from quantum physics, astrophysics, to environmental ecology, psychology, philosophy and metaphysics. With titles like “Dark Matter”, “Touching Infinity”, “We are made of Stars”, “Rising tides” and “A drop in the ocean” or “Alchemy”. Can you tell us something more about the convergence of these ideas and influences? What continues to motivate and inspire you as an artist? We both felt these questions addressed the initial topic of exploring creativity, explored why Claire became an artist, gives insight into Claire’s work and practise and looks toward the future of Claire’s practice. After refining the questions, we proceeded to organise a day to film, which will be on the 16th September. Hopefully if all goes well we will both have an artist portrait that lives up to our expectations. Question: What is the interview being used for?

Mathieu grew up to become a renowned French painter and writer, known for his significant contributions to the art world. He was a prominent figure in the movements of lyrical abstraction and tachisme, which emerged during the post-World War II period in Europe, particularly in France. Throughout his career, Mathieu created notable works such as \\"Hommage au Maréchal de Turenne\\" (1952) and \\"La Bataille de Bouvines\\" (1954). Apart from painting, Mathieu was also known for his writing, which helped to establish his reputation as a multi-talented artist. Georges Mathieu held French nationality and became widely celebrated for his distinct artistic style. His paintings were characterized by bold, expressive strokes and vibrant colors, which represented the core principles of lyrical abstraction and tachisme. These movements sought to emphasize the emotional power and gestures of the artist, rather than focusing on accurate depictions of physical objects. Mathieu lived a fruitful life, contributing to the world of art and literature until his death on June 10, 2012, in Boulogne-Billancourt, France. He was 91 years old.

Would PepsiCo potatoes be less or more herbicide tolerant than Kettle Foods'? PepsiCo has been supplying GMO potato seeds to farmers. Eventually, they buy the potatoes for their chips. On the other hand, Kettle Foods supplied non-GMO potato seeds to their farmers. They wanted to see how customers react to their non-GMO products, mostly chips. Hint: Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination... A:","output":"PepsiCo potatoes would be more herbicide tolerant than Kettle Foods' potatoes because they use GMO potato seeds, which are genetically engineered for increased herbicide tolerance. Kettle Foods, on the other hand, uses non-GMO potato seeds."},{"instruction":"The 24-year-old has not scored a point after 18 grands prix starts.

Let's understand these two questions one at a time. Question 1: How can extroverted persons handle introverted persons? An extroverted person is someone who likes talking and playing with lots of friends. An introverted person is someone who enjoys quiet time alone or with a few close friends. To help an extroverted person handle an introverted person, they can remember to: 1. Be patient: Since introverted people need time to think and can be quiet, give them a little more time to answer your questions or share their stories. Pretend it's like waiting for your turn on a swing! 2. Listen carefully: Introverted people might have some interesting things to share, but they'll only tell you if they know you're listening. It's like you're playing a detective and finding clues in what they're telling you! 3. Respect their space: Introverted people like to have their own space and not be surrounded by too many people. Think of it like a secret hiding spot where they can be comfortable. Question 2: If interacting with people makes us happy, are introverts less happy than extroverts? Interacting or playing with people can make us happy, but what makes one person happy might not be the same for someone else. Introverted people also enjoy spending time alone or with a small group of friends, they can be just as happy as extroverted people. Think of happiness like your favorite ice cream flavor. Different people like different flavors, and that's okay! As for your last question, no, questions 1 and 2 are not the same. Question 1 is about how extroverts can interact with introverts in a way that's comfortable for both. Question 2 is about whether introverts are less happy because they enjoy spending time with fewer people.

Answer the question and classify your answers into yes or no. Input: Is NOBODY wrong in the post ? POST : Alright so first let me preface this with two things: •I am white and very aware I undountedly have inherent biases, and do my damnedest to fight them and better myself •I hold firm to the belief that Nazis deserve to be decked in the throat. repeatedly. •because of the nature of this question, I would prefer if nonwhite people responded to this I work in a coffeeshop in a mall (not a Starbucks), and have been there for coming up on three years this May. Naturally, I get some shitty customers, as well as plenty of fantastic customers. The problem is that I've noticed a pattern in what groups have been the biggest pains in my ass to deal with, at least as customers. And unfortunately that manages to settle into two specific groups: Hispanic families and east Asians. Hispanic families being the groups of at least three people at once, usually with at least one kid. First, there tends to be a language barrier that's difficult to get past, but I've learned to deal with that. *However*, these groups also tend to end up being picky on top of not knowing what they actually want (ordering one thing and then realizing they ordered wrong when I've finished the drink, even when I clarified what they meant when they ordered the drinks), showing up less that 30 minutes before close, not using normal manners like \\"please\\" and \\"thank you,\\" either tipping less than 50 cents or not tipping at all, giving me a 50 or 100 bill for an order under 10, and making an awful mess and either not cleaning up after themselves at all or half-assing their \\"attempt\\" to clean up. I realize that outside of a retail scenario these people are probably perfectly reasonable, but at work I'm starting to build a preemptive internal feeling of frustration when these demographics of people just walk into the store, before they've even approached the counter. Am I just being awful and racist, or am I just noticing an unfortunate pattern? There are also plenty of fantastic PoC customers and godawful white customers (for example, my favorite customers are black people because I literally almost never have any problems with any black customers), so I'm not sure if this is a bias or just a really awful coincidence. Output:","output":"Answer: No Justification: The author in the post acknowledges their biases and is trying their best to better themselves. They are asking for input from others to understand if their feelings are due to an unfortunate pattern or racism.

Step 2: A person eats more high sugar food. Reasoning: Consuming high sugar food may be a coping mechanism for some people when they are feeling more depressed. Step 3: The person's blood sugar level rises. Reasoning: Eating more high sugar food will result in an increase in blood sugar levels. Step 4: The pancreas receives a signal to release insulin. Reasoning: The body senses elevated blood sugar levels and signals the pancreas to secrete insulin. Step 5: Insulin is released into the bloodstream. Reasoning: The pancreas releases insulin in response to high blood sugar levels. Step 6: Insulin signals cells to absorb sugar. Reasoning: Insulin is a hormone that enables cells to take in sugar from the bloodstream. Step 7: The cells absorb the sugar from the bloodstream. Reasoning: The cells take in sugar to use it as a source of energy, reducing blood sugar levels in the process. Influence on the second effect (person's blood sugar level rises): More effect.

Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget. It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps. Clean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet. Some of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating. A major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself. Use Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive. For example: you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall. Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers. When you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating. If you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine. Question: When does the author advise that adding super foods should occur after beginning clean eating? === The answer to the above question is Answer:","output":"The author advises that adding superfoods to your diet can be done at any time after beginning clean eating, as long as you can afford to do so. However, it is not necessary to add them immediately, as you can still eat clean by consuming the clean foods that are within your budget."},{"instruction":"Write some highlights for the following article: By. Daily Mail Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 03:36 EST, 4 April 2013. |. UPDATED:. 17:06 EST, 4 April 2013. Connecticut Governor Dannel P. Malloy signed into law Thursday sweeping new restrictions on weapons and large capacity ammunition magazines similar to the ones used by the man who gunned down 20 child and six educators in the massacre. Alongside family members of some of the victims of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Malloy signed the bill hours after the General Assembly approved the measure to give the state some of the toughest gun laws in the country. 'This is a profoundly emotional day for everyone in this room,' the governor said. 'We have come together in a way that few places in the nation have demonstrated the ability to do.' Scroll down for video. Taking action: Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy signed strict gun control measures into state law on Thursday while surrounded by the parents of victims from the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Relatives: Nicole Hockley (right), the mother of slain Dylan Hockley, hugs State Senator Beth Bye as Neil Heslin (left), the father of victim Jesse Lewis, watches. Emotional: Mark Barden, the father of victim Daniel Barden, cries as he hugs Senator Richard Blumenthal following the signing of the law banning more than 100 weapons. Waiting for action: Relatives of two of the children who were killed at the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting added to the poignancy of the signing of the gun control law on Thursday. In the hours after the shooting. December 14, as anxious family members gathered inside a firehouse and. waited for news, Malloy told them their loved ones were not coming home. He said later that he didn't think it was right for the families to. wait for the victims to be formally identified. Now, Connecticut joins states. including California, New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts in having. the country's strongest gun control laws, said Brian Malte, director of. mobilization for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence in. Washington. 'This would put Connecticut right at the top or near the top of the states with the strongest gun laws,' Malte said. The legislation adds more than 100. firearms to the state's assault weapons ban and creates what officials. have called the nation's first dangerous weapon offender registry as. well as eligibility rules for buying ammunition. Some parts of the bill. would take effect immediately after Malloy's signature, including. background checks for all firearms sales. Support: Now Connecticut is one of the states with the most strict gun control laws in the country. Advocate: Democratic Governor Dannel Malloy has been held up as a leader on the issue of gun control. Heartfelt: Malloy was the one to inform the waiting parents on December 14th that their children had been killed. Following a total of more than 13. hours of respectful and at times somber debate, the House of. Representatives and the Senate voted in favor of the 139-page bill. crafted by leaders from both major parties in the Democratic-controlled. General Assembly. Both were bipartisan votes. 'I pray today's bill — the most. far-reaching gun safety legislation in the country — will prevent other. families from ever experiencing the dreadful loss that the 26 Sandy Hook. families have felt,' said House Majority Leader Joe Aresimowicz. 'Don't tread on me': Gun control opponents. outside the statehouse in Hartford, Connecticut, as lawmakers debated. the new laws passed last night which ban more than 100 guns and. large-capacity ammo magazines. Gun control advocates: Lauren Garrett, a supporter of gun regulation and her son Robert display a sign that reads 'Ban AR-15's' inside the statehouse in Hartford yesterday. Colorado and New York also passed new. gun control requirements in the wake of the Newtown shooting, in which a. 20-year-old gunman used a military-style semi-automatic rifle. Compared with Connecticut's. legislation, which, for example, bans the sale or purchase of ammunition. magazines holding more than 10 rounds, New York restricted magazines to. seven bullets and gave owners of higher-capacity magazines a year to. sell them elsewhere. Colorado banned ammunition magazines that hold more. than 15 rounds. President Barack Obama has urged lawmakers at the national level to take similar action. Connecticut House majority leader Joe. Aresimowicz said of last night's decision: 'I pray today's bill - the. most far-reaching gun safety legislation in the country - will prevent. other families from ever experiencing the dreadful loss that the 26. Sandy Hook families have felt.' Some of the measures take effect. right away, including an expansion of the state's assault weapons ban,. background checks for all firearms sales and a ban on the sale or. purchase of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. Defining issue: President Barack Obama speaks about gun control at the Denver Police Academy in Colorado yesterday. He is pushing for new nationwide gun controls but faces opposition from powerful groups. The massacre reignited a national. debate on gun control, and President Obama has made gun safety one of. the defining issues of his second term, which started a month after the. shooting. His proposed gun control measures. have largely stalled in Congress, however, and Obama has planned a trip. to Connecticut on Monday to increase pressure on lawmakers in. Washington. Legislative leaders, aware of the attention on them, struck a rare bipartisan agreement they want to serve as a national model. Long debate: Rob Kane, a Republican senator serving towns in western Connecticut, left, questions Senate President Donald Williams, D-Brooklyn, during a discussion of a gun bill on the Senate floor last night. Tense: Senate Minority Leader John McKinney, R-Fairfield, left, and Senator Carlo Leone, D-Stamford and Darien, watch a vote for an amendment of the gun-control bill at the Capitol in Hartford. President Barack Obama has made gun safety one of the defining issues of his second term, which began just a month after the bloody Sandy Hook massacre. Connecticut is the latest state to introduce stricter gun controls in response to the 26 killings on December 14, joining New York, Massachusetts, California and Colorado. But Obama's proposed national gun control measures have largely stalled in Congress, however, and the president has planned a trip to Connecticut on Monday to increase pressure on lawmakers in Washington. He visited Colorado yesterday and repeated his call for universal background checks for gun buyers - a measure that has better chances of winning enough support in Congress than an assault weapons ban or limits on large-capacity ammunition magazines. Obama's visit was heavy with political symbolism because Colorado recently expanded gun control laws despite being a western, largely rural state where gun ownership is a cherished right. Colorado suffered two of the worst mass shootings in U.S. history - at Columbine school in 1999 and at a movie theater last year. It has expanded background checks for gun purchases and placed restrictions on ammunition magazines. Obama said Colorado's action shows 'there doesn't have to be a conflict' between keeping citizens safe and protecting the right to bear firearms guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. But the powerful National Rifle Association gun lobby claims more guns keep people safer and have blocked many efforts towards stricter gun controls. Several county sheriffs in Colorado have also vowed not to enforce the new gun restrictions. Senate. President Donald Williams Jr., a Democrat, said: 'The tragedy in. Newtown demands a powerful response, demands a response that transcends. politics. 'It is the strongest and most comprehensive bill in the country.' The. bill passed 26-10 in the Senate and 105-44 in the House of. Representatives. Both were bipartisan votes. The legislation adds more than 100. firearms to the state's assault weapons ban and creates what officials. have called the nation's first dangerous weapon offender registry as. well as eligibility rules for buying ammunition. But some lawmakers said they felt the legislation did not do enough to address mental health issues. Representative Mitch Bolinsky, a freshman Republican lawmaker from Newtown, acknowledged the legislation 'is not perfect' and he hoped would be 'a beginning in addressing critical mental health needs.' Representative Douglas McCrory, D-Hartford, said he felt the bill 'doesn't speak to the issue of gun violence that has permeated our cities.' He said families in his district who've lost children to gun violence have not received the same level of attention from state politicians as the Newtown families. But Senate Minority Leader John McKinney, R-Fairfield, whose district includes Newtown, said he felt he was representing the interests of the Sandy Hook victims as he cast his vote. 'I stand here as their voice, as their elected representative,' he said, reciting the names of the 26 victims at the school. Lawmakers appeared to still be stunned by the enormity of the massacre. 'When. a child is sent to school, their parents expect them to be safe. The. Sandy Hook shooting rampage was a parent's, a school system's, a. community's and the nation's worst nightmare,' said Republican state. Sen. Toni Boucher of Wilton. Horror: Connecticut State Police lead a line of. children from the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. on Friday, December 14, 2012 after the massacre at the school which. claimed 26 lives. Grief: Young children wait outside Sandy Hook Elementary School after the shootings. Tears: A woman waits to hear about her sister, a teacher, following a shooting at the Sandy Hook. Gun rights advocates, who greatly. outnumbered gun control supporters in demonstrations held earlier in the. day at the Capitol, railed against the proposals as misguided and. unconstitutional. Newtown school gunman Adam Lanza: He slaughtered. 20 first-grade pupils and six teachers with shots from a legally bought high-powered rifle. 'No! No! No!' and 'Read the bill!' they chanted. 'We want them to write laws that are sensible,' said Ron Pariseau, of Pomfret, who was angry he'll be made a felon if he doesn't register his weapons that will no longer be sold in Connecticut. 'What they're proposing will not stop anything.' By the time the Senate voted around 6.30pm, many of the gun rights advocates had gone home, leaving behind proponents of the bill who applauded when the tally in the Senate was read. The halls were mostly empty by the time the House voted at 2.26am this morning. Among the gun control advocates were Dan and Lauren Garrett, of Hamden, wearing green shirts in honor of the Sandy Hook victims. The Garretts traveled to Hartford with their 10-month-old son, Robert, to watch the bill's passage. They said they hope lawmakers will build on the proposal. 'It's just the beginning of this bill. In six months from now, it's going to get stronger and stronger,' Dan Garrett said. 'I think they're watching us all over the country.'","output":"- Connecticut Governor Dannel P. Malloy signed new gun restrictions into law, including limitations on weapons and large capacity ammunition magazines. - The law was signed in the presence of family members of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims. - Connecticut now has some of the toughest gun laws in the country. - The legislation bans more than 100 firearms, creates a dangerous weapon offender registry, and enforces eligibility rules for buying ammunition. - The measure's passage in Connecticut was seen as a national model for bipartisan cooperation on gun control."},{"instruction":"Tammy likes to crochet.

When reasoning through this scenario, we can consider various possibilities, limitations of language, cultural and contextual factors, as well as additional sources of information. First, let's explore the potential scenarios the given statement might imply. The statement simply states that a young girl is playing in the surf, or the foamy waves that break along the seashore. It provides no further details about her clothing, the specific location, or her activities at that moment. She could be wearing any type of clothing, such as a swimsuit, a dress, or even a wetsuit if water sports are involved. Examining the limitations of language also helps elucidate the point. In any language, descriptions can vary in detail, and it can be challenging to deduce specific details unless they are explicitly stated. Given the phrase \\"A young girl plays in the surf,\\" one can make no definitive assumptions about her clothing based solely on this information. Beyond language, cultural and contextual factors come into play when interpreting any statement. Different cultures and locations may have different norms for appropriate or expected clothing when interacting with the ocean. For example, in a Western context, swimwear may be the norm. However, in more conservative societies, clothing while playing in ocean might resemble regular clothing, such as a shirt and shorts. One cannot infer such cultural and contextual norms from the phrase provided. Additionally, various sources of information may alter the interpretation of the statement. If the phrase is encountered in isolation, it is difficult to determine specifics about the girl's clothing. But if the statement is part of a larger conversation, story, or set of images that provide further contextual clues, readers or observers may be better equipped to make educated guesses about her attire. Yet, unless this additional information specifically mentions her wearing a shirt and shorts, it remains uncertain. In conclusion, without supplementary information or context that elaborates on the young girl's clothing, it is not possible to definitively conclude that she is wearing a shirt and shorts as she plays in the ocean's surf based solely on the statement \\"A young girl plays in the surf.\\" Language limitations, cultural factors, and contextual variability all contribute to the indeterminate nature of this conclusion."},{"instruction":"Write a dialog about anything you want.","output":"To create a dialogue, I will choose a specific setting and characters to bring the conversation to life.

Federal prosecutors charged 23-year-old Samy Mohamed Hamzeh on Tuesday, Jan. 26, 2016, with... (Associated Press) MILWAUKEE (AP) — A Milwaukee man wanted to storm a Masonic temple with a machine gun and kill at least 30 people in an attack he hoped would show \\"nobody can play with Muslims\\" and spark more mass shootings in the United States, federal agents said Tuesday after the man's arrest. Federal prosecutors charged 23-year-old Samy Mohamed Hamzeh with unlawfully possessing a machine gun and receiving and possessing firearms not registered to him. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney, Dean Puschnig, didn't immediately respond to a question asking why charges were limited to gun possession. Hamzeh's attorney, federal defender Ronnie Murray, didn't immediately return email and voicemail messages left after business hours. According to an FBI affidavit, agents were tipped off in September that Hamzeh planned to travel to Israel in October to attack Israeli soldiers and citizens in the West Bank. He abandoned those plans due to \\"family, financial and logistic reasons,\\" the affidavit said, but refocused his efforts on a domestic attack. Hamzeh discussed his plans extensively with two FBI informants. The affidavit said the FBI started recording his conversations with the informants in October. Hamzeh and the two informants traveled to a gun range on Jan. 19 and practiced with a pistol. Afterward they took a tour of a Masonic temple in Milwaukee. The affidavit does not name the temple and Puschnig declined to identify it. Masons are members of a fraternal organization that carries out a variety of activities including charity work. Wisconsin has nearly 11,000 Masons in 180 lodges, according to Frank Struble, grand master of Free and Accepted Masons in Wisconsin. The organization is not a religion. Struble said the allegations were \\"hard to hear.\\" He said he knew which Masonic center had been targeted but declined to identify it. \\"Masons are a part of an organization that helped build this country,\\" Struble said. \\"I can understand from that standpoint where someone who is against this country would target us.\\" The owner of a downtown Milwaukee gym said she recently fired Hamzeh after hiring him as a trainer just a few weeks ago. Delia Luna of 9Round Kickbox Fitness described Hamzeh as \\"very intense, very militant\\" as a trainer and said he didn't fit the atmosphere she wanted to create. \\"He didn't mix well,\\" Luna said. Federal agents said that on Jan. 19 and into the early morning of Jan. 20, Hamzeh discussed his plans to attack the temple with the informants, telling them they needed two more machine guns — the group apparently already had one — and silencers. They planned to station one person at the temple's entrance while the other two went through the building, killing everyone they saw. They then planned to walk away from the scene as if nothing had happened. \\"I am telling you, if this hit is executed, it will be known all over the world ... all the Mujahedeen will be talking and they will be proud of us,\\" Hamzeh said, according to the affidavit. \\"Such operations will increase in America, when they hear about it. The people will be scared and the operations will increase. ... This way we will be igniting it. I mean we are marching at the front of the war.\\" Hamzeh added that he hoped to kill 30 people, \\"because these 30 will terrify the world. The (expletive) will know that nobody can play with Muslims.\\" He added, \\"We are here defending Islam, young people together join to defend Islam, that's it, that is what our intention is.\\" According to the affidavit, Hamzeh met with two undercover FBI agents on Monday. They presented him with two automatic machine guns and a silencer. He paid for the weapons and silencer in cash and put them in the trunk of his car. The agents then arrested him and recovered the guns and silencer. Hamzeh's arrest marks the Milwaukee area's second brush with a mass shooting in less than four years. A white supremacist named Wade Michael Page fatally shot six people at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, a Milwaukee suburb, in 2012. Page shot himself in the head after a police officer wounded him. Last month Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire on a social services center in San Bernardino, California, killing 14 people. They later died in a shootout with police. ____ Richmond reported from Madison, Wisconsin. ||||| Advertisement Continue reading the main story WASHINGTON — Federal prosecutors on Tuesday announced the arrest of a Milwaukee man who they said was planning a mass shooting at a Masonic temple in the city. The suspect, Samy Mohamed Hamzeh, 23, who worked as a trainer at a kickboxing facility, was charged with illegally buying a machine gun and a silencer to carry out the attack. But he was not charged with any terrorism-related offenses because investigators were unable to tie him conclusively to a foreign terrorist organization, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case is continuing. A tip from the public appears to have led counterterrorism investigators in Milwaukee to Mr. Hamzeh. The F.B.I. used two undercover operatives to gather evidence against him, including recorded conversations in which he spoke of making the “mujahedeen” overseas proud, the authorities said. “We are Muslims, defending Muslim religion,” he is accused of saying. Last fall, Mr. Hamzeh planned to travel to Jordan, then enter the West Bank and attack Israeli soldiers and citizens, prosecutors said. But he abandoned those plans and instead focused on a possible attack in the United States, the prosecutors said. In a criminal complaint filed Monday, the Justice Department charged that the suspect and the two undercover operatives went to a shooting range in the Milwaukee area last week for target practice. They then went to a Masonic temple in the city and got a tour to scout the location, the complaint said. Mr. Hamzeh “devised a detailed plan to commit a mass shooting intended to kill dozens of people,” Gregory J. Haanstad, the acting United States attorney in Milwaukee, said in a statement. ||||| The exterior of Humphrey Scottish Rite Masonic, on N. Van Buren St., the target of a planned mass shooting. Credit: Rick Wood By of the A terrorist-style plot intended to kill dozens of people with automatic weapons at a Masonic center in Milwaukee was foiled this week by FBI agents, federal prosecutors said Tuesday. Samy Mohamed Hamzeh discussed his plan to attack the center with two others, detailing how they would quickly and quietly kill the first people they saw and then methodically move through the building, \\"eliminating everyone\\" they encountered, according to a federal criminal complaint. Hamzeh, 23, has been charged with possessing a machine gun and a silencer. Despite indications of an attempted act of terrorism, Hamzeh is not charged with any terrorism counts. \\"We are Muslims, defending Muslim religion, we are on our own, my dear, we have organized our own group,\\" Hamzeh said, according to the criminal complaint, adding he was confident it would trigger more attacks in the United States. \\"Such operations will increase in America, when they hear about it. The people will be scared and the operations will increase, and there will be problems all over,... this will lead to people clashing with each other. This way we will be igniting it. I mean we are marching at the front of the war,\\" he said, according to the complaint. Acting U.S. Attorney Gregory J. Haanstad called it a \\"detailed plan to commit a mass shooting intended to kill dozens of people.\\" \\"(Hamzeh) also said that he wanted this mass shooting to be 'known the world over' and to 'ignite' broader clashes. It is difficult to calculate the injury and loss of life that was prevented by concerned citizens coming forward and by the tireless efforts of the FBI and the Joint Terrorism Task Force.\\" Hamzeh does not claim a connection to an established, known terrorist group, according to the complaint. At one point he says, \\"We have our own group, not with Hamas, ... we are here defending Islam, young people together join to defend Islam, that's it, that is what our intention is.\\" Jeff Cramer, a former federal prosecutor, said a criminal complaint is used to arrest someone and it appears there was urgency to take Hamzeh into custody. Prosecutors still must present the case to the grand jury, when additional charges may be added, including a terrorism-related count, but that will depend on the facts of the case, Cramer said. Such counts generally require approval from the Justice Department in Washington. Hamzeh — who most recently worked at a downtown gym where he was fired for being too intense, gym owner Delia Luna said — appeared in federal court in Milwaukee Tuesday and remains in custody by order of U.S. Magistrate Judge David Jones. Hamzeh will have court-appointed counsel but an attorney has not been assigned, according to federal defender Daniel Stiller, who did not have further comment on the case. Hamzeh was planning to attack the Humphrey Scottish Rite Masonic Center, a historic building on N. Van Buren St. in downtown Milwaukee that hosts weddings, conferences, meetings and other special events. The Wisconsin Scottish Rite, which purchased the building in 1912, has been in the community since 1863. Hamzeh had scouted the Masonic center by taking a tour and spoke in detail about how the attack would occur, the complaint says. A woman in the lobby of the center Tuesday afternoon told a reporter that the staff had no comment. Hamzeh had been under investigation by the FBI since September, which used confidential informants who secretly recorded him. Undercover FBI agents arrested him this week after he tried to buy automatic weapons from them, the complaint says. Hamzeh originally had planned to travel to Jordan to attack Israeli soldiers and civilians in the West Bank, but ditched those plans because of logistical issues and focused on attacking a target in the U.S., according to the criminal complaint. He hatched a plan to attack a Masonic center in Milwaukee with two others, who were actually the informants cooperating with the FBI. Last week, Hamzeh and the informants went to a local shooting range and practiced firing a handgun. Afterward, they went to the Masonic center and got a tour of the facility. Later, Hamzeh spoke with the informants in detail about the planned attack, according to the complaint. Detailed plan of attack During this meeting, which was recorded and translated from Arabic to English, Hamzeh, according to the complaint, said they needed three automatic weapons, each with a silencer, to launch the attack. According to the complaint: They would enter with clothes over their heads, he said. It was important to quietly kill the receptionist, the first person they were likely to see, Hamzeh said. \\"... If she was alone, it is OK, if there were two of them, shoot both of them, do not let the blood show, shoot her from the bottom, two or three shots in her stomach and let her sit on the chair and push her to the front, as if she is sleeping, did you understand?\\" After killing those at the door, one attacker would remain there, Hamzeh said. \\"...One of us will stay at the door at the entrance and lock the door down, he will be at the main door down, two will get to the lift (elevator) up, they will enter the room, and spray everyone in the room. The one who is standing downstairs will spray anyone he finds. We will shoot them, kill them and get out.\\" Hamzeh said each of them would have to kill everyone around him, \\"to annihilate everyone, there is no one left, I mean when we go into a room, we will be killing everyone, that's it, this is our duty.\\" The exit plan was to leave by the stairs and out the door, quietly and calmly. \\"We leave, as if there is nothing, no running, no panic, just regular walking.\\" Global reaction predicted He predicted the attack could bring global attention, the complaint states. \\"I am telling you, if this hit is executed, it will be known all over the world. Sure, all over the world, all the Mujahedeen will be talking and they will be proud of us.\\" Of the target, he said, according to the complaint: \\"They are all Masonic; they are playing with the world like a game, man, and we are like asses, we don't know what is going on, these are the ones who are fighting, these are the ones that needs to be killed, not the Shi'iat, because these are the ones who are against us, these are the ones who are making living for us like hell,\\" he said. \\"Thirty is excellent. If I got out, after killing thirty people, I will be happy 100% ... 100% happy, because these 30 will terrify the world.\\" Hamzeh met with undercover FBI agents on Monday. The undercover agents showed two weapons and a silencer to Hamzeh, and told him the weapons were capable of fully automatic fire, the complaint says. Hamzeh agreed to a price and paid it to the undercover agents, who then handed Hamzeh a bag containing two automatic weapons and a silencer. Hamzeh carried the bag to his car and put the bag in the trunk of the vehicle, the complaint states. He then was arrested. Robert J.

Context: A permissive society is a society in which social norms become increasingly liberal, especially with regard to sexual freedom. This usually accompanies a change in what is considered deviant. While typically preserving the rule \\"do not harm others\\" (harm principle/non-aggression principle), a permissive society would have few other moral or legal codes (no victimless crimes, for example). Hypothesis: A permissive society ends up becoming quite deviant. Choose from: * Yes. * It's impossible to say. * No.","output":"To draw an appropriate conclusion, let's analyze the context step by step: 1. The context defines a permissive society as one where social norms become increasingly liberal, especially in matters of sexual freedom. 2. This change usually accompanies a redefinition of what is considered deviant. 3. A permissive society typically follows the rule \\"do not harm others,\\" but has fewer moral and legal codes concerning victimless crimes. Given these points, we will evaluate if the hypothesis \\"A permissive society ends up becoming quite deviant\\" is valid. The term \\"deviant\\" refers to behavior that deviates from social norms. In the context, it's mentioned that what is considered deviant may change as the society becomes more permissive. Therefore, whether the society becomes deviant or not depends on what is accepted as the new social norm in that society. So, the conclusion we can draw from the context is: \\"It's impossible to say.\\" The hypothesis that a permissive society ends up becoming quite deviant cannot be confirmed or denied universally, as the degree of deviation depends on the evolving social norms within that specific society."},{"instruction":"You are given a new situation: Rob is a chemist with a pharmaceutical company. He is trying to devise a technique that would be able to control chemical reactions. For that, he conducted two tests. In the first test, he used warmer reactants. He called it reactant A. In the second test, he used cooler reactants. He called it reactant B. and a hint : When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage.

They say Qatar backs militant groups including so-called Islamic State (IS) and al-Qaeda, which Qatar denies. The Saudi state news agency SPA said Riyadh had closed its borders, severing land, sea and air contact with the tiny peninsula of oil-rich Qatar. Qatar called the decision \\"unjustified\\" and with \\"no basis in fact\\". The unprecedented move is seen as a major split between powerful Gulf countries, who are also close US allies. It comes amid heightened tensions between Gulf countries and their near-neighbour, Iran. The Saudi statement accused Qatar of collaborating with \\"Iranian-backed terrorist groups\\" in its restive eastern region of Qatif and in Bahrain. The diplomatic withdrawal was first put into motion by Bahrain, then Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt, Yemen, Libya's eastern-based government and the Maldives all followed suit. SPA cited officials as saying the decision was taken to \\"protect its national security from the dangers of terrorism and extremism\\". Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain have given all Qatari visitors and residents two weeks to leave their territory. The three countries have also banned their citizens from travelling to Qatar. However, Saudi Arabia says it will still allow Qataris to take part in the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. So far, there has been no sign of reciprocal moves by Qatar. In the latest developments: Why this row has erupted Food, flights and football at risk While the severing of ties was sudden, it has not come out of the blue, as tensions have been building for years, and particularly in recent weeks. Two weeks ago, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE blocked Qatari news sites, including Al Jazeera. Comments purportedly by Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani criticising Saudi Arabia had appeared on Qatari state media. The government in Doha dismissed the comments as fake, attributing the report to a \\"shameful cybercrime\\". Back in 2014, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE withdrew their ambassadors from Qatar for several months in protest over alleged interference in their affairs. 'A Qatarstrophe' - social media reacts All you need to know about Qatar The story behind Qatar 'hack' More broadly, two key factors drove Monday's decision: Qatar's ties to Islamist groups, and the role of Iran, Saudi Arabia's regional rival. While Qatar has joined the US coalition against IS, the Qatari government has repeatedly denied accusations from Iraq's Shia leaders that it provided financial support to IS. Wealthy individuals in the country are believed to have made donations and the government has given money and weapons to hardline Islamist groups in Syria. Qatar is also accused of having links to a group formerly known as the Nusra Front, an al-Qaeda affiliate. The SPA statement accused Qatar of backing these groups, as well as the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood - banned in Gulf countries as a terrorist organisation - and that it \\"promotes the message and schemes of these groups through their media constantly\\". Saudi Arabia itself is a key backer of Islamist rebels, including hardline jihadist groups, in Syria. Where key countries stand on IS Where does IS get its support? 2.7m population 2m of whom are men 11,437 sq km in size (4,416 sq miles) 77 years life expectancy (men) 80 years for women While on a visit to Riyadh two weeks ago, US President Donald Trump urged Muslim countries to take the lead in combating radicalisation, and blamed Iran for instability in the Middle East. \\"It seems that the Saudis and Emiratis feel emboldened by the alignment of their regional interests - toward Iran and Islamism - with the Trump administration,\\" Gulf analyst Kristian Ulrichsen told Reuters news agency. \\"[They] have decided to deal with Qatar's alternative approach on the assumption that they will have the [Trump] administration's backing.\\" Is Saudi to blame for IS? Saudi Arabia, too, has been accused of funding IS, either directly or by failing to prevent private donors from sending money to the group - allegations it denies. In recent days, British Prime Minister Theresa May has also come under pressure from election rivals to publish a report thought to focus on the funding of UK extremist groups by Saudi Arabia. Qatar, which is due to host the football World Cup in 2022, was critical of the decision. The foreign ministry said the decisions would \\"not affect the normal lives of citizens and residents\\". US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, speaking in Sydney, urged the countries to resolve their differences through dialogue. Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi said there was a need for \\"transparent dialogue and diplomacy\\", adding: \\"No country in the region will benefit from the heightened tension.\\" Qatar's stock market closed down 7.27%. One of the likely knock-on effects is on food stability: about 40% of Qatar's food is believed to come by lorry from Saudi Arabia. The Doha News newspaper reported that people had rushed to supermarkets to stock up on food and water. Nearly 90% of Qatar's population are migrant workers, many of whom are working on the construction boom fuelled by the successful World Cup bid. There have long been tensions not far beneath the surface. Qatar has often seemed out of step with its neighbours. It has tended, for example, to side with Islamist forces in the Middle East - like the Muslim Brotherhood, which is reviled by the Saudis and the current Egyptian leadership. Past efforts by the neighbours to pull the Qataris into line have had limited impact. But now Doha has suddenly come under much greater and more co-ordinated pressure. Emboldened by President Trump's trip two weeks ago, the Saudis and the Emiratis believe that this is the moment to make clear to Qatar that its divergent views will no longer be tolerated. And right now this small country's rulers will probably be feeling very lonely indeed.","output":"Several Middle East and African countries, including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, Yemen, Libya's eastern-based government, Bahrain and the Maldives, have severed land, sea and air contact with Qatar, which they accuse of supporting militant groups including Islamic State and al-Qaeda, and of compromising their national security."},{"instruction":"Aggression is behavior that is intended to cause harm or pain, and another form of aggressive behavior is known as territorial aggression.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Charles-Camille Saint-Saëns (French: [ʃaʁlkamij sɛ̃sɑ̃s]; 9 October 1835 – 16 December 1921) was a French composer, organist, conductor and pianist of the Romantic era. His best-known works include Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso (1863), the Second Piano Concerto (1868), the First Cello Concerto (1872), Danse macabre (1874), the opera Samson and Delilah (1877), the Third Violin Concerto (1880), the Third (\\"Organ\\") Symphony (1886) and The Carnival of the Animals (1886). Saint-Saëns was a musical prodigy; he made his concert debut at the age of ten. After studying at the Paris Conservatoire he followed a conventional career as a church organist, first at Saint-Merri, Paris and, from 1858, La Madeleine, the official church of the French Empire. After leaving the post twenty years later, he was a successful freelance pianist and composer, in demand in Europe and the Americas. As a young man, Saint-Saëns was enthusiastic for the most modern music of the day, particularly that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner, although his own compositions were generally within a conventional classical tradition. He was a scholar of musical history, and remained committed to the structures worked out by earlier French composers. This brought him into conflict in his later years with composers of the impressionist and dodecaphonic schools of music; although there were neoclassical elements in his music, foreshadowing works by Stravinsky and Les Six, he was often regarded as a reactionary in the decades around the time of his death. Saint-Saëns held only one teaching post, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse in Paris, and remained there for less than five years. It was nevertheless important in the development of French music: his students included Gabriel Fauré, among whose own later pupils was Maurice Ravel. Both of them were strongly influenced by Saint-Saëns, whom they revered as a genius. The answer to this question is:","output":"Gabriel Fauré and Maurice Ravel were the pupils who revered Saint-Saëns as a genius. Step 1: Identify the relevant information in the given context. The passage mentions that Saint-Saëns held only one teaching post at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse in Paris. Step 2: Locate the names of the students who studied under Saint-Saëns. In the text, it is stated that Gabriel Fauré was one of his students. Step 3: Identify any indirect students who were influenced by Saint-Saëns through their own teachers. The text states that Maurice Ravel was a pupil of Gabriel Fauré, who was himself a student of Saint-Saëns. Therefore, Ravel is an indirect pupil of Saint-Saëns. Step 4: Determine if these students revered Saint-Saëns as a genius. The passage explicitly states that both Fauré and Ravel revered Saint-Saëns as a genius.

The dramatic revelation came Monday during a court hearing in New York where lawyers for Cohen and Trump argued for permission to determine whether thousands of pages of documents FBI agents seized from Cohen last week should be subject to attorney-client privilege. U.S. District Court Judge Kimba Wood appeared to reject the idea, saying that a “taint team” created by prosecutors to set aside privileged documents is a “viable option,” while a court-appointed outside lawyer known as a “special master” may also play a role in determining which records can and cannot be viewed by prosecutors. The disclosure about Hannity, who also hosts a nationally syndicated talk radio show, came after prosecutors indicated that Cohen performed “little to no legal work” and had just one client: Trump. In response, Cohen’s lawyers said that Cohen has represented three clients in the past year — Trump, GOP fundraiser Elliott Broidy and a third “publicly prominent individual” who wished to remain anonymous. Cohen's lawyers identified Hannity as the third unnamed client only after Judge Wood ruled that it must be made public. In a statement, Hannity sought to minimize his relationship with Cohen, saying he had never retained him as a lawyer. “Michael Cohen has never represented me in any matter,” Hannity said. “I never retained him, received an invoice, or paid legal fees. I have occasionally had brief discussions with him about legal questions about which I wanted his input and perspective.\\" “I assumed those conversations were confidential, but to be absolutely clear they never involved any matter between me and a third-party,” Hannity said.

Should Walcott be charged by FA for taunting Spurs fans? Theo Walcott teased Tottenham Hotspur supporters with a 2-0 scoreline gesture as he was stretchered from the action during Arsenal’s FA Cup victory at the Emirates Stadium. The Gunners were leading thanks to goals from Santi Cazorla and Tomas Rosicky when, with seven minutes remaining, Walcott made the cheeky hand signal to the visiting fans. The Football Association may choose to take action against Walcott for his taunt, while Tottenham may also come under fire after their supporters showered him with objects. Cheeky: Theo Walcott leaves the game on a stretcher and reminds the Spurs fans of the 2-0 scoreline. All smiles: Walcott cannot hide his grin as he makes the gesture, to the delight of Arsenal's fans. Two good: Arsenal were comfortable victors as they booked their place in the fourth round. Satisfaction: Walcott continued to tease the visiting fans as he made his way around the pitch. They had responded with a hail of coins, as well as a lighter, a plastic cup and a bread bun. But Walcott, who had been forced off with a leg injury, appeared unconcerned and was smiling ear to ear despite the irritation caused. He then donned a scarf thrown to him by a member of the home support who were thrilled with their player's jibe. Walcott’s team-mate Wojciech Szczesny also got in on the act and posted a picture mimicking the gesture on his Instagram account. Handy: Wojciech Szczesny copies Walcott's cheeky gesture in this instagram post. Money shot: A matchday steward holds a handful of coins that were thrown in the direction of Walcott. Target: A lighter, a bread roll and a plastic cup were all hurled towards Walcott. The Football Association will wait until receiving the match report of referee Mark Clattenburg before deciding whether the Walcott incident warrants investigation. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, however, moved to diffuse the situation. 'The doctors said to me that the coins had been raining over his (Walcott's) head and they had to protect him, maybe that is why he did that. Yes (the coins came before the gesture) that is what I have been told,' said Wenger. 'After that, what he did is not offensive. You look for every single incident, I can understand that, but it is an action that didn't offend anybody. Angry: Some of the visiting fans were incensed by Walcott's cheeky scoreline. 'I have seen the pictures after the game and it does not even look aggressive, he is smiling.' Last month, Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere was suspended for two matches after television pictures showed him making an obscene hand gesture towards Manchester City supporters in the 6-3 defeat at Manchester City. Wenger, though, maintained this situation did not merit any disciplinary action. 'My response will be simple, they (FA) have seen the pictures on television. If they judge it offensive, what can I say?' the Arsenal boss added. Injury: Walcott was taken off on a stretcher towards the end of the FA Cup victory. Tottenham manager Tim Sherwood, meanwhile, revealed in his post-match press conference he had not witnessed the incidents. Sherwood said: 'Someone just mentioned it to me in there. I didn't see it. 'Is that what he did? Well, listen I don't know Theo, I don't know him as a lad. It could have been a bit of banter, possibly. 'If they (Tottenham fans) did then it's a problem, isn't it?

She thought that boys had what? Options: - arousal - disease - sweet - halatosis - cooties Reasoning process:","output":"Little Sarah, being a young girl, would most likely not be aware of concepts like arousal or halatosis and would not associate this with kissing boys. The term \\"sweet\\" is generally used positively, so it wouldn't make sense for her to think that boys shouldn't be kissed due to something positive. The term \\"cooties\\" is a common slang that young children use to describe a fictional contagious condition that they believe someone of the opposite sex has. This term is commonly used in a playful manner among kids and is likely Little Sarah's reasoning for not wanting to kiss boys. Therefore, Little Sarah thought that boys had cooties."},{"instruction":"Build a movie plot around this: Who will arrive for a dinner party? their uncle and his wife The answer to this question is:","output":"Title: \\"The Surprise Package\\" Plot Summary: Brad and Alice Harris, a young married couple living an ordinary suburban life in Boston, receive a surprising letter one day.

What dish was most likely included in the meal my mom and I ate ?","output":"From the information given in the passage, we can say that the author and their mother dined at a French restaurant in EPCOT, enjoying a 3-course French meal. While the passage does not specifically mention any dish, we can deduce the possibilities based on traditional French cuisine commonly featured in a 3-course meal. A traditional French meal typically consists of an appetizer or \\"entrée,\\" a main course or \\"plat principal,\\" and a dessert. Since we are asked about one dish, let's consider potential dishes for each of the three courses. Appetizer possibilities: 1. French Onion Soup: A rich soup made with onions, beef broth, and topped with melted Gruyère cheese on toasted bread. 2. Escargot: Snails cooked with garlic, butter, and parsley, typically served as a starter in French cuisine. 3. Ratatouille: A vegetable medley consisting of eggplant, zucchini, tomatoes, and bell peppers, slowly cooked in olive oil and flavored with herbs. Main course possibilities: 1. Coq au Vin: A traditional French dish made of braised chicken cooked in red wine, mushrooms, onions, and garlic, often served with potatoes or noodles. 2. Bouillabaisse: A fish stew that contains various types of fish and shellfish, simmered with vegetables, olive oil, and flavored with saffron, fennel, and other herbs. 3. Beef Bourguignon: A slow-cooked beef stew prepared with red wine, mushrooms, onions, and herbs, typically served with mashed potatoes or baguettes. Dessert possibilities: 1. Crème Brûlée: A rich custard made of cream, sugar, and egg yolks, topped with a layer of caramelized sugar. 2. Tarte Tatin: An upside-down caramelized apple tart made with puff pastry and served with whipped cream or ice cream. 3. Chocolate Soufflé: A decadent chocolate dessert with a light, airy texture that rises as it bakes, often served with a dusting of powdered sugar or a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Based on these common French dishes, it is most likely that the author and their mom enjoyed one of these dishes or similar French delicacies during their 3-course meal at the restaurant in EPCOT."},{"instruction":"Continue the following story. Felicia believed the stories Kayla told were just fiction, so","output":"she didn't pay much attention to them initially. The tales of mystical beings and hidden realms woven by Kayla during their nightly conversations were undeniably intriguing, but Felicia simply shrugged them off as mere musings of her friend's overactive imagination. As the days went on, however, Felicia began to notice some strange coincidences. The stories Kayla told seemed to align strikingly well with events unfolding in their small town. A sudden storm brewing over the horizon mirrored the exact description of the tempest conjured by the sorcerer in Kayla's tale. The mysterious disappearance of Mr. Thompson, the elderly florist, bore striking resemblance to the character who vanished without a trace in one of Kayla's stories. Felicia couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to these stories than she initially thought. She decided to confront Kayla about the troubling connections, hoping that her friend would have a rational explanation for the series of strange events. To her dismay, Kayla's response only raised greater alarm. Kayla admitted to Felicia that the stories she'd shared weren't simply figments of her imagination. Instead, they were snippets of memories from a parallel world that existed alongside their own. Kayla had discovered her ability to travel between the realms and had been secretly exploring the mystifying cosmos, unbeknownst to anyone. Felicia was dumbfounded and struggled to accept the truth in Kayla's words. As she wrestled with her skepticism, a part of her yearned to believe her friend. So, she put her doubts aside and asked Kayla to show her proof of this parallel world. That night, under a star-filled sky, Kayla took Felicia by the hand and led her deep into the heart of a dense forest. There, a shimmering portal appeared before them, pulsating with energy and beckoning them to enter. Felicia hesitated at first, but with Kayla's encouragement, she mustered the courage to take her first step into the unknown. Their arrival in the parallel world left Felicia breathless. The sights, sounds, and smells were like nothing she had ever experienced. Towering trees with iridescent leaves, fields of bioluminescent flowers, and peculiar creatures filled the landscape. Rivers and waterfalls flowed with glittering water, and the sky was painted in vibrant colors that were beyond comprehension. Together, Felicia and Kayla explored this enchanting realm and encountered the mystical beings that Kayla had once described – the graceful elves with their mesmerizing songs, the wizened sorcerers wielding powerful magics, and the wise guardians of the realm who vigilantly protected the balance between worlds. As Felicia continued to immerse herself in this new world, she discovered that she too had a unique gift – she was a Seer, blessed with the power to glimpse into the future. With Kayla as her guide, Felicia began to unlock her innate abilities and embrace her newfound purpose. Together, they embarked on a series of adventures that would take them to the farthest reaches of the parallel world. Through their journey, the girls would confront unimaginable challenges and encounter ancient evils that threatened the very fabric of the realms. Their alliance would grow stronger with each passing day as they relied on one another for survival and companionship. As they battled dark forces and unraveled the mysteries of the cosmos, Felicia and Kayla forged a bond that transcended space and time. They became defenders of the realms, guardians of the balance that held the multiverse together. Felicia, once the skeptic, was now an undeniable believer in Kayla's stories – for she had become a part of them herself. The once simple tales, dismissed as mere flights of fancy, had unveiled the truth of their existence. It was a truth that would forever connect Felicia and Kayla to a world that asked them to embrace the magic within themselves and to believe in the infinite possibilities that lay beyond their wildest imagination."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question.

Mono Paiutes gathered obsidian from the Mono–Inyo Craters to make sharp tools and arrow points. Unworked obsidian was carried by the Mono Paiutes over passes in the Sierra Nevada to trade with other Native American groups. Chips of Mono–Inyo obsidian can still be found at many ancient mountain campsites. Gold rush–related boomtowns sprang up near Mono Basin in the 19th century to exploit bonanzas. The largest of these, Bodie (north of Mono Lake), was founded in the late 1870s and grew large enough to need a tree mill, which was located at Mono Mills, immediately northeast of Mono Domes. Trees directly around the domes and on their slopes were felled to provide timber for the mill. As part of the California Water Wars, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power purchased large tracts of land in the 1930s within Mono Basin and Owens Valley in order to control water rights. Excavation of an 11.5-mile (18.5 km) water tunnel under the southern part of the Mono Craters dome complex started in 1934 and was completed in 1941. Tunnel workers had to deal with loose and often water-charged gravels, pockets of carbon dioxide gas and flooding. About one man was lost for each mile excavated. Water diverted from its natural outlet in Mono Lake passes through the tunnel on its way to the Los Angeles Aqueduct system. The United States Pumice Company, based in Chatsworth, California, has mined the area for pumice since 1941. The company markets the pumice in slabs for use in commercial scouring and in large irregular chunks sold as yard decoration.Apollo 16's John Young and Charlie Duke did some of their geologic training here in June 1971. William R. Muehlberger was one of the geology instructors.Exploratory drilling for geothermal power occurred near the Mono Craters on the south shore of Mono Lake in 1971. The wells did not show promising results, so the effort was abandoned., can you guess it ?

Let's break down both sentences: Sentence 1: \\"Ashley was born on 1 November 1986 and is a contemporary dancer from Arizona who originally grew up in Los Angeles.\\" In this sentence, it is stated that Ashley is a contemporary dancer from Arizona. The phrase \\"from Arizona\\" leads us to understand that her contemporary dance career or her identity as a dancer is associated with Arizona. Moreover, it is mentioned that she originally grew up in Los Angeles. This implies that she spent a significant part of her childhood or formative years in Los Angeles before moving to Arizona. Sentence 2: \\"Ashley was born on 1 November 1986 and is a contemporary dancer from Los Angeles who originally grew up in Arizona.\\" In this sentence, it is stated that Ashley is a contemporary dancer from Los Angeles.

Furthermore, it is mentioned that she originally grew up in Arizona. This implies that she spent a significant portion of her childhood or formative years in Arizona before moving to Los Angeles. To sum up, both sentences share the same information about Ashley's birth date and her career as a contemporary dancer. However, the differences lie in the locations associated with her dance career and where she grew up. In the first sentence, her dance career is associated with Arizona, and she grew up in Los Angeles.

The sentence \\"loses sight of its own story\\" suggests that the film has shortcomings when it comes to its narrative. The phrase \\"loses sight\\" implies that the movie could not maintain a strong focus on the central plot or core message throughout its duration. This kind of critique could indicate various problems with the movie, such as weak character development, inconsistencies in the story arc, or the presence of confusing subplots that detract from the main storyline. As the film fails to remain cohesive and engaging, it is likely to lead to a less enjoyable and more frustrating viewing experience. Consequently, the reviewer's sentiment seems to be largely unfavorable. However, it is important to keep in mind that this single sentence does not provide an exhaustive evaluation of the movie. A comprehensive review might explore other aspects, such as visuals, cinematography, performances, or soundtrack, to provide a more balanced evaluation.

Billie Jean King emerged victorious in this historic battle, winning in straight sets 6-4, 6-3, 6-3. The Battle of the Sexes was a significant event in the sports world, as well as in the broader fight for gender equality in the 1970s. Leading up to the match, Bobby Riggs, then 55 years old and a former World No.1 tennis player, claimed that no female player could beat him. He had already defeated Margaret Court, another female tennis star, earlier in the year, and challenged Billie Jean King to a match in an effort to prove male superiority in sports. Billie Jean King, a 29-year-old top-ranked female tennis player, with 12 Grand Slam titles by that time, accepted the challenge. The stakes were high for the match, with a 100,000 winner-takes-all prize. But more importantly, the clash was a cultural event that drew attention to gender equality, both on and off the sports field. The match itself attracted widespread media coverage, with over 30,000 spectators at the Houston Astrodome and an estimated 90 million viewers watching the live broadcast worldwide. In a tactical battle, King demonstrated her skill and strength, dominating Riggs throughout the encounter. Riggs, who earlier claimed that he could beat King with his left hand, couldn't keep up with the pace and lost in straight sets. King's victory in the Battle of the Sexes had far-reaching consequences. It was a moment of empowerment for women in sports and paved the way for greater recognition and equal pay for female athletes. Additionally, the match served as a crucial step in the public perception of the Women's Liberation Movement, transcending barriers in the fight for equal opportunities for women in general. While the Battle of the Sexes match did not singlehandedly resolve gender disparities in sports, it helped to ignite conversations about these issues and served as a landmark moment in the broader push for women's rights. Today, the legacy of the match lives on, with Billie Jean King remaining an influential figure and an advocate for gender equality, both in sports and society as a whole."},{"instruction":"Is \\"Clegg denied that the Queen made such a statement, and a Buckingham Palace spokesperson confirmed that a complaint had been made to the Independent Press Standards Organisation over a breach of guidelines relating to accuracy.\\" a good answer to the question \\"Who refuted the statement that the Queen was critical of the European Union?\\"","output":"Yes, this sentence provides a good answer to the question \\"Who refuted the statement that the Queen was critical of the European Union?\\" Here's why: 1.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose feeling more depressed happens, how will it affect More copper wire is wrapped around the metal. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"No, the supposed perturbation of feeling more depressed does not have any direct or indirect effect on the process of creating an electromagnet. The process of creating an electromagnet is purely based on physics and is independent of the emotional state of a person. The process of creating an electromagnet can be broken down into the following steps: 1. A conductive copper wire is wrapped around a piece of ferromagnetic (iron, nickel, or cobalt) core, such as an iron nail. 2. An electric current is introduced from a power source, such as a battery, which then flows through the copper wire. 3. As the current flows through the wire, a magnetic field gets created around it. 4. The magnetic field generated by the flow of current in the wire magnetizes the ferromagnetic core. 5. When the electric current is turned off or disconnected, the magnetic field collapses, and the metal core loses its magnetism. The emotional state of feeling more depressed does not have any effect on the physics of this process or the ability of the copper wire to create a magnetic field. The entire operation is determined by the flow of the electric current, the magnetic properties of the core, and the interaction between the current and the magnetic field. It is essential to separate emotional factors from the scientific principles that govern the creation of electromagnets. The emotional state will not impact the scientific process and its outcomes."},{"instruction":"How can I get peace of mind? How do I find peace of mind?

It is the story of two competing projects, one carried out by the city-dweller Jean Cadoret, and the other by the peasant Ugolin, set in the rustic and picturesque environment of Provence in the 1920s. It is a story of opposites: the city versus the country, modernity versus traditional, good versus bad, and memory versus oblivion.\\"Manon des Sources,\\" takes place some ten years after \\"Jean de Florette\\", also in the village of \\"les Bastides\\" and the surrounding hills. Ugolin's carnation-growing business is prospering, as inferred when he sells his flowers to a retailer who complains about their high prices. Manon (Emmanuelle Béart) is now a beautiful, wild shepherdess, spending her time in the hills and valleys of the area, tending her flock of goats. She totally ignores \\"les Bastides,\\" and the villagers aware of her presence, reciprocate, calling her \\"la sauvageonne\\" - the wild child. She lives with her mother and Baptistine (Margarita Lozano), at \\"le Plantier.\\" A new character is introduced, the new village school teacher, Bernard Olivier (Hippolyte Girardot) who is also an amateur mineralogist.One day while hunting in the hills, Ugolin (Daniel Auteuil), comes across Manon who is dancing nude, playing a tune on her father's harmonica. This is the proverbial love-at-first-sight. Too shy to approach Manon directly, he continues to spy on her, following her in the hills. He sets traps to capture birds and rabbits, which he then places in her traps as gifts. From then on, Ugolin is obsessed with Manon. César Soubeyran (Yves Montand), \\"le Papet,\\", who had been pushing a reluctant Ugolin to marry in order to continue the Soubeyran line, is thrilled when Ugolin finally confesses, although in a rather unusual manner, his matrimonial intentions.

Herring (lyrics and vocals). The band was formed in January 2006 by Welmers, Cashion and Herring--the remaining members of the performance art college band Art Lord & the Self-Portraits--and drummer Erick Murillo. Murillo left in November 2007, after which the band relocated to Baltimore, MD, and released the debut album Wave Like Home through British label Context: When Art Lord & the Self Portraits disbanded in late 2005, its members forgot they had discussed with alt-country band The Texas Governor the possibility of touring together. Future Islands was formed in early 2006 to keep that commitment, with an original line-up consisting of Cashion, Herring, Welmers and Erick Murillo--bassist for The Kickass --who played an electronic drum kit. Already as Art Lord & the Self-Portraits, the band wanted to change their image and took this opportunity to do so. William Cashion stated: \\"Me and Gerrit had been talking for a while about how we wanted to get rid of the gimmick. We wanted to be taken seriously. Our songs had outgrown the gimmick that the band was made on. The songs were starting to deal with bigger, personal, universal themes. We wanted to be taken seriously.\\" The band played their first show on February 12, 2006 at an anti-Valentine's Day party in a venue called the Turducken house, opening for about a dozen bands. After writing 6-7 songs in only one week, they had to come up with a new name quickly, narrowing it down to two choices--Future Shoes and Already Islands--and combining them into one. Future Islands self-released the EP Little Advances on April 28, 2006 which they recorded in March 2006. A couple of months later, Herring dropped out college and left Greenville to deal with a substance abuse problem he had acquired: In June, I left town and didn't come back. It was just drug problems, man. I got sucked into the darkness of partying and shit college kids do. I came clean to my parents and said, 'Look, I have a problem and need your help.' I stayed at my parent's for about a month and then moved across the state to Asheville, North Carolina. It took about a year for me to get my act together. The band still continued and on January 6, 2007 they self-released a split CD with Welmers' solo project Moss of Aura, recorded in December 2006. Question: When was Future Islands formed?

Sleep is a fundamental biological process that allows the body and mind to recover, consolidate memories, and maintain proper functioning. During sleep, several essential physiological processes occur, such as tissue growth and repair, energy restoration, and the release of important hormones. Over time, there have been various experiments performed on animals and humans to better understand the consequences of sleep deprivation. These studies have demonstrated negative effects on cognitive performance, mood, immune system function, and overall health. Prolonged sleep deprivation can lead to hallucinations, memory problems, weakened immunity, and in some cases, even death. Taking all of this into consideration, the answer is no, a human cannot survive indefinitely without sleeping. The negative effects of sleep deprivation on both physical health and cognitive function make it clear that sleep is a necessary component for survival and wellbeing."},{"instruction":"Produce a sentence which mentions all of these concepts: giraffe, pen, walk, zoo","output":"First, I will start forming the sentence by mentioning the giraffe and the zoo, other concepts will be included in the following steps.

So, which is the best bike for you? If you're traveling to work, a folding bike such as one of the models here is suitable unless you're cycling more than a couple of miles, in which case it might be uncomfortable . You can take a fold-up on the train and as it goes indoors with you, it's secure . For longer journeys, a road bike with drop handlebars and narrow tyres is a good choice. Try Specialized, from PS400. Note that the riding position encourages you to look downwards, which can be dangerous. Mountain bikes are best suited to off-road travel; their fat and strong tyres are good for climbing steep, muddy slopes . Good brands include Trek and Giant, with prices starting at less than PS300. A hybrid bike (halfway between a mountain bike and a road bike) is a good compromise with more upright riding position and thin, fast tyres. Ridgeback makes great hybrids, from around PS350. For a classic sit-up-and-beg bike, it's still hard to beat Pashley, which makes its bikes by hand. Expect to pay around PS500. Once you've picked your bike, sizing is crucial or you may suffer back or neck pain. A famous bike shop will help you choose the right size frame. The height of the seat should be adjusted carefully---again, a good shop will advise. If you only plan to cycle once or twice a month, you can choose a lower-priced bike, but for regular use, paying more means better quality: cheaper bikes need more frequent adjustment of brakes and gears ---and tend to be heavier, too. Finally, items such as mudguards aren't always included. Options: A A road bike. B A mountain bike. C A folding bike. D A hybrid bike. Answer: C A folding bike.

The story is set in 490 BC, the time of the Medic Wars, during which Persian armies sweep through the Ancient world. Having brought home to Athens the Olympic victor's laurel crown, Phillippides becomes commander of the Sacred Guard, which is expected to defend the city-state's liberty, a year after the expulsion of the tyrant Hippias. Athenian supporters of Hippias conspire, hoping to sideline Phillippides with a marriage to Theocrites' expensive servant Charis, and thus neutralize the guard. She fails to seduce him, as his heart is already taken by a young girl before he learns her name is Andromeda, daughter of Creuso. Everything personal is likely to be put on hold when the news breaks that the vast army of Darius, the Persian King of Kings, is marching on Greece, hoping that its internal division will make its conquest a walk-over. Theocrites instructs Miltiades to hold back the Sacred Guard to defend the temple of Pallas after a likely defeat, and proposes instead to negotiate terms with Darius, but is told an alliance with Sparta could save the Hellenic nation. Phillippides makes the journey and survives an attempt on his life by conspirators; he returns with Sparta's engagement during the Persian attack in far greater numbers on Militiades valiant troops. Charis, left for dead after overhearing Darius's orders, reaches the camp to tell that the Persian fleet, now commanded by the traitor Theocrites, is heading for the Piraeus to take Athens. Miltiades sends Phillippides ahead to hold out with the Sacred Guard until his hopefully victorious troops arrive, and after his perilous journey back they successfully beat back the Persians.

The opening sentence recognizes a potential evolution in Obama's stance regarding meeting with Iran, suggesting a shift or development in his approach to these discussions. The second sentence highlights the argument that it would be imprudent for a country to agree to significant preconditions prior to negotiations, as these very preconditions would be the main subject of the discussions themselves. In other words, accepting certain demands beforehand would render the need for negotiations redundant and weaken the position of the country agreeing to the preconditions. Next, the argument emphasizes that it is unlikely for any nation to accept conditions that would compromise its bargaining power during negotiations. This idea supports the notion that countries should maintain a strong stance in order to achieve favorable outcomes in diplomatic discussions. The reference to \\"Klein, Rick\\" possibly implies that the subsequent information or ideas are attributed to the aforementioned individual. However, without further context, it is unclear who Rick Klein is and how his thoughts contribute to the argument. Lastly, the argument articulates the consequences of countries like North Korea or Iran agreeing to vital preconditions, such as suspending development of nuclear weapons or enrichment programs. The statement suggests that if these countries accepted such terms before a meeting with the United States, they would be left with a significantly weaker negotiating position compared to the US.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose \\"acid rain is absorbed into the earths soil with aluminum\\" happens, how will it affect LESS damage by acid rain. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"If acid rain is absorbed into the earth's soil with aluminum, it may result in less damage by acid rain. However, the supposed perturbation would still have some direct and indirect effects on the process: Direct effects: 1. The leaching of aluminum from clay particles in soil may be reduced, as the acid rain is already absorbed with aluminum. This could potentially lessen the amount of aluminum that flows into streams and lakes, reducing the damage done to aquatic life. Indirect effects: 1. The acid rain may still dissolve minerals and nutrients in soil, washing them away so plants can't benefit from them. This would still lead to a negative impact on plant growth and health. 2. Soil and water pH could still be affected, as the acid rain would still introduce acidity into the soil, which might still harm or kill plants and animals. 3. Acid rain in fog at higher elevations may still strip foliage off trees, causing damage to forests. In summary, the supposed perturbation of acid rain being absorbed into the earth's soil with aluminum could potentially cause less damage by reducing the leaching of aluminum from clay particles in soil. However, other harmful effects of acid rain, such as the dissolving of minerals and nutrients in soil, the change in pH levels, and the impact on forests, would still be present."},{"instruction":"Continue writing the following text. The brakes on the Ford Focus need to be changed, but the tires are fine because the","output":"tread depth is still within the recommended range. In order to complete this task properly, it is essential to follow a few important steps. Step 1: Gather the necessary tools and supplies To change the brakes on a Ford Focus, one would need the appropriate tools and supplies. This includes a jack, jack stands, a lug wrench, a socket wrench, pliers, a torque wrench, a rubber mallet, and the replacement brake pads or rotor, if needed. Also, ensure that you have a safe, flat surface to work on. Step 2: Raise the vehicle Before starting any work, make sure the vehicle is on a flat surface with the parking brake engaged. Use the jack to lift the vehicle and place it on jack stands for extra security. Be sure to chock the wheels to prevent any possible movement. Step 3: Remove the tire Use the lug wrench to loosen the lug nuts in a star pattern and then remove the tire. Set it aside, ensuring it is out of the workspace. Step 4: Inspect the brake components Examine the brake caliper, brake pads, rotor, and other components for wear and tear. In this case, we know that the brake pads need to be changed. If the rotor is damaged or has deep grooves, it should be replaced as well. Step 5: Remove the brake caliper Use the socket wrench to remove the bolts holding the brake caliper in place. After it's loose, use pliers to carefully remove the caliper without damaging the brake line. Hang the caliper using a wire or string so that it doesn't dangle and put stress on the brake line. Step 6: Replace the brake pads Remove the old brake pads from the caliper bracket. It's a good practice to clean the caliper bracket with a wire brush before installing the new pads. Apply brake grease to the contact points of the new brake pads to help reduce noise. Install the new brake pads by placing them in the caliper bracket. Step 7: Reinstall the brake caliper If necessary, use a caliper piston tool or a C-clamp to push the piston back into the caliper. Carefully reinstall the brake caliper over the new brake pads and tighten the bolts using the torque wrench according to the manufacturer's specifications. Step 8: Reattach the tire Place the tire back onto the wheel studs and hand-tighten the lug nuts. Lower the vehicle and remove the jack stands. Then, use the lug wrench to tighten the lug nuts in a star pattern, ensuring they are properly secured. Step 9: Test the brakes Start the engine and press the brake pedal a few times to ensure proper brake pressure. Once confident that the brakes are functioning correctly, take the vehicle for a slow and careful test drive, making sure the brakes respond well and there is no unusual noise. By following these steps, the brakes on the Ford Focus will now be changed successfully. Keep in mind to periodically check the tire tread depth to maintain optimal performance and safety."},{"instruction":"Q:Information: - The 2000 Cannes Film Festival started on 14 May and ran until 25 May.

Located 320 light years away in the constellation of Centaurus the planet, known as HD 131399Ab, goes one better than Luke Skywalker’s home planet of Tatooine in the film Star Wars, which famously boasted two sunrises. But the triple-sun system is far from simple – HD 131399Ab orbits around only the brightest of the three stars which is thought to be around 80% more massive than our own sun. The other two stars, it is thought, are rapidly spinning around each other, with all three stars in orbit around the system’s centre of mass. The upshot is that an observer on the planet would experience up to three sunrises at certain times of year, while at other times they would be bathed in constant daylight. “You could see sunsets and sunrises of three stars, or could see single stars rising or setting,” said Daniel Apai, a co-author of the research from the University of Arizona. “The stars have different temperatures which gives them different colours so there would be a bluer, a yellower and a redder star,” he added. While a handful of planets are currently known to exist in three-star systems, the 16-million-year-old HD 131399Ab is one of the youngest planets to be discovered outside our solar system. What’s more its proposed orbit is the widest ever seen for an exoplanet in a multi-star system, taking an estimated 550 Earth years for the planet to travel around the brightest star, with a radius around 80 times the distance of the Earth from the sun. “What makes this system special is that the orbit of the planet is so long that [it] also feels the influence of the other stars,” said Apai. “If it would be a little bit longer, then these other two stars could wrestle the planet away.” Quite how it ended up in such an orbit is something of a puzzle. “It is possible that it formed pretty much where it is now, but it is not something our models would predict,” said Apai. Other possibilities, he says, are that it formed close to the brightest star and was kicked into its current orbit by a bigger planet, or that it formed near the other two stars and was later ejected, ending up on its current path. “We should be able to figure this out soon and in either case the results will be exciting,” said Apai. Published in the journal Science by an international team of astronomers, the study reveals how HD 131399Ab was discovered from ground-based observations using the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope in Chile with a device known as the Spectro-Polarimetric High-Contrast Exoplanet Research Instrument. The set-up allows astronomers to take a direct image of exoplanets, provided they orbit far enough away from their star and are hot enough to allow detection by thermal imaging. The approach, says Apai, offers advantages over instruments such Nasa’s Kepler Space Observatory which looks for a dip in the light intensity of a star as an indirect clue that a planet is passing in front of it. “This system, in contrast, is one where we have actually taken an image and we see three stars and we can see the planet itself,” he said. But the technique had seldom been used to explore multiple star systems as it was previously thought unlikely that a planet would be found at the necessary distance. “We were only looking around single stars because we had made the assumption that the planets had formed where we found them,” said Zoë Leinhardt, a computational astrophysicist at the University of Bristol who was not involved in the study. “What [the authors] are suggesting is that the planet didn’t form where they found it but that it moved there,” she added. The research also provides intriguing insights into the nature of the newly discovered planet. A gas giant, it is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with an upper atmosphere that contains a mix of water and methane. Below that, the researchers predict, are clouds of tiny silicate grains, with the deeper regions of the atmosphere boasting clouds of liquid iron. Thought to have a mass four times that of Jupiter, the planet has temperature of about 850K (577 degrees celsius) which is far cooler than other exoplanets detected using the same technique. While the team are still working out how the planet ended up in its current orbit, its discovery, they say, suggests that the range of planetary systems present in the universe is far wider than we thought. Leinhardt agrees. “This is another example of a system that was ignored because we assumed we understood something,” she said. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"This news article is about a planet with three suns that has been spotted by astronomers. This planet is called HD 131399Ab and is located 320 light years away in the constellation of Centaurus. It is a gas giant and is four times the size of Jupiter.

Establish the context: The Second Temple Period in Jewish history spans from 530 BCE to 70 CE. During this time, the Second Temple in Jerusalem was the center of Jewish religious life. 2. Identify Jewish ritualistic practices: During the Second Temple Period, various Jewish rituals revolved around purification and spiritual cleansing. One such practice is the mikvah, a ritual bath that Jews immersed themselves in for purification purposes. 3. Assess similarity with baptism: The mikvah and early Christian baptism share similarities, as both involve immersion in water and signify spiritual cleansing. 4. Identify John the Baptist's influence: John the Baptist, a Jewish preacher and prophetic figure in the New Testament, emerged during the Second Temple Period. He performed water immersion rituals, known as baptisms, to symbolize repentance and forgiveness of sins. As John baptized Jesus, this marked a significant transition from Jewish rituals to Christian practices. 5. Examine the historical connection: Early Christianity, which includes the baptism practice, emerged from a Jewish context. Jesus and his disciples were Jews who participated in Jewish rituals. Early Christianity is, therefore, rooted in the theological and cultural context of the Second Temple Period. Based on the reasoning process above, it is generally verifiable that the baptism practice emerged from Jewish ritualistic practices during the Second Temple Period. However, further research may be needed to delve deeper into the development and nuances of these rituals."},{"instruction":"I heard that Aubrey thought Jesse was sick and brought her flowers at her home that evening. And I was wondering How would Jesse feel as a result? Answer:","output":"To determine how Jesse would feel as a result, let's consider the situation step-by-step and empathize with her perspective: 1. First, Aubrey thinks Jesse is sick. This means Aubrey is concerned for Jesse's well-being and wants to show she cares. 2. Aubrey brings flowers to Jesse's home. Flowers are a common gesture of kindness, empathy, and support when someone is unwell or going through a difficult period. By bringing flowers, Aubrey is showing she cares for Jesse and is willing to spend her time and resources to buy the flowers. 3. Aubrey visits Jesse at her home in the evening, rather than waiting until a potentially more convenient time. This indicates to Jesse that Aubrey has genuinely prioritized her well-being. Considering the above steps, Jesse is likely to feel a combination of gratitude, appreciation, and warmth towards Aubrey. She might also feel emotional, comforted, and cared for, knowing that Aubrey took the time and effort to visit her, show concern, and bring a thoughtful gift when she was not feeling well.

Article: For grown-ups,an afternoon snooze is often easier said than done.But many of us have probably experienced just how simple it can be to catch some sleep in a gently rocking hammock .By examining brain waves in sleeping adults,researchers reported in the June 21issue of Current Biology,a Cell Press publication,that they now have evidence to explain why that is. \\"It is a common belief that rocking causes sleep:we fall asleep in a rocking chair soon and,since ancient times,we cradle our babies to sleep,\\"said Sophie Schwartz of the University of Geneva.\\"Yet,how this works had remained a mystery.The goal of our study was made up of two parts:to test whether rocking does indeed improve sleep,and to understand how this might work at the brain level.\\" Schwartz,Michel Muhlethaler,and their colleagues Laurence Bayer and Irina Constantinescu asked twelve adult volunteers to nap on a custom-made bed or\\"experimental hammock\\"that could either remain still or rock gently.All participants were good sleepers who didn't typically nap and did not suffer from excessive sleepiness during the day.Each participant took two 45-minute afternoon naps,one with the bed still and one with the bed in motion,while their brain activity was monitored. \\"We observed a faster transition to sleep in each and every subject in the swinging condition,\\"Muhlethaler said.\\"Surprisingly,we also observed a dramatic boosting of certain types of sleep-related brain waves.\\" More specifically,rocking increased the length of stage N2sleep,a form of non-rapid eye movement sleep that normally occupies about half of a good night's sleep.The rocking bed also had a lasting effect on brain activity,increasing slow brain waves and bursts of activity known as sleep spindles . Schwartz and Muhlethaler say the next step is to find out whether rocking can improve longer periods of sleep and to find out whether it may be useful for the treatment of sleep disorders,such as insomnia . Question: What can we learn from Sophie Schwartz's words? Answer: The answer is:","output":"From Sophie Schwartz's words, we can learn that rocking is believed to cause sleep, as evidenced by people falling asleep in rocking chairs and cradling babies to sleep.

They are studying bacteria: Bob studies nitrogen fixating bacteria, while Andy studies non-respiratory and facultative anaerobes. Which researcher learned less about sulfate reduction? Hint: In many ways, bacterial metabolism provides traits that are useful for ecological stability and for human society. One example is that some bacteria have the ability to fix nitrogen gas using the enzyme nitrogenase. This environmentally important trait can be found in bacteria of most metabolic types listed above. This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively. Bacterial metabolic processes are also important in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste. Facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves. A:","output":"To determine which researcher learned less about sulfate reduction, we will analyze the research subjects of both Bob and Andy. Bob studies nitrogen fixating bacteria. Nitrogen fixation is a process that can be found in bacteria of most metabolic types including those involved in sulfate reduction. Although his primary focus may not be on sulfate-reducing bacteria, there is a possibility that some of the nitrogen-fixing bacteria he studies may also participate in sulfate reduction. Andy studies non-respiratory and facultative anaerobes. Non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation, which doesn't involve sulfate reduction. Facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors, but sulfate reduction is not explicitly mentioned as part of their metabolic processes. Based on this information, we can infer that Andy, who studies non-respiratory and facultative anaerobes, likely learned less about sulfate reduction compared to Bob who studies nitrogen-fixating bacteria, which might participate in sulfate reduction."},{"instruction":"What are the most important words in the following sentence: a long queue of people waiting to cast their vote for the regional election .","output":"The most important words in the sentence are \\"queue,\\" \\"people,\\" \\"cast,\\" \\"vote,\\" and \\"regional election.\\" These words tell you that there is a line of people who are waiting to vote in an election for their area."},{"instruction":"They face Cowell's Britain's Got Talent co-star David Walliams alongside his X Factor colleague Cheryl Fernandez-Versini in a new TV judge category.

Tracy drives 20 miles more than twice Michelle, and Michelle drives 3 times the amount that Katie drives. How many miles does Michelle drive? Think carefully first, then make a decision:","output":"Let's use variables to represent the number of miles each person drives: Let T represent the number of miles Tracy drives. Let M represent the number of miles Michelle drives. Let K represent the number of miles Kati drives. Now let's translate the given information into equations: 1. Tracy drives 20 miles more than twice Michelle: T = 2M + 20 2. Michelle drives 3 times the amount that Kati drives: M = 3K 3. The total distance driven by all three is 1000 miles: T + M + K = 1000 Now we have a system of three equations with three variables. To solve the system, we can eliminate variables by substitution. First, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to eliminate Michelle: T = 2(3K) + 20 T = 6K + 20 Next, we can substitute this expression for Tracy and the expression for Michelle from equation 2 back into the third equation: (6K + 20) + (3K) + K = 1000 10K + 20 = 1000 Now we solve for K: 10K = 980 K = 98 Now that we have Kati's distance, we can find Michelle's distance using equation 2: M = 3K M = 3(98) M = 294 Michelle drives 294 miles."},{"instruction":"How does the sentence end?

The graph in Figure below shows how the number of T cells typically declines over a period of many years following the initial HIV infection. As the number of T cells decreases, so does the ability of the immune system to defend the body. As a result, an HIV-infected person develops frequent infections. Medicines can slow down the virus but not get rid of it, so there is no cure at present for HIV infections or AIDS. There also is no vaccine to immunize people against HIV infection, but scientists are working to develop one. Paragraph: A doctor tested two people for HIV.

The Carthaginian Empire was founded by Phoenician settlers from Tyre (in modern-day Lebanon) around 814 BCE and became a powerful center of trade and culture throughout the Mediterranean. The city of Carthage itself was situated on a promontory with a natural harbor, which facilitated its maritime dominance and economic growth. Carthage played a significant role in ancient history and was particularly famous for its conflicts with Rome, known as the Punic Wars (264-146 BCE). After three major wars and several smaller-scale conflicts, Carthage was eventually defeated by the Romans in the Third Punic War, and the city was destroyed in 146 BCE. Rome then established a new city on the ruins of Carthage, which eventually became an important city in the Roman Empire.

CHAPTER XIII. THE HOUSE ON THE HILL There was a little unfailing spring, always icy cold and crystal pure, in a certain birch-screened hollow of Rainbow Valley in the lower corner near the marsh. Not a great many people knew of its existence. The manse and Ingleside children knew, of course, as they knew everything else about the magic valley. Occasionally they went there to get a drink, and it figured in many of their plays as a fountain of old romance. Anne knew of it and loved it because it somehow reminded her of the beloved Dryad's Bubble at Green Gables. Rosemary West knew of it; it was her fountain of romance, too. Eighteen years ago she had sat behind it one spring twilight and heard young Martin Crawford stammer out a confession of fervent, boyish love. She had whispered her own secret in return, and they had kissed and promised by the wild wood spring. They had never stood together by it again--Martin had sailed on his fatal voyage soon after; but to Rosemary West it was always a sacred spot, hallowed by that immortal hour of youth and love. Whenever she passed near it she turned aside to hold a secret tryst with an old dream--a dream from which the pain had long gone, leaving only its unforgettable sweetness. The spring was a hidden thing. You might have passed within ten feet of it and never have suspected its existence. Two generations past a huge old pine had fallen almost across it. Nothing was left of the tree but its crumbling trunk out of which the ferns grew thickly, making a green roof and a lacy screen for the water.

This means that when a group of people is constantly treated as less important or not as good as others, it can increase the chances of violence turning into something much more severe and harmful called genocide."},{"instruction":"A friend asked me to answer this question: Whose husband is a wealthy businessman?, using the article: Down-on-his-luck Los Angeles architect and builder Edward Shaw is approached by Doris Hillman with a business proposal: buying land together, on which he would build houses that she would then sell, using her experience as a former real estate broker. Her husband, Gus Hillman, a wealthy businessman, would be willing to contribute half a million dollars as capital for the venture. Doris quickly seems interested in more than a purely professional relationship. Shaw starts an affair with her and accepts the business offer. However, an accidental discovery leaves him convinced that the Hillmans' interest lies less in the long-term profits of the venture than in the 175,000 key man insurance policy he took on himself as a precondition for the deal, and that an attempt on his life is imminent. Madge, the younger sister of Doris, develops a romantic interest in Shaw as well. Without knowing what Doris has planned, she reveals to Shaw that her sister was married previously to a man who died in Wyoming when his car crashed over a bridge. Shaw ends up drugged by Gus Hillman and barely keeps his car from going off a cliff. The police are skeptical about his story and the insurance company refuses to cancel the policy, Hillman having portrayed Shaw as a man who is trying to steal his wife. Madge teams with Shaw to try to foil her sister's scheme, but Doris lures him to a mountain cabin and shoots him with a gun. A wounded Shaw sees both Hillmans struggle then fall to their deaths through a clifftop doorway, just minutes before Madge and the cops arrive., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The answer to the question \\"Whose husband is a wealthy businessman?\\" is Doris Hillman. In the given article, it is stated that her husband, Gus Hillman, is a wealthy businessman who is willing to contribute half a million dollars as capital for a venture in which Edward Shaw, the down-on-his-luck Los Angeles architect and builder, would be involved. Specifically, Doris Hillman proposes a business idea to Edward Shaw which involves them buying land together, and Shaw would build houses on this land. Doris, with her experience as a former real estate broker, would then sell these houses. The businessman in question is Gus Hillman, who is willing to financially support this venture with a significant sum of money. However, unbeknownst to Edward Shaw initially, it seems that the Hillmans' primary interest in the business venture might be related to the potential financial gain from a 175,000 key man insurance policy on Shaw's life, rather than the potential long-term profits of their partnership. Throughout the course of the story, both personal and professional relationships become entangled, with Doris and Edward starting an affair, and Doris's younger sister, Madge, also developing a romantic interest in Edward. As the plot unfolds, it reveals multiple layers of deception and manipulation, eventually leading to a climax of violence and tragedy for the Hillmans, while Edward Shaw, wounded but ultimately surviving, manages to escape their plan with the help of Madge."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Information: - Wang Mang (c. 45 6 October 23 AD), courtesy name Jujun (), was a Han Dynasty official who seized the throne from the Liu family and founded the Xin (or Hsin, meaning \\"renewed\\") Dynasty (), ruling 923 AD. The Han dynasty was restored after his overthrow, and his rule marks the separation between the Western Han Dynasty (before Xin) and Eastern Han Dynasty (after Xin). Some historians have traditionally viewed Wang as a usurper, while others have portrayed him as a visionary and selfless social reformer. Though a learned Confucian scholar who sought to implement the harmonious society he saw in the classics, his efforts ended in chaos. - Han Xuan was a minor warlord and the Administrator ( ) of Changsha ( ) commandery during the late Han Dynasty . He served under Liu Biao , governor of Jing Province , for three years . After Liu Biao 's death , the northern part of Jing Province was divided between two of Liu Biao 's sons , Liu Qi and Liu Cong . The southern portion was divided between four Administrators , Zhao Fan , Jin Xuan , Liu Du and Han Xuan . Eventually , Changsha became an independent region under Han Xuan , and his land remained undisturbed by the other warlords for two years . Then in 210 , Liu Bei invaded Jing Province , capturing all the lands from their leaders . - The Han dynasty was the second imperial dynasty of China (206 BC220 AD), preceded by the Qin dynasty (221206 BC) and succeeded by the Three Kingdoms period (220280 AD). Spanning over four centuries, the Han period is considered a golden age in Chinese history. To this day, China's majority ethnic group refers to itself as the \\"Han people\\" and the Chinese script is referred to as \\"Han characters\\". It was founded by the rebel leader Liu Bang, known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu of Han, and briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty (923 AD) of the former regent Wang Mang. This interregnum separates the Han dynasty into two periods: the Western Han or Former Han (206 BC 9 AD) and the Eastern Han or Later Han (25220 AD). - The Battle of Red Cliffs, otherwise known as the Battle of Chibi, was a decisive battle fought at the end of the Han dynasty, about twelve years prior to the beginning of the Three Kingdoms period in Chinese history. It was fought in the winter of AD 208/9 between the allied forces of the southern warlords Liu Bei and Sun Quan and the numerically superior forces of the northern warlord Cao Cao. Liu Bei and Sun Quan successfully frustrated Cao Cao's effort to conquer the land south of the Yangtze River and reunite the territory of the Eastern Han dynasty. The allied victory at Red Cliffs ensured the survival of Liu Bei and Sun Quan, gave them control of the Yangtze , and provided a line of defence that was the basis for the later creation of the two southern states of Shu Han and Eastern Wu. The battle has been called the largest naval battle in history in terms of numbers involved. - Jin Xuan (died 209), courtesy name Yuanji (), was a minor warlord and Administrator of Wuling Commandery in the late Eastern Han Dynasty. - The Xin dynasty was a Chinese dynasty (termed so despite having only one emperor) which lasted from 9 to 23 AD. It interrupted the Han dynasty, dividing it into the periods of the Western Han and the Eastern Han. - Cao Wei (220265) was one of the three major states that competed for supremacy over China in the Three Kingdoms period (220280). With its capital at Luoyang, the state was established by Cao Pi in 220, based upon the foundations laid by his father, Cao Cao, towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty. The name \\"Wei\\" first became associated with Cao Cao when he was named the Duke of Wei by the Eastern Han government in 213, and became the name of the state when Cao Pi proclaimed himself emperor in 220. Historians often add the prefix \\"Cao\\" to distinguish it from other Chinese states known as \\"Wei\\", such as Wei of the Warring States period and Northern Wei of the Southern and Northern Dynasties. The authority of the ruling Cao family gradually weakened after the death of the second Wei emperor, Cao Rui, and eventually fell into the hands of Sima Yi, a Wei regent, and his family, in 249. Cao Rui's successors remained as puppet rulers under the control of the Simas until Sima Yi's grandson, Sima Yan, forced the last Wei ruler, Cao Huan, to abdicate the throne and established the Jin dynasty. - Cao Cao (155 15 March 220), courtesy name Mengde, was a Chinese warlord and the penultimate Chancellor of the Eastern Han dynasty who rose to great power in the final years of the dynasty. As one of the central figures of the Three Kingdoms period, he laid the foundations for what was to become the state of Cao Wei and was posthumously honoured as \\"Emperor Wu of Wei\\". Although he is often portrayed as a cruel and merciless tyrant in subsequent literature, Cao Cao has also been praised as a brilliant ruler and military genius who treated his subordinates like his family. During the fall of the Eastern Han dynasty, Cao Cao was able to secure the most populated and prosperous cities of the central plains and northern China. Cao had much success as the Han chancellor, but his handling of the Han emperor Liu Xie was heavily criticized and resulted in a continued and then escalated civil war. Opposition directly gathered around warlords Liu Bei and Sun Quan, whom Cao was unable to quell. Cao was also skilled in poetry and martial arts and wrote many war journals. - Shu or Shu Han (221263) was one of the three major states that competed for supremacy over China in the Three Kingdoms period (220280). The state was based in the area around present-day Sichuan and Chongqing, which was historically known as \\"Shu\\" after an earlier state in Sichuan named Shu. Shu Han's founder Liu Bei had named his state \\"Han\\" as he considered it the legitimate successor to the Han dynasty, while \\"Shu\\" is added to the name as a geographical prefix to differentiate it from the many \\"Han\\" states throughout Chinese history. - Liu Biao (142208), courtesy name Jingsheng, was a warlord and the governor of Jing Province who lived in the late Eastern Han dynasty. He was a member of the extended family of the Han emperors, descended from Liu Yu, the fifth son of Emperor Jing. - Guizhou, formerly romanized as Kweichow, is a province of the People's Republic of China located in the southwestern part of the country. Its capital city is Guiyang. Name. The area was first organized as an administrative region of a Chinese empire under the Tang, when it was named Juzhou, pronounced \\"Kjú-jyuw\\" in the Middle Chinese of the period. During the Mongolian Yuan dynasty, the character (\\"ju\\", \\"carpenter's square\\") was changed to the more refined (\\"gui\\", \\"precious or expensive\\"). The region formally became a province in 1413, with an eponymous capital then also called \\"Guizhou\\" but now known as Guiyang. - Zhao Fan was a minor warlord and prefect of Guiyang Commandery during the late Han Dynasty period of Chinese history. Zhao Fan surrendered to Zhao Yun after being attacked by his army at Guiyang following the Battle of Red Cliffs. Zhao Fan then unintentionally sparked the rage of Zhao Yun by suggesting his marriage to his older brother's widow. He became a minister of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period. - The Qin dynasty was the first dynasty of Imperial China, lasting from 221 to 206 BC. Named for its heartland of Qin, in modern-day Gansu and Shaanxi, the dynasty was formed after the conquest of six other states by the Qin state, and its founding emperor named Qin Shi Huang, the First Emperor of Qin. The strength of the Qin state was greatly increased by the Legalist reforms of Shang Yang in the fourth century BC, during the Warring States period. In the mid and late third century BC, the Qin accomplished a series of swift conquests, first ending the powerless Zhou dynasty, and eventually conquering the other six of the Seven Warring States to gain control over the whole of China. It is also the shortest dynasty in Chinese history, lasting only 15 years with two emperors. - Zhao Yun (died 229), courtesy name Zilong, was a military general who lived in the late Eastern Han dynasty and early Three Kingdoms period. Originally a subordinate of the northern warlord Gongsun Zan, Zhao Yun later came to serve another warlord, Liu Bei, and had since accompanied him on most of his military exploits, from the Battle of Changban (208) to the Hanzhong Campaign (217219). He continued serving in the state of Shu Han founded by Liu Bei in 221 in the Three Kingdoms period and participated in the first of the Northern Expeditions until his death in 229. While many facts about Zhao Yun's life remain unclear due to limited information in historical sources, some aspects and activities in his life had been dramatised or exaggerated in folklore and fiction, most notably in Luo Guanzhong's historical novel \\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\\", in which he was lauded as a member of the Five Tiger Generals under Liu Bei. - Liu Bei (161 10 June 223), courtesy name Xuande, was a warlord in the late Eastern Han dynasty who founded the state of Shu Han in the Three Kingdoms period and became its first ruler. Despite early failings compared to his rivals and lacking both the material resources and social status they commanded, he gathered support along disheartened Han loyalists who objected to Cao Cao's reign over the emperor and relied heavily on this support. Liu Bei overcame his many defeats to carve out his own realm, which at its peak spanned present-day Sichuan, Chongqing, Guizhou, Hunan, parts of Hubei, and parts of Gansu. - Emperor Gaozu of Han (256 BC June 1, 195 BC), born Liu Bang, was the founder and first emperor of the Han dynasty, reigning from 202 195 BC. He was one of the few dynasty founders in Chinese history with humble origin from the peasant class. - The Three Kingdoms (AD 220280) was the tripartite division of China between the states of Wei, Shu, and Wu, following the Han dynasty and preceding the Jin dynasty. The term \\"Three Kingdoms\\" itself is something of a mistranslation, since each state was eventually headed not by a king, but by an emperor who claimed legitimate succession from the Han dynasty. Nevertheless, the term \\"Three Kingdoms\\" has become standard among sinologists. To further distinguish the three states from other historical Chinese states of similar names, historians have added a relevant character: Wei is also known as Cao Wei, Shu is also known as Shu Han, and Wu is also known as Dong (or Eastern) Wu. - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower.

A: A:","output":"Free-living roundworms, also known as nematodes, are an incredibly diverse and abundant group of organisms that inhabit a wide range of environments on Earth. These microscopic organisms play a vital role in nutrient cycling and decomposition in many ecosystems. The main habitats where free-living roundworms are predominately found include: 1. Soil environments: The most common habitat for free-living roundworms is in the soil. They are particularly abundant in terrestrial ecosystems, where they contribute to the decomposition of organic matter and the release of essential nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon. In soil environments, roundworms inhabit various niches, including plant roots, leaf litter, and beneath stones or logs. 2. Arboreal habitats: Roundworms are also present in arboreal habitats, such as tree trunks and the canopy of forests. In these environments, they live in association with decaying plant materials, fungal hyphae, and mosses. They play a crucial role in breaking down organic matter and releasing nutrients for the growth of plants present in these habitats. 3. Rainforests: Rainforests, with their rich biodiversity and high humidity levels, provide an ideal environment for free-living roundworms. They can be found in leaf litter, the forest floor, and even within the canopy. In rainforests, these nematodes play a significant role in the food chain, serving as prey for various invertebrates and contributing to the overall nutrient cycling. 4. Ocean depths: Marine environments are also home to numerous free-living roundworms. In the depths of the ocean, roundworms inhabit various substrates, such as the surface of deep-sea rocks, hydrothermal vents, and sediments on the ocean floor. They serve as decomposers and nutrient cyclers, breaking down dead organic matter, as well as forming a vital part of the deep-sea food web. 5. Freshwater habitats: In freshwater habitats, such as lakes, rivers, and ponds, free-living roundworms are found in benthic sediments and submerged vegetation. They play a crucial role in breaking down detritus, decaying plant matter, and other organic materials, thereby releasing essential nutrients back into the ecosystem. In conclusion, free-living roundworms are primarily found in soil environments, arboreal habitats, rainforests, ocean depths, and freshwater habitats. Their abundance and diversity are a testament to their adaptability and ecological importance. As decomposers and nutrient cyclers, they play a crucial role in sustaining the health and productivity of various ecosystems around the world."},{"instruction":"Question: The speed of a boat in upstream is 100 kmph and the speed of the boat downstream is 120 kmph.

Some random reasoning:","output":"To find the speed of the boat in still water (x) and the speed of the stream (y), we use the following formulas: Speed upstream = Speed of boat in still water - Speed of stream Speed downstream = Speed of boat in still water + Speed of stream Let x be the speed of the boat in still water and y be the speed of the stream. Speed upstream: 100 = x - y Speed downstream: 120 = x + y We now have a system of two linear equations: 1) x - y = 100 2) x + y = 120 To solve these equations, we sum both equations: (1) + (2) => x - y + x + y = 100 + 120 2x = 220 x = 110 Now, we subtract equation (1) from equation (2): (2) - (1) => x + y - (x - y) = 120 - 100 2y = 20 y = 10 Hence, the speed of the boat in still water is 110 kmph and the speed of the stream is 10 kmph.

These features contribute to the attractiveness of his appearance, forming the basis for the assertion that \\"he was handsome.\\" However, the hypothesis also claims that he \\"looked very intelligent.\\" Determining someone's intelligence based solely on physical appearance is a subjective and potentially unreliable assessment. While it is plausible that certain aspects of an individual's appearance might lead to the perception of intelligence, such as facial expressions, posture, or attire, it is essential to note that these characteristics could be superficial in nature. In the given premise, there are no details regarding the expression on his face or observable behaviors that would suggest the individual's intellectual capacity. The description focuses primarily on his physical appearance, and there is no mention of any attributes that might necessarily imply or reveal a strong cognitive ability. One could argue that his choice to wear a cowboy hat might be indicative of confidence and reflect an ability to be independent and resourceful, which are qualities that can be associated with intelligence. However, this connection remains tenuous and indirect, as the premise only describes the physical attributes of the individual. In conclusion, based on the information provided in the premise, it can be reasonably concluded that the individual is indeed handsome due to the various physically attractive features described. However, making a definitive statement regarding his intelligence from the given information is difficult, as there are no clear indicators or descriptors within the premise that highlight or imply the individual's cognitive abilities. As such, while it is possible that he may appear intelligent, the hypothesis cannot be considered entirely true without further evidence supporting the claim of intelligence."},{"instruction":"By. Daily Mail Reporter. and Ap. Buddy Cianci, the twice-convicted felon who led Providence as mayor for 21 years, wants his old job back. Cianci said Wednesday that he is running as an independent for a seventh term as mayor. The last time he won an election was 16 years ago — before he was convicted in 2002 of racketeering conspiracy for widespread corruption in his administration. He spent 4 ½ years in prison. Cianci, 73, said he is not seeking redemption, but wishes to bring his experience and vision to the city to make a difference. He said Providence can't afford to have a mayor who is getting 'on-the-job training.' Convict: Buddy Cianci was twice forced from office after assault and corruption convictions. Making an announcement on his radio show, Cianci said that many people would call this an eleventh-hour decision, but that he decided to join the field after much soul-searching and reflection. He said he wants to rekindle the city's 'renaissance.' 'If the people don't want me, they don't have to vote for me. I realize I have baggage,' he said during a break in his show. 'They know who I am. They know what I am. And they know what I've accomplished.' Cianci's announcement came shortly before the 4 p.m. filing deadline; a surrogate filed his paperwork for him at City Hall. He will take a leave from the show and from his duties as a local television commentator during the campaign. Cianci previously won office as a Republican and independent. New gig: Cianci has worked as a radio broadcaster since his release from federal prison in 2007. Popular: Despite his felony convictions, Cianci has remained a popular politician in Providence. He was diagnosed in January with cancer and has undergone chemotherapy and radiation treatments, but says his health is good now and won't keep him from running a campaign or the city. Under his watch, the city transformed from a down-at-the-heels urban center with a dwindling downtown to an arts and culture hub. He often boasts that he literally moved rivers to improve the downtown. Supporters had urged him to run to bring his vision and attitude back to City Hall, but many residents feared a run by a man who was driven from office twice by felony convictions would embarrass the city. Cianci mounted his first campaign in 1974 and never lost an election. But he was forced to resign in 1984, after he was convicted of using a fireplace log and lit cigarette to assault a man he believed was having an affair with his estranged wife. Six years after that conviction, in 1990, he ran for mayor again and won. His second stint as mayor, known around town as Buddy II, came to an end in 2002 when he was convicted as part of a federal investigation into corruption in City Hall, called Operation Plunderdome by the FBI. Several other members of his administration were also convicted. Nice 'do: Cianci used to wear a tupee but recently ditched it and embraced his bald head. The city's demographics have changed since Cianci last won election. Its Hispanic population grew nearly one-third between 2000 and 2010, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Hispanics represented 38 percent of the population in 2010. The city usually votes heavily Democratic. A crowded field of candidates is vying to replace one-term Mayor Angel Taveras, who is mounting a run for governor. Democrats running include City Councilman Michael Solomon, political operative Brett Smiley and law professor and former judge Jorge Elorza. Republican Dan Harrop is also running.

'Providence cannot afford to return to the corrupt politics of the past, and that is what Buddy Cianci's candidacy represents,' Smiley said. Solomon said he — not Cianci — is the candidate of experience, having worked in recent years with Taveras to bring the city back from the brink of bankruptcy.

Cianci, who previously served as mayor for 21 years, was convicted in 2002 of racketeering conspiracy for widespread corruption during his administration, which led to 4 ½ years in prison. Despite his past convictions, Cianci remains a popular figure in Providence. He believes that his experience and vision can make a difference for the city and aims to rekindle its \\"renaissance.\\" Cianci's decision to run for mayor came shortly before the filing deadline, and he stepped away from his radio show and television commentator duties during the campaign. Notably, Cianci was diagnosed with cancer in January but has undergone treatment and claims his health is good enough to participate in the campaign and manage the city. During his tenure, Providence transformed from a downtrodden urban center to an arts and culture hub. Multiple candidates are vying to replace current one-term Mayor Angel Taveras, who is running for governor. Several candidates have issued immediate statements reacting to Cianci's entry into the race, with some emphasizing their experience and others expressing concerns about potentially returning to the past's corrupt politics."},{"instruction":"Choose between \\"glass mirror\\" and \\"stone slab\\". Question: A glass mirror is smoother than a stone slab. This means that running a razor blade over the _____ will create more heat (A) glass mirror or the (B) stone slab Answer:","output":"The correct answer is (A) glass mirror. When running a razor blade over the glass mirror, more heat will be generated due to the smoother surface. The glass mirror has a smoother surface than the stone slab because of how both materials are composed and manufactured. Glass mirrors are manufactured by placing a thin layer of metallic coating, usually aluminum or silver, on the back of a piece of flat glass, followed by a layer of paint to protect the metallic layer. This manufacturing process results in a smooth and reflective surface that is ideal for the even distribution and reflection of light. On the other hand, a stone slab is typically composed of natural minerals, usually granite or marble. Stone slabs are cut from larger pieces of rock and then polished for use as countertops, floors, or other surfaces. Although stone slabs could have various finishes such as polished, honed, or tumbled, they inherently have a rougher surface due to their natural composition. When a razor blade is run over a glass mirror, the smooth surface allows for continuous contact between the blade and the glass. This leads to increased friction which generates heat. In contrast, when running a razor blade over the stone slab, its rough surface results in less contact between the blade and the slab, which lessens friction and ultimately heat generation."},{"instruction":"Compose the next sentence for this paragraph.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"In the process you mentioned, the procedure essentially involves boiling saltwater and collecting the condensed water vapor, effectively separating the salt from the water. This process is known as desalination. The perturbation hypothesis you present involves increasing the amount of salt separated from the water. In this case, the hypothesis does not directly impact the desalination process. The amount of salt in the water should not affect the process of boiling and condensing water vapor. However, if more salt was present in the original saltwater, it might have some indirect effects on the overall desalination process: 1. Increased boiling point: As the concentration of salt in the water increases, the boiling point of the solution will also increase. This means that more energy will be required to boil the saltwater. 2. Slower rate of evaporation: Higher concentrations of salt in the water will generally result in a slower rate of evaporation during the boiling process. 3. Potential changes to the cooling and condensation process: The presence of more salt might affect the rate at which the water vapor cools and condenses back into liquid water. 4. Increased amount of salt residue: More salt left behind after the process means that more effort and resources will be required in disposing of the salt residue, which might affect the overall efficiency of the desalination process. Overall, the perturbation hypothesis itself doesn't directly affect the rate or efficiency of the saltwater boiling and condensation process. It can only indirectly impact the overall desalination process due to the changes in boiling point, evaporation rate, cooling and condensation process, and salt residue disposal associated with higher concentrations of salt in the water."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I was a waitress at the New England regional chain Newport Creamery for seven years in Jr. High, High School, and College. In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head. Next thing I know, I’m on the floor, covered in blood, the girls are screaming blue murder, and my manager is shaking like a leaf as he coddles me. Apparently, I passed out right onto the table of the nice family I was waiting on, then fell back and whacked my head on the corner of a wall. I remember noticing that my kelly green polyester dress was an awful shade of bloodied brown. My main concern was that I had a hot date that night, and now I had to go to the emergency room! The ER doctor was able to sew my head up, and sent me home with a diagnosis of “syncope, unknown origin”. After a few hours, I still felt spacey, but insisted on going on the date.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more water droplets are formed happens, how will it affect LESS snow. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if more water droplets are formed, there will be less snow. This hypothesis has both direct and indirect effects on the process. Direct effect: As more water droplets form, it increases the amount of moisture available in the atmosphere for the formation of ice crystals. If these droplets do not freeze and form ice crystals, there might be an increased chance of rainfall rather than snowfall, given certain temperature and humidity conditions. Indirect effects: 1. Increased water droplets in the atmosphere can lead to a higher rate of condensation, which releases heat into the surrounding air. This additional heat may raise the temperature slightly, making it less conducive for ice crystals to form. 2. More water droplets in the atmosphere could potentially lead to denser cloud cover, which could affect the temperature at the Earth's surface. This might result in less snow due to warmer temperatures near the ground. 3. The increased water content in the atmosphere may have an impact on air circulation and weather patterns, potentially causing less snow to fall in certain regions. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that the formation of more water droplets could have direct and indirect effects on the process of snowfall, potentially resulting in less snow.

The peace treaty had been prepared at a congress throughout the final years of the war. During the negotiations, several mostly Hanseatic cities requested that they become Imperial cities, with only Bremen being successful: Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor accepted Bremen as a Free imperial city in 1646. A respective document was signed in Linz on 1 June, with the aim of preventing Sweden from gaining the city. In turn Bremen, among other concessions, paid about 100.000 talers. Owing to Swedish diplomatic efforts however, the text of the 1648 treaty did not determine whether or not Bremen was to be included in the future Swedish dominion. The Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen, northerly and easterly neighbouring the city's territory, had been occupied by Sweden since 1646/47. Swedish forces had then expelled the forces of Prince-Archbishop Frederick II, Prince of Denmark, officiating from 1637 to 1648. On 18 February 1647, the emperor accepted Sweden's annexation of the prince-archbishopric's territory as a secularized duchy. After the war a dispute about custom collection between Bremen and the emperor led to the latter imposing an Imperial ban on the city in 1652/53. Sweden, which had never accepted Bremen's Imperial immediacy, attacked in 1654. What happened first, Bremen's acceptance as an Imperial city or the Peace of Westphalia?","output":"Bremen's acceptance as an Imperial city happened first. According to the article, Bremen was accepted as a Free Imperial city in 1646 by Ferdinand III, the Holy Roman Emperor. The Peace of Westphalia, which marked the end of the Thirty Years' War, happened later in 1648. So think of it like eating dinner then having dessert, first you ate dinner (Bremen became an Imperial city), then you had dessert (the Peace of Westphalia happened)."},{"instruction":"Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Shin Hye-sun, is a South Korean actress, she acted her first protagonist role in My Golden Life, a South Korean television series starring Park Si-hoo, Shin Hye-sun, Lee Tae-hwan, and Seo Eun-soo, released in what year?

Kayla Kline posted to her Instagram this week that she has resigned in solidarity with the current Miss America, who claimed of bullying in the Miss America Organization (MAO). “With a heavy heart I resign,” Kline wrote in the post. “I sent my letter to be received at the national level this afternoon. The national organization that the current MAO board of directors has made Miss America into is not one that I recognize. Miss America deserves a voice, and if you can't hear her, I'll stand and shout with her.” The post included a screenshot of her email to the national organization, where she expressed her concerns with its direction. “I hope that maybe, if the current board recognizes that the actions they have taken and the manner in which they conduct themselves has caused damage enough to make faithful titleholders resign that it may help push positive change,” she wrote. Her decision came in the wake of a letter penned by current Miss America Cara Mund, where Mund claimed that she was silenced and bullied by leaders in the organization, and wanted to stand up for all the volunteers and participants involved, according to the AP. Mund sent the letter to former Miss Americas on Friday. \\"Let me be blunt: I strongly believe that my voice is not heard nor wanted by our current leadership; nor do they have any interest in knowing who I am and how my experiences relate to positioning the organization for the future,\\" Mund wrote, according to the AP. \\"Our chair and CEO have systematically silenced me, reduced me, marginalized me, and essentially erased me in my role as Miss America in subtle and not-so-subtle ways on a daily basis. After a while, the patterns have clearly emerged, and the sheer accumulation of the disrespect, passive-aggressive behavior, belittlement, and outright exclusion has taken a serious toll.\\" On Aug. 17, MAO published a response to Mund's accusations. “The Miss America Organization supports Cara,\\" the response said. \\"It is disappointing that she chose to air her grievances publicly not privately. Her letter contains mischaracterizations and many unfounded accusations. We are reaching out to her privately to address her concerns.” ||||| Mund opens up to The Hollywood Reporter about speaking up about the pageant and its chairwoman, revealing she'd have \\"no regrets\\" if she's stripped of her title before the next coronation on Sept. 9.

Months after the North Dakota native took home the crown, the Miss America Organization became embroiled in scandal as offensive email chains leaked in December. In the exchanges, former CEO Sam Haskell, along with other organization leaders, crudely discussed the appearances of women who had competed in the pageant with demeaning and misogynistic language. \\"That was a tough time,\\" Mund tells The Hollywood Reporter. \\"Transitioning is always hard. I figured there would be some growing pains.\\" Pain, Mund says, \\"came indeed.\\" According to the 24-year-old beauty queen, the treatment she claims to have experienced under the new leadership of chairwoman Gretchen Carlson and CEO Regina Hopper was nearly paralyzing. In a five-page open letter — written to fellow Miss America winners and shared via her official Facebook page Aug. 17 — Mund detailed the bullying she allegedly endured at the hands of Carlson and Hopper, including hurtful comments about her appearance and an intent to have her \\"silenced.\\" \\"The treatment just kept getting worse and I kept thinking to myself, 'Is it my fault?'\\" Mund says, adding that her first uncomfortable encounter with Hopper was telling of their future dynamic. \\"The first instance of bullying that really sticks out to me? Back in January, the very first time I met Regina. She told me she's not nice. We were walking down the hall and she gave me some kind of compliment,\\" Mund recalls. \\"And my response is typically like, 'Oh, that's so nice of you.' And she turned around and she said, 'Oh, I'm not nice.'\\" Later, as Mund claims in her letter, Hopper went as far as to criticize her sartorial choices. Of a Karl Lagerfield dress Mund once wore, Hopper allegedly said, \\"Yuck. You should burn that. Don't ever wear that again.\\" Aside from Hopper's alleged insults, which, as Mund says, \\"took a toll\\" on her emotional well-being, Mund says that Carlson barred the Brown University graduate from participating in high-profile appearances that past titleholders have historically been a part of. \\"There was a National Press Club luncheon in D.C. that the CEO and chairwoman took. And it's fine. They can have it. But why wasn't I asked to do that? I had voiced this concern before,\\" Mund tells THR. \\"When we go in to get sponsors or attend big events, they should bring Miss America because I'm a product of the organization. I'm determined, I have an opinion, I am well-spoken and educated. Plus, I want to work! To have this job means the world to me and I want to make each day count.\\" But, under Carlson's leadership, Mund says her contributions as Miss America have been minimal at best. Adding to a long list of letdowns, she also says she was blocked from attending a trip to Cannes this year, where Carlson spoke about the relevance of Miss America in the #MeToo era. The former Fox & Friends anchor and onetime Miss America was hailed as an early voice of the movement after coming forward with her claims of sexual misconduct against the late Roger Ailes; she also offers advice about how to conquer workplace harassment in her 2017 book, Be Fierce. Mund finds it hard to reconcile Carlson's public persona with the woman Mund claims has \\"systematically silenced me, reduced me, marginalized me, and essentially erased me in my role as Miss America in subtle and not-so-subtle ways on a daily basis.\\" She elaborates to THR: \\"After all this, I do admire Gretchen's courage to come forward when she did because I now realize how tough and how scary it is. At the same time, I wish I would have had support from her because she is someone who went through harassment — at a different level, obviously, and in a different situation — but she knows how bad it can be on the other side.\\" \\"I just want to be heard in the same way she wanted to be heard,\\" adds Mund, who says she's been vocal about her issues with the organization's leadership since January. \\"My voice matters just as much as she feels hers does.\\" Mund's pageant sisters are certainly paying attention. More than 20 former Miss Americas, many of whom have expressed public praise for Mund, are now demanding that the entire Miss America board of directors, including Carlson and Hopper, resign. A petition calling for the same has been signed by over 21,000 people. In the state of New Jersey, where Miss America is crowned each year in Atlantic City, workplace bullying is defined as \\"deliberate insults, threats, demeaning comments, constant criticism, overbearing supervision, profane outbursts, blatant ostracism, being overworked or simply not communicating with colleagues.\\" Mund believes that what she has experienced falls under this definition. However, she tells THR that she'd like to avoid taking legal action against Carlson, Hopper or the Miss America Organization. \\"I think we all have the same goal,\\" says Mund. \\"I hope we all want Miss America to survive. I prefer not to take legal action. I just want us to air it out, point out the concerns and fix them. Let's move on.\\" Carlson refuted Mund's claims in a lengthy Twitter statement Aug. 19. Since then, she has attempted to reach Mund via phone. \\"I just prefer written communication at this point,\\" Mund says. \\"There's been a loss of trust, so that's what I've requested.\\" After sharing her letter, Mund says she's been receiving \\"emails about security instructions\\" for Sept. 9, the day she is set to hand over the crown to a new competitor at Miss America 2019. \\"But they're also forwarding media requests directly to me, to handle on my own,\\" she says. \\"So, I have no idea what's going on. Sometimes I think to myself, 'Is this a game? Is this a setup?' Those are thoughts I have, and thoughts I have had throughout my tenure.\\" Mund has also thought about the \\"possibility\\" of being dethroned before this year's pageant takes place — which would be a first in the 97-year history of Miss America. But, if she does have to hand in her tiara and sash ahead of time, she'll do it with a smile on her face. \\"Yes, it is a possibility that they take away my crown. But if they strip me of my title early, speaking out would have been well worth it. I have no regrets,\\" she says. \\"I want the next winner to know that she's stronger than she thinks she is. I kept thinking I was going to break, but I didn't. Women are so strong. And I want her to know that she has my support and the support of everyone who supported me.\\" Mund, who has plans to attend law school in the fall of 2019, concludes: \\"She needs to know that she has a voice and it's important. If she feels like she can't use it, grab that microphone and use it louder. She can really cause change.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"A woman named Kayla Kline, who was Miss Denver in 2018, has decided to leave her position.

He is experimenting with colliding particles. He has two samples of particles, sample A and sample B. Sample A contains gas particles, but sample B does not contain gas particles. But I can use this background: Another thing we can see in this animation is that particles are constantly colliding with one another. One assumption that we make when talking about collisions between gas particles is that they are completely elastic collisions. In an elastic collision , momentum is conserved, which means that none of the kinetic energy of the colliding particles is lost in some other form (such as the emission of light). This makes sense, because if energy were lost in collisions, the speeds of the particles would gradually decrease over time, and eventually everything would condense down into a solid form. What is an answer for this question: Would kinetic energy in sample B likely be lost or retained? Answer:","output":"In order to determine whether kinetic energy in sample B would likely be lost or retained, we must first understand the properties of the particles within sample B and analyze the type of collisions they might undergo. While we know that sample A contains gas particles, which are assumed to experience elastic collisions, sample B has not been explicitly defined. However, we do know that it does not contain gas particles. Considering sample B contains particles other than gas particles, it is possible that it could be made up of liquids or solids. The behavior of particles in these states of matter is different from that of gas particles. In liquid and solid states, the particles typically have stronger intermolecular forces and are in relatively closer proximity when compared to gas particles. This can result in energy transfer during collisions, including both kinetic and potential energy transformations. In response to the question of whether kinetic energy in sample B would be lost or retained, it is important to note that, unlike gas particles, collisions between particles in liquid and solid states might not always be perfectly elastic. This means that when particles in sample B undergo collisions, some kinetic energy could be transformed into other forms of energy, like thermal energy or vibrational energy, due to the stronger intermolecular forces. As a result, it can be concluded that kinetic energy in sample B would likely be partially lost during collisions, as some of it may be converted into other forms of energy. This is in contrast to the elastic collisions between gas particles in sample A, where kinetic energy is conserved. However, the extent to which kinetic energy is lost in sample B during collisions would depend on the nature of the particles, their velocities, the intermolecular forces in play, and the experimental conditions."},{"instruction":"I read this background article the other day: For example, if a solid pellet of NaOH is placed into a chamber of HCl gas, a relatively slow acid-base reaction will occur between gaseous HCl molecules and hydroxide ions on the surface of the pellet. If we were to grind the pellet into smaller pieces, it would greatly increase the total surface area, and therefore the overall reaction rate. Once ground up, many hydroxide ions that were on the interior of the pellet, where they were not exposed to any HCl molecules, will now be on the surface, where the necessary collisions can occur. I am facing a new situation today: In his chemistry lab David is experimenting with how NaOH and HCl gas reacts with each other. He conducted two experiments, experiment A and experiment B. In experiment A he used solid pellets of NaOH, but in experiment B he used ground NaOH. He was surprised to see the difference it made in his experiment. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Would experiment B's hydroxide have smaller or larger surface area than experiment A's hydroxide?","output":"Based on the background article and the information provided in the new situation, I can provide a detailed explanation as to why experiment B's hydroxide has a larger surface area compared to experiment A's hydroxide. In experiment A, solid pellets of NaOH were used. These pellets have a relatively small surface area, as only the exterior surfaces are exposed to the HCl gas. As a result, the acid-base reaction between gaseous HCl molecules and the hydroxide ions on the surface of the pellet is relatively slow. This is because only a limited number of hydroxide ions are available for interaction with the HCl gas at any given moment, and the reaction can only occur at the surface of the pellet. In experiment B, the NaOH pellets were ground up, resulting in a much larger total surface area. This occurs because grinding the pellets into smaller pieces creates additional surfaces, which in turn increases the number of hydroxide ions that are exposed to the HCl gas. When the pellet is ground up, many hydroxide ions that were previously only present on the interior of the pellet (where they were not exposed to any HCl molecules) now become available on the newly created surfaces, allowing for more frequent and efficient collisions between the hydroxide and HCl molecules. Consequently, the overall rate of the acid-base reaction increases in experiment B due to the larger surface area provided by the ground NaOH. In conclusion, experiment B's hydroxide has a larger surface area compared to experiment A's hydroxide, which explains the observed difference in reaction rates between the two experiments. By grinding the NaOH pellets, the total surface area is significantly increased, allowing for a greater number of hydroxide ions to be exposed to the HCl gas and thus facilitating a faster acid-base reaction."},{"instruction":"Given the question: - The pancreas detects chemical changes in the stomach - The pancreas creates juices that help digest food - The pancreas releases the juices into the stomach - Trypsin and chymotrypsin digest protein - Insulin is produced to move glucose from the blood What might be the last step of the process?

A young woman named Ellen Harper, daughter of the well-respected Mayor Martin Harper, has tragically been found drowned on the shore. Ellen had been known in the town as an independent-minded individual, an environmental activist, and an artist, whose sudden demise had left everyone in shock and despair, including Doc Wallace who had once saved her life during a heart surgery years prior. The townfolk quickly accept the drowning as an unfortunate accident, and grief engulfs the small tight-knit community. Doc Wallace, however, feels an unshakable sense of unease. As he carries out the necessary procedures, he begins to find minor, yet inexplicable inconsistencies in Ellen's autopsy; enough to spark his investigative instinct. Doc Wallace decides to dig deeper into the mystery, feeling a moral obligation towards Ellen. He enlists the help of his daughter, Rachel Wallace, a detective who has returned to their hometown after facing past traumas on the police force in a big city. As Doc Wallace and Rachel begin their investigation, they unearth secrets and hidden truths about Ellen and her apparent drowning. They discover that Ellen had been working tirelessly to expose a sophisticated criminal organization involved in illegal activities like dumping toxic waste into the once-pristine ocean, posing a severe threat to the marine life and the wellbeing of the coastal town. This endeavor had led Ellen to cross paths with influential and dangerous people, specifically the corrupted CEO of a major chemical company, Blair Winston, whose family has a longstanding rivalry with the Harper family. As Rachel and Doc Wallace put the pieces together, they uncover an intricately-woven web of deceit and betrayal that had taken root within their town. Love, jealousy, and envy also seem to have come into play as they investigate further and discover Ellen's affair with Paul, Blair’s son; a relationship that fueled the already burning animosity between the two families. One afternoon, as a shocking turn of events, Doc Wallace discovers Ellen's body missing from the morgue after conclusively proving that her death was no accident. As the pair frantically search for answers, they begin to unravel the long-buried secrets hidden beneath the idyllic facade of their coastal town. Moving deeper into the labyrinth of deceit, they finally uncover a meticulously-executed conspiracy revolving around a desperate attempt to control the area's resources and power dynamics. Life and death had merely become the tools sought to control the unseen struggles beneath the surface. In a gripping and suspenseful climax, Doc Wallace and Rachel finally confront the real mastermind behind the plot, enduring personal and emotional upheaval in the process. They succeed in restoring the faith and justice to their town, redeeming themselves from the ghosts of their own past. \\"The Requiem of Lost Souls\\" stands as a gripping and poignant tale of love, deceit, and perseverance.

Estranged from both love interest Mary Jane Watson and best friend Harry Osborn, Peter additionally discovers his Aunt May is facing eviction. Harry, now head of Oscorp's research division, is sponsoring brilliant nuclear scientist Otto Octavius' fusion power project, who befriend Peter and offers him life advice. While handling hazardous materials, Octavius wears a harness of powerful robotic tentacle arms with artificial intelligence. During a public demonstration, in which Peter and Harry attend, a power spike causes the fusion reactor to destabilize. Octavius refuses to shut down the reactor, which goes critical, killing his wife and shattering the inhibitor chip blocking the arms from his nervous system. Spider-Man arrives and shuts down the experiment, destroying it. At a hospital, doctors prepare to surgically remove Octavius's harness. However, as a result of the accident the arms have developed sentience and attack the crew. Upon regaining consciousness and seeing the carnage, Octavius escapes and takes refuge at a harbour.

What's the answer?","output":"When the population of small rodents, which are a primary food source for many predators, significantly declines or completely dies off, the predators relying on them will have to adapt to the situation in various ways in order to survive. This adaptation can manifest itself through several potential behavioral and ecological changes. Some of the potential outcomes include: 1. Change in diet: One of the more immediate adaptive responses by predators is to shift their diet to alternative prey, either by choosing other smaller animals such as insects and birds or by switching to larger prey options like rabbits, hares, or even other small predators. This can result in a change in hunting strategies and may lead to alterations in the predator's physical adaptations over time, as they hone new skills and techniques for catching and consuming different prey. 2. Decreased population: If a predator species is unable to adapt its diet sufficiently to compensate for the loss of small rodents, it may experience a decrease in its population, similar to the decline seen in the prey population. This process, termed density-dependent population regulation, occurs due to increased competition for the remaining available resources among the predator population. As weaker or less adaptable individuals struggle more to find food, their survival and reproduction rates decline, translating into a smaller overall population in the related environment. 3. Migration: As food resources dwindle, some predators may choose to leave their original habitat in search of a more abundant food source. This migration can lead to new territories being explored and conquered. However, it can also result in heavy competition within the new territory, as these predators might face direct competition from other predators adapted to that environment. 4. Behavioral changes: Predators that rely on small rodents for food may change their social and hunting behaviors as they search for other viable food sources. For example, solitary predators may be forced to cooperate with other members of their species, forming loose hunting parties to increase their chances of catching larger or more elusive prey. Additionally, nocturnal predators might expand their activity to daylight hours in hopes of increasing the opportunities to acquire food. 5. Evolutionary adaptation: Over an extended period, predator populations may undergo evolutionary adaptations to better suit their new dietary habits or lifestyles. Such adaptations can include physiological changes to improve the predator's ability to process new types of food or physical alterations to enhance their ability to catch and subdue a different variety of prey. These adaptations are significant when considering long-term shifts in predator-prey relationships within an ecosystem. In summary, when small rodents, the primary food source for many predators, decline or die off, predators will need to respond adaptively by changing their diet, enduring population decreases, migrating to more favorable environments, altering their behaviors, or undergoing long-term evolutionary adaptations. The specific response of each predator will depend on factors such as the species' biology, ecological niche, and the availability of alternative prey within the environment."},{"instruction":"Definition: In this task, you're given the title of a five-sentence story and the first four sentences.

Tonight (1984), another dance-oriented album, found Bowie collaborating with Tina Turner and, once again, Iggy Pop. It included a number of cover songs, among them the 1966 Beach Boys hit \\"God Only Knows\\". The album bore the transatlantic Top 10 hit \\"Blue Jean\\", itself the inspiration for a short film that won Bowie a Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video, Jazzin' for Blue Jean. Bowie performed at Wembley Stadium in 1985 for Live Aid, a multi-venue benefit concert for Ethiopian famine relief. During the event, the video for a fundraising single was premiered, Bowie's duet with Mick Jagger. \\"Dancing in the Street\\" quickly went to number one on release. The same year, Bowie worked with the Pat Metheny Group to record \\"This Is Not America\\" for the soundtrack of The Falcon and the Snowman. Released as a single, the song became a Top 40 hit in the UK and US.Bowie was given a role in the 1986 film Absolute Beginners. It was poorly received by critics, but Bowie's theme song, also named \\"Absolute Beginners\\", rose to No. 2 in the UK charts. He also appeared as Jareth, the Goblin King, in the 1986 Jim Henson film Labyrinth, for which he wrote five songs. His final solo album of the decade was 1987's Never Let Me Down, where he ditched the light sound of his previous two albums, instead offering harder rock with an industrial/techno dance edge. Peaking at No. 6 in the UK, the album yielded the hits \\"Day-In, Day-Out\\" (his 60th single), \\"Time Will Crawl\\", and \\"Never Let Me Down\\". Bowie later described it as his \\"nadir\\", calling it \\"an awful album\\". Supporting Never Let Me Down, and preceded by nine promotional press shows, the 86-concert Glass Spider Tour commenced on 30 May. Bowie's backing band included Peter Frampton on lead guitar. Contemporary critics maligned the tour as overproduced, saying it pandered to the current stadium rock trends in its special effects and dancing, although years after the tour's conclusion, critics acknowledged that the tour influenced how other artists performed concerts, including...","output":"David Bowie appeared as Jareth, the Goblin King, in the 1986 Jim Henson film Labyrinth."},{"instruction":"What name was given to the spin-off off the comedy series Porridge?","output":"As an AI, I am unable to physically watch TV shows, but I can provide information based on available data.

Question 2: How do I get interest in C language and start coding? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Hi there! I'll explain this to you like you're five years old. Question 1: How can a student start learning C programming? This question is asking about how someone who wants to learn C programming can begin their learning journey. Imagine someone wants to learn how to build awesome LEGO structures, and they are asking for advice on how to start, like getting a basic LEGO set and maybe a book of ideas. Question 2: How do I get interest in C language and start coding? This question is about finding motivation and interest in C programming and then actually begin doing it. It's like asking, \\"How can I really love playing with LEGO and then start building my own creations?\\" So, to answer your question, the two questions are similar, but not exactly the same. Question 1 focuses on how to start learning C programming, while Question 2 focuses on finding interest in C language and then starting to code. They both have starting to code in common, but one is more about how to learn, and the other is more about how to find motivation and interest."},{"instruction":"The sweet taste of cold and wood smoke hung in the air. Marlin rode low in the saddle, his shoulders curled against the hungry wind. His hat was pulled down tight and his eyes didn't move as he passed the crude shacks at the edge of town. He tied his horse in front of the saloon, unwinding his long body as if a sudden movement might snap it. He turned down the collar of his greatcoat and checked to make sure his big Army Colt was loose in its holster. The saloon door was a single chunk of white pine, still oozing sap, and he had to put his shoulder to it to force it open. The long room inside was quiet, and not much warmer than the street. Clusters of people sat nursing coffee and drinks, talking quietly if they talked at all. Marlin spotted a few farmers the railroad had brought in from Europe: rounded hats, nervous eyes, skin as red as blood. At the far end of the room a half-dozen cowboys turned over cards with patient boredom. Marlin walked up to the bar. \\"Whiskey,\\" he said, and when the drink came he tossed it straight down and felt it pull his lips into a grimace. He nodded for a refill. When he turned to face the room they were all watching him. \\"I'm looking for a man named Kraamer,\\" Marlin said. \\"Anybody here know of him?\\" One of the cowboys turned casually and rang the spittoon with a stream of tobacco juice.

Stream of Consciousness Reasoning: When considering forms of live entertainment, various options come to mind, such as concerts, stand-up comedy, and dance performances. However, the context of the query points to a medium involving stories, emotions, and characters. Concerts focus more on music and melody, while stand-up comedy highlights humor and personal anecdotes. Dance performances, although interpretative, do not primarily use dialogue to convey ideas. Of these live entertainment forms, theater stands out as the most comprehensive option that encompasses acting, dialogue, and visual elements to create a unique storytelling experience for its audience. Therefore, theater is the appropriate answer to the question."},{"instruction":"Information: - Jesus (; c. 4 BC c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church. - The Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with more than 1.27 billion members worldwide. As one of the oldest religious institutions in the world, it has played a prominent role in the history of Western civilisation. Headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the pope, its doctrines are summarised in the Nicene Creed. The Catholic Church is notable within Western Christianity for its sacred tradition and seven sacraments. - Branimir ( Latin : Brannimero ) was a ruler of the Duchy of Croatia who reigned as duke ( knez ) from 879 to 892 . His country received papal recognition as a state from Pope John VIII on 7 June 879 . During his reign , Croatia retained its sovereignty from both Frankish and Byzantine rule and became de jure independent . - In ecclesiastical heraldry, papal coats of arms (those of individual popes) and those of the Holy See and Vatican City State include an image of crossed keys to represent the metaphorical keys of the office of Saint Peter, the keys of heaven, or the keys of the kingdom of Heaven, that, according to Roman Catholic teaching, Jesus promised to Saint Peter, empowering him to take binding actions. In the Gospel of Matthew , Jesus says to Peter, \\"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven.\\" The keys of heaven or keys of Saint Peter are seen as a symbol of papal authority: \\"Behold he [Peter] received the keys of the kingdom of heaven, the power of binding and loosing is committed to him, the care of the whole Church and its government is given to him [cura ei totius Ecclesiae et principatus committitur (Epist., lib. V, ep. xx, in P.L., LXXVII, 745)]\\". - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. What entity does 'branimir of croatia' has the relation 'religion' with?","output":"Branimir of Croatia has a relation with the Catholic Church in terms of religion. He was a ruler of the Duchy of Croatia and reigned as a duke from 879 to 892. During Branimir's reign, Croatia retained its sovereignty from both Frankish and Byzantine rule and became de jure independent. Importantly, his country received papal recognition as a state from Pope John VIII on 7 June 879. This recognition established a connection between Branimir's Croatia and the Catholic Church, solidifying their relationship in terms of religion."},{"instruction":"Given a sentence in the Central Khmer, provide an equivalent translation in Japanese that retains the same meaning through the translation.

Josh Mallon and Ace Lannigan are best friends and work aboard the same ship. As their ship returns to the US after a long voyage, they see all the other sailors being mistreated by their wives and girlfriends, and the two friends pledge never to get involved with women again. Unfortunately, this vow is tested almost immediately. First, Ace is confronted by the family of a former lover, Cherry, who insist he marry her. Then Josh, who is the son of rich shipping magnate, has to fend off his fiancee, Gloria, and his father's wishes that he settle down and take over the family business. Things get worse when Josh and Ace get caught up fishing and turn up late for a party to celebrate Josh's engagement.

It is the traditional homeland of the Tibetan people as well as some other ethnic groups such as Monpa, Qiang, and Lhoba peoples and is now also inhabited by considerable numbers of Han Chinese and Hui people. Tibet is the highest region on Earth, with an average elevation of . The highest elevation in Tibet is Mount Everest, Earth's highest mountain, rising 8,848 m (29,029 ft) above sea level. - Korea is a historical state in East Asia, since 1945 divided into two distinct sovereign states: North Korea (officially the \\"Democratic People's Republic of Korea\\") and South Korea (officially the \\"Republic of Korea\\"). Located on the Korean Peninsula, Korea is bordered by China to the northwest and Russia to the northeast. It is separated from Japan to the east by the Korea Strait and the East Sea. - Hua Tuo ( c. 140 -- 208 ) , courtesy name Yuanhua , was an ancient Chinese physician who lived in the late Eastern Han Dynasty . The historical texts Records of the Three Kingdoms and Book of the Later Han record Hua as the first person in China to use anaesthesia during surgery . He used a general anaesthetic combining wine with a herbal concoction called máfèisàn ( , lit. \`\` cannabis boil powder '' ) . Besides being respected for expertise in surgery and anaesthesia , Hua Tuo was famous for his abilities in acupuncture , moxibustion , herbal medicine , and medical Daoyin exercises . He developed the Wuqinxi ( Wade -- Giles : Wu - chin - hsi ; ; lit. \`\` Exercise of the Five Animals '' ) from studying movements of the tiger , deer , bear , ape , and crane . - Romance of the Three Kingdoms, attributed to Luo Guanzhong, is a historical novel set in the turbulent years towards the end of the Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period in Chinese history, starting in 169 AD and ending with the reunification of the land in 280. - Chen Shou (233297), courtesy name Chengzuo, was an official and writer who lived in the Three Kingdoms period and Jin dynasty. He started his career as an official in the state of Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms era but was demoted and sent out of the capital for his refusal to fawn on Huang Hao, an influential court eunuch in Shu in its twilight years. After the fall of Shu in 263, Chen's career entered a period of stagnation before he was recommended by the minister Zhang Hua to serve in the Jin government. He held mainly scribal and secretarial positions under the Jin government before dying from illness in 297. He had over 200 writings about 30 of which he co-wrote with his relatives attributed to him. - Cao Wei (220265) was one of the three major states that competed for supremacy over China in the Three Kingdoms period (220280). With its capital at Luoyang, the state was established by Cao Pi in 220, based upon the foundations laid by his father, Cao Cao, towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty. The name \\"Wei\\" first became associated with Cao Cao when he was named the Duke of Wei by the Eastern Han government in 213, and became the name of the state when Cao Pi proclaimed himself emperor in 220. Historians often add the prefix \\"Cao\\" to distinguish it from other Chinese states known as \\"Wei\\", such as Wei of the Warring States period and Northern Wei of the Southern and Northern Dynasties. The authority of the ruling Cao family gradually weakened after the death of the second Wei emperor, Cao Rui, and eventually fell into the hands of Sima Yi, a Wei regent, and his family, in 249. Cao Rui's successors remained as puppet rulers under the control of the Simas until Sima Yi's grandson, Sima Yan, forced the last Wei ruler, Cao Huan, to abdicate the throne and established the Jin dynasty. - Acupuncture is a form of alternative medicine in which thin needles are inserted into the body. It is a key component of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). TCM theory and practice are not based upon scientific knowledge, and acupuncture is a pseudoscience. There is a diverse range of acupuncture theories based on different philosophies, and techniques vary depending on the country. The method used in TCM is likely the most widespread in the US. It is most often used for pain relief, though it is also used for a wide range of other conditions. Acupuncture is generally used only in combination with other forms of treatment. The conclusions of many trials and numerous systematic reviews of acupuncture are largely inconsistent. An overview of Cochrane reviews found that acupuncture is not effective for a wide range of conditions, and it suggests acupuncture may be effective only for chemotherapy-induced nausea/vomiting, postoperative nausea/vomiting, and idiopathic headache. A systematic review of systematic reviews found little evidence of acupuncture's effectiveness in treating pain. The evidence suggests that short-term treatment with acupuncture does not produce long-term benefits. Some research results suggest acupuncture can alleviate pain, though the majority of research suggests that acupuncture's effects are mainly due to placebo. A systematic review concluded that the analgesic effect of acupuncture seemed to lack clinical relevance and could not be clearly distinguished from bias. - The Han dynasty was the second imperial dynasty of China (206 BC220 AD), preceded by the Qin dynasty (221206 BC) and succeeded by the Three Kingdoms period (220280 AD). Spanning over four centuries, the Han period is considered a golden age in Chinese history. To this day, China's majority ethnic group refers to itself as the \\"Han people\\" and the Chinese script is referred to as \\"Han characters\\". It was founded by the rebel leader Liu Bang, known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu of Han, and briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty (923 AD) of the former regent Wang Mang. This interregnum separates the Han dynasty into two periods: the Western Han or Former Han (206 BC 9 AD) and the Eastern Han or Later Han (25220 AD). - The Three Kingdoms (AD 220280) was the tripartite division of China between the states of Wei, Shu, and Wu, following the Han dynasty and preceding the Jin dynasty. The term \\"Three Kingdoms\\" itself is something of a mistranslation, since each state was eventually headed not by a king, but by an emperor who claimed legitimate succession from the Han dynasty. Nevertheless, the term \\"Three Kingdoms\\" has become standard among sinologists. To further distinguish the three states from other historical Chinese states of similar names, historians have added a relevant character: Wei is also known as Cao Wei, Shu is also known as Shu Han, and Wu is also known as Dong (or Eastern) Wu. - The Hou Hanshu (), or Book of the Later Han, also known as History of the Later Han, is a Chinese court document covering the history of the Han dynasty from 6 to 189 CE. It was compiled by Fan Ye and others in the 5th century during the Liu Song dynasty, using a number of earlier histories and documents as sources. - Wu (222280), commonly known as Eastern Wu or Sun Wu, was one of the three major states that competed for supremacy over China in the Three Kingdoms period (220280). It previously existed from 220222 as a vassal kingdom nominally under Cao Wei, its rival state, but declared independence from Wei and became a sovereign state in 222. It became an empire in 229 after its founding ruler, Sun Quan, declared himself 'Emperor'. Its name was derived from the place it was based in the Jiangnan (Yangtze River Delta) region, which was also historically known as \\"Wu\\". It was referred to as \\"Eastern Wu\\" or \\"Sun Wu\\" by historians to distinguish it from other Chinese historical states with similar names which were also located in that region, such as the Wu state in the Spring and Autumn period and the Wuyue kingdom in the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. It was called \\"Eastern Wu\\" because it occupied most of eastern China in the Three Kingdoms period, and \\"Sun Wu\\" because the family name of its rulers was \\"Sun\\". During its existence, Wu's capital was at Jianye (present-day Nanjing, Jiangsu), but at times it was also at Wuchang (present-day Ezhou, Hubei). - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower. - Moxibustion is a traditional Chinese medicine therapy which consists of burning dried mugwort (\\"moxa\\") on particular points on the body. It plays an important role in the traditional medical systems of China (including Tibet), Japan, Korea, Vietnam, and Mongolia. Suppliers usually age the mugwort and grind it up to a fluff; practitioners burn the fluff or process it further into a cigar-shaped stick. They can use it indirectly, with acupuncture needles, or burn it on the patient's skin. - Luo Ben (c. 13301400, or c.12801360), better known by his courtesy name Guanzhong, was a Chinese writer who lived during the Yuan and Ming periods. He was also known by his pseudonym Huhai Sanren. Luo was attributed with writing \\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\\" and editing \\"Water Margin\\", the first two of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature. - A courtesy name (\\"zi\\"), also known as a style name, is a name bestowed upon one at adulthood in addition to one's given name. This practice is a tradition in East Asian cultures, including China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. - The Records of the Three Kingdoms is a Chinese historical text which covers the history of the late Eastern Han dynasty (c. 184220 AD) and the Three Kingdoms period (220280 AD). It is widely regarded as the official and authoritative historical text for that period. Written by Chen Shou in the third century, the work combines the smaller histories of the rival states of Cao Wei, Shu Han and Eastern Wu in the Three Kingdoms period into a single text. The \\"Records of the Three Kingdoms\\" provided the basis for the historical novel \\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\\" written by Luo Guanzhong in the 14th century. - Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a style of traditional medicine informed by modern medicine but built on a foundation of more than 2,500 years of Chinese medical practice that includes various forms of herbal medicine, acupuncture, massage (tui na), exercise (qigong), and dietary therapy. It is primarily used as a complementary alternative medicine approach. TCM is widely used in China and is becoming increasingly prevalent in Europe and North America. - Shu or Shu Han (221263) was one of the three major states that competed for supremacy over China in the Three Kingdoms period (220280). The state was based in the area around present-day Sichuan and Chongqing, which was historically known as \\"Shu\\" after an earlier state in Sichuan named Shu. Shu Han's founder Liu Bei had named his state \\"Han\\" as he considered it the legitimate successor to the Han dynasty, while \\"Shu\\" is added to the name as a geographical prefix to differentiate it from the many \\"Han\\" states throughout Chinese history. - Vietnam, officially the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRV), is the easternmost country on the Indochina Peninsula in Southeast Asia. With an estimated 90.5 million inhabitants , it is the world's 14th-most-populous country, and the eighth-most-populous Asian country. Vietnam is bordered by China to the north, Laos to the northwest, Cambodia to the southwest, Thailand across the Gulf of Thailand to the southwest, and the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia across the South China Sea to the east and southeast. Its capital city has been Hanoi since the reunification of North and South Vietnam in 1976. - Guangdong (Simplified ) is a province on the South China Sea coast of the People's Republic of China. Formerly romanised as Canton or Kwangtung, Guangdong surpassed Henan and Sichuan to become the most populous province in China in January 2005, registering 79.1 million permanent residents and 31 million migrants who lived in the province for at least six months of the year; the total population was 104,303,132 in the 2010 census, accounting for 7.79 percent of Mainland China's population. The provincial capital Guangzhou and economic hub Shenzhen are among the most populous and important cities in China. The population increase since the census has been modest, the province at 2014 end had 107,240,000 people. - Alternative medicine or fringe medicine are practices claimed to have the healing effects of medicine but are disproven, unproven, impossible to prove, or only harmful. Alternative therapies or diagnoses are not part of medicine or science-based healthcare systems. Alternative medicine consists of a wide variety of practices, products, and therapiesranging from those that are biologically plausible but not well tested, to those with known harmful and toxic effects. Contrary to popular belief, significant expense is paid in testing alternative medicine, including over 2.5 billion spent by the United States government, with almost none showing any effect beyond that of false treatment. Perceived effects of alternative medicine may be caused by placebo, decreased effects of functional treatment (and therefore also decreased side-effects), and regression toward the mean where improvement that would have occurred anyway is credited to alternative therapies. Alternative medicine is not the same as experimental medicine. - In the Chinese martial arts, imagery of the Five AnimalsTiger, Crane, Leopard, Snake, and Dragonappears predominantly in Southern styles, especially those associated with Guangdong and Fujian Provinces. An alternate selection which is also widely used is the crane, the tiger, the monkey, the snake, and the mantis. What is the relationship between 'hua tuo' and '200'?

Given that the answer to a question is \\"Thank Lee\\", what is the question? A:","output":"Who should we thank for giving the employee a bonus?"},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Given the following context: During the Iraq War, U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Shane Matthews is a sniper who is sent to investigate a pipeline construction site in the desert of the country, with his spotter, Sergeant Allen Isaac. The pair patiently wait 22 hours on overwatch before determining that the site is clear. Matthews proceeds to investigate the site, but is shot by an Iraqi sniper. Isaac tries to rescue the dying Matthews, but he is also wounded in the right knee and has his radio damaged and his water bottle destroyed in the process. Alone, Isaac takes cover behind an unsteady wall and tends to his wounds. The sniper has a radio tuned into the American channel, and uses it to communicate with Isaac under the pretense of being a high ranking allied soldier at another site. The deception allows the sniper to get other useful information from Isaac. Throughout their various one-sided attempts at conversation, we learn that the sniper does not claim to be the mythical Juba mentioned earlier in the film, a nom de guerre for various Al Qaeda snipers notorious for filming their attacks on American soldiers. Isaac's attempts to call headquarters for help are stymied by the loss of his radio antennae. He attempts to repair this item with one from a dead contractor's radio, only to discern that the sniper had used the earlier response team as a ruse to call for help and lure another response force into his jaws. Matthews regains consciousness and subtly gets Isaac's attention that he's still alive. Matthews slowly crawls towards his rifle in the midst of the dusty wind along with Isaac distracting Juba with small talk. Matthews believes that the sniper is hiding at the top of some rubble nearby and fires in that direction. The dusty wind settles quickly. The sniper sees Matthews and fires, injuring Matthews in the left shoulder as he crawled towards the wall, but a second shot kills him. answer the following question: What is the full name of the person whose water bottle was destroyed?

My buddy and I also had a giant beer (Spotted Cow?) and that was really good but it was forgettable really compared to the delicious other beers I had in Madison. Was this review given positively or negatively?","output":"The review given is primarily negative. The reviewer points out multiple aspects of dissatisfaction with their experience, such as the subpar quality of the braut compared to the ones they had in Madison, the forgettable nature of the Ruben sandwich, and the fact that the beer, while good, was not memorable compared to other beers they enjoyed in Madison. The comparison of Essen Haus to their experiences in Madison strongly implies that they had better dining experiences there, which further emphasizes the negativity of the review. The only slight positive mentioned was that the giant beer, Spotted Cow, was \\"really good.\\" However, it was still deemed forgettable compared to other Madison beers, which minimizes this positive aspect. In summary, the long answer is that the review was given negatively, as the reviewer expressed disappointment in several aspects of their dining experience at Essen Haus, highlighting that the food and drink were not as enjoyable or memorable as what they have had in Madison. All these factors combine to give a consistently negative impression of the experience."},{"instruction":"Answer based on context: In the county, the population was spread out with 29.60% under the age of 18, 6.40% from 18 to 24, 31.70% from 25 to 44, 23.40% from 45 to 64, and 8.90% who were 65 years of age or older.

Lawrence Morton, in a study of the origins of The Rite, records that in 1907–08 Stravinsky set to music two poems from Sergey Gorodetsky's collection Yar. Another poem in the anthology, which Stravinsky did not set but is likely to have read, is \\"Yarila\\" which, Morton observes, contains many of the basic elements from which The Rite of Spring developed, including pagan rites, sage elders, and the propitiatory sacrifice of a young maiden: \\"The likeness is too close to be coincidental\\". Stravinsky himself gave contradictory accounts of the genesis of The Rite. In a 1920 article he stressed that the musical ideas had come first, that the pagan setting had been suggested by the music rather than the other way round. However, in his 1936 autobiography he described the origin of the work thus: \\"One day [in 1910], when I was finishing the last pages of L'Oiseau de Feu in St Petersburg, I had a fleeting vision ... I saw in my imagination a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of the Sacre du Printemps\\".By May 1910 Stravinsky was discussing his idea with Nicholas Roerich, the foremost Russian expert on folk art and ancient rituals. Roerich had a reputation as an artist and mystic, and had provided the stage designs for Diaghilev's 1909 production of the Polovtsian Dances. The pair quickly agreed on a working title, \\"The Great Sacrifice\\" (Russian: Velikaia zhertva); Diaghilev gave his blessing to the work, although the collaboration was put on hold for a year while Stravinsky was occupied with his second major commission for Diaghilev, the ballet Petrushka.In July 1911 Stravinsky visited Talashkino, near Smolensk, where Roerich was staying with the Princess Maria Tenisheva, a noted patron of the arts and a sponsor of Diaghilev's magazine World of Art. Here, over several days, Stravinsky and Roerich finalised the structure of the ballet. Thomas F. Kelly, in his history of the Rite...

It enables policymakers, businesses, and various stakeholders to cater to the specific needs and preferences of different demographic groups. The age group of 45-64, often referred to as the middle-aged population, is of particular interest due to its implications on employment, healthcare, and social dynamics. In this article, we will explore the percentage of individuals who weren't within the 45-64 age bracket, shedding light on the importance of recognizing and catering to these other age groups. Step 1: Identifying the data source To answer the question at hand, we first need to identify a reliable data source that offers comprehensive breakdowns of age distribution in a particular population. The data could come from a national census, statistically accurate survey, or an international organization such as the United Nations or World Bank. For this article, we will assume we have access to a reliable data set that provides us with the total population and the number of individuals in each age group. Step 2: Isolating the 45-64 age group Once we have our data source, we'll need to pinpoint the number or percentage of individuals belonging to the 45-64 age group. This can be done by referring to the data set and isolating the age group in question. Step 3: Calculating the percentage of the population that's outside the 45-64 age group Having identified the number of individuals in the 45-64 age category, our next step is to calculate the percentage of the population that falls outside this age group. To do this, we'll subtract the number of individuals in the 45-64 age group from the total population and then divide the result by the total population. We'll then multiply the resulting fraction by 100 to obtain the percentage. The formula can be represented as follows: Percentage of individuals outside the 45-64 age group = ((Total Population - Number of people aged 45-64) / Total Population) * 100 Step 4: Analysis of results Once we have the percentage of individuals that weren't within the 45-64 age bracket, it's essential to put this figure into context. Comparing the percentage with other age groups can reveal interesting insights about the population's overall age distribution. Moreover, examining trends in age groups over time can highlight significant demographic shifts that may influence policy decisions and service provisions. Step 5: Reflecting on implications Identifying the percentage of individuals outside the 45-64 age group is not merely a numerical exercise; it also has real-life implications. Policymakers must consider the needs of people within and outside this demographic when formulating policies relating to education, healthcare, transportation, and social services. Failure to account for the diverse age composition of the population could result in ineffective or even harmful policies that neglect the needs of certain groups. Conclusion In conclusion, calculating the percentage of people who do not fall within the 45-64 age group offers valuable insights into the overall age distribution of a population. By following the steps outlined in this article, we can assess the composition of various age groups and inform data-driven policy decisions to improve the well-being of all citizens, regardless of their age."},{"instruction":"our guests in the bungalows are welcome in the hotel's fine restaurant or in the bar for a drink.

Liu, New York City’s comptroller, said he was “heartbroken” that the state’s top Democrats, skittish about a federal investigation into his campaign fund-raising, had excluded him from their delegate list to the Democratic National Convention. But this week, as most of the Democratic establishment, including all of his presumed major rivals in the 2013 race for mayor, gathers in Charlotte, N.C., Mr. Liu is doing his best to attract attention 7,000 miles away in Asia. He is visiting Seoul and Taipei, Taiwan, as part of a four-day whirlwind trip that will feature at least 14 events, including audiences with the mayor of Seoul and the vice president of Taiwan. One of the highlights of the trip came on Tuesday, when he delivered a speech at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul to a packed auditorium of more than 230 people, including 100 exchange students from the State University of New York, Mr. Liu’s alma mater. Mr. Liu, who was born in Taiwan but moved to New York as a child, said he was in Asia to promote business and investment opportunities for the city. The trip also promises to afford him a chance to connect with civic and business leaders who have ties to American immigrant communities and who could be potential donors, according to two people close to Mr. Liu. The host governments are paying for Mr. Liu’s airfare and lodging, which is permissible under city rules. In Seoul, many of Mr. Liu’s activities were arranged by Korea’s consulate in New York City, as well as by Mr. Liu’s office, according to the organizers. The organizers said they had discussed the federal inquiry into the comptroller’s campaign fund-raising, which so far has resulted in the arrests of his former treasurer and a top fund-raiser. “I am aware that Mr. Liu’s staff is under investigation, and we had a staff meeting about this,” said Jang Tae-yeoub, dean of external affairs at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. “But we decided to go ahead with his visiting our university because the investigation is ongoing and not final.” Park Yoon-joo, a director at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, said, “I do not think it is our business to get involved in those domestic political affairs,” before praising Mr. Liu as “a very active, promising leader fostering good relationships with various minority communities including the Korean-Americans.” At times, Mr. Liu touched on the political issues being discussed in Charlotte. Asked about “the most crucial factor in passing the budget,” for instance, he offered a rousing defense of President Obama. He said that “in my opinion, from Day 1, there were some people in Washington who were determined to see President Obama fail,” and he criticized the Tea Party, particularly for “standing in the way and making life difficult for the president.” Mr. Liu also addressed issues that would most likely be highlighted if he ran for mayor next year, including his aggressive auditing of city agencies, his desire to speed up infrastructure development and his personal history as an immigrant who was “made in Taiwan.” The city’s “Asian-American population continues to grow, is talented and is clearly on the move as they serve as our bridge to Asia,” he said to his audience at Hankuk University. “I want all of you to help me build that bridge,” he added, before saying, “Gamsahamnida,” which means “thank you” in Korean. This week’s trip is the fourth that Mr. Liu has taken overseas since becoming comptroller in January 2010, but his first since November 2010. From Seoul, he flew to Taiwan — his birthplace and the island of origin of many of the immigrants who are a dominant force in his Flushing neighborhood. His schedule included visits to two cabinet ministries and an address to the Taiwan Academy of Banking and Finance. Even in Seoul, which is 6,885 miles from New York, Mr. Liu was asked about his possible candidacy for mayor. “I can’t believe I am in Seoul and people are still asking me that question,” he said at one point. At a 7-Eleven outside the university after his speech, Mr. Liu acknowledged that he had given the idea some thought. “People say that I would be a different kind of mayor,” he said, after buying a bottle of Korean corn tea and a pack of dried squid. “I think it would be obvious why.” Su Hyun Lee reported from Seoul, and David W. Chen from New York.","output":"\\"New York City Comptroller John C.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper accuses coalition leaders of \\"betrayal\\" by relying on Quebec separatists' support. \\"Unfortunately, even before the government has brought forward its budget, and only seven weeks after a general election, the opposition wants to overturn the results of that election,\\" said the prime minister, whose Conservative Party strengthened its minority position in federal elections on October 14. \\"Canada's government cannot enter into a power-sharing coalition with a separatist party at a time of global insecurity,\\" he said. \\"Canada's government must stand unequivocally for keeping the country together.\\" The country is undergoing \\"a pivotal moment in our history,\\" he said, then ticked through a list of efforts his government is making to help the country survive the economic crisis, including personal tax reductions, doubling of spending on infrastructure, injecting liquidity into the financial markets and securing pension plans. iReport.com: Outrage brewing in Canada. \\"Tonight, I pledge to you that Canada's government will use every legal means at our disposal to protect our democracy, protect our economy and to protect Canada,\\" he said. Though Harper did not specify what those legal means might entail, his opponents predicted that he would try to dissolve Parliament and wasted no time in voicing their opposition. The Liberal Party, which lost seats in the October vote, and the leftist New Democratic Party announced plans earlier this week to form a governing coalition with the support of the Bloc Quebecois, which supports independence for French-speaking Quebec. In a televised address that followed Harper's, opposition Liberal leader Stephane Dion called for a vote of confidence. He said he had asked Canada's Governor-General Michaelle Jean -- the acting head of state who would call for a new election or a confidence vote -- \\"to refuse any request by the prime minister to suspend Parliament until he has demonstrated to her that he still commands the confidence of the house.\\" He said Canada \\"is facing the impact of the global economic crisis\\" and must act quickly. \\"Stephen Harper refuses to propose measures to stimulate the economy\\" and his party has lost the confidence of the majority of the House of Commons, he said. \\"This means that they have lost the right to govern,\\" Dion said. He said he and Jack Layton, head of the New Democratic Party, had agreed to form a coalition government to address the economic crisis, and that the Green Party supported it too. \\"Coalitions are normal and put in practice in many parts of the world and are able to work very successfully,\\" he said. \\"Mr. Harper's solution is to extend the crisis by avoiding a simple vote -- by suspending Parliament and continuing the confusion,\\" Dion said. \\"We offer a better way. We say, settle it now and let's get to work on the people's business.\\" The vote scheduled for Monday ought to be allowed to proceed, he said. In separate televised remarks, Layton accused Harper of having \\"delivered a partisan attack.\\" The Conservative Party's plan would create no jobs and protect no pensions, he said. \\"He seems to be more interested in his job than in protecting your job,\\" Layton said. \\"Now, that's simply wrong.\\" Highlights:","output":"1. Prime Minister Stephen Harper is trying to stop a no-confidence vote in Parliament. 2. He doesn't want a coalition government to replace his own. 3. Harper believes the coalition leaders are betraying Canada by supporting Quebec separatists. 4. He is working to help Canada through the economic crisis with tax reductions, spending on infrastructure, and securing pensions. 5. The opposition parties want to form a coalition government, saying Harper's party is not doing enough to help the economy. 6. The vote scheduled for Monday will decide if Harper's government stays in power or if a coalition takes over."},{"instruction":"Q: Given a disfluent sentence, modify the sentence to it to its equivalent fluent form, preserving the meaning of the sentence.

Options: - freedom of expression - freedom of information - hugs - own house - food and water Step-by-step reasoning process below:","output":"To thrive, a person needs more than just the basic necessities of life. Considering the options provided, we can analyze each of them and identify the two most crucial factors for a person's well-being: 1. Freedom of expression - This is essential for one to express their thoughts, opinions, and emotions without any restrictions. It helps in personal and emotional growth, mental well-being, and building strong connections with others. 2. Freedom of information - Access to information allows people to educate themselves, make informed decisions, and stay connected to the world around them. It plays a significant role in intellectual development, and personal and professional growth. 3. Hugs - While physical touch is important for emotional well-being and bonding, they are not as vital as other factors, like freedom of expression and information, when it comes to thriving in life. 4. Own house - Having shelter is a basic need, but owning a house is not a crucial factor for thriving. Adequate housing and a sense of security are important, but they can be achieved through various means, including renting or sharing a living space. 5. Food and water - These are basic physiological needs essential for survival. While they are vital, thriving involves more than just meeting basic physical needs. In conclusion, to thrive in addition to fulfilling the need to breathe, a person needs freedom of expression and freedom of information. These factors help with personal and emotional growth, intellectual development, and building connections with others, all of which contribute to the overall well-being of a person."},{"instruction":"Premise: well that's pretty good my my sister is very over zealous too she's got Hypothesis: That's good.

So when he began dabbling heavily in cryptocurrencies years ago, his friends and family tried to dissuade him, figuring it was another erratic obsession. And, indeed, he abandoned some early investments and sold his Bitcoin a few years ago. But then Mellon got turned on to XRP, spending some 2 million to acquire coins, which he liked because it's one of the few cryptocurrencies that are working within the banking system. \\"Crypto is scary and dark. It's anti-America,\\" says Mellon, 54. \\"I am pro-America, pro-business and pro-bank. That's why I went with Ripple.\\" Mellon's XRP is worth around 1 billion. Recently divorced, he parties in a posh Los Angeles house he rents for 150,000 month. \\"It's 1 billion virtually for free. I actually have earned it because I was the only person who was willing to raise his hand,\\" says Mellon. \\"My family thought I was insane, when I knew it was a home run.\\" *All cryptocurrency/U.S. dollar conversions are as of January 19, 2018.

Mellon, an early backer of global settlement network Ripple, was the ex-husband of Jimmy Choo guru Tamara Mellon and of designer Nicole Hanley, his second wife. A rep said in a statement: “Billionaire Matthew Mellon, 53, died suddenly in Cancun, Mexico, where he was attending a drug rehabilitation facility. Mellon made his fortune in cryptocurrency, turning a 2 million investment into 1 billion. He is survived by his three children, Force, Olympia and Minty. The family asks that their privacy be respected at this very painful time.” On Tuesday, the same rep amended their statement to say: “Billionaire Matthew Mellon, 53, died suddenly in Cancun, Mexico, where he was planning to check into a rehabilitation facility for follow-up treatment.” Mellon, a former chair of the New York Republican Party’s finance committee, had battled addiction. In 2016, he told The Post, “OxyContin is like legal heroin. And it needs to be addressed,” while at a Malibu treatment center kicking a habit of 100,000 a month. But he was in Forbes this year for his latest investments. Tamara, who with Mellon had daughter Araminta, aka Minty, said in 2013, “He keeps fighting and coming back.” Mellon and Nicole, parents of Force and Olympia, announced their split in 2015 after an attempted reconciliation. ||||| Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Blue-blood banking heir Matthew Mellon is in the Passages Malibu addiction-treatment center kicking his OxyContin habit. Mellon was spending 100,000 a month and taking about 80 pills a day when he checked himself in nearly two weeks ago. “[Using that much] is the death zone,” Mellon told me. The handsome ex of former Jimmy Choo shoe queen Tamara Mellon and fashion designer Nicole Hanley said he got hooked after suffering a painful surfing injury. “The doctors kept writing prescriptions like they were Smarties. It’s very irresponsible,” Mellon said. He continued, dead seriously, “OxyContin is like legal heroin. And it needs to be addressed.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently tightened up prescription guidelines after a surge in opioid drug overdoses among white middle-aged patients. Mellon — who has been flooded with expressions of support from friends — is determined to tame this demon. “I’m here as long as it takes,” he said. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Matthew Mellon, an heir to one of America's major banking fortunes and former chair of the New York Republican Party's finance committee, was a significant personality in the world of cryptocurrency. Despite his struggle with drug addiction and skepticism from those around him, Mellon invested heavily in cryptocurrencies, in particular XRP or Ripple. His faith in the potential of this digital money was justified when his 2 million investment transformed into around 1 billion. Mellon found XRP attractive due to its association and acceptance within the banking system. Known for his pro-American, pro-business, and pro-bank stance, Mellon considered Ripple a safer bet in the volatile world of cryptocurrency, which he viewed as \\"scary and dark.\\" He was not afraid to make huge investments when others were reluctant. Despite his family's doubts about his investment strategy, Mellon was confident his move would pay off brilliantly, and it did. Mellon's life, however, had its shadows. He was known to have severe struggles with drug dependency and had spent a fortune in treatment facilities trying to overcome his addiction to OxyContin. His addiction stemmed from a painful surfing injury and escalated with doctors recklessly prescribing him the addictive opioid. Mellon compared the drug to \\"legal heroin\\" and was outspoken about the need to address the opioid crisis. Despite his enormous struggles, Matthew remained a committed investor and was often in the media spotlight for his vast fortune made in cryptocurrency. Tragically, his life took a sharp turn when he passed away suddenly in Mexico at the age of 53, where he was about to check into a rehabilitation facility for additional treatment. He was formerly married to Jimmy Choo mogul Tamara Mellon and designer Nicole Hanley, with whom he had three children. His unexpected death is a sobering contrast to his gargantuan success in the world of cryptocurrency, serving as a stark reminder of the human costs of drug addiction."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it? Who has won more Grand Slam doubles titles, Elizabeth Smylie or Vasek Pospisil? The answer is:","output":"Elizabeth Smylie has won more Grand Slam doubles titles than Vasek Pospisil. In order to provide a detailed and reasoned explanation, let's first dive into the careers of both these professional tennis players, comparing their accomplishments and statistics in the sport. Elizabeth Smylie, an Australian tennis player born on April 11, 1963, retired in 1999. During her professional tennis career, she focused primarily on doubles competitions. Smylie managed to excel in this discipline, winning a total of four Grand Slam doubles titles. These titles are as follows: 1. Australian Open (1985): Partnering with Kathy Jordan, the duo won the women's doubles event by defeating the team of Martina Navratilova and Pam Shriver in the final. 2. French Open (1988): Teaming up with Wendy Turnbull, the pair secured the title in the women's doubles competition, overcoming the team of Martina Navratilova and Pam Shriver. 3. Wimbledon (1985): In the women's doubles category, Smylie and Kathy Jordan emerged victorious against the pair of Hana Mandlíková and Wendy Turnbull in the final match. 4. US Open (1989): Smylie, alongside her partner Hana Mandlíková, won the women's doubles championship, defeating the team of Martina Navratilova and Patty Fendick in the final. In addition to her doubles accomplishments, Smylie also earned one Grand Slam title in mixed doubles, winning the 1990 Wimbledon Championships alongside her partner Todd Woodbridge. On the other hand, Vasek Pospisil, a Canadian tennis player born on June 23, 1990, has achieved success in both singles and doubles competitions. Throughout his career, Pospisil has won only one Grand Slam doubles title so far: 1. Wimbledon (2014): Partnering with Jack Sock, Pospisil won the men's doubles event by defeating the opposing team of Bob Bryan and Mike Bryan in the final. While Pospisil has had an impressive career and continues to compete in professional tournaments, Elizabeth Smylie has the edge in terms of Grand Slam doubles titles. With four Grand Slam doubles titles and one mixed doubles title to her name, Smylie's accomplishments in the world of professional tennis surpass those of Pospisil, who currently has one major doubles title to his credit."},{"instruction":"How's your year going?

Which artist used a terrace at St Thomas' Hospital as a vantage point for his series of paintings of the Houses of Parliament?","output":"The artist who used a terrace at St. Thomas' Hospital as a vantage point for his series of paintings of the Houses of Parliament is Claude Monet, a renowned French Impressionist painter. Born on November 14, 1840, Monet was a critical figure in the Impressionist movement that transformed French painting in the second half of the 19th century. During his career, Monet employed a unique technique that focused on capturing light and vivid hues, emphasizing the beauty and vibrancy of the scenes he painted. The paintings of the Houses of Parliament were created during his three-month stay in London between late 1899 and early 1900. He worked on this series at the nearby St. Thomas' Hospital, which offered an ideal vantage point for observing and capturing the structures across the River Thames amid the distinctive atmosphere. The series includes approximately nineteen canvases featuring the iconic political buildings that house the United Kingdom's legislative body. Monet was particularly intrigued by the way fog and pollution diffused sunlight, creating an intricate blend of colors and a mysterious effect around the Houses of Parliament. This atmospheric display can be seen in his celebrated works such as \\"The Houses of Parliament, Sunset,\\" \\"Houses of Parliament, Effect of Sunlight in the Fog\\" and \\"The Houses of Parliament with Fog.\\" During the time he painted this series, Monet was staying at the Savoy Hotel, where he had set up a studio within his suite. Every day, he would travel to the terrace at St. Thomas' Hospital, armed with numerous canvases. Monet would repeatedly work on multiple canvases simultaneously, as he aimed to capture the changes in lighting throughout the day and the various moods that the atmosphere evoked. Monet's Houses of Parliament series showcases the power of the Impressionist approach, which took advantage of brief, thick brushstrokes and a thorough understanding of light and color to render stunning landscapes and scenes. It remains one of his most famous series and a testament to his artistic innovation and vision in the world of art."},{"instruction":"Q:Generate a question that has the following answer: The grave digger for the following movie plot: This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","output":"Yes, the answer you found on Google briefly describes the Bretton Woods system, but it does not provide a detailed explanation of its fundamentals. To give you a more comprehensive understanding, let me explain the fundamentals of the Bretton Woods system for fixed exchange rates. The Bretton Woods system was established in 1944 at a conference held in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, USA. The conference brought together delegates from 44 countries to create an international monetary framework that would support post-World War II reconstruction and economic growth. The system was the first of its kind and aimed to foster monetary cooperation, exchange rate stability, and economic growth among participating nations. Some of the key fundamentals of the Bretton Woods system include: 1. Fixed exchange rates: One of the main features of the Bretton Woods system was the establishment of fixed exchange rates. This meant that the value of each participating country's currency was pegged to the US dollar, and the US dollar's value was in turn indirectly tied to gold. Countries agreed to maintain their exchange rates within a narrow band (±1%) of the fixed rate. 2. Role of the US Dollar and Gold: The US dollar became the cornerstone of the Bretton Woods system, as it was the only currency directly convertible to gold. At the time, the US held the majority of the world's gold reserves, which enabled the dollar's value to be fixed at 35 per ounce of gold. This convertibility of the dollar into gold brought stability to the system and increased the international acceptance of the US dollar. 3. Establishment of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank: The Bretton Woods agreement led to the creation of two key financial institutions: the IMF and the World Bank. The IMF was responsible for monitoring and enforcing the fixed exchange rate system and providing temporary financial assistance to countries facing balance of payment issues. The World Bank, initially named the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), aimed to support the economic rebuilding and development of member countries through loans and technical assistance. 4. Capital controls: To maintain the stability of the fixed exchange rate system, participating countries were encouraged to implement capital controls. These restrictions were intended to limit the flow of capital between nations, preventing large speculative financial movements that could destabilize the agreed-upon exchange rates. 5. Adjustment mechanism: When a country faced persistent balance of payment imbalances under the fixed exchange rate system, it could adjust its currency value within the predetermined band. The IMF was responsible for assessing the need for such adjustments and had the authority to approve or disapprove these changes. Although the Bretton Woods system provided a period of relative stability and growth after World War II, it eventually faced several challenges. The link between the US dollar and gold came under pressure as the US experienced high inflation, which reduced the dollar's value. In 1971, President Richard Nixon announced the suspension of the dollar's convertibility into gold, effectively ending the Bretton Woods system. This event marked the beginning of a transition towards a more flexible exchange rate regime, known as the floating exchange rate system, which is currently in place in most countries today."},{"instruction":"Definition: A text is given in Urdu.

She spends 5 minutes cooking lunch. She spends 10 minutes cooking dinner 4 days this week. The rest of the days she spends 30 minutes cooking dinner. How many minutes does Polly spend cooking this week? Thoughts? Step-by-step reasoning:","output":"To determine the total number of minutes Polly spends cooking this week, we need to break the problem down into three parts: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. 1. Breakfast: Polly cooks breakfast every day, and it takes her 20 minutes each time. Since there are 7 days in a week: 20 minutes/day x 7 days = 140 minutes spent cooking breakfast this week. 2. Lunch: Polly spends 5 minutes cooking lunch every day. Again, there are 7 days in a week: 5 minutes/day x 7 days = 35 minutes spent cooking lunch this week. 3. Dinner: For dinner, we are given two different sets of information. Polly cooks dinner for 10 minutes on 4 days of the week, and for 30 minutes on the remaining 3 days. First, let's calculate the time spent cooking dinner on the 4 days where she cooks for 10 minutes: 10 minutes/day x 4 days = 40 minutes spent cooking dinner for those 4 days. Next, we will calculate the time spent cooking dinner on the 3 days where she cooks for 30 minutes: 30 minutes/day x 3 days = 90 minutes spent cooking dinner for those 3 days. Now, we add the time spent cooking dinner on both sets of days: 40 minutes (4 days) + 90 minutes (3 days) = 130 minutes spent cooking dinner this week. Finally, we add the time Polly spends cooking breakfast, lunch, and dinner during the week to find her total time spent cooking: 140 minutes (breakfast) + 35 minutes (lunch) + 130 minutes (dinner) = 305 minutes. So, Polly spends a total of 305 minutes cooking this week."},{"instruction":"Sentence 1: On July 19, 2001, LSC implemented a Reconfiguration Re Sentence 2: LSC didn't reconfigure in 2001 If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"In this case, we have two opposing sentences that provide contradictory information about a single event. The first sentence says \\"On July 19, 2001, LSC implemented a Reconfiguration Re.\\" The second sentence states, \\"LSC didn't reconfigure in 2001.\\" Now, let's analyze both sentences to determine which one is true or if there is a possibility of both being true, though the current information presents a contrasting situation. 1. The first sentence seems to be a partial statement, as the word \\"Re\\" could be the beginning of a longer term. For example, this could be \\"Reconfiguration Request\\" or \\"Reconfiguration Report.\\" Nevertheless, the main point of this sentence is that LSC underwent a reconfiguration process on July 19, 2001. 2. The second sentence is clear in stating that LSC did not undergo any reconfiguration in the year 2001. Taking a closer look at the statements, they cannot both be true simultaneously due to their conflicting nature. If the first sentence is true, it implies that there was a reconfiguration event that took place on July 19, 2001, for LSC. In that case, the second sentence would be considered false because it denies the occurrence of any reconfiguration for LSC in 2001. In conclusion, both statements cannot be true at the same time. If the first statement holds accurate information about the LSC reconfiguration on July 19, 2001, then the second sentence is not true. However, to definitively determine which statement is accurate, more information or context would be necessary."},{"instruction":"Given the question: The explorers visited Galapagos 1 and Galapagos 2, both islands part of the same archipelago. Island 1 had experienced a drought in recent years. Both islands had populations of birds living there. Which island had fewer small-beaked birds that could only crack open smaller seeds? The answer is:","output":"The island with fewer small-beaked birds that could only crack open smaller seeds is likely to be Galapagos 1. To understand why this might be the case, we need to consider the ecological conditions on both islands, particularly the effects of the drought experienced by Galapagos 1. Drought can have a significant impact on the availability and types of food sources for various species, including birds. In the case of the small-beaked birds that rely on smaller seeds for sustenance, a limited amount and variety of such seeds might have a profound effect on their population. During a drought, plants and their seeds may become scarcer as water becomes less available. As a result, competition for food resources among bird populations could increase. Birds with smaller beaks might be at a disadvantage in such situations, as they would have limited access to the smaller seeds that they can consume. Conversely, larger-beaked birds might fare better, as they could have an easier time breaking open larger seeds and accessing an alternative food source. On Galapagos 2, where the ecological conditions have remained stable, there might be a greater availability and diversity of seeds, allowing small-beaked birds to thrive. The competition for seeds might be less intense, with greater opportunities for the smaller-beaked birds to find and consume the smaller seeds they require. Furthermore, the concept of natural selection and adaptive radiation also plays a role in the development of different bird populations on the Galapagos Islands. According to Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, species adapt to their environments through the selection of traits that enhance their chances of survival and reproduction. In this case, small-beaked birds on Galapagos 1 might have faced greater difficulties in securing food and maintaining a stable population due to the prevailing conditions. Over time, small-beaked birds on this island might have experienced a decline in population size, while those with larger beaks and more diverse feeding abilities would have been more likely to survive and reproduce. In contrast, small-beaked birds on Galapagos 2 might not have experienced such strong selective pressure and would have maintained a stable and diverse population. As a result, it is reasonable to conclude that Galapagos 1 likely had fewer small-beaked birds that could only crack open smaller seeds, as their survival would have been challenged by the drought conditions and the accompanying scarcity of food resources."},{"instruction":"Write a 1). tweet.

Drafted primarily by Thomas Jefferson, it serves as a formal announcement of the thirteen American colonies' intention to sever their political ties with Great Britain and establish a new, autonomous nation. While the Declaration of Independence does not specifically enumerate rights, it contains implicit references to certain natural rights and primary ideas that form the basis of the American political system and individual liberties. Here are the main rights and concepts included in or derived from the Declaration of Independence: 1. Equality: The most well-known line of the Declaration states, \\"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.\\" This assertion emphasizes the importance of equality for all citizens, regardless of their social status, ethnicity, or religion. Although the original statement referred specifically to white land-owning men, this concept has evolved over time to encompass every American, irrespective of race, gender, and social standing. 2. Natural Rights: Another key phrase in the Declaration refers to the \\"inalienable rights\\" with which individuals are endowed by their Creator. These natural rights include life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The idea is rooted in Enlightenment-era philosophy and emphasizes the importance of individual freedom and self-determination. 3. The Right to Self-Government: The Declaration of Independence was drafted to justify the American colonists' decision to reject British rule and establish their government. One of the primary grievances listed is the lack of representation in the British Parliament, leading the colonists to declare their right to self-government and build their institutions that reflect their unique identity and interests. 4. Consent of the Governed: The Declaration asserts that governments derive their power from the consent of the governed. This idea is an essential aspect of democratic governance since it emphasizes the importance of the will of the people in determining a country's political framework and institutions. 5. The Right to Revolution: Based on the philosophical works of Enlightenment-era thinkers like John Locke, the Declaration of Independence maintains that when a government becomes oppressive and violates people's natural rights, the governed have the right and duty to alter or abolish it. The document cites numerous instances of abuse of power by the British crown and justifies the colonists' decision to rebel and establish a new government that safeguards their rights and liberties. While the Declaration of Independence does not function as a legal document delineating the specific rights of citizens, it sets forth the foundation for America's philosophical and ethical values. Subsequent important documents, like the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, draw heavily from the principles outlined in the Declaration, establishing a legal framework for protecting the rights of citizens and guiding the country's continued growth and development. In this sense, the Declaration of Independence stands as a precursor and ideological basis for the more detailed enumeration of rights and legal protections provided in later governing documents."},{"instruction":"Instructions: In this task you will be given two lists of numbers and you need to calculate the intersection between these two lists.

Article: Kindergarten outside? Yes, indeed. It's part of a growing worldwide trend toward outdoor education. The schools are called forest kindergartens. The numbers are small so far in the U.S., but the idea is well established in Europe, with schools in Scotland, England, and Switzerland. By far the most such schools are in Germany, which has more than 400 forest kindergartens. Some schools feature several hours of outdoor schooling. This is certainly the case with the Waldorf School of Saratoga Springs. Children there will be venturing out on the nearby Hemlock Trail to learn more about the natural world. Some lessons are focused on nature; others are academic topics delivered in a natural setting. In all cases, students are active-not sitting at desks or on mats on the floor but walking, running, jumping, solving problems like how to get the mud off the bottoms of their shoes before their parents find out. Seriously, the focus is on activity at these schools. Studies have shown that children's immune systems actually get stronger after all of the outdoor activity, and that graduates of forest kindergartens show a higher ability to learn when they progress through their academic careers. Other schools are all outdoors, all the time. This is the case with the Cedar Song Nature School, on Vashon Island, Washington. Students at this school spend their whole three-hour day outdoors, in a private five-acre forest, doing all kinds of physical activities. At these forest kindergartens, students learn science by observing and doing it, learn math by applying it to the natural world around them, learn letters and words by putting them together using sights and sounds. These students learn how to get along with one another, individually and in a group. They also develop healthy levels of self-confidence. Nowadays many children become obese because of sedentary activities like watching television and playing video games. These outdoor schools give children chances to learn just as much, if not more, from opening their eyes... Question: What is special about forest kindergartens?

The death toll has risen to seven from a 'rapidly evolving outbreak' of rare fungal meningitis that has been linked to spinal steroid injections, sparking fear as new cases have been reported in nine U.S. states. The potential scope of the meningitis outbreak, that has sickened 64 people, widened dramatically as health officials warned that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of patients who received steroid back injections in 23 states could be at risk. The outbreak of the disease, known as aspergillus meningitis, is caused by a fungus found in a spinal steroid injections, a fairly common treatment used to relieve back pain, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Beware: Health officials warned that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of patients who received steroid back injections in 23 states could be at risk (stock photo) The latest fatalities were reported in Michigan on Saturday, though the Michigan Department of Community Health said they would not provide more information on the two deaths until after the weekend. The fifth victim, Diana Reed, died on Wednesday afternoon at St Thomas Hospital in Nashville, Tennessee, surrounded by family members. Mrs. Reed, 56, is one of thousands of patients recently treated in Tennessee. hospitals for back pain with a steroid epidural - a fairly typical. treatment. But since then a tainted batch of steroids released across. the U.S. has been linked to dozens of cases of fungal meningitis. Mrs Reed, of Brentwood, Tennessee, was the fifth person to succumb to the infection. A blog written by a close friend of Reed's family, Brandon Scott Thomas, characterized her as 'hilarious, beautiful, and full of life' and praised her for carrying for husband Wayne Reed after he was diagnosed with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease - almost 20 years ago. 'Over the course of the last week she has gone from someone brimming with life to someone in the process of passing from this life to the next,' wrote. 'Her brain couldn't take the stress. After a series of strokes they moved her to hospice care. Wayne, one of the longest surviving patients with ALS, there by her side.' Reed served on the board of her husband's namesake child care organization, the Wayne Reed Christian Child Care Center. The caretaker: Diana Reed dedicated her life to helping underprivileged children before a routine medical procedure infected her with a rare fungal meningitis. Source: The outbreak of the deadly form of meningitis was traced to St Thomas Hospital in Nashville, Tennessee. The injectable steroids responsible. for Reed's death were produced by New England Compounding Center, a. specialized pharmacy in Framingham, Massachusetts. The company has shut down operations and said it is working with regulators to identify the source of the infection. It is not clear how many patients received tainted injections, or even whether everyone who got one will get sick. So far, 64 people in nine states - Tennessee, Virginia, Maryland, Florida, North Carolina, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota and Ohio - have contracted fungal meningitis, and five have died, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In an alarming indication that the outbreak. could get a lot bigger, Massachusetts health officials said the pharmacy. involved, the New England Compounding Center of Framingham, has. recalled three lots consisting of a total of 17,676 single-dose vials of. the steroid, preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate. No solicitors: Specialized pharmacy New England Compounding Center has hidden from the public as its steroids are linked to multiple deaths and critical infections. An unknown number of those vials reached 75 clinics and other facilities in 23 states between July and September, federal health officials said. Several hundred of the vials, maybe more, have been returned unused, one Massachusetts official said. However many other vials were used. At one clinic in Evansville, Indiana, more than 500 patients got shots from the suspect lots, officials said. At two clinics in Tennessee, more than 900 patients received them. The incubation period before symptoms appear is 28 days, and its almost certain more cases will be reported say health officials, who are now calling this a national health crisis. Tennessee: The initial outbreak site with a suspected 16 cases, two of whom are in critical condition. Three others have already died. North Carolina: The second state to report infection with one case found at an unidentified clinic. Florida: Only two cases have been reported but health officials fear more may come forward. Virginia: One person has died from fungal meningitis and three more cases are still being treated. Maryland: Seven medical clinics in Maryland pulled their stock of a questionable steroid after one person died and two more cases were reported. Indiana: At least five people in Indiana are sick with fungal meningitis, with no fatalities yet reported. Michigan: There are at least eight confirmed cases of meningitis in Michigan, including two deaths. Minnesota: Fungal meningitis has been diagnosed in two women hospitalized in Minnesota. Ohio: Health officials reported Saturday of a 65-year-old man being treated for the meningitis after receiving the steroid. Unlike the more common viral and bacterial meningitis, fungal meningitis is not contagious. It is an inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms include a severe headache, nausea, fever, and dizziness. The first patients identified in Tennessee experienced slurred speech, and difficulty walking and urinating. The pharmacy voluntarily recalled three lots of the steroid Methylprednisolone Acetate on September 26 according to the FDA. The drug is primarily used to relieve back pain. The drug was administered to patients in their late 40s to early 80s. Tennessee's S. Thomas Hospital, ground zero for the outbreak with a suspected 15 cases as of Wednesday with two in critical condition, reported having 2,000 vials of the steroid in stock before the threat was discovered. 'Some are doing well and improving. Some are very ill - very, very. seriously ill and may die,' Tennessee health official Dr. David Reagan. said. In Tennessee alone roughly 1,000 people were administered the steroid. The link between the injections and the. meningitis was discovered by Tennessee physician April Pettit, who found. the initial cases were all people who'd recently received an epidural. Officials are still investigating how the steroid resulted in fungal meningitis. New England Compounding Center. released a statement promising to work with heath authorities to. discover what happened. But company president and licensed pharmacist. Barry J. Cadden has otherwise dodged interview requests and the company. web site is down. An archived version of the site notes the company is licensed to distribute drugs in every U.S. state. Critical condition: Tennessee health official Dr. David Reagan says the infected are 'very, very seriously ill and may die' New England Compounding Center is among the approximately 3,000 U.S. compounding pharmacies specializing in blending, liquefying, or combining medicines customized for patients unable to swallow tablets, require specific dosages, or who have allergies. Such companies are regulated by the. state boards of pharmacy that license them rather than facing the. broader regulations traditional drug companies deal with. The pharmacy has produced questionable. products before. In 2006, New England Compounding Center was one of. four companies ordered by the the Food and Drug Administration to cease. producing a topical anesthetic cream that was found to cause 'grave. reactions including seizures and irregular heartbeats.' The cream was the cause of two deaths, neither tied directly to New England Compounding Center. Ground zero: The first patients of the fungal meningitis were reported at St. Thomas Hospital which had roughly 2,000 vials of a dangerous steroid on stock. That same year the company was also cited for multiple violations of federal laws and regulations based on a 2004 review of its offices. They were charged with misbranding drugs prescribed for eye treatment, misbranding an anesthetic drug and failing to provide adequate directions for its use, and promoting the use of a cancer drug for an unapproved purpose. An FDA warning letter admonished the company that it was 'distributing an unapproved drug in violation' of federal regulations. In 2010 the company was sued by an Illinois firm that alleged New England Compounding Center illegally hacked its database violating the federal computer computer fraud and abuse act. The case was eventually settled. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"This article talks about a serious outbreak of a rare fungal meningitis in the United States in 2012.

Subject: Both sentences have the same subject, BP. Similarity: 5/5 2. Action: Both sentences have the same action, which is selling. Similarity: 5/5 3. Object: Both sentences involve BP selling Gulf of Mexico assets. However, Sentence 1 specifies that BP is selling \\"some\\" assets, rather than all of them. Sentence 2 does not indicate if all or only some assets are being sold, but the absence of the word \\"some\\" can potentially imply the sale of all the assets. Nevertheless, both sentences revolve around the same objects: Gulf of Mexico assets. Similarity: 4/5 4. Context: Sentence 1 does not mention a buyer, while Sentence 2 specifies that the buyer is Plains. This difference indicates that the context is not identical between the two sentences. Similarity: 3/5 5. Value: Both sentences mention the same monetary value, 5.55 billion. Similarity: 5/5 To calculate the overall similarity, we can average the similarity scores from each criterion: (5 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 5) / 5 = 22/5 = 4.4 Based on the analysis, the similarity between the two sentences is 4.4 on a scale from 0 to 5.

Create a question such that its answer can not be found easily on a single web page (e.g., mentioned in a Wikipedia page). This can be accomplished if answering the question requires more than one fact (facts = statements that can be found on a Wikipedia page or Google). For example, answering the question 'did Aristotle use a laptop?', one needs the know about the invention of the laptop and the death of Aristotle. Avoid questions should not just compare the properties of objects (e.g., Is a door bigger than an elephant?) or those that refer to details in the given description.

However, we can analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, consider possible scenarios, and determine the likelihood of the hypothesis being true. When someone states that they have the highest regard for a particular judicial system, it indicates that they respect, admire, and potentially agree with the principles, organization, and functioning of that system. In this case, the individual expresses a positive opinion about another judicial system, suggesting that they believe it operates effectively and fairly. Now, let's consider the hypothesis \\"I would run a judicial system similar to how they do.\\" This statement assumes that the individual would attempt to replicate or adopt a similar approach to the judicial system they hold in high regard. To determine if this hypothesis holds, we need to consider a few factors: 1. Personal beliefs and values: If the individual's personal beliefs and values align with the principles and values of the judicial system they admire, it is more likely that they would attempt to implement a similar system if given the opportunity. However, if their beliefs and values conflict with the admired system, there may be a lower likelihood of replicating that system. 2. Context and constraints: A person's ability to create a judicial system similar to the one they admire depends on various contextual factors, such as the jurisdiction's legal framework, historical circumstances, and sociopolitical environment. For example, even if the individual wishes to implement a particular system, they may face legal, societal, or political obstacles that prevent them from doing so. 3. Implementation feasibility: Establishing or modifying a judicial system can be a complex and challenging endeavor. The individual might have the intention of running a judicial system similar to the one they admire but may face practical limitations, such as insufficient resources, lack of expertise, or resistance from stakeholders. These limitations might make it difficult or impossible to create an identical or similar system. Considering these factors, we cannot determine with certainty that the hypothesis \\"I would run a judicial system similar to how they do\\" is true based solely on the premise that the individual has the highest regard for their judicial system. While it is plausible and likely that the individual would want to run a similar system, external constraints, personal beliefs, and implementation challenges could impact the extent to which they can replicate the admired judicial system. Ultimately, further information about the individual's intentions, values, and the context in which they would establish this judicial system would be necessary to draw a definitive conclusion."},{"instruction":"Translate to Russian: Now let's suppose another thing--that you come here as an apostle of a better, honest life, in the nature of a, now, saviour of perishing souls.","output":"Теперь предположим еще одну вещь - что вы приходите сюда как апостол лучшей, честной жизни, по своей сути, как, скажем, спаситель гибнущих душ."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

The New York Stock Exchange said Friday it will be closed on Jan. 2 for the national day of mourning for the 38th president, a day after the Nasdaq stock market said it also will be closed. Over the last century, the markets have traditionally closed to commemorate the death of a past or sitting president. Ford, who became the first non-elected U.S. president in 1974, after the threat of impeachment forced the resignation of Richard Nixon, died this week on Tuesday at his home in Rancho Mirage, Calif., at age 93. Separately, the Federal Reserve will be closed Tuesday and has delayed the release of the minutes from its December meeting to Wednesday at 2 p.m. EST. The Fed's 12 regional banks will remain open Tuesday. With Monday's New Year's Day holiday and Tuesday's closing, the markets will be closed for an unusual four days. Aside from the stock exchanges, the commodities and futures markets said their main operations will be shut down for the day. The New York Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange all said their floor trading operations will be closed. The New York Merc metals and energy futures and options markets will close early on Friday. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, formerly the Bond Market Association, recommended an early close Tuesday. It was closed for an entire day for President Ronald Reagan's funeral. A spokesman could not give a reason for the partial closing. At his ranch in Crawford, Texas on Thursday, President Bush declared Tuesday a national day of mourning for Ford, closing most federal offices for the day. Ford's body will be flown to Washington on Saturday and his casket will lie in state at the Capitol. Bush is due to speak at a service in his memory Tuesday, a White House spokesman told Reuters. During his presidency, Ford sought to calm the turbulence caused by the Vietnam war and Watergate. In his effort to heal this strife, he notably granted Mr. Nixon a \\"full, free and absolute pardon\\" from prosecution early in his term of office. Later on, Ford served on the board of the NASD from 1999-2000, before the Nasdaq stock market was spun off from its former parent. Ford's \\"leadership and invaluable service during his time on the NASD board contributed to what the Nasdaq is today,\\" Nasdaq CEO Bob Greifeld said in a statement. The day of a president's funeral has traditionally been a national day of mourning. Most recently financial markets were closed Friday, June 11, 2004, after Reagan died. Throughout the 20th century, the NYSE traditionally has observed the death of former and sitting presidents by closing for an entire day. Former President William McKinley's funeral was the first to be so honored on Thursday, Sept. 19, 1901. Five presidents were honored with partial closings: Herbert Hoover (1964), William Howard Taft (1930), Woodrow Wilson (1924), Theodore Roosevelt (1919), and Grover Cleveland (1908).

A real direct distance measurement of an astronomical object is possible only for those objects that are \\"close enough\\" (within about a thousand parsecs) to Earth. The techniques for determining distances to more distant objects are all based on various measured correlations between methods that work at close distances and methods that work at larger distances. Several methods rely on a standard candle, which is an astronomical object that has a known luminosity. Answer this question: how do we measure the distance to other galaxies? Let's give stream of consciousness first:","output":"To measure the distance to other galaxies, astronomers employ a variety of techniques that make up the cosmic distance ladder. These methods are based on the correlation between close-distance measurement techniques and larger-distance methods, often relying on the use of standard candles with known luminosities. Here is a stream of consciousness about the methods used to determine the distance to other galaxies: - Parallax: This is the most direct method of measuring distances to objects within our galaxy, but it's limited to stars less than a thousand parsecs away. By observing the apparent movement of a star against the background of more distant stars as the Earth orbits around the Sun, astronomers can determine the star's distance using basic trigonometry. - Main sequence fitting: This involves comparing the brightness and color, or the position in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, of stars in nearby galaxies with the main sequence stars in our own galaxy. By estimating how much fainter they are, astronomers can calculate their distance using the inverse square law. - Cepheid variable stars: As a type of pulsating variable star, Cepheids have a well-established relationship between their pulsation periods and their luminosities. By observing the period of a Cepheid's brightness variation and comparing it to the known period-luminosity relationship, astronomers can estimate the true luminosity of the Cepheid which then helps to determine the distance to the galaxy where the Cepheid is located. - Type Ia supernovae: These are exploding white dwarf stars in binary systems that reach a certain mass threshold. They produce remarkably consistent peak luminosities, making them excellent standard candles. By comparing the observed brightness of a Type Ia supernova to its known luminosity, astronomers can calculate the distance to the supernova-hosting galaxy. - Tully-Fisher relation and the Faber-Jackson relation: The Tully-Fisher relation measures the rotational speed of a spiral galaxy against its luminosity, while the Faber-Jackson relation focuses on the velocity dispersion of stars in elliptical galaxies against their luminosity. Both of these relationships provide a way to estimate the galaxy's intrinsic luminosity, which can be used to find the distance to the galaxy. - Redshift: For more distant galaxies, their light gets stretched out or \\"redshifted\\" due to the expansion of the universe. By observing the redshifted spectral lines in a galaxy's light and comparing them to a local reference frame, astronomers can estimate the galaxy's distance using Hubble's law, which connects the velocity of a galaxy with its distance from us."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: \\"Hon?

Certain differences, depending on the oil, are also visible in the sheen of the paints. An artist might use several different oils in the same painting depending on specific pigments and effects desired.

Speaking on condition of anonymity, and appearing in a Fox News Channel interview with his face and voice disguised, the special operator contradicted claims by the Obama administration and a State Department review that said there wasn’t enough time for U.S. military forces to have intervened in the Sept. 11 attack in which U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens, an embassy employee and two former Navy SEALs working as private security contractors were killed. “I know for a fact that C-110, the EUCOM CIF, was doing a training exercise in … not in the region of North Africa, but in Europe,” the operator told Fox News' Adam Housley. “And they had the ability to act and to respond.” The C-110 is a 40-man Special Ops force capable of rapid response and deployment specifically trained for incidents like last year’s attack in Benghazi. During the night of the Sept. 11, 2012, attack in Libya, in which U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed in Libya, the C-110 were training in Croatia, just 3 ½ hours away. “We had the ability to load out, get on birds and fly there, at a minimum stage,” the operator told Fox News. “C-110 had the ability to be there, in my opinion, in a matter of about four hours…four to six hours.” Being so close, C-110s would have been able to respond had there been a second attack, the source added. “They would have been there at a minimum to provide a quick reaction force that can facilitate their exfil out of the, out of the problem situation. Nobody knew how it was going to develop. And you hear people and a whole bunch of advisers say, 'We wouldn’t have sent them because the security was a unknown situation.'” The source says the government could have at least sent the C-110s there as backup. “If it’s an unknown situation, at a minimum, you send forces there to facilitate the exfil, or, or, um medical injuries,” he said. “We could have sent a C-30 to Benghazi to provide medical evacuation for the injured.” The source says many people connected to the Benghazi bombing feel threatened and are afraid to talk. “The problem is, you got guys in my position, you got guys in special operations community who are still active and still involved,” the source said. “And they would be decapitated if they came forward with information that would affect high level commanders,” he said. Despite the concern, the source who spoke to Fox News says there’s a feeling of betrayal in the community that the government left people on the ground in Benghazi to fend for themselves. “You know, it’s something that’s risky, especially in our line of profession, to say anything about, anything in the realm of politics, or that deals with policy,” the source said. In December, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm.

A military special ops member, speaking anonymously and with concealed identity, claimed in a Fox News interview that the U.S. government could have responded to the 2012 Benghazi attack which caused the death of four men including the U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens. The informant alleges that the government betrayed those men. 2. The source refutes the Obama administration and a State Department review claims which stated there wasn’t adequate time for U.S. military forces to intervene in the Sept. 11 attack. 3. The informant revealed that C-110, the EUCOM CIF, a swift deployment and rapid-responder 40-man Special Ops force trained for such incidents, were in a training exercise in Europe during the time of the attack, just a few hours away in Croatia. 4. The source maintains that the C-110 team could have been there in approximately four to six hours, and at a minimum, could have been ready to provide a quick reaction force for the situation. 5. Despite the uncertainty of the security situation, the source argues that the government should have sent forces as backup to facilitate extraction or medical evacuation. 6. The source mentions an atmosphere of fear among those with connections to the Benghazi bombing, stating that active special operations community members would face severe consequences if they shared information implicating high-ranking commanders. 7. There is a sense of betrayal within the community as they perceive the government to have abandoned people on the ground in Benghazi. 8. Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm.

These builders need some important skills, like knowing how to put bricks together or how to paint walls. We call those skills \\"core competencies\\" because they are very important for building houses. The first sentence says that the team of builders should know and keep these important skills. If they give those skills to someone else, it can be risky, and they might not build the houses properly. Now, the hypothesis asks if these builders must eliminate or get rid of these important skills. But we just learned that they should keep those skills because they are very important. So, based on the first sentence (premise), the hypothesis is not correct. It's like saying the builders should forget how to build houses, which wouldn't make sense."},{"instruction":"Based on the sentence \\"A man wearing a hat and bracelet glares at the camera.\\", is the sentence \\"A woman performs a sassy dance for the camera.\\" a true sentence?","output":"It is not accurate to classify the sentence \\"A woman performs a sassy dance for the camera.\\" as a true sentence based solely on the information given in the sentence \\"A man wearing a hat and bracelet glares at the camera.\\" These two sentences are separate, describing different subjects and situations. It is important to understand that while both sentences describe actions or events involving a camera, they are not directly related to each other and do not make any factual statements regarding the other sentence. The first sentence talks about a man who is wearing a hat and bracelet and is glaring at the camera. This sentence provides information about the subject (a man), accessories he is wearing (hat and bracelet), and his action (glaring at the camera). On the other hand, the second sentence discusses a woman performing a sassy dance for the camera. This sentence focuses on a different subject (a woman) and a contrasting action (performing a sassy dance) in comparison to the first sentence. Therefore, based on the information given in the first sentence, we cannot determine the truth or falsity of the second sentence. Both sentences describe independent scenarios involving different subjects and situations that happen to involve a camera. Judging the truth of the second sentence would require additional information or context about the woman and her actions, which is not provided within the first sentence."},{"instruction":"Answer the question...who starred in the movie fiddler on the roof??","output":"To find the answer to this question, I will follow these steps: 1.

However, taking into account that the user provided a rating higher than the maximum rating on the given scale, it can be inferred that the user's experience was highly positive and exceeds expectations. In such instances, it is common to assume that the user's rating intends to express the highest level of satisfaction possible. Thus, the review can be rated a 5, the most favorable rating on the given scale. However, it is essential to consider the overall quality of the review. The review \\"10 star\\" is indeed a rating but lacks qualitative information about the experience to help others understand why the user highly recommends the product or service. A more detailed review would be more helpful to other users who are considering their options.

It helps a preschooler : Develop social skills As children play pretend, they explore relationships between family members, friends and coworkers and learn more about how people interact. Playing doctor, they imagine how physicians care for their patients. Playing house, they learn more about how parents feel about their children. Imaginative play helps develop empathy for others. If children can imagine how it feels to be left out of a game or to lose a pet, they are better able to help those in need. They become more willing to play fair, to share, and to cooperate. Build selfconfidence Young children have very little control over their lives. Imagining oneself as a builder of skyscrapers or a superhero defending the planet is empowering to a child. It helps them develop confidence in their abilities and their potential. Boost intellectual growth Using the imagination is the beginning of abstract thought.Children who can see a king's castle in a mound of sand or a delicious dinner in a mud pie are learning to think symbolically . This skill is important in school where a child will have to learn that numerals symbolize groups of objects, letters symbolize sounds, and so on. Practice language skills Kids who play pretend with their friends do a lot of talking.This helps _ their vocabulary, improve sentence structure and promote communication skills. Work out fears Playing pretend can help children work out their fears and worries. When children roleplay about the big, bad monster under the bed, they gain a sense of control over him and he doesn't seem quite so big or so bad. Imaginative play also helps kids vent confusing feelings they might have, such as anger toward a parent or compete with a new sibling .

The answer is:","output":"Louis David Brandeis, born on November 13, 1856, in Louisville, Kentucky, was a prominent jurist, advocate, and Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. He is best remembered for his deep commitment to social justice, progressive legal theory, and his strong defense of individual rights and liberties. Raised in a Jewish household, Brandeis inherited a sense of strong cultural and religious commitment from his parents. His family moved to the United States from Europe in search of a better life, instilling in him a great sense of gratitude and motivation to succeed. Brandeis eventually pursued his education at the prestigious Harvard Law School, where he excelled academically and graduated at the top of his class. Throughout his career as a lawyer, Brandeis passionately advocated for social and economic reform, often taking on cases in the public interest. His legal writings and arguments in such cases helped to shape the progressive movement of the early 20th century. In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson nominated Brandeis to the United States Supreme Court, marking the first time a Jewish person had been appointed to the highest court in the land. Despite facing considerable anti-Semitic obstacles, Brandeis was eventually confirmed and took the bench as an Associate Justice on June 1, 1916. Once on the Supreme Court, Brandeis continued to advance his progressive ideas and firmly supported individual rights, especially in cases involving free speech and privacy. His time as an Associate Justice saw landmark decisions in which he consistently championed the rights of the underprivileged and advocated for the protection of personal liberties. Brandeis married Alice Goldmark in 1891, and they shared a long, happy life together. The couple was recognized for their philanthropic work and unwavering support for social causes. After serving on the Supreme Court for over two decades, Brandeis retired on February 13, 1939. He was succeeded in his position by William O. Douglas, another prominent progressive jurist. Brandeis continued to be an influential voice in American legal circles and social advocacy until his death on October 5, 1941, in Washington, D.C. In sum, Louis Brandeis remains a seminal figure in U.S. legal history and an iconic embodiment of the progressive movement. His dedication to social justice, individual rights, and steadfast defense of personal liberties have left an indelible mark on the Supreme Court jurisprudence and American legal thought."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Manhattan Island is surrounded on the east by the East and Harlem Rivers and on the west by the North and Hudson Rivers.It links with the other four towns which make up New York City and with New Jersey are by means of subways,underground tunnels and bridges which lead into Manhanttan from the surrounding area. The Brooklyn Bridge was the first suspension bridge to link Brooklyn to Manhanttan.It is also the second oldest bridge in New York.The architect was John Augustus Roebling,who was the chief engineer of the suspended Railroad Bridge at Niagara Falls. Misfortune accompanied the building of the bridge,which took place from 1869 to 1883.The architect died as a result of an accident early during the construction.His son,Washington Roebling,carried on his father's work,using the most advanced engineering techniques of the day.He also fell ill during the construction of the bridge and was obliged to direct the work on it from an apartment window overlooking the site.

Question 2: Why has the Tata Sons Board voted to remove Cyrus Mistry as chairman? OPT: (i) no (ii) yes Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Yes, the answer to both questions would essentially be the same, as they both pertain to the reasons behind the removal of Cyrus Mistry as the chairman of Tata Sons. However, it is important to note that Ratan Tata, as an individual, didn't single-handedly remove Cyrus Mistry. It was a collective decision by the Tata Sons Board, of which Ratan Tata is a prominent member. Cyrus Mistry's removal as the chairman of Tata Sons in October 2016 was a result of multiple factors, which can be broadly categorized into two areas: performance issues and differences in management style. 1. Performance issues: During Cyrus Mistry's tenure as chairman, the group's overall financial performance was considered to be underwhelming. Some of the key concerns were: a. Poor profitability: During Mistry's four-year tenure, the group's profit margin and market capitalization took a hit. Some of the group's businesses, such as Tata Motors, Tata Steel Europe, and Tata Teleservices, faced significant financial difficulties. b. Lack of strategic growth: There was concern regarding Mistry's ability to drive growth through strategic acquisitions and expansion plans. The critics pointed at Tata Motors' unsuccessful acquisition of Jaguar Land Rover and the stalled divestiture of Tata Steel Europe as examples. c. Rising debt: Under Mistry's leadership, the group's consolidated debt increased, raising concerns about its financial stability. 2. Differences in management style: Cyrus Mistry's management approach was considered to be incompatible with the group's values and ethos. Some of the reasons cited were: a. Focus on select businesses: Mistry's strategy was to consolidate the conglomerate and focus more on a few key business segments. This led to tensions with the board, as it was seen as diverging from the group's core value – the commitment to a diversified business portfolio. b. Governance issues: Mistry was often critical of Ratan Tata's decision-making and business strategies, while accusing the Tata Trusts, the largest shareholder in Tata Sons, of interference in the functioning of the operating companies. This tension created friction between the Tata Trusts and the management. c. Lack of interpersonal skills: Cyrus Mistry was criticized for his communication and public relations skills, which some considered detrimental to the overall functioning of the group. These cumulative factors led to the loss of confidence in Cyrus Mistry, resulting in the Tata Sons Board's decision to remove him as chairman. Ratan Tata played a significant role in the process, partially due to his position as the Chairman Emeritus of Tata Sons and his strong involvement with the Tata Trusts. However, it is important to emphasize that the decision was ultimately taken by the Tata Sons Board, not Ratan Tata alone."},{"instruction":"Bruce, Just a reminder, this Wednesday (Dec 13) is the Associate PRC meeting in which Sally will be representing Cheryl Ingstad.

It is a non-profit and the story has been corrected. The White House on Tuesday formally requested 3.7 billion in emergency funding from Congress to deal with an influx of Central American minors along the southern border. But the proposal was quickly met with broad skepticism among Republican lawmakers, who were doubtful that the package would be approved quickly — if at all. Administration officials said the request is part of a comprehensive strategy aimed at building more detention centers, adding immigration judges, and beefing up border patrols and air surveillance. President Obama has said he hopes such steps will speed deportations and discourage adults from sending children on a dangerous, sometimes deadly, trip north. But GOP leaders, who have called on Obama to take stronger action, said they were reluctant to give the administration a “blank check” without ­more-detailed plans to ensure that the money would help stem the crisis at the border. The president “is asking to use billions of taxpayer dollars without accountability or a plan in place to actually stop the border crisis,” Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said in a statement. Asked if he thought lawmakers would approve the proposal, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said, “No, given the mood here in Washington, I don’t have confidence it will happen.” View Graphic White House requests 3.7 billion The uncertainty on Capitol Hill casts doubt on whether the administration can mount a successful response to a surge of tens of thousands of children who have overwhelmed Border Patrol stations in recent months. More than 52,000 unaccompanied minors and 39,000 women with children have been apprehended on the southern border this year, far more than in past years. Most have come from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras; those countries would receive money under Obama’s proposal to help repatriate their citizens after they are returned home. The request comes just days after Obama announced that he was giving up on a year-long effort to persuade House Republicans to support a comprehensive immigration bill. The president said he would take executive actions to reform border-control laws on his own — a declaration that angered the GOP. The toxic environment on the Hill, combined with the looming midterm elections this fall, has contributed to the sense among Democrats and Republicans that a deal on emergency funding is unlikely, even though both sides say they agree with the White House that the crisis is urgent. “What we would like Congress to do is to act promptly, maybe even expeditiously, to consider this proposal and hopefully move on it in bipartisan fashion,” said White House press secretary Josh Earnest. A spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said the House Appropriations Committee and a separate working group of seven Republicans focused on border issues would review the administration’s proposal. “The speaker still supports deploying the National Guard to provide humanitarian support in the affected areas — which this proposal does not address,” spokesman Michael Steel said in a statement. Immigration advocates are urging President Obama to come up with another solution besides sending young children back to their home countries. The demonstration comes as an influx of Central American children are illegally crossing into the United States. (Theresa Poulson/The Washington Post) The rift between the parties hinges on a fundamental disagreement over how the crisis should be handled. Republicans argue that Obama must stop the flow of illegal immigrants to the border and ensure that the entire border is secure before focusing on the tens of thousands who are already in detention facilities there. Citing that logic, Heritage Action, a conservative non-profit that closely monitors how Republican lawmakers vote, decried the Obama funding proposal as a “non-starter.” Heritage Action’s chief executive, Michael A. Needham, said in a statement that the proposal “seeks to address the symptoms, not the cause. The president should rescind his anti-enforcement policies and demonstrate a commitment to implementing existing law.” Democrats, meanwhile, say the first step must be new facilities and legal services to work through a debilitating backlog of minors and families already apprehended at the border. “The process I don’t think is the problem,” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). “I think it is a real crisis. Lives are going to be lost and mistakes are going to be made, so I think this supplemental is really all-important.” Under the White House proposal, most of the emergency funds would be split between the Department of Health and Human Services — which would receive 1.8 billion to provide shelter and care to the immigrants — and the Justice and Homeland Security departments, which would get a combined 1.6 billion to handle enforcement. The State Department would receive 300 million to help the Central American countries repatriate their citizens and create advertising campaigns about the dangers of placing children in the hands of smuggling cartels. The White House request also includes money to help the federal government fight wildfires. “I commend the administration for doing what it can to quickly address this surge of children and families attempting to enter our country, and I urge my colleagues in Congress to support it,” Sen. Thomas R. Carper (D-Del.), chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said in a statement. Republicans criticized the administration for not including measures to amend a 2008 anti-human-trafficking law that provides greater legal protections for minors entering the United States from non-border countries. The Obama administration had signaled last week that it would pursue such changes in order to deport Central American minors more quickly. “I just think the average American will say that if you don’t deport these children, others are going to keep coming,” Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said. “The 2008 law was not designed to address this situation. . . . I think you take the 2008 law and you come up with a law that will address this situation.” Earnest said Tuesday that the administration will work with lawmakers on proposals to amend that law. But Democrats and immigrant rights advocates have sharply condemned proposed changes, fearing that migrants will be returned to dangerous situations in their home nations. Obama left Washington on Tuesday evening for a trip to Denver, Dallas and Austin, where he will attend several Democratic fundraisers and talk about the economy. Administration aides said that he will not visit the border while in Texas but that he will meet with local leaders, including Gov. Rick Perry (R), to discuss the crisis. “If it’s serious enough for him to send a 3.7 billion funding request to us, I would think it would be serious enough for him to take an hour of his time on Air Force One to go down and see for himself what the conditions are,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) told reporters Tuesday. “I think it would be instructive for him.” Ed O’Keefe and Katie Zezima contributed to this report. ||||| The Obama administration on Tuesday asked Congress for 3.7 billion in emergency funding to address the wave of child immigrants crossing the southwest border. The figure is much bigger than the 2 billion that administration officials initially floated, and the total 4.3 billion package also includes a request for 615 million for the Department of Agriculture to fight wildfires in the West. THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE July 8, 2014 FACT SHEET: Emergency Supplemental Request to Address the Increase in Child and Adult Migration from Central America in the Rio Grande Valley Areas of the Southwest Border While overall rates of apprehensions across our Southwest border remain at near historic lows, apprehensions and processing of children and individuals from Central America crossing the border in the Rio Grande Valley have continued at high rates. The Administration continues to address this urgent humanitarian situation with a whole-of government response which includes efforts by the Departments of Homeland Security (DHS) and Justice (DOJ) to deploy additional enforcement resources -- including immigration judges, Immigration and Customs Enforcement attorneys, and asylum officers -- to focus on individuals and adults traveling with children from Central America and entering without authorization across the Southwest border. Part of this surge includes detention of adults traveling with children, as well as expanded use of the Alternatives to Detention program, to avoid a more significant humanitarian situation. DHS is working to secure additional space that satisfies applicable legal and humanitarian standards for detention of adults with children. This surge of resources means that cases are processed fairly and as quickly as possible, ensuring the protection of asylum seekers and refugees while enabling the prompt removal of individuals who do not qualify for asylum or other forms of relief from removal. Finally, to attack the criminal organizations and smuggling rings that are exploiting these individuals, agencies are surging law enforcement task forces in cooperation with our international partners, with a focus on stepped-up interdiction and prosecution. Under the President’s direction, the Administration also continues to work closely with our Mexican and Central American partners to address the root causes of this problem, stem the flow of adults and unaccompanied children into the United States, and expand capacity to receive and reintegrate repatriated migrants. Following the Vice President’s June 20 meeting with leaders from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico, to discuss our shared responsibility for promoting security, these countries committed to working together and with the United States to address the immediate humanitarian situation as well as the long-term challenges. Secretary Kerry met with leaders from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras on July 1st in Panama, and in his remarks highlighted some of the challenges driving migration, the importance of applying the law and combating misinformation, and working together with Central American partners to address these challenges. We are working with our Central American partners, nongovernmental organizations, and other influential voices to send a clear message to potential migrants so that they understand the significant dangers of this journey and to make clear that they are not eligible for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals process or earned citizenship provisions that are part of comprehensive immigration reform pending in the Congress. As part of this effort, we have also committed foreign assistance resources to improve capacity of these countries to receive and reintegrate returned individuals and address the underlying security and economic issues that cause migration. While the Administration is working across all of these channels, we are eager to work with the Congress to ensure that sufficient resources and authorities exist to continue our efforts. That is why today the President is requesting a 3.7 billion supplemental appropriation focused on: · Deterrence, including increased detainment and removal of adults with children and increased immigration court capacity to speed cases · Enforcement, including enhanced interdiction and prosecution of criminal networks, increased surveillance, and expanded collaborative law enforcement task force efforts · Foreign Cooperation, including improved repatriation and reintegration, stepped-up public information campaigns, and efforts to address the root causes of migration · Capacity, including increased detainment, care, and transportation of unaccompanied children The supplemental appropriation broken down below would fund activities at the Departments of, Homeland Security (DHS), Justice (DOJ), State and other International Programs, and Health and Human Services (HHS). The Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement - 1.1 billion This proposal would provide the Department of Homeland Security a total of 1.1 billion for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Of this total: · 116 million would pay for transportation costs associated with the significant rise in apprehensions of unaccompanied children; · 109 million would provide for immigration and customs enforcement efforts, including expanding the Border Enforcement Security Task Force program, doubling the size of vetted units in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, and expanding investigatory activities by ICE Homeland Security Investigations; and · 879 million would pay for detention and removal of apprehended undocumented adults traveling with children, expansion of alternatives to detention programs for these individuals, and additional prosecution capacity for adults with children who cross the border unlawfully. The Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection - 433 million This proposal would provide the Department of Homeland Security a total of 433 million for Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Of this total: · 364 million would pay for operational costs of responding to the significant rise in apprehensions of unaccompanied children and families, including overtime and temporary duty costs for Border Patrol agents, contract services and facility costs to care for children while in CBP custody, and medical and transportation service arrangements; · 29 million for CBP to expand its role in Border Enforcement Security Task Force programs, increasing information-sharing and collaboration among the participating law enforcement agencies combatting transnational crime; and · 39.4 million to increase air surveillance capabilities that would support 16,526 additional flight hours for border surveillance and 16 additional crews for unmanned aerial systems to improve detection and interdiction of illegal activity. The Department of Justice - 64 million This proposal would provide the Department of Justice a total of 64 million. Of the total: · 45.4 million would be to hire approximately 40 additional immigration judge teams, including those anticipated to be hired on a temporary basis. This funding would also expand courtroom capacity including additional video conferencing and other equipment in support of the additional immigration judge teams. These additional resources, when combined with the FY 2015 Budget request for 35 additional teams, would provide sufficient capacity to process an additional 55,000 to 75,000 cases annually. · 2.5 million would be used to expand the legal orientation program that provides assistance to adults and custodians of children in the immigration court system. · 15 million to provide direct legal representation services to children in immigration proceedings. · 1.1 million to hire additional immigration litigation attorneys to support Federal agencies involved in detainee admission, regulation, and removal actions. Department of State and Other International Programs - 300 million This proposal would provide 300 million to the Department of State. Of the total: · 295 million would support efforts to repatriate and reintegrate migrants to Central America, to help the governments in the region better control their borders, and to address the underlying root causes driving migration, i.e. creating the economic, social, governance, and citizen security conditions to address factors that are contributing to significant increases in migration to the United States. Beyond initial assistance, continued funding for repatriation and reintegration activities will be contingent on sustained progress and cooperation by the Central American countries. · 5 million would support State Department media campaigns in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, targeting potential migrants and their families. The campaigns will emphasize the dangers of the journey, deliver the message that unaccompanied children are not given a permit to stay in the U.S., and highlight a shared community responsibility for the welfare of unaccompanied children. Funds would also support youth programs to develop skills and leadership among potential migrants. The Department of Health and Human Services - 1.8 billion This proposal would provide an additional 1.8 billion for HHS to provide the appropriate care for unaccompanied children, consistent with Federal law, while maintaining services for refugees. With these funds, HHS will have the resources to be able to care for the children currently projected to come into the custody of the Department of Homeland Security while putting in place more stable, cost-effective arrangements for these children going forward. The proposal would also support the ongoing HHS medical response activities for unaccompanied children to address the surge at Border Patrol facilities. Without supplemental funding, absent undertaking extraordinary measures, agencies will not have sufficient resources to adequately address this situation. HHS will be unable to address the influx of children by securing sufficient shelter capacity with the number of children held at Border Patrol stations continuing to increase, for longer periods of time. Going forward, HHS will be unable to set-up more stable, cost-effective arrangements for these children, Border Patrol agents will have to be re-assigned to child care duties from their border security work, and ICE will lack the resources needed to sufficiently expand detention and removal capacity for adults with children who cross the border illegally. In addition, without additional funds, DOJ will be unable to keep pace with its growing caseload, leading to longer wait times for those cases already on the docket. And absent dedicated resources in Central American countries, we will not make progress on the larger drivers of this humanitarian crisis. For these reasons, supplemental resources are urgently needed to continue forward with the aggressive response that the Administration has deployed to date. # Read more from The Hill: Obama wants 3.7B for border Read letter from the president ||||| The administration on Tuesday asked Congress for 3.7 billion in emergency funding to address the wave of child immigrants crossing the Southwest border. The figure is much more than the 2 billion that was initially reported. The overall package totals 4.3 billion, and also includes a request for 615 million for the Department of Agriculture to fight wildfires in the West. [READ WHITE HOUSE FACT SHEET.] Administration officials had said the request would be more than 2 billion, but had not suggested it would be nearly double that amount. The White House cast the request as part of an aggressive response to the border crisis, which has become a political problem for the administration months before the midterm elections. [READ PRESIDENT'S LETTER TO SPEAKER.] ADVERTISEMENT “If you look at the details, what you see is an embodiment of the incredibly serious commitment that the president has to addressing the situation,” one White House official said on Tuesday. The request includes 1.8 billion for the Health and Human Services Department to provide “appropriate care” for the children, who are mostly coming from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. It also includes 1.1 billion for the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The funding would help expand border security task forces and help pay for transportation costs associated with the rise in unaccompanied children. The package could be controversial with Republicans, who have argued the administration’s policies are encouraging an unprecedented wave of child immigrants. They have pointed to President Obama’s decision not to deport certain children who were brought to the U.S. as illegal immigrants. Republicans have also pressed Obama to send the National Guard to the border. Michael Steel, a spokesman for Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said Tuesday that the Appropriations Committee and other members — including the working group on the border crisis led by Rep. Kay Granger (R-Texas) — will review the administration's proposal. \\"The Speaker still supports deploying the National Guard to provide humanitarian support in the affected areas, which this proposal does not address,\\" Steel said. At the White House briefing on Tuesday, press secretary Josh Earnest disputed Boehner's concern about border agents, saying that immigrants who are entering the country without authorization \\"aren't seeking to evade detection\\" by law enforcement officials. \\"Rather, these individuals are seeking out these Border Patrol agents with the expectation they'll be detained and in the hope that they'll be allowed to remain in the country,\\" he said. Earnest said he hopes Congress will act \\"promptly and even expeditiously\\" on the supplemental. \\"With emergency requests like this traditional Congress has not sought to bog it down with a search for offsets,\\" Earnest said. The administration has acknowledged that many of the people entering the country believe they will be allowed to stay, and has said it is working to counter those misperceptions. The White House took its toughest line yet Monday, with Obama spokesman Josh Earnest saying most of the children would not be allowed to stay in the United States. Administration officials have said that many of the new immigrants are entering the United States to escape violence in their home countries. U.S. officials have been ill-equipped to handle the wave of new immigrants, who have crowded into detention centers. Immigrants have been bussed to other centers in California, where there have been some high-profile protests. Some of the funding request would be used to speed up immigration trials so that people could be deported more quickly. Many of the new immigrants are released to the care of relatives while they await court hearings. The request also includes 433 million to go toward additional resources for border agents, including overtime and \\"temporary duty costs\\" for border agents as well as an increase in air surveillance capabilities. The Department of Justice would receive 64 million to hire approximately 40 additional immigration judge teams, White House officials say. The administration is seeking Congressional discretion on at least one element of the plan: \\"We are seeking a greater authority for the secretary of Homeland Security to exercise greater discretion that would allow him to more efficiently and effectively remove and repatriate immigrants to this country that don't have a legal basis for remaining here,\\" Earnest said. The White House says more than 52,000 unaccompanied children have attempted to cross the border since October. The president will travel to Texas on Thursday but administration officials say he will not visit the border while he is there. Instead, he plans to address the issue in a meeting with local leaders. The White House has invited Texas Gov. Rick Perry to also take part in the meeting. Speaking about this crisis on Tuesday, White House officials say Obama believes the wave of immigrants is an “urgent humanitarian situation.” The officials said the administration is focused on making sure the children have proper care “but plan to enforce the law.” Administration officials say they are hopeful Congress will approve the president's request. “Our hope and expectation ... is that this will be treated as the urgent humanitarian situation that it is,” one White House official said. —This story was posted at 11:36 a.m. and updated at 1:44 p.m. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"The White House has requested 3.7 billion in emergency funding from Congress to deal with an influx of Central American minors along the southern border.

Samuel Johnson was so irritated at hearing it continually praised, that he made a parody of it, where the devil appears to a young Whig and predicts that in short time, Whiggism will poison even the paradise of America! A:","output":"The evidence showing that the angel prophesied during Bathurst's lifetime comes directly from the context provided. Burke, in his speech, describes a scenario from the year 1704 where an angel prophesies to Lord Bathurst. In this prophesy, the angel tells Bathurst about the future greatness of England and America. Specifically, the angel predicts that America, then seen as little more than a source of stories about savage men and uncouth manners, would rise in importance and power. The angel's prophecy distinctly states that this change will happen \\"before you taste of death,\\" implying that this shift will occur within Bathurst's own lifetime. This assertion is presented as a part of a larger political dialogue by Burke, wherein he connects the angel's prophesy to the contemporary political realities and possibilities for England and America.

They were requesting he be restrained with leather ones. I had not done any restraining and was asked to assist a woman counselor to show me the ropes (no pun intended). When we arrived in the patients room, I was shocked to see a man in his early 20’s flailing around spasmodically on the bed with his gums bleeding in between his teeth. The nurse informed us that the patient was dying of a liver disease and his body and brain had become toxic, causing delirium. The counselor instructed me to hold down his arms and she placed him in leather restraints which were fastened to the side of the bed. The most upsetting thing which to this day I can not remove from memory was this man literally snapping his jaws at me like a mad animal with traumatized bloody gums from biting so hard on the cloth restraints. There was nothing I, or anyone could do, except keep him restrained from hurting himself or others. It is the kind of witness to suffering I had never experienced before, and I felt almost relieved when the nurse quietly said, “ He will die before morning. “ I suppose what is so traumatic about witnessing such situations is the utter sense of helplessness. I was a trained therapist, and in this situation, I was unable to do anything, and was rendered powerless.

Chris Christie (Mel Evans, AP) Chris Christie says the government must seek “balance” between concerns for public health and decisions made by parents when it comes to vaccinations for children. Hours after his initial comments, Christie’s office sent out a statement clarifying the potential presidential candidate’s remarks. “The governor believes vaccines are an important public health protection and with a disease like measles there is no question kids should be vaccinated,” the statement said. A day after President Obama urged parents to vaccinate their children against measles, the New Jersey governor added his voice to the debate on immunizations during a trip to England. The Republican governor told reporters traveling with him that he and his wife, Mary Pat, had their four children vaccinated. His remarks came after a tour of a biomedical research center. “That’s the best expression I can give you of my opinion,” Christie said, according to a transcript of remarks provided by his office. “It’s much more important … what you think as a parent than what you think as a public official. And that’s what we do. But I also understand that parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well, so that’s the balance that the government has to decide.” In a pre-Super Bowl interview with NBC’s Savannah Guthrie, Obama heralded the success of vaccinations in preventing diseases and noted that measles is “preventable.” “The science is, you know, pretty indisputable,” Obama said in comments that aired Monday. “We’ve looked at this again and again. There is every reason to get vaccinated, but there aren’t reasons to not.” A measles outbreak originating at Disney theme parks has sickened more than 100 people in the United States. These measles cases have occurred in at least six states and Mexico, and have been connected to Disneyland in California. Christie said the “balance” is necessary because of different diseases and vaccines, and he stressed that his comments are not meant to suggest that vaccinations are optional. “What I’m saying is that you have to have that balance in considering parental concerns because no parent cares about anything more than they care about protecting their own child’s health and so we have to have that conversation, but that has to move and shift in my view from disease type,” he said. “Not every vaccine is created equal and not every disease type is as great a public health threat as others. So that’s what I mean by that so that I’m not misunderstood.” Democrats seized on Christie’s remarks, and suggested he is trying to court the votes of people who are against vaccinations for children. “If he wants to actually be a leader, then he should stop bowing to junk science and take a cue from President Obama by showing leadership that promotes facts and keeps our children and our nation safe,” said Mo Elleithee, communications director for the Democratic National Committee.","output":"A man named Chris Christie, who is an important person in New Jersey, talked about vaccines. Vaccines are special medicines that help protect us from getting sick. He said that the government should find a balance between making sure everyone is safe and healthy, and letting parents make choices for their kids. Later, he made it clear that he thinks vaccines are very important in keeping everyone healthy, especially for dangerous sicknesses like measles. Measles is a sickness that can spread easily and make a lot of people sick and it started spreading again in a place called Disneyland. Some people disagreed with what Chris Christie said and they think everyone should always listen to what doctors say about vaccines."},{"instruction":"Definition: You will be given a trivia clue, and the category it belongs to.

Possible answers: wanted to rob the guests, wanted to ensure the party went smoothly, wanted to steal the coats Answer:","output":"From the given context, it appears that Bailey offered to gather the guests' coats and put them in the coat room primarily to ensure the party went smoothly. However, it is important to consider the various factors at play to better understand Bailey's motives. Firstly, Bailey's actions demonstrate a sense of hospitality and responsibility by taking care of the coats belonging to the party guests. By offering to gather coats, Bailey is making sure that the party attendees can focus their full attention on enjoying themselves without having to worry about the cumbersome task of finding a place to store their outerwear. This act can create a welcoming and friendly atmosphere that contributes to the smooth running of the party. Moreover, Bailey's initiative to keep the coats in the coat room demonstrates organizational skills and an understanding that a clutter-free environment can significantly improve the overall ambiance of the party. By collecting the coats and neatly storing them away in a designated area, Bailey is fostering an environment where guests can easily navigate and feel comfortable in. A well-maintained coat room can also save guests from the headache of searching for their belongings towards the end of the event. Although it is possible that Bailey could have malicious intentions, such as robbing the guests or stealing the coats, these scenarios seem less plausible given the context. It is important to assume the best in people and focus on the potential positive outcomes of their actions. Of course, it would be wise for the party host to keep an eye on the coat room, just as a precautionary measure. In summary, Bailey most likely offered to gather the guests' coats and put them in the coat room to ensure the party went smoothly. This act showcases a desire to create a welcoming and organized environment for the event attendees. While it is possible that Bailey had ulterior motives, it is more appropriate and fair to believe in the goodwill of others until proven otherwise."},{"instruction":"How do you say \\"Carpool with six other people or more 0\\" in Spanish?","output":"To translate \\"Carpool with six other people or more 0\\" to Spanish, I will: 1.

I will list a few and then determine which one makes the most sense. 1. Maintain proper tire pressure: Ensuring that your tires are inflated to the recommended pressure can improve gas mileage by reducing friction between tires and road. 2. Get regular engine tune-ups: Regular maintenance of your vehicle's engine and systems like oil change and filter replacements will keep it running efficiently and improve gas mileage. 3. Drive at a moderate speed: Faster speeds require more fuel to maintain, so driving at a moderate speed will help save gas. 4. Use air conditioning wisely: Air conditioning consumes more fuel, so using it judiciously or rolling down the windows when possible can help save gas. 5. Reduce excess weight: Unnecessary weight in your vehicle can decrease fuel efficiency, so removing excess items can improve gas mileage. 6. Plan trips efficiently: Combining errands into a single trip and navigating the shortest routes can help reduce the amount of fuel consumed. Considering these options, the most sensible way to improve gas mileage would be a combination of steps, with the focus on regular maintenance (engine tune-ups, oil changes, and filter replacements), maintaining proper tire pressure, driving at moderate speeds, and reducing excess weight in the vehicle. While the other steps can also contribute to fuel efficiency, these stand out as the most impactful in general."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Taungle - Taungle is a village in Banmauk Township Katha District in the Sagaing Region of northern-central Burma.

Aaron had more friends than Christopher had because","output":"Aaron had an innate ability to connect with people that Christopher lacked. This made it easier for Aaron to cultivate and maintain friendships. Over the years, Aaron developed a large friend circle, while Christopher had comparatively fewer friends. One of the primary reasons for this disparity was that Aaron was great at empathetic listening. Whenever someone expressed their thoughts and feelings to him, he genuinely listened and understood their perspective. This warm, empathetic demeanor drew people to Aaron and helped solidify strong bonds of friendship. Aaron also had an infectious sense of humor that never failed to brighten up any room he entered. People gravitated towards his exuberance and enjoyed being around him. Christopher, on the other hand, was a bit more reserved in nature. While he had a pleasant demeanor, it was harder for him to initiate conversations and playfully engage with others. This made it challenging for Christopher to connect with new people, as they may have perceived him as somewhat serious and difficult to approach. Another factor that contributed to the difference in the number of friends Aaron and Christopher had was their interests and hobbies. Aaron was passionate about a wide range of activities, from sports to the arts. This allowed him to bond with people from various walks of life and create a diverse friend group. Christopher, on the other hand, had a narrower range of interests, which limited the number of people he could naturally connect with and form friendships. Additionally, Aaron had a strong belief in the value of networking and staying in touch with friends and acquaintances. He made it a point to reach out to people frequently and maintain connections, even if only through casual messaging or occasional meet-ups. This helped ensure that he was constantly nurturing his relationships, allowing them to grow and flourish. Christopher, on the other hand, wasn't as focused on maintaining contact, which sometimes led to friendships fizzling out or dwindling over time. Moreover, Aaron often hosted social events and gatherings, inviting friends and their acquaintances to his home. These events allowed Aaron to meet many new people, providing ample opportunities for forming new friendships. Unlike Aaron, Christopher preferred smaller, more intimate gatherings, which ultimately limited his exposure to new social circles. Lastly, Aaron's openness and willingness to help others endeared him to many people. He was the kind of person who would go out of his way to offer assistance, even if it was for someone he didn't know very well. This trait made others feel comfortable around Aaron and encouraged them to consider him a close friend. Christopher, while caring and kind, was often preoccupied with his own worries, making it more difficult for him to extend himself to others in a similar fashion. In summary, Aaron had more friends than Christopher because of his genuine empathy and ability to connect with others, his engaging personality and sense of humor, diverse interests, dedication to maintaining relationships, proactive approach to socializing, and his thoughtfulness towards others. Christopher's somewhat reserved nature, narrower range of interests, and focus on his own concerns made it more challenging for him to develop and maintain the same number of friendships as Aaron."},{"instruction":"Surviving being shot and stabbed at the end of the previous film , the stepfather has been institutionalized in Puget Sound , Washington since , spending his time building model houses in the workshop .

Ecologically, the agricultural productivity of the Sumerian lands was being compromised as a result of rising salinity. Soil salinity in this region had been long recognized as a major problem. Poorly drained irrigated soils, in an arid climate with high levels of evaporation, led to the buildup of dissolved salts in the soil, eventually reducing agricultural yields severely. During the Akkadian and Ur III phases, there was a shift from the cultivation of wheat to the more salt-tolerant barley, but this was insufficient, and during the period from 2100 BC to 1700 BC, it is estimated that the population in this area declined by nearly three fifths. This greatly upset the balance of power within the region, weakening the areas where Sumerian was spoken, and comparatively strengthening those where Akkadian was the major language. Henceforth Sumerian would remain only a literary and liturgical language, similar to the position occupied by Latin in medieval Europe.

The Broncos got on the scoreboard quick with Jake Plummer throwing a 16-yard touchdown strike to WR Rod Smith on their first drive of the game. On the ensuing kickoff, the Steelers fumbled the ball, with the Broncos recovering deep into Steelers' territory. Plummer then threw a 10-yard pass to WR Javon Walker to make the score 14-0. On the next drive, the Steelers got to the Denver 41-yard line when QB Ben Roethlisberger completed a 35-yard pass to WR Cedrick Wilson, who then fumbled the ball and the Broncos recovered. In the second quarter, the Steelers dominated play outscoring the Broncos 10-0 on the quarter. Roethlisberger threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to RB Willie Parker for his first touchdown pass of the game. The Steelers were about to score on their next possession when Roethlisberger threw an interception near the end zone to CB Champ Bailey. After the Broncos showed no offense in the quarter, and the Steelers missed a 40-yard field goal, the quarter ended with the Steelers' Jeff Reed kicking a 46-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Denver quickly scored with a 72-yard end around run by Javon Walker. On their next drive, the Steelers were driving down the field, when Roethlisberger threw another interception to Champ Bailey near the end zone. Denver was unable to get out of their own end zone after that and punted to the Steelers, who scored on the next drive with a 3-yard touchdown run by Willie Parker. Denver put the game to an end in the fourth quarter with another 10-yard touchdown pass from Plummer to Walker. This came after the Steelers punted from their own 1-yard line and the Broncos began the series on the Steelers' 17-yard line. Both the Steelers and the Broncos scored field goals on their next possessions, the Steelers with a 29-yard field goal and Denver with a 32-yard field goal. Pittsburgh again, down by 11, nearly made it a 4-point game when WR Hines Ward leaped into the end zone, but fumbled from a John Lynch (American football) tackle, whereby the Broncos safety Curome Cox recovered the fumble. On the Steelers next possession, Roethlisberger again threw an interception, this time to Curome Cox, ending the game.

Strikingly, regardless of the place of origin, Ashkenazi Jews can be grouped in the same genetic cohort – that is, regardless of whether an Ashkenazi Jew's ancestors came from Poland, Russia, Hungary, Lithuania, or any other place with a historical Jewish population, they belong to the same ethnic group. The research demonstrates the endogamy of the Jewish population in Europe and lends further credence to the idea of Ashkenazi Jews as an ethnic group. Moreover, though intermarriage among Jews of Ashkenazi descent has become increasingly common, many Haredi Jews, particularly members of Hasidic or Hareidi sects, continue to marry exclusively fellow Ashkenazi Jews. This trend keeps Ashkenazi genes prevalent and also helps researchers further study the genes of Ashkenazi Jews with relative ease. It is noteworthy that these Haredi Jews often have extremely large families.\\", answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text.

In the context of the passage, Ashkenazi Jews possess a clear, homogeneous genetic subgroup that is prevalent among them, regardless of their place of origin. This genetic makeup is maintained through endogamy and exclusive marriages within their community, particularly among Haredi Jews, members of Hasidic or Hareidi sects.

Each character had their own distinctive traits, and together the gang concocted various schemes to make money or get out of trouble, often getting entangled with Officer Dibble, the local NYPD beat cop. 1. Brain: Brain, despite his incongruous name, is the least intelligent member of the gang. He is known for his naïve personality and often misunderstands Top Cat's instructions, leading to humorous situations. Despite his shortcomings, Brain is loyal to his friends and always willing to help. 2. Spook: Spook is a smooth-talking, laid-back cat with a suave demeanor. He speaks in rhyming \\"beatnik\\"-style slang and often offers ideas that contribute to the gang's schemes.

Let's convert the distance to kilometers and time to hours first. 1 meter = 0.001 km, so 200 meters = 200 * 0.001 = 0.2 km 1 second = 1/3600 hrs, so 30 seconds = 30 * 1/3600 = 1/120 hrs Now we can calculate the speed: Speed = 0.2 km / (1/120) hrs Speed = 0.2 km * (120 hrs / 1) Speed = 24 km/hr So, the correct answer is (B) 24 km/hr."},{"instruction":"You are presented with the quiz \\"Animals usually require what for survival?\\" But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints.

Instead, calmly assess the situation and decide on the best course of action. Step 2: Gather materials - To effectively remove gum from your hair, you will need some items that help dissolve the gum's stickiness. Common household items that might work well include oil-based products like cooking oil, peanut butter or conditioner, ice cubes, a fine-tooth comb, and a towel or cloth. Step 3: Apply chosen substance - Choose one of the oil-based substances like cooking oil, peanut butter, or conditioner. Apply a generous amount directly onto the gum and surrounding hair using a cloth, or your fingers. The more lubricated the gum becomes, the easier it will be to remove. Step 4: Loosen the gum - Once the substance is applied, gently work it into the gum and surrounding hair. As the gum starts to lose its stickiness, it should begin to slide off the hair strands more easily. Step 5: Use a fine-tooth comb - Hold the hair above the gum so you don't pull on the roots or further tangle the hair. Then, gently slide a fine-tooth comb through the affected hair, starting close to the gum and working your way down the hair strands. Be patient and avoid using excessive force; doing so may cause further damage to the hair. Step 6: Repeat as needed - If the gum is still not fully removed, repeat the above steps until the gum is completely gone. Depending on how large the gum is or how tangled it is in the hair, this process may take several attempts. Step 7: Wash your hair - Once the gum is removed, you'll want to get rid of any remaining residue. Wash your hair thoroughly using your regular shampoo, and then condition to help detangle and restore the hair's natural softness. Step 8: Dry and style - Gently towel-dry your hair and apply a leave-in conditioner if necessary to prevent and repair any damage caused during the gum removal process. Then, style your hair as usual, being mindful of the previously affected area."},{"instruction":"Q:Facts: - third: lori olson-johns - skip: valerie sweeting - lead: '' \` rachelle brown '' ' - medaltemplates: women 's curling - birth date: 6 july 1986 - name: rachelle brown - birth place: smithers , british columbia - alternate: sarah wilkes - second: dana ferguson Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of rachelle brown .

The decision facing one Brooklyn jury was how much a landlord should pay in damages to the boy -- named \\"G.M.M.\\" in court documents -- after an investigation showed he had been living in an apartment illegally coated with lead paint. Attorneys representing G.M.M. said 3.4 million was the right number, arguing that the boy would have had a bright career ahead of him; both of his parents had graduated from college and his mother received a master's degree. But the landlord's defense put the figure at less than half that -- 1.5 million. Attorney Roger Archibald noted that because the boy was Hispanic, G.M.M. was unlikely to attain the advanced education that would provide to such a large income. The 4-year-old's case is a rare public look at one corner of the American legal system that explicitly uses race and gender to determine how much victims or their families should receive in compensation when they are seriously injured or killed. As a result, white and male victims often receive larger awards than people of color and women in similar cases.

Note that URLs in the text have been replaced with [Link]. Q: But President Donald J. Trump hardly looked like a grand wizard a week ago today. On January 8 he hosted Alveda King the niece of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.; Isaac Newton Farris Jr. Dr. King’s nephew and Bruce Levell of the National Diversity Coalition for Trump . All three of Trump ’s guests are black. “I did about 200 cataract surgeries with a group of surgeons in Haiti and the same in Central America ” Senator Paul an ophthalmologist said on NBC’s Meet the Press yesterday. “And when we asked Donald J. Trump as a private citizen to support those trips he was a large financial backer of both medical mission trips.” Paul continued: “I think it’s unfair then to sort of all of a sudden paint him ‘Oh well he ’s a racist ’ when I know for a fact that he cares very deeply about the people in Haiti because he helped finance a trip where we were able to get vision back for 200 people in Haiti.” Whatever Trump said or didn’t say the reaction has been beyond incendiary with the words “racist” and “racism” erupting like volcanos around the Pacific Ring of Fire. Trump’s alleged language if uttered was unfortunate vulgar and unpresidential although he hardly would have been the first chief executive to use profanity in office. His supposed words apparently were aimed at sh**hole nations rather than sh**hole people. The latter would have been inexcusable. It is widely understood that certain nations are garden spots and others are not. It is fair to say that Haiti El Salvador and a tragically high number of African countries are non-garden spots. It also is perfectly appropriate to ask whether America would be better off with immigrants from such impoverished and embattled places or from prosperous nations such as Norway which Trump reportedly mentioned. It likely was top of mind given Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg’s visit and joint press conference with him on Wednesday. Whatever he stated or didn’t President Trump should learn these lessons from this experience and repeat them to himself daily: “Every word I say matters.” This is true in public in private and around the clock until he leaves the White House and begins work on the Donald J. Trump Presidential Library. Trump should think of himself as Jim Carrey in the 1998 film The Truman Show. Except when he is in bed Trump should behave as if every breath he takes were being broadcast live around the globe. Trump needs to remember that Democrats are not his pals. They almost universally crave his failure resist his program and want to yank him from office — never mind the 304 votes he legitimately won in the Electoral College. Anything he says in front of Democrats (and even some Never Trump Republicans alas) can and will be used against him in the court of public opinion. Senator Durbin should be condemned for publicizing (or distorting) his private conversation with Trump thus sabotaging efforts to reach a DACA deal. But this should be no more shocking than if somewhere in Illinois a rooster crowed at dawn. Trump needs to remember that Democrats are not his pals. Ned Ryun of American Majority has an excellent idea: Whenever President Trump meets with Democrats he should summon news cameras and let them stay until Democrats leave. Trump displayed his leadership skills to almost universal applause when he allowed the media to broadcast live for 55 minutes from the Cabinet Room as he negotiated immigration and border security last Tuesday. Doing this regularly when Democrats are around will prevent them from offering journalists an alternative version of events. With cameras present Trump should be on his best behavior. And the American people will benefit from Senate-floor-like transparency inside the White House. This would be unprecedented and gain Trump considerable respect for opening a virtual sunroof atop the West Wing. Trump’s job is to recall at all times with the relentlessness of a bloodhound chasing an escaped Death Row inmate that he must not give free knives and anvils to people who hate his guts and literally would cheer if he woke up dead tomorrow morning . (And the Left need not bother to deny this. Everyone knows this is true as evidenced by the Left’s repeated fantasies about Trump being shot stabbed and decapitated.) These people would call Trump a racist for ordering vanilla ice cream. He should remember this without fail and act accordingly. If Trump becomes blurry about this fact he should remember the very first fake-news story to emerge on his watch. On January 20 during his very first day as president Time magazine’s Zeke Miller reported that Trump removed a bust of Dr. Martin Luther King from the Oval Office. This confirmed that Trump was a racist who couldn’t wait to evict that troublemaking black from his new office. A:","output":"President Donald J.

Minutes later, they heard a strange banging sound on the floor. In the options below, what is the most likely to happen next? (1). They slept soundly after that.. (2). They all freaked out naturally..","output":"To determine the most likely outcome, I'll analyze the options based on the context and emotional states of the characters. Option 1: They slept soundly after that. Given that the group played with a Ouija board and they might already be on edge or nervous, hearing a strange banging sound might not be easily dismissed. As a result, it seems unlikely that they would just simply sleep soundly after the banging sound. Option 2: They all freaked out naturally. Considering the context of the story, the group has been playing with a Ouija board, which might make them more inclined to believe in supernatural events or at least be more prone to fear. Hearing strange noise would likely evoke such fear or general discomfort, making this option more plausible. Therefore, based on the context of the story and the character's emotional state, Option 2: They all freaked out naturally, is the most likely outcome."},{"instruction":"Instructions: In this task, you are given a conversation between a flight agent and the customer.

Let me explain each question for you: 1. Why is Karan Johar as judge in Jhalak Dikhla Jaa since 4 seasons? Karan Johar is a famous Bollywood filmmaker who makes many popular movies. He has good knowledge about dance, acting, and entertainment, so he has been a judge on a dancing show called \\"Jhalak Dikhla Jaa\\" for 4 seasons. People like him as a judge because he gives good advice to the participants. 2. Why do some people say that Karan Johar is gay? When people talk about someone being gay, it means that person might like others of the same gender, instead of the opposite gender. Some people say Karan Johar is gay because of the way he talks or behaves, or because of some rumors they heard.

Rage Against the Machine broke up as a result of de la Rocha's departure, but the remaining three members of the band—Tim Commerford, Tom Morello, and Brad Wilk—decided to stay together and announced plans to continue with a new vocalist. Several vocalists jammed with the three, including B-Real of Cypress Hill, but they did not want another rapper or anybody who sounded like de la Rocha. Contrary to popular belief, Layne Staley of Alice in Chains neither auditioned nor was asked to join the new project. Tom Morello denied this claim on his Twitter account in 2015. Music producer and friend Rick Rubin suggested that they play with Chris Cornell, the ex-frontman of Soundgarden. Rubin also persuaded the three of them to go into group therapy with performance coach Phil Towle after the breakup. Rubin was confident that with the right new voice, Rage Against the Machine had the potential to become a better band; he believed \\"it could turn into a Yardbirds-into-Led Zeppelin scenario.\\" Commerford later credited Rubin for being the catalyst that brought Audioslave together.

Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \\"favoured races\\" as \\"perfected races\\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Clémence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until a translation by Edmond Barbier was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860.

The Dr. Gridlock column receives hundreds of letters each month from motorists and transit riders throughout the Washington region. They ask questions and make complaints about getting around a region plagued with some of the worst traffic in the nation. The doctor diagnoses problems and tries to bring relief. Dr. Gridlock appears in The Post's Metro section on Sunday and in the Extra section on Thursday. His comments also appear on the Web site's Get There blog. You can send e-mails for the newspaper column to drgridlock@washpost.com or write to Dr. Gridlock at 1150 15th St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20071. Dr. Gridlock: Hello, travelers, let's get to your questions about getting around this region. Metro Web site lies re: Train Times, D.C.: Why doesn't the Metro Web site sync with actual train schedules? I'm often leaving my office at Metro Center late and night, and I hate waiting 15 minutes for a train! So I figured I could look up when the next train was coming and be there to meet it. Except there is no relation to the Metro Web site and actual train schedules! Why??? Dr. Gridlock: I can tell you how it's supposed to work. Here's what Metro says about using its Web site, www.metroopensdoors.com, to get real time information on trains: From the home page, go to the \\"Maps and Stations\\" page and click on \\"Find a Stop/Station.\\" You'll see a list of stations. Click on the on yours. Then click to \\"Next Train Arrival\\" to get the arrival times of the next three trains headed in each direction. What you'll see looks like the electronic display boards on the platforms. The page refreshes every 30 seconds. Arlington, Va.: A big thank you to the Arlington County Police Officer who was pulling over people driving in the breakdown lane on 66-West this morning. This is a chronic problem in the a.m. between Lee Highway and Glebe Road, so it was nice to see someone take some action against it. Dr. Gridlock: It's a frustrating thing to drive I-66, especially at rush periods and especially inside the Beltway, where it's only two lanes. The state is looking at some improvements in the westbound direction that don't involve expanding the right of way. Driving in the breakdown lane is no solution. It's a dangerous thing for those who do it and for other motorists. Fairfax, Va.: This may be more of a Metro question but... Recently the overflow parking lot at the Vienna station closed down. Although Metro offered options of where else to park your car (then take a bus to the station) none are very convenient for me. Several times now I have arrived at the station at around 8, only to find there is no parking (except for all the empty \\"reserved\\" spaces). Metro claims that a new parking deck is being built in 2007, but what do they plan to do about all the new traffic this will cause, and all the back-up this will cause on the trains? Dr. Gridlock: Metro and local governments are planning to add more parking across the region, but construction is not keeping pace with demand. My letter-writers are particularly vexed about the closings of parking areas in some places to make way for construction around Metro stations. Vienna is a case in point. I talked to a group of retired federal workers in the Vienna-Oakton area last week who said they don't even think about taking the train. They like to do their traveling outside of rush hour, and of course, you can't get a parking space at the Vienna Station. Meanwhile, Metro wants to add more reserved parking and overbook it, like airlines overbook seats because they know some people won't show up. I hear from some people frustrated because they've been on the waiting list for reserved parking forever, but I also hear from others who see empty reserved spaces they can't use when everything else is full. Chesapeake Beach, Md.: Why isn't there a bullet train between Baltimore and Washington? Fifteen minutes station to station -- something really revolutionary and modern. Dr. Gridlock: If you go to http://www.bwmaglev.com/, you can read more about the proposal to build a maglev train line between Baltimore and Washington. But the thing is, this would cost about 4 billion to build (and I think the estimate would prove to be low). So what would a one-way ticket cost? Maybe 40? Maybe tourists would use it, or people in a desperate hurry on one particular day. But it's not a solution for commuters. We'd be better off extending Metro's Green Line up that way, building a new light rail line, or enhancing commuter bus service. Can you please let us know the rules regarding bicycles on the escalators when the elevators are down? I am always seeing strollers on the escalators and no one bats an eye... Dr. Gridlock: Here's Metro's rule: \\"Cyclists shall be required to use elevators to access mezzanines and platforms. Escalators and stairs shall not be used except when special requests (for emergency reasons) have been granted by Metro Station Managers, Metro Transit Police, or city/county police or fire officials. Cyclists shall allow other passengers to exit before placing bicycles in or taking bicycles out of the elevators.\\" Metro doesn't want to take a chance on a bike slipping from the riders hands and tumbling down the steps. It's crazy for people to take a chance with a stroller, too. Metro's Web site has a list of stations where the elevators are out of service, so surprises should be rare. Jacksonville, Fla. (but recently D.C.): What do you mean by saying that Porcari \\"knows\\" that Maryland doesn't have enough money to build any new stuff? If they can afford the ICC, why can't they afford other stuff? Dr. Gridlock: What I said on my \\"Get There\\" blog this morning was that incoming Maryland transportation secretary John Porcari Porcari \\"knows that Maryland doesn't have the money or the room to build a lot of big new stuff in the densely populated Washington-Baltimore corridor.\\" I also quoted Porcari saying that his top priority is to make sure that projects under construction or near construction actually get done. That would include the intercounty connector highway, for example. Probably would not include a 4 billion maglev link between Washington and Baltimore. Back on metro after 20 years!: I hope I am not beating a dead horse, but I have noticed some particularly foul odors in Metro stations recently. The odors smell part dead animal, or part burning brakes or some other mechanical piece burning. I notice the smells waiting in stations, but not on trains themselves. Sometimes the smell is enhanced when a train enters the station. Has anyone else noticed or commented on these odors? Dr. Gridlock: If you experienced what a lot of other riders have experienced in the past couple months, Metro says you're smelling the new brake pads. Metro knows the odor is a problem and is working with the manufacturer to fix this. Fairfax, Va.: Can you ask your readers how busy Chain Bridge Road from McLean through Tysons into Vienna is during rush hour? Is it busy throughout the day, or can I get across town better before a certain time in the early morning and early evening? As bad as it may be, is it better than taking the beltway to I66W to get to Vienna instead of Chain Bridge Road? Fairfax, Va.: When the funding finally gets finished for Metro to Tysons/Dulles, do you think we'll finally see movement on rail to Centreville down the median of I-66? Dr. Gridlock: I hope we don't have to wait that long for some way of pushing transit farther out the I-66 corridor. The 4 billion rail to Dulles project won't be finished till 2015, which might be optimistic. Burke, Va.: Why do states constantly think that throwing money at a problem will solve it??? Spending billions of dollars on transportation is NEVER going to solve the source or the problem: That people cannot afford to live where they work. Until the government figures out a way to create affordable housing near work centers, all of the money in the world is not going to solve the traffic problem! Dr. Gridlock: I agree with what you said. More money is not going to solve the problem. But I do believe that all across this region, we've got to spend a lot more money to help solve it. The problem is so big, it requires a big, complex solution. Make our transportation planning and construction problems more rational, more transparent, more efficient. Coordinate transportation planning and land use planning (like you said, more affordable housing near work centers). But if you just plan better for land use, you haven't solved the problem either. We still have to build roads and transit and sidewalks and bike paths to match up with a smarter design for our communities. Arlington, Va.: Is there any information about how the closing of the Arlington Cemetery station this weekend went? I live in Rosslyn and I do know that the shuttle buses were there, but I decided not to bother to head to Pentagon City because of the business of going in and out of the Pentagon Station both ways, although I suppose riding down to L'Enfant Plaza and switching might have worked. Dr. Gridlock: I haven't heard any complaints -- yet -- about the changes Metrorail imposed this weekend because of the major track work around Arlington Cemetery Station. What say you all? This was a fairly large-scale reorganization. Because of the weekend work, the Yellow Line was extended and the Blue Line was diverted away from the Rosslyn tunnel. Capitol Hill, D.C.: The Montgomery County Planning Board recently approved recommendations to build a bikeway along the entire 18 mile ICC. Right now, the state is only going to build along 7.7 miles (non-contiguous). Did Porcari say anything about the bikeway (since he believes that \\"a proper transportation network offers people choices -- drive, ride transit, bike, walk.\\") Dr. Gridlock: Capitol Hill refers to my interview with incoming MD transportation secretary John Porcari. I didn't ask Porcari specifically about the unfunded portion of the ICC bikeway, but I've got to believe that if he can find a way to extend it along the entire route, he'll do that. During the interview, Porcari frequently mentioned his enthusiasm for the region's bike trails and the need to use every opportunity to expand them. He noted with some pride -- because he was involved in the planning -- that the new Wilson Bridge will be accessible to bikers. Chain Bridge into Vienna: Is a mess. Beltway is by far the better option. Or, take the backroads from McLean to Rt 7 and hop on 66 there. Dr. Gridlock: A response to the traveler's question above. Rockville, Md.: \\"Spending billions of dollars on transportation is NEVER going to solve the source or the problem: That people cannot afford to live where they work.\\" How much is this versus choose not to live near where they work? I work in downtown D.C. I have some coworkers who live in West Virginia. It's not cost of living (per se). They want to have acres upon acres on which to play on the weekends. They can't buy that here (since it doesn't exist) but they could (if they wanted) buy a nice house with a decent yard close in but, it wouldn't be what they wanted. Dr. Gridlock: That's the problem with Americans. They're never going to do exactly what you tell them. They're going to decide for themselves what's best for them and their families. I do believe in good planning as a partial solution to our transportation problems, but it's unrealistic to think we're going to eliminate the solo driver and get everyone living in areas dense enough to support transit. What is the absolute latest I could leave the D.C. area to get to NYC relatively hassle-free? Is 1:00 pushing it? Dr. Gridlock: Questions about long-distance travel times always vex me, because there's no way to account for what's going to happen to you between here and there. Will the weather change? Will there be a lane-closing accident on I-95 in Delaware? How long will the backup be at Delaware's toll plaza? Also, when you're making a long-distance trip during daylight, you're likely to wander into somebody else's rush period in the congested Northeast corridor. A Delaware highway official pointed out to me that the stretch of I-95 through his state may seem like long-distance pavement to us in Washington, but it's Main Street for New Castle County. (You think I'm obsessing on Delaware?) Washington, D.C.: Re: trains to BWI. Why build a new train? Why extend Metro? There actually is a train that goes there from D.C. and New Carrollton already. The train is called MARC. Granted, the service is awful unless you are going southbound in the a.m. or northbound in the p.m. Oh, and forget about weekends and holidays. But expanding existing service of trains that go from Metro stops to BWI and Baltimore seems to be a lot cheaper than building new tracks or inventing mag-lev trains. The various governments (I'm lumping all transit authorities, state, city, feds together here) should recognize the existing commuter rail networks such as MARC and VRE as reasonable ways to transport large numbers of people around the area, not just a way to get people into D.C. for work. The model should be more along the lines of Long Island RR or NJ Transit, with frequent service even on the weekends, rather than simply 9-5 commuters. Dr. Gridlock: I think improved weekday service on MARC and VRE should be a very high transportation priority. But it's not going to do everything we need -- at least not soon. MARC has to operate on tracks owned by CSX and Amtrak. There are only so many trains that can run on those lines. At a town hall meeting in Montgomery County last week, Porcari was asked if MARC service could run on weekends. Porcari noted that it would require renegotiation of agreements with the rail owners, plus a significant increase in the operating subsidy for MARC. Better equipment and more reliable service would be a good place to start improving MARC. Alexandria, Va.: Is there a resource online that displays what time the Metro stations with parking become full in the morning? Personally, I am interested in the Virginia stations. Thanks! Dr. Gridlock: There's no source I know of. Definitely not anything official from Metro that would help you on a given day. Maybe readers have some suggestions, though? Reston, Va.: Re:Chain Bridge Road From McLean into and through Tyson's it's \\"not that bad\\", assuming that everything is going smoothly. (No accidents, mistimed lights, random cop on the corner, etc.) But 123 into Vienna (after Old Courthouse) is usually a bear, primarily due to volume of both cars and traffic lights. Dr. Gridlock: That's another response to reader question above on best route. Washington, D.C.: Any idea on what the ICC will be signed as when it's complete? Will it be an extension of I-370 or will it have a number at all? Dr. Gridlock: David Buck, spokesman for the Maryland State Highway Administration, tells me that the intercounty connector will be designated as MD 200. Washington, D.C.: I used to work in McLean. I'd suggest that the reader seeking to go to Vienna consider taking the Toll Road west to Spring Hill, go left after the tollbooth, then right on Westpark Drive (the light at the top of the hill after passing the apartments), and follow that until you hit 123 next to the \\"Toilet Bowl Building.\\" Then go right onto 123. This avoids the mall traffic. In my experience 123 was worst during the evening rush hour but was okay during midday, but that was a few years ago. Dr. Gridlock: Another response to the travel question above. (What I've found is that our readers are an army of researchers and they're very willing to help fellow sufferers on the roads and rails. This is a very powerful force.) Arlington, Va.: re: travel between D.C. and NYC -- I've tried, and there is no way to travel during the day and miss rush hour everywhere. If you are actually going to NYC (vs. the suburbs), you stand a chance if you leave D.C. around 9:30 a.m. If you're passing through D.C. to Long Island or Westchester, you'll hit rush hour on the other side of the city. Really your best best is to wait after the p.m. rush ends in D.C., and the later you leave, the better -- you'd be amazed how much traffic is still on the NJ Turnpike at midnight. I usually wait until 9 p.m. before I head out. Dr. Gridlock: Another example of the research army. This was in response to the question about how late you can leave for New York and still avoid a big hassle. By the way, in doing some columns of holiday travel advice, I came to the conclusion that the time you leave outweighs the importance of the route you take in most cases. If you're traveling in the Northeast corridor of during holiday periods, you'll get more benefit from a very early or very late departure than you will from a \\"shortcut.\\" Delaware: I think you are so right to obsess about the backups in Delaware. They really need to stop considering their stretch of I-95 as part of a local Main Street, and start thinking of it as a piece of a vital commercial corridor that connects the entire eastern seaboard. A corridor that is consistently brought to a crashing halt in Delaware. Why don't they have high speed EZ-Pass lanes, similar to the N.J. turnpike, where you can drive through at 55 mph? That facility added to the Delaware Memorial Bridge and to the absurd little toll plaza they use to extort payment from all travelers would help immeasurably. Dr. Gridlock: And I should ask the Del. folks why they can't go for a one-way toll, like so many other turnpike and bridge authorities do. Must be a revenue reason. Probably something about the ease of getting around that toll plaza near the Maryland border. To earlier post (I-66, police officer..) There is a public workshop concerning the westbound I-66. Washington Lee HS, next Tuesday Jan. 23, 7-8:30. Dr. Gridlock: Thanks, Arlington, and I'll mention that in my Road Watch column as well. That meeting is about several ways the state has come up with to ease westbound travel without expanding the right of way on I-66 inside the Beltway. Washington, D.C.: Dr. Gridlock, I'm sure you've heard these comparisons before. I visited NYC a couple of weeks ago and couldn't help but marvel at how much more efficient the subway system is there. My sister was able to go online and figure out the best way for me to get from the city to Queens so that I could be picked up by my in-laws. Not only did it work, but it was a lot quicker than I expected -- on a Saturday! While the trains are not as luxurious as Metro's, they are relatively clean and seemingly run like clockwork and quite frequently -- for a Saturday. I also noticed there is a flat rate and no turnstiles when exiting the station. When will Metro get with the program? Also, do we trade off more luxurious trains and cleaner stations for trains that don't run frequently on weekends, evenings and holidays? Dr. Gridlock: In terms of transit in the U.S., there's New York and then there's everything else. Though it's a century old, the NYC system has lots of natural advantages. The region is so densely populated it can support an enormous transit system. Also, it was built with express tracks, that not only speed travel but also allow the subway managers to work the trains around problems. Still, our Metro system is one of the finest I've seen in my travels. We all want to see it get better, but that shouldn't blind us to this great resource. By the way, the \\"Trip Planner\\" on Metro's Web site is pretty good at helping you get around the region by transit. I use it a lot. Reston, Va.: Anyone want to do an actual headcount of Delaware tags on 95 IN Delaware? I worked there for several years and most folks avoid it like the combination of the plague and Ebola. Dr. Gridlock: Maybe it's like Yogi said: \\"Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded.\\" Around here, we say \\"never again\\" after a bad drive on the Beltway or a crushing experience on the Orange Line. But the next day, we're back in the rut because we haven't found a better way. Tysons Corner, Va.: I have written with this question but have never seen it in your column. I commute to Herndon from Tysons on the Toll Road. Frequently, a Fairfax County bus exits the Dulles Access Road doing 65 or 70, then has to careen over four lanes of traffic in time to get off at its Toll Road exit. I see the same thing the other direction, as buses get onto the Toll Road then swoop to the left to get on the Access Road. This seems like an accident looking for a time to happen. Why are buses allowed to use the Dulles Access Road? And why are they routed so as require such challenging lane changes? Dr. Gridlock: That's not a good maneuver for anybody, let alone a bus. That set up must have been designed for an era with far fewer cars trying to jam through. It is pretty common, though, to give buses access to the fastest possible route. They have access to the carpool lanes, they'll have access to the tolled intercounty connector in Maryland and to the High Occupancy/Toll lanes when they're built from Springfield to American Legion Bridge. Northern Virginia: Dear Dr. Gridlock, Recently I moved to the Ashburn area and commute to Reston. When I travel on Loudoun County Parkway to Waxpool (this is a really big intersection), two things I see every day: 1. People run the red light...not just by a smidgen, but blowing right through it 2. People turning right onto Waxpool from Loudoun County Parkway do so on red from the middle turn lane, even though there is a sign saying \\"No Turn on Red from This Lane\\". But really it's so small that people miss it, or people honk if someone actually stops on red in this lane. Just needed to vent, that is all. Dr. Gridlock: Thought I'd share that vent with the group. \\"Northern Virginia's\\" frustrations are pretty common across the region. Waldorf, Md.: Commuter buses are only as good as the roads they travel. There are plenty of commuter buses coming up to D.C. from Southern Maryland each day, but they sit in the same horrific traffic on 5/301 and into D.C. that I do in my car. I would take the bus if there were dedicated lanes and a consistent schedule. Any talk from Porcari about those types of improvements (or any improvements for that matter) for the fast-growing Southern Maryland region? Dr. Gridlock: First, give the man a chance. He isn't even in Annapolis yet. But I can tell you this: When we were talking about improvements in Maryland's transportation system, Porcari talked specifically about the addition of commuter buses to serve Southern Maryland. We also talked a bit about the need for a Route 301 bypass around Waldorf. I think you've got a guy coming into this job who brings experience from his first round under Gov. Glendening and an awareness of what Maryland travelers are looking for in terms of improvements. Dr. Gridlock: Travelers, I need to head off to a briefing on a transportation project many of you will be interested in. Once again, I've got far more good questions and comments on my screen than I could get to today. I'll make a printout and try to address some of them on the \\"Get There\\" blog or in upcoming Dr. Gridlock columns.","output":"Dr. Gridlock, an expert on traffic and transit in the Washington region, fielded a variety of questions from readers regarding traffic problems, transportation developments, and personal commute experiences.

Which language is this?","output":"This phrase, \\"Roztočíme to jak na Prvního máje,\\" is in Czech, a West Slavic language spoken by over 10 million people mainly in the Czech Republic. It belongs to the larger group of Indo-European languages. Czech is closely related to other Slavic languages such as Slovak, Polish, and Russian, although each of these languages has its own distinct vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. Czech uses the Latin alphabet with additional diacritical marks (e.g., ě, š, č, ř, ž, ý, á, í, é, ů, and ú) that provide information on pronunciation and stress. The language has a relatively complex grammatical system, with features such as noun declension, verb conjugation, and aspect, that demand attention to detail when learning and using the language. In the given phrase, \\"Roztočíme to jak na Prvního máje,\\" the meaning is \\"We'll spin it like on the First of May.\\" This is a colloquial expression that could be understood as starting something with a lot of energy or enthusiasm, similar to how people might start celebrations and festivities on the First of May. The First of May is International Workers' Day in many countries, including the Czech Republic, and is often marked by various events, parades, and social gatherings."},{"instruction":"Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What is a key driver of evolution? Context: Chapter I covers animal husbandry and plant breeding, going back to ancient Egypt. Darwin discusses contemporary opinions on the origins of different breeds under cultivation to argue that many have been produced from common ancestors by selective breeding. As an illustration of artificial selection, he describes fancy pigeon breeding, noting that \\"[t]he diversity of the breeds is something astonishing\\", yet all were descended from one species of rock pigeon. Darwin saw two distinct kinds of variation: (1) rare abrupt changes he called \\"sports\\" or \\"monstrosities\\" (example: ancon sheep with short legs), and (2) ubiquitous small differences (example: slightly shorter or longer bill of pigeons). Both types of hereditary changes can be used by breeders. However, for Darwin the small changes were most important in evolution. The answer to this question is:","output":"selective breeding"},{"instruction":"Given the following context: While on a hunting trip on Loyalsock Creek north of the park in 1850, brothers Elijah and Clemuel Ricketts were frustrated at having to spend the night on a hotel's parlor floor. In 1851 or 1853 they bought 5,000 acres (2,000 ha), including what is now Lake Ganoga and some of the park, as their own hunting preserve, and built a stone house on the lake shore by 1852 or 1855. The stone house served as their lodge and as a tavern; it was known as \\"Ricketts Folly\\" for its isolated location in the wilderness. Clemuel died in 1858 and Elijah bought his share of the land and house. The Ricketts family was not aware of the glens and their waterfalls until about 1865, when they were discovered by two guests from the stone house who went fishing and wandered down Kitchen Creek.Elijah's son Robert Bruce Ricketts, for whom the park is named, joined the Union Army as a private at the outbreak of the American Civil War and rose through the ranks to become a colonel in the artillery. After the war, R. Bruce Ricketts returned to Pennsylvania and in 1869 began purchasing the land around the lake from his father. By 1873 he controlled or owned 66,000 acres (27,000 ha), and eventually this grew to more than 80,000 acres (32,000 ha), including the glens and waterfalls and most of the park.While the stone house had served as a home and inn since its construction, in 1872 R. Bruce Ricketts built a three-story wooden addition north of the house. The addition used lumber from a sawmill Ricketts and his partners operated from 1872 to 1875, about 0.5 miles (0.8 km) southeast of the stone house. The North Mountain House hotel opened in 1873; Ricketts' brother Frank, for whom a park waterfall is named, managed it from then until 1898. Many of the hotel's guests were Ricketts' friends and relations, who arrived after school let out in June and stayed all summer until school resumed in September. In 1876 and 1877, Ricketts ran the first summer school in the United States at his house and hotel; one of the teachers was Joseph Rothrock,... answer the following question: What is the name of the hotel in which, combined with his house, Ricketts ran the first summer school in the United States?

A mall Santa had a heart attack at work and was rushed to the Emergency Room in full cardiac arrest. Let me explain that a person playing Santa is generally a certain age (white beard) and body type (round) that is predisposed to cardiac disease. We did everything we could but ultimately our efforts were futile. The mall Santa rode his sleigh into the great beyond. A mother, there to visit another patient, was insistent that her 7–8 year old son be allowed back to visit his grandmother. We had a strict 12 year old age limit visitation policy. I was called to speak with her. ”Why do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?” She insisted. “The Emergency Room is no place for a child ma’am. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,” I explained. “Like what?” She argued. “Well, there are people in pain moaning,” I answered. “And drunks cursing at the staff. It’s a tough place.” “He’s fine,” she insisted. “I think I know how to parent. I don’t need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.” I caved in and allowed her back. As we passed the room with the dead Santa, a tech exited and opened the curtain. Her child looked in and saw Santa’s lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room. The child lost it! “Mom, Santa Claus is Dead!” He cried. “I’m not going to get anything for Christmas.” “Why would someone open the curtain?” The mother demanded. “I warned you,” I said. “That’s why we have a 12 years and above visitation policy.” She was not happy. Come to find out the child had his picture made with that very Santa a few days prior. Very ironic. Question: Why was the boy upset?

Article:","output":"Title: Rohingya Refugees Abandoned at Sea: A Dire Humanitarian Crisis Unfolds Introduction: In a shocking revelation, CNN has recently uncovered evidence that suggests hundreds of Rohingya refugees were abandoned at sea by the Thai army. These vulnerable individuals, already facing immense challenges as they flee persecution from the hard-line military regime in Myanmar, now face an uncertain fate as they are left adrift on rickety boats. Thai Army's Involvement: According to the information gathered by CNN, photographs have surfaced that clearly show these desperate refugees on board their dilapidated boats, being towed out to sea by the Thai army before being cut loose and left to drift. This disturbing act raises critical questions about the Thai army's role in the ongoing Rohingya crisis and their apparent lack of empathy for the suffering of these vulnerable people. Thailand Government's Response: In response to these alarming revelations, the Thai government has taken the essential step of launching an official inquiry to address and investigate the matter. They aim to hold those responsible accountable and take necessary action against any individuals or factions found guilty of such inhumane actions. The Plight of the Rohingya: Hailing from Myanmar, the Rohingya people have long been victims of persecution at the hands of the nation's hard-line military regime. Violent crackdowns, killings, and forced displacement of the Rohingya have led them to seek refuge in neighboring countries such as Bangladesh, Thailand, and Malaysia. However, the journey to safety is often riddled with hardships and dangers, including exploitation by human traffickers, violence, and now being abandoned at sea. Moving Forward: As the Thai government takes important steps to address the issue of Rohingya refugees being abandoned at sea, it is crucial for the international community to take notice of this humanitarian crisis and come together to provide support for these displaced people. Efforts must be made to ensure their safe passage to countries willing to offer them refuge and protect them from further persecution. The Rohingya people face an uphill battle in their quest for safety, and the apparent actions of the Thai army only serve to exacerbate their plight. It is imperative that the international community, humanitarian organizations, and governments across the globe work together to address the Rohingya crisis and ensure that these vulnerable people can finally find a safe haven, free from fear and persecution."},{"instruction":"Write a brief sentence.","output":"A brief sentence is a short group of words that tell us something, like \\"I love ice cream!\\""},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"Step 1: Select a language other than English.

Descriptions of Imogen as a small child indicate that she had blue eyes, fair hair, an oval face reminiscent of her father's, and a rather prominent nose inherited from her mother. In 1912, at the age of five, she joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute, and remained at the school for five years. Summers were often spent at the Holsts' rented country cottage at Thaxted in Essex, where Gustav Holst began an annual Whitsun Festival in 1916.In 1917 Imogen began boarding at Eothen, a small, private school for girls in Caterham, where Jane Joseph, Gustav's star pupil from SPGS, taught music. A letter home, dated 17 July 1917, tells of \\"compertishions [sic], and ripping prizes, and strawberries and cream for tea\\". At the school, Imogen studied piano with Eleanor Shuttleworth, violin with André Mangeot (described as \\"topping\\") and theory with Jane Joseph (\\"ripping\\"). Under Joseph's tuition Imogen produced her first compositions—two instrumental pieces and four Christmas carol tunes—which she numbered as Ops. 1, 2, and 3. In the summer term of 1920, she composed and choreographed a \\"Dance of the Nymphs and Shepherds\\", which was performed at the school under her direction on 9 July.Imogen left Eothen in December 1920 hoping to study under Ruby Ginner at the Ginner-Mawer School of Dance and Drama, but was rejected on health grounds, although there appeared to be no significant medical issue. She then studied at home under a governess, while waiting to start at St Paul's Girls School in the autumn. At Whitsun 1921 she took part as a dancer in her father's production of Purcell's semi-opera from 1690, Masque of Dioclesian, held in the St Paul's School grounds and repeated a week later in Hyde Park.In September 1921 Imogen began at St Paul's Girls School, and became a boarder from Spring 1922.

This includes, depending on the particular manner of practice, the language, race, culture, religion, and customs of the \\"nation\\" in its primal sense of those who were \\"born\\" within its culture. This form of nationalism arose in reaction to dynastic or imperial hegemony, which assessed the legitimacy of the state from the \\"top down\\", emanating from a monarch or other authority, which justified its existence. Such downward-radiating power might ultimately derive from a god or gods (see the divine right of kings and the Mandate of Heaven). - Josef Daniel Stenbäck (May 2, 1854, Alavus April 27, 1929, Helsinki) was a Finnish church architect and engineer. He designed 35 churches for Finland, which until 1917 was part of the Russian Empire. Four of the churches were located in the current Russian territory of the Karelian Isthmus, ceded to the Soviet Union in 1944. Stenbäck's churches represent Romantic nationalism or Gothic Revival. One of his most famous works is the Juselius Mausoleum. - Joensuu Church is located in the centre of Joensuu , North Karelia , Finland .

Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Choices: --yes. --it is not possible to tell. --no.","output":"The premise does not entail the hypothesis. The statement \\"Then the two men slowed\\" simply describes an action taken by two men, that they have reduced their speed or pace. This could apply to any number of contexts or situations. It could occur in a running race, while driving, while walking, or any situation in which movement or progress can be moderated and decreased. The hypothesis, \\"Both men slowed because the enemy was advancing,\\" introduces new elements not mentioned or implied in the premise. It introduces the concept of an \\"enemy\\" and the action of that enemy \\"advancing\\". There is nothing in the original premise that suggests the existence of an enemy or any related danger, threat or conflict, let alone that the act of slowing by the two men is as a reaction to an enemy's advancement. Logically, for the premise to entail the hypothesis, the premise would have to contain within it all the necessary elements that are required to make the hypothesis a reasonable, logical conclusion. In this case, it does not. There is simply not enough information provided. We can't definitively say why the two men slowed - the reason could be any number of alternatives. While it is possible to interpret the two men's action as being prompted by a hostile or combative situation based on the hypothesis, that level of specificity is just not present or implied in the original premise.

He occasionally sang lead vocals with the group, usually for one song on each album, including \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\", \\"Good Night\\", and their cover of \\"Act Naturally\\". He also wrote and sang the Beatles' songs \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Flying\\". Starr was afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, and he fell behind in school as a result of prolonged hospitalisations. He briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, he became interested in the UK skiffle craze and developed a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he co-founded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll by early 1958.

After achieving moderate success in the UK and Hamburg, he quit the Hurricanes and joined the Beatles in August 1962, replacing Pete Best. Starr played key roles in the Beatles' films and appeared in numerous others. After the band's break-up in 1970, he released several successful singles including the US number-four hit \\"It Don't Come Easy\\", and number ones \\"Photograph\\" and \\"You're Sixteen\\".

Let's break down the premise and the hypothesis to examine how they are related. Premise: The premise states that in situations where challenges and risks are addressed, agencies use a variety of approaches. These approaches include setting goals and measures that are directly or indirectly related to the challenges and risks or developing strategies to tackle them. This implies that different methods are applied based on the specific challenges and risks that must be resolved. Hypothesis: The hypothesis suggests that there are many approaches to addressing challenges and risks, and establishing goals is one among them. Conclusion: Since the premise declares that agencies use a variety of approaches to address challenges and risks, it inherently implies that there are numerous strategies deployed by agencies. The premise involves setting goals and measures directly or indirectly linked to management challenges and program risks as one such approach. Therefore, the hypothesis aligns with the premise, stating that there are many approaches, with establishing goals being one of them.

If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\". Question: What was the name of Andrzej's wife? Title: KatyÅ Movie plot: Katyn describes the tragedy of a generation. The film follows the story of four Polish families whose lives are torn apart when, at the outset of WWII, a great number of Polish soldiers (who are also fathers, husbands and brothers) fall into the hands of Soviet troops and later brutally become victims of Stalinism. The film also underlines the complicated circumstances of Poland's position both in the war and after. -tc-119\\"Katyn\\" tells the story through the eyes of the women; the mothers, wives and daughters of the victims executed on Stalin's orders by the NKVD in 1940.The main male character is Andrzej (played by Artur Zmijewski), a young Polish captain in an Uhlan (light cavalry) regiment who keeps a detailed diary. He is taken prisoner by the Soviet Army, which separates the officers from the enlisted men, who are allowed to return home, while the officers are held. His wife Anna (played by Maja Ostaszewska) and daughter Weronika (\\"Nika\\", played by Wiktoria Gsiewska) find him shortly before he is deported to the USSR. Presented with an opportunity to escape, he refuses on the basis of his oath of loyalty to the Polish military.Andrzej ends up in a prisoner of war camp, where he is kept for awhile and continues to keep his diary. He carefully records the names of all his fellow officers who are taken from the camp, as well as the dates they are taken. When winter comes, Andrzej is obviously suffering from the cold temperatures, and his colleague Jerzy (played by Andrzej Chyra) lends him an extra sweater. As it happens, the sweater has Jerzy's name written on it. Finally, it is Andrzej's turn to be taken from the camp, but Jerzy is left behind.At this point, the film fast-forwards to the post-WWII period back in Poland, when and where Andrzej's wife and daughter are still awaiting word about him.

The measure, backed by 10 Democrats and four Republicans, would codify Justice Department regulations that the special counsel can only be fired by the attorney general or a designee for \\"misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or other good cause.\\" The proposal would give the special counsel 10 days to challenge a dismissal in court. If a court determines the firing was not for \\"good cause,\\" the special counsel would be reinstated. The measure would also require the Justice Department to notify Congress when a special counsel is appointed and to report the findings of an investigation. While marking a strong show of support for Special Counsel Robert Mueller who is under frequent attack by President Donald Trump and some Republicans, the bill is unlikely to become law in the face of Republican opposition. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week that Trump will not fire Mueller and that there was no need to bring the measure to the Senate floor for a vote. House Speaker Paul Ryan has also opposed the idea. The legislation was introduced by four Senators earlier this month after Trump's sharp criticism of an FBI raid on his personal lawyer's home and office rekindled fears that Trump may fire Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who supervises Mueller. Mueller is heading the federal investigation into Russia's electoral interference and possible collusion with the Trump presidential campaign. Trump has said there was no collusion and repeatedly denounced the probe as a \\"witch hunt.\\" Despite his harsh criticism of the Special Counsel and the Justice Department, Trump has dismissed reports that he's privately talked about firing Mueller.

I was stationed on the Isle of Grain – a ghastly place but the first line of defence against invasion – and in our battalion of the Suffolks we had a number of professional musicians. So we formed an orchestra and played in the equivalent of the NAAFI during our spare time. I was the principal cello and we were conducted by the bandmaster, one Lieutenant Bonham. The other boys knew that I was longing to conduct and one day when Bonham fell ill with 'flu, they thought \\"old Barby\\" – as I was known – should have a go. It was really rather romantic – I was scrubbing the floor in the Officers' Mess when they came and invited me to take over. We did the Light Cavalry overture and Coleridge-Taylor's Petite Suite de Concert but I can't say I recall the rest of the programme. While in the army, Barbirolli adopted the anglicised form of his first name for the sake of simplicity: \\"The sergeant-major had great difficulty in reading my name on the roll-call. 'Who is this Guy Vanni?' he used to ask. So I chose John.\\" After demobilisation he reverted to the original form of his name, using it until 1922.On re-entering civilian life, Barbirolli resumed his career as a cellist. His association with Edward Elgar's Cello Concerto began with its première in 1919, when he played as a rank and file member of the London Symphony Orchestra. He was the soloist at another performance of the concerto just over a year later. The Musical Times commented, \\"Signor Giovanni Barbirolli was not entirely equal to the demands of the solo music, but his playing unquestionably gave a considerable amount of pleasure.\\" At the Three Choirs Festival of 1920 he took part in his first Dream of Gerontius, under Elgar's baton, in the LSO cellos. He joined two newly founded string quartets as cellist: the Kutcher Quartet, led by his former fellow student at Trinity, Samuel Kutcher, and the Music Society Quartet (later called the International Quartet) led by André Mangeot. He also made several early broadcasts with Mangeot's quartet.

There are multiple elements and expressions within the sentence that evoke a negative tone or attitude. Firstly, the phrase \\"our culture is headed down the toilet\\" suggests that the speaker believes that the society and its values are deteriorating or on a downward trajectory. This idea is further emphasized by the comparison to a \\"frozen burrito after an all-night tequila bender\\"—an image that brings to mind chaos, disorder, and decay. Secondly, the mention of an \\"all-night tequila bender\\" implies a sense of recklessness and irresponsibility. By associating this with the decline of the culture, the speaker is implying that there is little control or concern for the direction in which society is headed. Lastly, the reference to \\"Jackass: The Movie\\" as evidence to support the speaker's claim suggests that the speaker views the film as emblematic of the undesirable aspects of the contemporary culture. Therefore, by connecting the movie to the decline of society, the speaker displays a negative sentiment towards both the film and the current state of culture. In conclusion, the sentiment of the sentence is negative, as it portrays a grim outlook on society's direction and values, while also expressing disapproval and disappointment with influential cultural products like \\"Jackass: The Movie.\\""},{"instruction":"Article: If you need to stock up on food, food vendors are the places to go. There are lots of different styles and specialty stores, and some may be more appropriate for you, given what it is you're looking for. You probably shouldn't go looking for sushi-grade salmon at Walmart, and you probably shouldn't expect to find super-cheap saltines at the Natural Food Co-Op. Learn what different places specialize in and shop for different foods at the right place. Chain groceries and box stores like Safeway, Kroger, Sainsbury's, and Woolworth's, Tesco, New World, etc specialize in affordable perishable and nonperishable food. Box stores like Walmart, Meijer, Target, and other chains also have grocery sections that are expansive and usually cheap. These are good places to visit for name-brand goods and find deals. Natural groceries and specialty vendors may be the best place to visit for local produce, fresh vegetables, and raw ingredients, but they tend to be more expensive than chain stores. You're paying for quality. Food cooperatives are common in some places, allowing you to buy in to a partial ownership of the store and decide what should be stocked. If required, check out bulk suppliers - these used to be called Cash and Carry. You may need to buy a membership card, but you could save money if you need to buy food in bulk. Corner stores, convenience stores, dairies and local shops are good places for prepared food, snacks, and alcohol, but not great places to find fresh vegetables or fruits unless you have no other option. Grocery outlets supply overstocked off-brand food that can be purchased for much cheaper than at regular grocery stores. Amelia's and ALDI are common examples of this, offering a somewhat limited variety of fresh and non-perishable foods for much cheaper than at the bigger stores. You don't have the same variety, so it's not the place to go looking for super-specific ingredients, but it's a good place to find staples, like cooking oil, sugar, or vinegar. It's also a good place for things like snack crackers, bread, and other off-brand goods. By far where practical, the best place to find quality produce where you live is to find out about local farmers' markets. Typically held on weekends, farmers' markets combine a festival-like atmosphere with outdoor stalls and extremely fresh produce. Depending on the climate, this might only happen during the harvest season, but some markets go year-round in certain climates. These are excellent places to get fresh fruits, organic vegetables, and local meat raised in a humane way. Markets also give you a chance to see and interact with the people who grow, prepare, and sell your food. It's a lot more personal than buying cookies at the corner store. Markets are also a good place to find out about Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) in your area, if applicable. Many booths may offer CSA packages, which allow you to buy into the farm, essentially paying an up-front or a monthly price for a package of fresh vegetables that you can pick up or have delivered. Like anything, it's also possible to buy certain specialty ingredients online and have it delivered. This can be an excellent choice if you live somewhere very remote and struggle to find access to certain ingredients or fresh supplies in your area. Everything from organic gummy bears to bulk bags of caraway seeds and jasmine rice can be had for decent prices online. Coffee co-ops are very popular online options, letting you buy in and \\"subscribe\\" to a coffee club that will deliver high-quality whole beans directly to your door. If you're a coffee-food eater, it's a no-brainer. Citrus delivery doesn't have to be reserved for Christmas-time. Since citrus can only grow in limited climates, having high-quality oranges, grapefruits, lemons and limes delivered straight to your door is another great option if this happens where you live. Increasingly, stores are charging for the use of plastic or paper bags, making it much more cost-effective to buy one and take it with you when food shopping. It's also cutting down a lot on waste to get rid of those 20 useless plastic bags that come home with you every time you head to the store. Invest in five or six good quality tote-bags and keep them in your car, or near the front door so you'll remember them when you head to the store. o to a restaurant. Sometimes, you just don't feel like cooking. While it's usually more cost-effective to cook meals at home and get more bang for your buck, if you're solo it can be a whole lot easier buy food buy going out for a sandwich than to buy a bunch of ingredients to cook at home. One always-easy way of buying food is to buy it already made at the restaurant. What is a summary?","output":"Alright kiddo, this article is about different places where you can buy food. Like big stores with lots of choices, small stores for quick snacks, and farmers' markets with fresh stuff from local farms. It also talks about buying food online if you can't find certain things where you live, and it reminds us to use reusable bags when shopping to help the environment.

Production designers have a key creative role in the creation of motion pictures and television. Working directly with the director, cinematographer and producer, they must select the settings and style to visually tell the story. The term \\"production designer\\" was coined by William Cameron Menzies while he was working on the film \\"Gone with the Wind\\". Previously (and often subsequently) the people with the same responsibilities were called \\"art directors\\". - George Clarke Jenkins ( November 19 , 1908 -- April 6 , 2007 ) was an American production designer . Born in Baltimore , Maryland , he studied architecture at University of Pennsylvania before leaving to build sets . One Tony nomination was for his set for the 1959 Broadway drama The Miracle Worker . He shared his Academy Award with George Gaines for the 1976 film All the President 's Men . He later taught at University of California , Los Angeles . Jenkins died at his home in Santa Monica , California . - William Cameron Menzies (July 29, 1896 March 5, 1957) was an American film production designer (a job title he invented) and art director who also worked as a director, producer, and screenwriter during a career spanning five decades. He earned acclaim for his work in silent film, and later pioneered the use of color in film for dramatic effect.

What is the answer?","output":"The Latin term \\"Tabula Rasa\\" translates literally to \\"blank slate\\" or \\"erased tablet\\" in English. This term, which has been adopted by various philosophical concepts and theories, refers to the idea that human beings are born with minds that are essentially \\"empty\\" or devoid of any innate ideas or knowledge. Instead, proponents of this notion argue that all knowledge, beliefs, values, and personality traits are acquired and developed through individual experiences, societal conditioning, and sensory inputs as people grow and interact with their environment. The concept of \\"tabula rasa\\" can be traced back to the work of ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle, who believed that the mind began as a blank sheet that would then be filled with knowledge as a person acquired experiences. Despite its ancient origins, the concept has persisted through the centuries and has been adopted, adapted, and debated by various philosophers and thinkers. John Locke, a 17th-century English philosopher, expanded on the concept of \\"tabula rasa\\" in his influential work \\"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding.\\" According to Locke, human beings are born without any innate ideas or knowledge, and all of our mental content comes from two primary sources: sensation, through which we acquire information about our external environment, and reflection, which involves the processing and interpretation of the information obtained through sensation. The \\"tabula rasa\\" concept has been utilized and challenged by various schools of thought over time. For instance, proponents of empiricism, which emphasizes the role of experience in shaping knowledge, tend to support the idea of the mind as a \\"blank slate.\\" In contrast, those who advocate for the existence of innate ideas, such as the rationalists, argue against \\"tabula rasa\\" and maintain that certain ideas or knowledge are inherent to human beings. In the field of psychology, the \\"tabula rasa\\" notion has influenced the development of behaviorism, which highlights the importance of learning, conditioning, and environmental factors in shaping human behavior. However, advancements in cognitive and neuroscience research have shed light on the complex interplay between genetic predispositions, brain structure, and environmental influences in the development of human cognition and behavior, suggesting the need for a more nuanced perspective that goes beyond the \\"blank slate\\" metaphor. In summary, the Latin term \\"tabula rasa\\" translates literally to \\"blank slate\\" or \\"erased tablet,\\" and it refers to the philosophical concept that humans are born with empty minds that acquire knowledge, beliefs, and traits through experiences and interactions with their environment. This idea has been the subject of extensive debate throughout history and continues to be an important issue in various fields, including philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science."},{"instruction":"Answer this question: what is the richest company in south africa??","output":"To find the answer to this question, I will take the following steps: 1.

Context: I had this one guy, who enjoyed being a part time bully and part time neutral to me. To say the least he was annoying. He'd take the liberty to hide my backpack, borrow my books without consent, doodle scandalous stuff on my notebooks with a pen and yada yada. So one day, I was showing this cool trick I learned on an anatomy program on the TV to a couple of classmates who used to sit around me. The thing was that you can't flex your ring finger upwards if you put your middle finger under the palm (try that) We were all kids, and soon everyone in the class started staring at us weirdos looking laughing at out hands. The bully noticed it too, and came near to inquire about this hand stuff. I described the trick and he was impressed. And then, I saw our teacher walking up the corridor, just a couple paces behind the class door. So, I asked him (the bully) if he wanted to see another trick and to that he nodded a big yes. Cool, What I did was, that I grabbed his right arm by the thumb and put it on my throat right above the larynx. Then I quickly shifted my grip to his wrist. He without batting an eye, asked what I was doing, but then I started beating the desk with my other hand and made squeaking noises while pushing his hand against my throat harder with every turning head. And voilà! Every one in the class (including the teacher) thought he was smothering me. After a few ifs and buts between him and the teacher, he was summoned at the principal’s chambers, from where, later he was sent home, where presumably judging from the look on his face for the next few days, he was beat to crap by his folks.

This is to be healthier and to be more environmentally friendly. They don't give up meat completely, but eat good quality meat less often. Founder Brian Kateman believes people will follow diet as it's not radical. 'Eating less meat is easy, healthy and good for the environment', he says. Article:","output":"Title: Embracing Reducetarianism: A Trail towards Health and Environmental Sustainability The burgeoning Reducetarian Movement is drawing vast attention offering a realistic approach towards a healthier lifestyle and a more sustainable Earth. Reducetarians commit to consciously reduce their consumption of meat, seafood, and dairy products without eliminating these food items entirely. Their mission is anchored in two primary objectives, enhancing individual health and promoting environmental sustainability. Unlike the stringent plant-based diet alternatives, the reducetarian approach allows for a more accessible and feasible transition, which according to its founder Brian Kateman, will attract a larger demographic of followers. Reduce to Enhance: The Health Perspective A well-implemented reducetarian diet can have profound health benefits. By limiting the intake of meat, seafood, and dairy, it helps reduce the exposure to harmful saturated fats and cholesterol found in animal products, which are associated with diseases such as heart disease, stroke, and certain forms of cancer. Additionally, a diet that is high in plant-based foods - such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts and seeds - promotes a healthier cardiovascular system and supports weight management, reducing risks associated with obesity and diabetes. However, it is crucial to note that reducetarians do not completely exclude meat from their diets. The philosophy is to minimize, not eliminate, underpinning the importance of balance. High-quality meat is still on the menu, but the emphasis is on consuming it less frequently. With this approach, one can still enjoy the benefits of proteins, vitamins, and other essential nutrients found in meat, but with a reduced risk of health complications. Minimize to Sustain: The Environmental Angle Beyond the health implications, the reducetarian movement presents a strong case on the environmental front. The production of animal-based food items—particularly beef, seafood, and dairy—is taxing to the environment, demanding exorbitant amounts of water, land, and energy. It also significantly contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, a leading factor in climate change. By choosing to be a reducetarian, one commits to relieving some of this planetary burden, transitioning toward a more sustainable diet and lifestyle. While going vegan or vegetarian can indeed have a more significant environmental impact, not everyone is ready or willing to make such an extreme dietary commitment. This is where the reducetarian approach comes into play—it's about progress, not perfection. Reducing meat, seafood, and dairy consumption should not be seen as an absolute, but as an accessible goal that anyone can work towards, bringing collective benefits to the planet. As Brian Kateman, the cofounder of the Reducetarian Foundation, aptly puts it, \\"Eating less meat is easy, healthy, and good for the environment.\\" This statement underscores the reducetarian belief that responsible consumption doesn't need to be a radical, inaccessible lifestyle change. It can be as simple as eating less meat and more plant-based foods—a subtle shift with monumental benefits to both personal health and environmental sustainability. In conclusion, the reducetarian movement signifies an important shift in how we conceptualize diet and its broader impacts. It encourages individuals to take manageable steps toward better health and a more sustainable world, making it a viable alternative for those reluctant to completely eliminate animal products from their diets. Reducing rather than eliminating allows the everyday citizen to make a significant difference in their lives and indeed, in the world. As more people become conscious of their dietary choices, reducetarianism might just be the bridge we need towards a more inclusive and sustainable approach to eating."},{"instruction":"Add punctuation: The purpose of the agreement is to ensure collection and recycling of used tyres in Denmark Landfilling is avoided and resource recovery ensured whereby material recovery is prioritised to energy recovery","output":"The purpose of the agreement is to ensure collection and recycling of used tires in Denmark.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the food was plentiful happens, how will it affect LESS mold forming on bread. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"A: If food was plentiful, it could potentially have an indirect effect on the amount of mold forming on bread. When there is an abundance of food, people may consume food more quickly, leaving less opportunity for mold to develop on the bread. The rate at which the bread is consumed could outpace the growth of mold, thus leading to less mold formation overall. Additionally, if food is plentiful, proper storage and management practices may be implemented, such as using airtight containers or refrigeration, which can slow or inhibit mold growth. This further reduces the chances for mold to form on the bread. However, the process of mold growth itself will likely not be directly affected by the presence of plentiful food. If the mold spore lands on the bread, it will still grow hyphae into the bread and follow the mold growth process outlined in the initial question.

Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"No, the two questions do not have the same meaning. To help you understand the distinction and provide the necessary information, let me answer each question separately: How can I become a Scientologist? Becoming a Scientologist involves a few main steps: 1. Research and familiarize yourself with the beliefs and practices of Scientology. Start by reading books written by its founder, L. Ron Hubbard, such as \\"Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health\\" and \\"The Scientology Handbook.\\" You can also visit the official Scientology website (www.scientology.org) for further information on its core beliefs and practices. Additionally, there are many online forums, blogs, and social media platforms where you can engage in discussions to learn more about the religion from its followers. 2. Visit your local Church of Scientology or affiliated center. The Church of Scientology has numerous locations worldwide. Use their online directory to find the closest one to you. Attend a Sunday service or a free introductory seminar. This will provide you with firsthand experience of the Scientology courses, auditing (counseling), and the church environment. 3. Participate in Scientology courses and self-improvement programs. These courses are designed to help you understand the philosophy and apply its principles to your life. As you progress through the courses, you'll become more familiar with the concepts and methods used in Scientology. 4. Undergo auditing (counseling) sessions. Auditing is an essential component of Scientology, aimed at helping individuals recall past traumas and improve their mental and spiritual well-being. You'll work with an auditor, a trained Scientology practitioner, to address your past experiences and achieve personal growth. 5. Join the Church officially. After completing the foundational courses and participating in auditing sessions, if you wish to become an active member, you can officially join the Church of Scientology. This may involve signing a membership form and indicating your commitment to the principles and practices of Scientology. 6. Continue to study Scientology materials and engage in spiritual practices as you progress in your newfound faith. This lifelong learning and personal growth will help you deepen your understanding of Scientology beliefs, apply them practically in your daily life, and share them with others. Who is a Scientologist? A Scientologist is someone who practices Scientology, a religious system and philosophy developed by L. Ron Hubbard in the early 1950s. Scientologists believe in the principles of Dianetics, which focus on the idea that humans are essentially spiritual beings called \\"Thetans\\" who have lived through many past lives. Scientologists follow the teachings of L. Ron Hubbard by seeking self-improvement, spiritual growth, and personal enlightenment through various Scientology practices, such as auditing (counseling), courses on communication, interpersonal relationships, and life skills. They believe that through these practices, they can achieve increased self-awareness, spiritual well-being, and a higher state of consciousness. A Scientologist might come from any racial, cultural, or socioeconomic background, as Scientology has a worldwide membership with millions of adherents. Some Scientologists may hold positions within the hierarchical structures of the Church of Scientology, while others are simply members who adhere to the teachings and practices of the faith. The shared element among all Scientologists is their belief in the basic tenets of Scientology and their commitment to personal improvement through its practices."},{"instruction":"next question: You might head to the locker room after getting a green drink here.

The mention of a \\"green drink\\" refers to smoothies or juices made with healthy ingredients (such as vegetables, fruits, and superfoods) that are typically found in health clubs. The other options do not fit the context as closely as a health club does. - Jocks: This term refers to sports enthusiasts or athletes, not a specific location where one might get a green drink. - Fitness centre: Similar to a health club, but may not necessarily offer refreshments like a green drink. - Stadium: A large venue for sports events and concerts, but not specifically focused on fitness or wellness. - Gymnasium: An indoor place where sports are played, often part of a school or community center, and might not have a place that provides green drinks."},{"instruction":"Read the article and select the best answer.
