Before they can begin hunting, which the son does not want to do anyway, they are killed by flying jellyfish-like creatures, which penetrate their skin with needle-tipped tentacles. Some time later, four teenagers, Tom, Greg, Beth and Sandy, hike in the same area, ignoring the warnings of local truck stop owner Joe Taylor (Jack Palance). A group of Cub Scouts is also in the area; their leader (Larry Storch) is also killed by the alien creatures, while his troop runs into an unidentified humanoid and flee. The teenagers set up camp at a lake, but after a few hours, Tom and Beth disappear. Sandy and Greg go looking for them and discover their bodies in an abandoned shack. They drive away in their van, while being attacked by one of the starfish which tries to get through the car's windshield. After they get rid of it, they arrive at the truck stop. Greg tries to get help from the locals, but they do not believe him, except for Fred 'Sarge' Dobbs (Martin Landau), who is a mentally ill veteran. Meanwhile, Sandy encounters the humanoid and flees into the woods, where Joe Taylor finds and returns her to Greg. While they discuss the situation, the sheriff arrives, but Sarge shoots him and begins to become more paranoid. Greg and Sandy leave with Taylor, who reveals he has been attacked by the humanoid before and secretly keeps the flying jellyfish as trophies. They search for the shack and once there, Taylor goes inside to only find the bodies of Tom, Beth and the cub scout leader. They discuss waiting for the creature when Taylor is attacked by another \\"jellyfish\\". The young people run once again, leaving him behind as ordered. They stop a police car and get into the back seat, but find Sarge driving. He abducts them, believing them to be aliens.

Write a title: New York - The Web portal Lycos Europe on Friday terminated a spam-fighting campaign that had been criticized as a breach of Internet civility.","output":"Title: \\"The End of Lycos Europe's Controversial Anti-Spam Crusade: Balancing Technology and Internet Etiquette\\" Introduction: Over the years, the increasing levels of spam have become a major concern for internet users around the world. As technology continues to advance, it has become crucial for companies and organizations to find ways to combat the growing issue that threatens the effectiveness and integrity of email communication. In an attempt to address this challenge, Lycos Europe launched an aggressive anti-spam campaign that quickly became enveloped in controversy. Eventually, the online portal decided to end the operation amid accusations of breaching the boundaries of internet civility. The Lycos Europe Anti-Spam Campaign: Launched in the early 2000s, Lycos Europe's ambitious anti-spam campaign aimed to fight spam by targeting the sources of the unwanted messages. To accomplish this, they developed a screen saver named \\"Make Love Not Spam,\\" which, when run by users, would repeatedly send requests for access to known spammers' servers. The objective was to generate a tremendous amount of traffic on these servers and ultimately overwhelm them, rendering them unable to continue their spamming operations. The Backlash and Criticism: While the intentions of Lycos Europe's campaign may have been noble, their methods drew heavy criticism from various sectors of the online community. Many internet users were concerned about the ethics of fighting spam with seemingly hostile actions, as it raised questions about online vigilante justice and the potential for damaging unintended targets. Furthermore, critics argued that the campaign violated the principles of internet civility by encouraging large-scale Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which are generally regarded as unethical and illegal in most countries. The Termination of the Campaign: As the anti-spam campaign continued, pressure from critics led Lycos Europe to reconsider their approach. The company ultimately decided to terminate the crusade in the pursuit of a more balanced and ethical method of combating spam. In a statement to the public, Lycos Europe acknowledged the concerns of the online community and expressed their commitment to promoting internet civility while continuing their fight against spam. The Aftermath and Lessons Learned: The story of Lycos Europe's terminated anti-spam campaign offers a valuable lesson about the significance of maintaining ethical boundaries when fighting online issues. Although spam remains a pressing concern that requires technological innovation, the case demonstrates the importance of avoiding extreme measures that may infringe on the principles of internet civility. The termination of the campaign serves as a reminder that responsible companies should strive to develop solutions that respect the rules of the online community and promote responsible digital citizenship. Conclusion: The controversy surrounding the Lycos Europe anti-spam campaign highlights the challenges that the modern-day internet faces in balancing effective spam-fighting techniques and upholding the principles of civility and acceptable conduct. While the technology-driven initiative met a swift end, it leaves behind an important message that in the world of the internet, ethical considerations must be prioritized in the battle against spam."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

I taught the kitten the way Pa taught me: I threw him into water where he could not stand, and I watched, ready to grab him if he went under. Tiger did not thrash desperately like me. He merely paddled urgently for the edge of the plastic pool with his head high and his thin legs churning. Little Bit said, \\"Dog paddle,\\" and we all laughed. \\"Tiger paddle,\\" I said, and we all laughed some more, even Jordy. That was probably when Ma noticed the kitten swimming lessons and stopped them. Our swimming lessons happened in two places. When Pa took us, we went to Hawkins Springs behind Mrs. DeLyons' Fountain of Youth Motor Hotel. When Ma took us, we drove to Mermaid Springs State Park, where we would sometimes meet Mr. Drake. I liked Mermaid Springs better because I felt safe there. Ma could not swim, so she never made me jump off a dock into deep water, and she always insisted that I wear an orange styrofoam cylinder on my back like a skindiver or spaceman. Ma usually sat on a towel on the grass near the beach, reading a magazine or a book while tanning her legs. Every now and then she would call to us not to go too far or not to splash each other. When she wore her one-piece red swimming suit, she would come in up to her waist, then lower herself to her shoulders, being careful not to get her hair wet. On the rarest occasions, she would wear a swimming cap and float on her back in the shallow water. Often she stayed in her shorts and shirt, adding sunglasses and removing shoes as her concession to summer and the beach. Question: Where did Pa take them for lessons?

Given the question: Article: Surprisingly, no one knows how many children receive education in English hospitals, still less the content or quality of that education. Proper records are just not kept. We know that more than 850,000 children go through hospital each year, and that every child of school age has a legal right to continue to receive education while in hospital. We also know there is only one hospital teacher to every 1,000 children in hospital. Little wonder the latest survey concludes that the extent and type of hospital teaching available differ a great deal across the country. It is found that half the hospitals in England which admit children have no teacher. A further quarter have only a part-time teacher. The special children's hospitals in major cities do best; general hospitals in the country and holiday areas are worst off. From this survey, one can estimate that fewer than one in five children have some contact with a hospital teacher--and that contact may be as little as two hours a day. Most children interviewed were surprised to find a teacher in hospital at all. They had not been prepared for it by parents or their own school. If there was a teacher they were much more likely to read books and do math or number work; without a teacher they would only play games. Reasons for hospital teaching range from preventing a child falling behind and maintaining the habit of school to keeping a child occupied, and the latter is often all the teacher can do. The position and influence of many teachers was summed up when parents referred to them as \\"the library lady\\" or just \\"the helper\\". Children tend to rely on concerned school friends to keep in touch with school work. Several parents spoke of requests for work being ignored or refused by the school. Once back at school children rarely get extra teaching, and are told to catch up as best they can. Many short-stay child-patients catch up quickly. But schools do very little to ease the anxiety about falling behind expressed by many of the children interviewed. Question: Which of the following statements is true? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Not enough is known about hospital teaching.\\"? The answer is:","output":"Yes, \\"Not enough is known about hospital teaching.\\" is a true statement.

Mr Vineer, who now walks with crutches, was in Craigavon court supported by his family. Speaking afterwards, he said he was pleased and relieved. His mother, Helen-Louise, said: \\"The night they found him, they told us they expected him to die, and when he survived for 24 hours, they thought he would be in a vegetative state for the rest of his life - so he has proved them wrong, and that's my boy.\\" She said the attack on her teenage son had left him with brain damage. \\"He has tremors in his left arm, and being left-handed that causes him problems,\\" she said. \\"His balance has been affected, his short-term memory has been affected and his speech can be quite slurred at times.\\" Scott Vineer also revealed that he was now preparing for a different challenge, that of being best man at his mother and step-father's wedding in August. \\"I'll have to write a speech and all.

He was found close to the towpath on Laganbank Road with severe brain and head injuries, having been beaten and left unconscious behind a disused warehouse. The attack left Scott in a coma for three months, and he returned home six months after the incident. As a result of the assault, Scott now has brain damage, tremors in his left arm, issues with balance, short-term memory problems, and at times experiences slurred speech. Ryan Craig, from Ashmount Gardens, Lisburn, was initially set to go on trial for attempted murder in relation to the attack. However, he pleaded guilty to a lesser charge, leading to the crown deciding not to proceed with the trial. Scott, now walking with crutches, was present in court with the support of his family and expressed relief and satisfaction with the outcome. Scott's mother, Helen-Louise, reflected on the doctors' initial prognosis that her son was expected to die or remain in a vegetative state for the rest of his life, emphasizing that he has proved them wrong. She commented on the impact the attack has had on her son's life, including the challenges he faces due to the lasting effects of his injuries. Despite the ongoing struggle, Scott is preparing for the positive challenge of being the best man at his mother and step-father's wedding in August. He recognizes that delivering a speech will be nerve-wracking but believes he will overcome it.

You might need to use additional knowledge to answer the question. He repeatedly calls on his followers to embrace martyrdom since \\"The walls of oppression and humiliation cannot be demolished except in a rain of bullets.\\" For those yearning for a lost sense of order in an older, more tranquil world, he offers his \\"Caliphate\\" as an imagined alternative to today's uncertainty. For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world.  Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction.  Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith. Many Americans have wondered, \\"Why do 'they' hate us?\\" Some also ask, \\"What can we do to stop these attacks?\\"  Bin Laden and al Qaeda have given answers to both these questions.  After reading the above, is \\"Jahiliyya\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Who calls on his followers to embrace martyrdom since \\"The walls of oppression and humiliation cannot be demolished except in a rain of bullets.\\"?\\"? Pick your answer from: [-] no. [-] yes.","output":"[-] no. \\"Jahiliyya\\" is not the correct answer to the question \\"Who calls on his followers to embrace martyrdom since 'The walls of oppression and humiliation cannot be demolished except in a rain of bullets.'\\"? Jahiliyya refers to a period of ignorance before the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed, as described by Sayyid Qutb in his writings. The correct answer would be Osama bin Laden, as he is the one mentioned in the text as calling on his followers to embrace martyrdom. The other option, \\"yes,\\" is incorrect because Jahiliyya is not an individual, but rather a term used by Qutb to describe a condition or period that he saw as the antithesis of Islam."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Alvaro Negredo has been named in Valencia's squad for the first time since  breaking his foot before his loan move from Manchester City. The Spanish forward could now make his long-awaited debut for the club against regional rival Elche at Mestalla Stadium on Saturday. 29-year-old Negredo scored 23 goals in 48 games as Manchester City won the Premier League and Capital One Cup last season. Alvaro Negredo poses during his unveiling as a Valencia player last month The Spanish forward has not played for Valencia after breaking his foot in a pre-season game in July But the former Sevilla man has been sidelined since breaking his right foot in one of City's pre-season games in July.

This move offers the Spanish striker an opportunity to showcase his skills and regain his form after the unfortunate foot injury. Valencia's decision to include this purchase clause in the loan agreement signals their confidence in Negredo's ability to make a significant impact on the team's performance. The loan agreement with Manchester City allows Valencia to assess Negredo's progress during his time at the club and make an informed decision on the obligatory purchase clause. This is a mutually beneficial arrangement for both clubs, as Manchester City can continue to monitor Negredo's progress while Valencia benefits from the striker's talent and experience. Negredo's previous success in La Liga, primarily with Sevilla, and his impressive stint at Manchester City have demonstrated his ability to perform at the highest level. Valencia's faith in Negredo stems from his proven goal-scoring record and ability to link up well with teammates in the final third. The upcoming match against regional rival Elche is the perfect opportunity for Negredo to make his long-awaited debut and begin acclimatizing with his new teammates at Mestalla Stadium. The passionate atmosphere at the stadium is likely to motivate Negredo to perform well and win over the Valencia faithful. In conclusion, the most logical way to complete the passage is to state that Alvaro Negredo is currently at Valencia on a one-year loan deal that includes an obligatory purchase clause at the end of the deal. This arrangement benefits both clubs involved and provides Negredo with an opportunity to get back to top form after recovering from his foot injury. Valencia's fans will eagerly await the debut of their new forward and hope that his addition to the team will translate into success on the pitch."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I chose a transparent lemon yellow gloss with tiny flecks of iridescent glitter in, and over the following months I treated myself to several other Juicy Tube variants including a shimmery nude gloss called Pamplemousse which I wore on nights out for years (incidentally Pamplemousse is still going!). Fast forward several (ahem…) years and Juicy Tubes are still going strong, but there’s a new member of the Juicy family vying for attention – the Juicy Shaker.*. Another lip product, this one is a nourishing tinted lip oil which acts a bit like a gloss, and I was sent two of the new shades to try out – Piece of Cake and Show Me The Honey. Juicy Shakers are a bi-phase nourishing lip oil, when the product is allowed to settle the pigment falls to the bottom and the oil rises to the top, giving a split effect. Then you need to shake the bottle to mix the two layers together, giving the product it’s name. The ingredients include sweet almond oil, omega 3 and cranberry oil and really help care for your lips unlike most other glosses. Show Me The Honey is a nude coral shade, it looks rather orange and scary in the bottle but in reality it’s much more of a gentle shade. Piece of Cake is a damson pink, and again looks much darker in the bottle.

And the answer is...","output":"To solve the equation -5*h - 5 = 5 for h, follow these steps: Step 1: Isolate the term with the variable h First, we need to isolate the term that includes the variable h on one side of the equation. In this case, we will begin by adding 5 to both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term on the left side: -5*h - 5 + 5 = 5 + 5 This simplifies to: -5*h = 10 Step 2: Solve for h Now that we have isolated the term with h, we can solve for the value of h by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of h which is -5: -5*h / (-5) = 10 / (-5) This simplifies to: h = -2 So the solution to the equation -5*h - 5 = 5 is h = -2."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Paragraph :  The farther you stretch the band, the greater the resistance is. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Jim would feel more resistance stretching the rubber band to 40 cm compared to 30 cm. The reason for this is that the resistance increases with the distance the rubber band is stretched. In this case, 40 cm is farther than 30 cm, which means there will be greater resistance when the rubber band is stretched to 40 cm. The elasticity of the rubber band creates tension as it is stretched, and this tension leads to an increased resistance against further stretching. Therefore, Jim would experience a higher resistance when stretching the rubber band to 40 cm rather than 30 cm."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given the question: Information:  - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history.  - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II.  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - Fort Eben-Emael is an inactive Belgian fortress located between Liège and Maastricht, on the Belgian-Dutch border, near the Albert Canal. It was designed to defend Belgium from a German attack across the narrow belt of Dutch territory in the region. Constructed in 19311935, it was reputed to be impregnable and at the time, the largest in the world. The fort was neutralized by glider-borne German troops (85 men) on 10 May 1940 during the Second World War. The action cleared the way for German ground forces to enter Belgium, unhindered by fire from Eben-Emael. Still the property of the Belgian Army, the fort has been preserved and may be visited.  - The Battle of Maastricht was one of the first battles that took place during the German Campaign on the Western Front during World War II. Maastricht was a key city in order to capture the Belgian Fort Eben - Emael and split the allied armies in half .  - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany.    After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'battle of maastricht' with the relationship of 'point in time'.

Canadian media scholar Harold Innis had the theory that people use different types of media to communicate and which one they choose to use will offer different possibilities for the shape and durability of society (Wark, McKenzie 1997). His famous example of this is using ancient Egypt and looking at the ways they built themselves out of media with very different properties stone and papyrus. Papyrus is what he called 'Space Binding'. it made possible the transmission of written orders across space, empires and enables the waging of distant military campaigns and colonial administration. The other is stone and 'Time Binding', through the construction of temples and the pyramids can sustain their authority generation to generation, through this media they can change and shape communication in their society (Wark, McKenzie 1997). What ancient civilization did Harold Innis use as an example of his theory?","output":"Harold Innis, the Canadian media scholar, used the ancient civilization of Egypt as an example to demonstrate his theory of coregulation. His theory posits that the choice of media used for communication profoundly influences the shape and longevity of a society.  Innis carefully analyzed how different types of media - 'space-binding' and 'time-binding' - were used in ancient Egypt and how they fostered different modes of communication, organization, and control, which in turn affected the overall structure and function of the society. 'Space-binding' was exemplified by the use of papyrus in ancient Egypt. This lightweight, portable media made it possible to transmit written orders across vast distances, thereby enabling centralized control over remote territories. With papyrus, the Egyptian civilization could conduct military campaigns and administer colonies that were geographically distant. By facilitating communication across space, papyrus essentially allowed the Egyptian empire to expand its political and economic influence. In contrast, 'time-binding' media, as demonstrated by the use of stone, allowed the Egyptian authority to persist over prolonged periods. Monuments such as temples and pyramids were built of stone, a durable material that withstands the test of time. These stone structures served not just as architectural marvels but also as media for communicating authority, culture, and laws. They stood as enduring symbols of power, helping successive generations recollect and respect their rulers and gods, aligning them with the societal norms and expectations. In other words, the wisdom, commandments, and narratives of the society were imprinted on these stone structures, making authority and tradition persist over time. These artifacts essentially enabled society to transmit cultural values and societal structures across generations. Thus, Innis' theory showcases how the selection of media - be it papyrus aiding communication over space, or stone facilitating communication over time - can affect societal norms, power structures, and even the perpetuity of the civilization. The Egyptian civilization, with its innovative use of both 'space-binding' and 'time-binding' media, stands as a classic example of this theory."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: Two women sitting on a deck. Hypothesis: the women are enjoying a summer day .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","output":"While the hypothesis that the two women are enjoying a summer day may be a possible interpretation of the premise, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. The premise only states that two women are sitting on a deck, but it does not provide sufficient information about the context, situation, or emotions of the individuals to ascertain if the hypothesis is true.  Let's break down the hypothesis and premise in detail: Premise: 1. There are two women. 2. These women are sitting on a deck. Hypothesis: 1. The women are enjoying their time. 2. It is a summer day. In order to validate the hypothesis, we need more information or further evidence to corroborate its components. For example, if we knew that the weather was warm and sunny, this would provide support for the notion that it is a summer day. Additionally, if the two women were observed laughing, talking happily, or engaging in leisure activities, this would lend credence to the idea that they are enjoying themselves. There are multiple alternative scenarios that could also fit the premise. The women could be sitting on the deck during a different season, such as spring or autumn, and merely happen to be outside. They could be discussing serious matters or feeling upset, in which case they would not be enjoying their time. Alternatively, they may just be outside to get some fresh air, with neither enjoyment nor discontentment as a driving factor. In conclusion, while the hypothesis that the two women are enjoying a summer day could very well be true, there is not enough evidence provided by the premise alone to definitively confirm it. More context, detail, or observational points are necessary to determine the validity of the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Read this article and answer this question The Patriots travelled to the Metrodome for a Monday Night Football showdown with the Minnesota Vikings, who, like the Patriots, boasted an excellent run defense. The Patriots, who took to the air with a spread offense for the entire game, opened with a seven-play, 86-yard strike that ended with a touchdown pass from Brady to wide receiver Reche Caldwell. Their next drive was for 93 yards which resulted in a 23-yard Gostkowski field goal. And just before halftime the Patriots moved 74 yards in 11 plays to take a 17-0 lead on a nine-yard scoring toss to tight end Benjamin Watson. The only Vikings score of the game came on a 71-yard punt return by Mewelde Moore in the third quarter; Laurence Maroney immediately answered on the ensuing kickoff, with a 77-yard return to Minnesota's 21-yard line, his second return of over 70 yards in as many weeks. The Patriots' lead grew to 17 after a seven-yard touchdown reception by Brown with 9:03 in the third quarter and then became 31-7 with a touchdown catch by Jackson. The Patriots defense also intercepted four passes from quarterbacks Brad Johnson and Brooks Bollinger. On Bollinger's first drive after relieving Brad Johnson he was sacked three times in a row for a net loss of 23 yards. With their fourth straight victory, the Patriots advanced to 6-1.This was the Patriots' third and final game played in the Metrodome.

ACTION2: Wanting a larger room instead of my brother. - This action expresses a personal preference or desire. - The reasoning behind this preference might affect the ethical judgment (e.g. selfishness or entitlement, or maybe because of a valid need for more space?).

The language used (\\"Dumb\\") and the fact that the user cannot access or use a specific feature (cybertron) suggest a negative experience. Considering the traditional rating scale of ★ to ★★★★★, where ★ is the lowest possible rating and ★★★★★ is the highest, I would infer that the reviewer would most likely give this product or service a low rating. There is no explicit mention of a specific number of stars, but the overall sentiment points towards a low rating. Taking all these factors into account, in order to provide a detailed and long answer, let's analyze the review and break it down further: 1. The user uses the word \\"Dumb,\\" which implies frustration and dissatisfaction. This sentiment suggests that the user would give a low rating. 2. The user is unable to utilize the \\"cybertron\\" feature, which seems to play a role in their overall dissatisfaction. If the feature is essential to the product or service, the user's inability to access it would further lower the rating. 3. The review does not provide more context about other aspects of the product or service that they might have liked or appreciated; therefore, there is no reason to believe that the user would give a higher rating based on other factors. In conclusion, while it's impossible to pinpoint the exact ★-rating this user would give based solely on the review provided, we can reasonably deduce that it would likely be a low rating, leaning towards a ★ or ★★. The combination of the expressed dissatisfaction, lack of access to an essential feature, and absence of any positive comments supports this determination."},{"instruction":"Combine facts and answer this: Holston River joins up at Knoxville with which river that begins in Transylvania County, North Carolina?

Write a text based on this summary: opposition lashes out at gov t over chunghwa telecom strike plan Text:","output":"Title: Opposition Resolutely Condemns Government's Handling of Chunghwa Telecom Strike Plan The opposition has vehemently criticized the government's approach towards the Chunghwa Telecom workers' impending strike plan, with key figures highlighting the necessity for an immediate resolution to the problems surrounding the employees' rights and labor conditions. By allowing the workers' grievances to go unaddressed for an extended period, the government finds itself in the middle of significant social and political turmoil. Chunghwa Telecom, the leading telecommunications company in the nation, plays an essential role in maintaining and providing a stable communication infrastructure for millions of individuals. Recent events, however, have caused a deep divide amongst its employees, with the announcement of a potentially large-scale strike drawing more attention than ever before. The strike, as planned, stands to disrupt activities significantly, affecting customers nationwide. The opposition has been quick to question the government's decision-making processes concerning the growing unrest within Chunghwa Telecom. It specifically points towards a lack of action or intervention effort to address the workers' demands. According to the opposition, the government's failure to initiate appropriate dialogues, negotiate with stakeholders, or take prompt corrective actions is proof of its incompetence in handling significant labor-related matters. Concerns have been raised by the opposition about the widespread ramifications of the telecom strike plan. With services potentially being halted or significantly delayed, millions of customers would be left without a reliable means of communication, severely impacting businesses and government operations. The opposition also emphasized the possible aftermath of the strike plan: losing the public's faith in the government's ability to maintain a stable and functional society. In response to the escalating turmoil, the opposition has suggested several measures the government should prioritize to resolve the ongoing situation effectively. One of them includes initiating transparent negotiations with the aggrieved workers of Chunghwa Telecom, where they are given an open platform to express their grievances and partake in devising a mutually agreeable solution. It is of paramount importance that the employees feel heard and included in the decision-making process, as it would provide them with a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. Another point highlighted by the opposition encompasses the establishment of a robust and just labor management system, which is of utmost importance as workers must be treated fairly while safeguarding their rights. A well-structured labor system allows disputes to be addressed with mediation that is swift, efficient, and fair, reducing the likelihood of future conflicts and promoting a healthy work environment. Finally, the opposition calls for an in-depth review of Chunghwa Telecom's management structure and internal policies, as these are the core factors that have provoked unrest among its workers. Areas such as salary structures, promotions, and employee benefits must be scrutinized carefully to ensure that the primary causes of the discontentment are eliminated. In conclusion, the opposition's strong backlash against the government's handling of the Chunghwa Telecom strike plan represents a call for action and policy change. It is vital that the government demonstrates its dedication to addressing the needs and rights of its workforce. If left unresolved, the ongoing situation would not only cause damage on a national scale, but will also erode the fundamental trust people hold in the government's competence and capabilities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The factory, which manufactures automotive spare parts, is known for its high employee satisfaction. However, recently, a small group of workers has realized that they are being spied on by their lower-level managers. The workers, Bill, Sarah, Roxanne, and Tim, start noticing that these managers, led by David, have become increasingly paranoid, performing bag checks, listening in on conversations, and even installing new security measures. Rumors of layoffs and potential downsizing begin to circulate around the factory, leading to unrest among the employees. The group decides to investigate why the managers are spying on them and what secrets the factory could hold. They start attending local town hall meetings, trying to determine when these changes in the factory's management began. Tim, an old-timer at the factory, recalls a mysterious new investor who had joined the board a couple of years ago. Coincidentally, Tim also observed a significant change in management since then. The group decides to infiltrate the management offices after hours, hoping to find some answers. Breaking in, they hack into the plant manager's computer and discover a hidden email chain between the mysterious investor, David, and other lower-level managers. It becomes clear that the investor, Raymond Watson, is using the factory for something more sinister than vehicle part production. The truth begins to unravel as they uncover a conspiracy to manufacture illicit arms components within the factory and export them to international terrorist organizations. As the group digs deeper, they realize that Raymond's influence and power extend to the local government and law enforcement authorities, plunging the entire town into a web of corruption. In a race against time, the four friends decide to gather evidence and bring down Raymond and his cohorts before the authorities catch on and hunt them down.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"No, these three questions are quite distinct from one another. The first question seeks advice on health or nutrition - specifically, whether it's recommended to consume eight glasses of lime water each day. The second question is asking about a technical process, whether reverse osmosis (RO) water can be used to soften hard water that contains lime scales. Finally, the third question itself is a comparative question -- it seeks to determine whether the first two questions are similar in nature. Though they all involve water and lime in some manner, their focus varies widely.  Let's delve into each of these questions in more detail: 1. \\"Is it good to take 8 glass of lime water a day?\\": This question is focused on the health impacts of drinking a specific amount of lime water each day. Lime water, a solution made from limes and water, contains vitamin C and other nutrients and antioxidants that can have numerous health benefits. These might include aiding digestion, improving skin quality, assisting weight loss, and boosting immunity. However, drinking as many as eight glasses per day might not be necessary to achieve these benefits - in fact, consuming too much citric acid (found in limes) could potentially have negative impacts, such as eroding tooth enamel. The specific answer to this question would likely depend on an individual's health condition and overall dietary habits, but it's generally advisable to maintain a balanced and varied diet. 2. \\"Can RO water soften hard water having lime scales?\\": The focus of this question is on water chemistry and treatment methods. Hard water contains high concentrations of minerals such as calcium and magnesium, which can form lime scale in water pipes and on fixtures. Reverse osmosis is a process that pushes water through a semi-permeable membrane to remove impurities. While it's effective at removing many contaminants, RO isn't generally regarded as the most effective method for softening hard water because it doesn't specifically target the minerals that cause this hardness. Water softening typically requires a process like ion exchange, which specifically targets these minerals.  3. \\"Would you say that these questions are the same?\\": The short answer to this question is no, the first two questions are not the same. Despite the similarities in subject matter (lime and water), the specific queries address different topics - the first is about health and nutrition, while the second relates to water treatment methods."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Animals with higher fitness have a better chance of passing their genes on to the next generation. If genes control behaviors that increase fitness, the behaviors become more common in the species. This occurs through the process of evolution by natural selection.  Now, I have a new situation: Two bears are living in the same forest.

Women between the ages of 40 and 60 are more likely to develop lumps or cysts within the breasts. Hormonal changes can cause cysts to develop, so you may notice breast cysts develop right before your menstrual cycle begins.","output":"Taking this into consideration, it is important for women in this age range to be vigilant about monitoring their breasts for any changes. One effective way to do this is by performing regular self-examinations. Familiarize yourself with the normal texture and appearance of your breasts, so you can promptly identify any new lumps or areas of discomfort. You should ideally perform these self-exams once a month, preferably a week after your menstrual period when your breasts are least likely to be tender or swollen. In addition to self-exams, you should also schedule annual visits with your healthcare provider for a clinical breast examination. For women aged 45 to 54, it is recommended that they undergo mammograms every year, while women aged 55 and over should have mammograms every two years. These diagnostic tools are essential for early detection of breast lumps, cysts, and potential malignancies. If a cyst or lump is discovered, further evaluation and treatment may be required. Breast cysts can be classified into two categories: simple cysts and complex cysts. Simple cysts are filled with fluid and are typically benign. Complex cysts, on the other hand, may contain both fluid and solid components. While these can still be benign, in some cases, they may be indicative of a more serious issue. If you are diagnosed with a simple breast cyst that is asymptomatic, your healthcare provider may recommend a \\"watchful waiting\\" approach, which involves monitoring the cyst for any changes in size or shape. This approach is typically chosen when the cyst is believed to be harmless, and surgical intervention is not deemed necessary. However, if the cyst is causing discomfort or anxiety, or if there is a concern about its nature, your doctor may choose to drain the fluid using a fine needle aspiration (FNA) procedure. This procedure is done under local anesthesia and helps to alleviate any associated discomfort. In the case of complex breast cysts, further evaluation may be needed to determine the most appropriate course of action. Your healthcare provider may order a breast ultrasound, breast MRI, or biopsy to gather more information about the cyst's structure and composition. If any suspicious features are identified, a more invasive intervention, such as a lumpectomy or surgical excision, may be recommended. It is also crucial to assess and manage any associated risk factors for breast cysts. Lifestyle modifications such as maintaining a healthy weight, engaging in regular physical activity, and minimizing alcohol consumption can help promote overall breast health. Additionally, quitting smoking is a decisive factor in maintaining not only breast health but overall well-being. In summary, treating breast cysts begins with understanding the risk factors and utilizing early detection methods like self-exams, clinical breast exams, and mammograms. Depending on the nature of the cyst, watchful waiting, needle aspiration, or surgical intervention may be necessary, accompanied by the incorporation of wellness practices and lifestyle adjustments to promote optimal breast health. It is crucial to consult with your healthcare provider for personalized recommendations, as each individual's needs may vary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The premise specifies a particular scenario within the topic of inventory accounting – forfeitures related to satisfying tax liabilities. The hypothesis suggests that these forfeitures should be considered when dealing with inventory accounting. Step 2: Evaluate the connection. Given that the premise focuses on a specific situation (forfeitures related to tax liabilities) within the broader topic of inventory accounting, it sets the context for the hypothesis. The hypothesis then expands on that context by stating that these forfeitures must be factored into the accounting process. Step 3: Make a conclusion. Since the hypothesis is a logical extension of the premise and the two statements align in their focus on the importance of forfeiture consideration, the conclusion is: Answer: a). yes. The premise entails the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

As the owner of the largest music company globally, Vivendi Universal has established itself as a dominant force in the sector. This divestment illustrates Philips Electronics' strategic decision to refocus their resources and streamline their investments to align better with their core business areas. The Philips-Vivendi Universal partnership initially proved beneficial for both companies, allowing Philips Electronics to expand its presence in the entertainment industry and Vivendi Universal to strengthen its position in the technology sector. However, the dynamic landscape of the music and entertainment business has prompted Philips and Vivendi to take stock of their priorities and reassess their investment portfolios. By selling its stake in Vivendi Universal, Philips Electronics can now concentrate on bolstering its primary product lines and innovation in the technology market. Over time, the music industry has been witnessing a profound transformation driven by the increased proliferation of digital streaming services and the diminishing demand for physical media like CDs and DVDs. As such, Philips Electronics' decision to divest from Vivendi Universal reflects its strategic reassessment of the future trajectory of the music business. The company is now redirecting its resources to nurture its core competence in technology and electronics product manufacturing, considering the radical shift in consumer preferences and the rapid pace of technological advancements. The sale of Philips Electronics' 3 percent stake in Vivendi Universal is particularly timely and relevant in light of ongoing conversations about mergers and acquisitions in both the technology and entertainment industries. It is essential for companies like Philips Electronics to maintain agility in their investment strategies to adapt to highly competitive markets. By detaching its interests from Vivendi Universal, Philips is responding proactively to a constantly evolving business environment, demonstrating an acute awareness of the challenges and opportunities presented by the digital revolution. It is essential to note that the implications of this strategic move for Philips Electronics extend far beyond the financial outcomes and the reframing of investment portfolios. In essence, this decision could set the stage for a new era within the company's history, characterized by its commitment to innovation and technological evolution. As Philips Electronics solidifies its focus on its core competencies and expertise in the electronics sector, the company will be better positioned to explore new growth opportunities, develop groundbreaking products, and achieve sustained success in the long run. In conclusion, Philips Electronics' divestment of its 3 percent stake in Vivendi Universal signifies a new chapter in the company's strategic outlook and evolution. As consumer preferences, technological advances, and market trends reshape the music and entertainment landscapes, Philips Electronics' decision to refocus its resources on its primary areas of expertise demonstrates exemplary foresight and adaptability. By refining their investment priorities, Philips Electronics can concentrate on innovation and the creation of cutting-edge products that will captivate audiences and ensure the company's lasting success in an age of digital transformation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This implies that the fisherman is near the coastline, navigating his canoe in relatively calm waters. There is no mention of any adverse weather or water conditions in this statement. On the other hand, the second statement introduces a completely new and unrelated scenario – a fisherman caught in a tsunami in the middle of the sea. A tsunami is a massive wave or series of waves caused by seismic activity, volcanic eruptions, or underwater landslides. Tsunamis can cause widespread destruction and loss of life when they reach coastal areas, but they are different from the usual image of a wave crashing on the shoreline and a canoe gently gliding across calm water. The two statements describe entirely different situations without any connection between them. The first statement does not provide any evidence or indication that the fisherman in question will encounter a tsunami, nor does it suggest that he is located in an area prone to tsunamis or dangerous ocean conditions.

Process: - Grapes are grown - A selection of grapes are gathered - The grapes are washed - The stems are removed from the grapes - The grapes are crushed and added to a fermation container - Yeast is added to the container - The yeast eats the sugar in the yeast, releasing alcohol -   Question: suppose the wine demand decreases happens, how will it affect wine production will rise.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If the demand for wine decreases, it will generally have an impact on the overall wine production. The extent of this influence varies depending on the scale of the decrease in demand and the responsiveness of the wine producers. However, it is essential to analyze how this decrease in demand would affect the different stages of wine production and the subsequent implications for the wine industry. 1. Grapes are grown: A decrease in wine demand might lead to a reduction in the incentives for vineyard owners to cultivate grapes primarily meant for winemaking. As a result, they might explore other opportunities to grow alternative crops or grapes for table consumption or other grape-derived products like grape juice or vinegar. This could potentially lead to lower grape production intended for wine-making. 2. A selection of grapes are gathered: With less demand for wine, winemakers may be more selective in choosing which grapes to use for their products. This could result in a higher focus on grape quality to create premium, niche wines that cater to specific market segments, rather than mass-producing lower-quality wines, ultimately reducing the quantity of grapes needed for wine production. 3. Grapes are washed, the stems are removed, and the grapes are crushed: The reduced demand for wine means that wineries will likely process fewer grapes, consequently requiring less labor, equipment, and infrastructure. This can lead to more efficient use of resources, optimization of the production process, and potentially encourage the development of innovative winemaking techniques to differentiate their products in a competitive market. 4. Adding to the fermentation container and adding yeast: In response to decreased wine demand, winemakers might lean towards creating higher-quality wines or producing innovative wine styles with unique characteristics like organic, biodynamic, or natural wines. This could affect the scale and the type of fermentation containers and yeast selection that are required for the specific wine production process. 5. Yeast eats sugar, releasing alcohol: The reduction in wine production will have a proportionate impact on this step of the process. Consequently, the need for yeasts and other fermentation-related resources will also be reduced in direct correlation with the overall wine output. In conclusion, a decrease in wine demand is expected to lead to less wine production, as wineries adapt to new market conditions and focus on improving the quality of their wines. This perturbation could potentially lead to a more competitive market, encouraging innovation and the development of niche products. Although it's crucial to consider that factors such as the region's market dynamics, government policies, geographical factors, and other economic indicators could influence these effects, it is reasonable to assume that the outcome would be a general reduction in wine production across the industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Question: \\"Debutantes are all?\\"  Context: \\"Court presentations of aristocratic young ladies to the monarch took place at the palace from the reign of Edward VII. These young women were known as débutantes, and the occasion—termed their \\"coming out\\"—represented their first entrée into society. Débutantes wore full court dress, with three tall ostrich feathers in their hair. They entered, curtsied, and performed a choreographed backwards walk and a further curtsy, while manoeuvring a dress train of prescribed length. (The ceremony, known as an evening court, corresponded to the \\"court drawing rooms\\" of Victoria's reign.) After World War II, the ceremony was replaced by less formal afternoon receptions, usually without choreographed curtsies and court dress.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"Debutantes, in the context of court presentations of aristocratic young ladies to the monarch, are young women from upper-class or aristocratic families who are making their formal introduction or \\"coming out\\" into high society. This tradition has deep historical roots and dates back to the reign of Edward VII in the United Kingdom. The debutantes' presentations symbolized their availability for marriage, and thus, it became an essential rite of passage for these young women as they entered the adult world. During court presentations, debutantes were expected to adhere to strict protocols and customs concerning their attire and behavior. They wore full court dress, which was an elaborate and costly affair, often featuring rich fabrics, intricate embroidery, and luxurious accessories. An essential element of their appearance was the inclusion of three tall ostrich feathers in their hair, signifying their high social standing. In addition to their attire, debutantes were required to perform specific actions and behaviors during their presentation to the monarch. They would enter the room, curtsy in a precise manner, and execute a choreographed backward walk while managing the prescribed length of their dress train. They would then perform an additional curtsy before gracefully exiting the scene. The ritual, known as an evening court, was similar to the court drawing rooms held during Queen Victoria's reign. These presentations were held at prestigious venues, such as the royal palace, and were highly anticipated social events attended by the elite of society. Families often invested a significant amount of time and money in preparing their daughters for this crucial moment. Debutantes typically received extensive lessons on etiquette, manners, and social skills so that they could navigate the upper echelons of society with grace and poise. However, following the aftermath of World War II, these court presentations underwent a significant transformation due to shifting social norms and the decline of aristocracy. The formal evening courts were gradually replaced by less ceremonious afternoon receptions with fewer rigid protocols. Elaborate curtsies and court dress became less common, as the focus shifted to a more casual and modern approach towards these social events. In summary, debutantes were aristocratic young ladies who were introduced to high society through formal court presentations during which they adhered to strict dress and behavioral codes. As times and societal norms changed, the debutante tradition evolved into less elaborate events that prioritized social interaction over pomp and ceremony. Nevertheless, debutante culture still endures in certain circles today as a means of continuing age-old traditions and celebrating the entry of young women into upper-class society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What did Reznor think he should have just written himself? is inside the article: A remix album, titled Year Zero Remixed, was released in November 2007. Due to the expiration of his contract with Interscope Records, the album's release, marketing, and promotion were completely in Reznor's control. The album features remixes from artists including The Faint, Ladytron, Bill Laswell, Saul Williams, Olof Dreijer of The Knife, and Sam Fogarino of Interpol. Reznor himself strongly supports fan-made remixes of songs from the album, as evidenced by his decision to upload every song in multi-track form to the then-newly launched Nine Inch Nails remix website.  Instrumental versions of the songs on Year Zero are available at the site for download in multiple formats, including MP3, WAV, GarageBand, and Ableton Live formats. A planned film adaption of Year Zero became a television project in 2007. Reznor met with various writers and pitched the idea to television networks. The 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike affected the pre-production stage. Nevertheless, Reznor commented in 2008 that the project is \\"still churning along\\", and that he had begun working with American film producer Lawrence Bender.

Cyclists were left baffled after they were given an apparent bike path just four inches wide. The bizarre white line was supposed to mark out a 'shared pavement' between walkers and cyclists in Grimsby, Lincolnshire - but it left even councillors scratching their heads. Residents thought they would have to ride along a four-inch gap between the thick white line and the kerb, a daunting task for even the most experienced cyclist. 'Pointless': How 61-year-old Ray Lawrance, pictured, described the new white line which left just a four-inch gap. But North East Lincolnshire Council said it was a normal way of marking out a shared pavement. Baffling: Cyclists complained after it appeared council workers had painted a path for them four inches wide. Cyclist Ray Lawrance, 61, spotted the white line as he walked his two grandchildren to school. He said: 'As a layman looking at this, I am totally confused. Where is the cycle path, where is the pedestrian path? There's no clear definition which is which. Wheely confusing: The start of the bike path in Great Coates, Grimsby. Cyclists should ride on the left. 'It. is pointless. It does not appear to be the best use of public money. It. is probably to tick boxes to get a bit of central government funding. but it has left pedestrians and cyclists confused.' The line was painted last month on a residential street in the village of Great Coates, on the outskirts of Grimsby, as part of resurfacing work at a busy junction. Labour-controlled North East Lincolnshire Council insisted its intention was to mark out a shared space for cyclists and pedestrians, not to divide the path in two. A spokesman said: 'This is a commonly used marking to show where a cycle. path joins a footpath. Cyclists and pedestrians share the length of path. marked by the white line.' But Labour councillor Cliff Barber was forced to hold his hands up after the issue was raised at a community meeting on October 30. The path had been resurfaced following complaints from the public,' he said. 'It. was a very uneven surface with lots of holes in so they have completely. re-tarmacked it and they have done a good job, but I must admit the. newly painted line does look a bit narrow.' The council insisted the repainting was essential for the pavement, but declined to say whether they will change the original markings. Vic Goose, chairman of the North East Lincolnshire Cycle Forum, said: 'The cycle path has been there for some time and has always been a shared path. 'It is quite likely that the white line is to segregate the cycle path from the road.' The bizarre incident is certainly not the first questionable paint job by council workers. Contractors for Cumbria County Council last month painted the words KEEP CEEAR in huge white letters - before having to apologise and correct it for free. And workmen in Thatcham, Berkshire, were a laughing stock when they refused to let parked cars stop them doing their job - and simply painted double yellow lines between each one.

From the moment I walked through the door, I was showered with impeccable service, divine food, and an atmosphere that can only be described as pure magic. I have been singing the praises of this gem of a restaurant to all my friends and family, encouraging everyone to visit and experience the magic for themselves.  The Enchanted Garden Bistro, nestled in the heart of our beautiful city, truly stands out with its inspiring and warm garden-themed décor. The lush green walls, delicate fairy lights, and aromatic flowers immediately transported me to another world. The enchanting ambience created the perfect backdrop for an evening of exceptional dining. Upon being seated, our attentive server introduced himself and provided us with the evening's specials. I was delighted to find a wide selection of seasonal dishes, showcasing the restaurant's commitment to using only the freshest local ingredients. The wine list was also thoughtfully curated, featuring a mix of both well-known classics and delightful lesser-known gems. For our meal, I ordered the seared scallops with a delicate cauliflower purée to start, while my partner opted for the roasted beet and goat cheese salad. Both appetizers were visually stunning and bursting with flavor. The scallops were cooked to perfection – tender, juicy, and expertly balanced by the creamy cauliflower purée. The beet salad was equally impressive, with the sweetness of the beets and tangy goat cheese marrying together in perfect harmony. Our main courses were equally exquisite. I chose the succulent slow-roasted lamb shank with a side of creamy mashed potatoes and sautéed asparagus, while my partner decided on the pan-seared salmon with vegetable quinoa and a zesty lemon-dill sauce. The love and care poured into crafting these dishes was evident in every bite. The lamb practically fell off the bone and the flavor was enhanced beautifully by a rich, velvety sauce. The salmon was cooked to perfection, moist and flaky, while the lemon-dill sauce provided a refreshing, tangy finish. As if our taste buds hadn't been pampered enough, the dessert menu beckoned us in for one final hurrah. I simply couldn't resist the triple chocolate mousse, and my partner selected the raspberry panna cotta. Heavenly is the only word that comes close to describing the decadence of the chocolate mousse – it was unbelievably smooth, with layers of intense and varied chocolate flavors that danced on my tongue. The raspberry panna cotta was artistically presented and radiated a perfect balance of tart and sweet. Throughout our meal, the service remained impeccable. Our server consistently checked on us without being intrusive, ensuring our wine glasses were filled, and promptly attending to any requests. It is clear that the staff at Enchanted Garden Bistro are well-trained and passionate about providing an exceptional experience for their patrons. I wholeheartedly recommend the Enchanted Garden Bistro for anyone seeking an unforgettable culinary adventure. The sublime food, impeccable service, and enchanting atmosphere all come together to create a dining experience that is truly a cut above the rest.

Summarize: But few people who work in computer security can stand those programmes or movies because, in their words, they are so technically inept. One TV show that has proved popular with hackers is NBC Universal's Mr Robot which centres around Elliott Alderson - a security pro by day but who is also a member of an anti-establishment hacker group called FSociety that wants to use his technical skills to change the world. Kor Adana, one of Mr Robot's writers who worked in IT security before jumping to TV production, said the decision to make the show as technically accurate as possible was made even before the first episode was shot. \\"I've got nothing but disdain for how Hollywood has portrayed hacking and technology before now,\\" he told a packed session at Def Con that was testament to the huge following Mr Robot has won among hackers. \\"We wanted to do it right,\\" he said, \\"and we thought that doing it in a realistic way would be enticing and compelling.\\" To help get the details correct, Mr Adana has recruited several technical consultants well-known in the Def Con and hacking community to advise on how the hacks Elliott uses can be accomplished. The consultants develop the hacks, prove they work and then pass on information about how they were done to Mr Adana so they can be used on the show. However, he said, drama demands that not every last detail of how Elliot cracks passwords, spoofs text messages, hacks phones or penetrates corporate and civil networks is shown. \\"We have to strike a balance between what's visually compelling and what we have to do to move the story forward,\\" he said. Despite this the show does take care to make sure real and relevant hardware and software is used, he said. This attention to detail extends to the version numbers of software packages being used, command syntax, output format and screen layouts. \\"We want to nail those details,\\" said Mr Adana. \\"It really helps to ground the show in reality if we can use real tools.\\" Mr Adana extended an open invitation to the Def Con audience to contact him and the technical consultants with information about the tools they use so they can be featured on the show and used in its hacks. Beyond the technology and hacks featured in the show, Mr Adana said it was also trying to make an important point about the contemporary role of technology. \\"We live in an age where we are more dependent on devices than ever,\\" he said. \\"And there are a lot of the younger generation that know how to use apps but do not know about the ways in which they are vulnerable and how if they leave their phone unlocked it will not take long for it to be rooted.\\" \\"If Mr Robot increases the level of awareness and paranoia out there then that's a good thing,\\" he said. Veteran hacker Marc Rogers, who develops and proves many of the hacks featured in the show, said he had been encouraged by the care it took to get the tech right. \\"For years and years I have watched TV betray my community,\\" he said, \\"I want to see real stuff on TV that does not make me rage and which is an accurate portrayal of people in my community.\\" \\"It's been a gift to work on this,\\" he said. Andre McGregor, a consultant who formerly worked in the FBI's cyber division, said he too was heartened by the care taken over the technology in the show. \\"I find it refreshing that the accuracy is so important to them,\\" he said, adding that he was approached to help with Series Two of Mr Robot because several episodes feature law enforcement and government responses to cyber attacks. Mr McGregor said his advice extended beyond helping the show's writers understand how the FBI and law enforcement agencies investigate cyber intrusions and conduct interviews. It also involved more subtle elements such as how FBI agents arrange themselves in a room during a meeting or interrogation, he said. \\"An agent would never stand in front of a door,\\" he said. \\"It's what we call the 'fatal funnel', you could be hit by a shotgun blast through that door.\\" But there were some things that the show did gloss over, said consultant Ryan Kazanciyan, a former penetration tester who is now head of forensics at security firm Tanium. \\"It's missing the time, the number of steps you have to go through for a hack, complexity and the amount of research you have to do,\\" he said. \\"When I would do penetration testing I would have one or two weeks to get in from the outside and then one or two weeks to see how much damage I could do from the inside,\\" he said. \\"Sometimes I would go for days just coming up blank,\\" he said. \\"And then you would have that Aha! moment that gets you in.\\" He said one facet of hacking the show did get right was the view of the world that anyone with an understanding of security software swiftly acquires. \\"There's always a way in,\\" he said. Summary:","output":"Technical consultants and experts in the computer security field are praising NBC Universal's Mr Robot, a TV series about a cybersecurity expert who is part of an anti-establishment hacker group, for its realistic portrayal of hacking and technology. Writer Kor Adana, who previously worked in IT security, said he wanted the show to get the technical details right and has enlisted known consultants in the hacking community.

Write an article based on this summary: – Donald Trump has revisited a conspiracy theory that the Clintons orchestrated a murder, and Sheila Foster Anthony \\"cannot let such craven behavior pass without a response.\\" The Washington Post reports that in an interview last week, Trump was asked about the death of Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster—who committed suicide in 1993—and branded it \\"very fishy. ... He knew everything that was going on [with the Clintons], and then all of a sudden he committed suicide.\\" Conspiracy theories that the Clintons had Foster murdered because he had knowledge specific to the Whitewater scandal surfaced in the months following Foster's death, though five investigations found he took his own life. \\"For Trump to raise these theories again for political advantage is wrong,\\" \\"irresponsible,\\" and \\"cruel,\\" Foster's sister writes at the Post. Foster Anthony has never made public comments on the matter in a bid to protect the tattered remains of her family's privacy, but decided to when the Post asked what she thought. She says she was very close to her brother, who told her he was battling depression before he died; indeed, the names of three psychiatrists she suggested to him were in his wallet when his body was found in a park outside Washington DC. \\"I did not see a suicide coming, yet when I was told that Vince was dead I knew that he had killed himself. Never for a minute have I doubted that,\\" and \\"these outrageous suggestions have caused our family untold pain,\\" she adds. \\"This is scurrilous enough coming from right-wing political operatives who have peddled conspiracy theories about Vince’s death for more than two decades.

Article:","output":"Cruel, Irresponsible, and Wrong: Examining Trump's Revived Conspiracy Theory Surrounding Vince Foster's Death The shocking and tragic death of Vince Foster, Deputy White House Counsel, in 1993 left a trail of heartache and unanswered questions in its wake. Now, over two decades later, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has reignited the conspiracy theory fire that has long claimed Foster's suicide was actually a murder orchestrated by none other than Bill and Hillary Clinton. This revival of a discredited theory is misleading, dangerous, and in many ways, a tactic that is both cruel and exploitative. Foster, who was closely connected with the Clintons and held substantial knowledge about their workings, was found dead in a park outside Washington DC, with investigations leading to the conclusion that he had taken his own life. In the months that followed, conspiracy theorists were quick to suggest that Foster's untimely death was the result of the Clintons silencing him due to his involvement in their alleged Whitewater scandal. Despite five separate investigations finding that Foster indeed committed suicide, Trump's recent comments continue to cast doubt on the official findings. In a recent interview, Trump was asked about Foster's death and his troubling relationship with the Clintons, to which he replied, \\"He knew everything that was going on [with the Clintons], and then all of a sudden he committed suicide.\\" This response clearly echoes the sentiments of those who still question the truth surrounding Foster's death. Foster's sister, Sheila Foster Anthony, has bravely broken her silence and spoken out against Trump's incendiary comments. In an essay published in The Washington Post, Anthony describes her brother's struggle with depression before his death and her unwavering conviction in the cause of his passing. \\"I did not see a suicide coming, yet when I was told that Vince was dead, I knew that he had killed himself. Never for a minute have I doubted that,\\" she writes. It would be reasonable to assume that Trump, who has no personal ties to the Foster family, may not be fully informed about the case. However, for the presidential hopeful to capitalize on a deeply painful family tragedy for his own political gain is both \\"irresponsible\\" and \\"cruel,\\" as Anthony puts it. As we move closer to the 2016 election, it is vital that we delve into the motivations behind Trump's choice to engage in conspiratorial discussions surrounding Foster's death. By injecting renewed doubt into an already emotional and deeply painful situation, is Trump simply pandering to the beliefs of his audience, or is he wholeheartedly endorsing an unproven theory at the expense of the lives that Foster left behind? Regardless of the motives, one thing is abundantly clear: With each cruel, inflammatory statement, Trump demonstrates an apparent willingness to subordinate the truth in the name of personal gain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a hypothesis: USA Snapshots and other regular graphs are plentiful. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"To analyze whether it is possible to conclude that if the given premise is true, then so is the hypothesis, we must first evaluate the premise and its relationship to the hypothesis.  Premise: USA Snapshots and other regular graphs abound. This premise tells us that USA Snapshots, as well as other regular graphs, are abundant or are found in copious amounts. Regular graphs refer to those graphs in which each vertex has the same degree (i.e., the same number of edges connected to it). USA Snapshots, though not explicitly defined, can be inferred to be a subset of regular graphs or a type of regular graph related to the USA, since the premise has grouped them together. Hypothesis: USA Snapshots and other regular graphs are plentiful. This hypothesis states that USA Snapshots and other regular graphs are plentiful or easily found. In essence, it suggests that these graphs exist in large quantities or are widespread. Now, let's compare the two statements and examine their relationship: Both the premise and the hypothesis convey a similar idea – that USA Snapshots and other regular graphs are present in large amounts. The premise uses the term \\"abound,\\" while the hypothesis uses \\"plentiful.\\" These words are synonymous, meaning they convey the same idea. Therefore, it can be deduced that if the premise is true (i.e., if USA Snapshots and other regular graphs abound), then the hypothesis would also be true (i.e., USA Snapshots and other regular graphs are plentiful). In conclusion, it is possible to assert that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis, as they both convey a similar concept.

Twenty years ago, the five years old boy Michael Hawthorne witnessed his father killing his mother with an axe in an empty road and committing suicide later. On the present days, Michael (Gordon Currie) invites his girlfriend Peg (Stacy Grant) and his best friends Chris (Myc Agnew), Jennifer (Emmanuelle Vaugier), Lisa Ann (Kelly Benson), Ned (Brendon Beiser), Mitch Maldive (Phillip Rhys) and Trish (Rachel Hayward) to spend the Halloween in the country with his grandparents in their farm. He asks his friends to wear costumes that would represent their greatest innermost fear, and together with his Indian friend Crow (Byron Chief Moon), they would perform an ancient Indian celebration using the carved wooden dummy Morty (Jon Fedele) that would eliminate their fears forever. The greatest fear of Michael is to become a serial killer like his father, but something goes wrong and Morty turns into his father, killing his friends. \\"The Fear: Resurrection\\" is a disappointing and pointless slash movie that uses the interesting concept of eliminating the greatest innermost fear of each friend before it grows, but in a messy screenplay full of clichés. There are some exaggerated performances, like for example Ms. Betsy Palmer; others very weak, but in general the acting is good. Unfortunately there is no explanation why the dummy is brought to live; further, in spite of being surrounded by close friends, the group does not feel pain or sorrow when each one of them dies. The low-pace along more than fifty minutes could have been used to built a better dramatic situation. In the very end, Michael shows a charm that his father was interested that I have not noticed along the story. I do not know whether the previous reference was edited in the DVD released in Brazil with 87 minutes running time. The special effects are very reasonable for a B-movie. My vote is four.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Who is more likely to gain unhealthy amounts of weight?  Ronaldo and Jeff are two college roommates that have similar body structure and similar physical activity levels. Ronaldo is a nutrition enthusiast and eats a diet with appropriately low amounts of fat and cholesterol. Jeff, on the other hand, doesn't really care about nutrition at all. He eats whatever he wants, whenever he wants, and as a result he consumes a diet with an inappropriately high amount of fat and cholesterol.  Hint: Although some lipids in the diet are essential, excess dietary lipids can be harmful. Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Jeff is more likely to gain unhealthy amounts of weight compared to Ronaldo. There are several factors contributing to this likelihood. First, Ronaldo is a nutrition enthusiast and consciously makes an effort to follow a healthy diet with low amounts of fat and cholesterol. This indicates that he is aware of the potential health risks associated with excess dietary lipids and is actively working to minimize them in his daily food choices. His low-fat and low-cholesterol diet is likely to keep his weight within a healthy range and protect him against potential issues associated with a high-fat diet, such as cardiovascular disease or atherosclerosis. On the other hand, Jeff does not pay much attention to his diet and consumes a high amount of fat and cholesterol without restraint. Due to the high caloric content of dietary lipids, Jeff is consistently providing his body with an excess of energy that, if not burned off through physical activity, will be stored as body fat. His high-fat diet can not only cause unhealthy weight gain but also lead to elevated lipid levels in his blood, increasing his risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease or atherosclerosis. Additionally, Jeff's consumption of saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol poses further risks to his health. These dietary lipids are of particular concern due to their potential contribution to the narrowing of arteries (atherosclerosis) and other conditions which increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and other serious health complications. In conclusion, considering their dietary habits and the potential consequences of excess dietary lipids, Jeff is more likely to gain unhealthy amounts of weight compared to his roommate Ronaldo. This is primarily due to Jeff's lack of concern for nutrition and his consumption of high amounts of fat and cholesterol, which can lead to an array of health problems such as cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis. In contrast, Ronaldo's conscientious efforts to maintain a low-fat and low-cholesterol diet protect him from these risks and make it less likely that he will experience the same weight gain or health issues as Jeff."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: When you meet someone for the first time, you will get a general idea in your mind of that person in the first moment. Your feelings about other people, however, are really just show the way that you look at yourself. Your reactions to others say more about you than they do about others. You cannot really love or hate about yourself. We are usually drawn to those who are most like us and may dislike those who have the same characters as ourselves that we dislike. Therefore, you can allow others to be the mirror to see more clearly your own feelings of self-worth. And, you can view the people you judge negatively   as mirrors to show you what you are not accepting about yourself. To live peacefully with others, you will need to learn patience. A big challenge is to let your judgment of others be a lifelong research of yourself. Your task is to consider all the decisions and judgments you make onto others carefully and to begin to see whether you can use them to help yourself and become whole. Several days ago I had a business lunch with a man who showed _ table manners. My first feeling was to judge him as rude. When I noticed that I was judging him, I stopped and asked myself what I was feeling. I discovered that I was nervous to be seen with someone who was eating with his mouth open and loudly blowing his nose. I was very surprised to find how much I cared about how the other people in the restaurant judged me. Remember that your judgment of someone will not serve as some kind of protective thing against you becoming like him. Just because I judge my lunch partner as rude, it does not prevent me from ever looking or acting like him. In the same way, my patience to him would not cause me to suddenly begin eating my food with my mouth open. When you get close to life in this manner, those with whom you hate very much as well as those whom you admire and love can be seen as mirrors, guiding you to discover parts of yourself that you dislike and to embrace your greatest characters you are proud of.

In Western Europe, Emperor Charlemagne painted his palace red as a very visible symbol of his authority, and wore red shoes at his coronation. Kings, princes and, beginning in 1295, Roman Catholic cardinals began to wear red costumes. When Abbe Suger rebuilt Saint Denis Basilica outside Paris in the early 12th century, he added stained glass windows colored blue cobalt glass and red glass tinted with copper. Together they flooded the basilica with a mystical light. Soon stained glass windows were being added to cathedrals all across France, England and Germany.

In other words, one usually acquires German citizenship if a parent is a German citizen, irrespective of place of birth, or by birth in Germany to parents with foreign nationality if certain requirements are fulfilled. Naturalisation is also possible for foreign nationals after six to eight years of legal residence in Germany. However, non-EU and non-Swiss citizens must usually renounce their old citizenship before being naturalised in Germany. Citizens of other EU countries and of Switzerland usually can keep their old citizenship. Some EU countries do not allow dual citizenship even with other EU countries. German citizens wanting to acquire a non-EU or non-Swiss citizenship and to maintain their German citizenship must apply for a permission (Beibehaltungsgenehmigung) before acquiring the other citizenship, or they will automatically lose their German citizenship when they acquire the foreign citizenship.

Objective: Increase cushion for dog bed. Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning? Options: + Wrap dog bed with old shower curtain.; + Wrap dog bed with old bed sheet.;","output":"To determine which of the given options is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning when aiming to increase cushion for a dog bed, we must analyze both options and their implications on the overall comfort and softness of the dog bed. Option 1: Wrap dog bed with an old shower curtain. A shower curtain is typically made of, but not limited to, vinyl, PVC, or polyester materials, which are water-resistant and suitable for moisture-rich environments. However, these materials do not tend to provide additional cushioning or comfort to the dog bed due to their stiffness, thickness, or relatively non-porous nature.  Pros: - Easy to clean and maintain - Water-resistant and suitable for outdoor use Cons: - Limited cushioning effect due to the nature of the material - Possible discomfort or irritation for dogs sensitive to synthetic materials - Lack of breathability, which may lead to overheating or a build-up of odor Option 2: Wrap dog bed with an old bed sheet. Bed sheets are generally crafted from cotton, polyester, or a blend of both materials. As these fabrics are soft, lightweight, and breathable, they are more suitable for providing an increase in cushioning and comfort for a dog bed. Pros: - Increased cushioning due to softer materials used - Breathable, allowing for adequate air circulation and reduced odor build-up - Gentle on the dog's skin, reducing the risk of irritation or sensitivity - Easy to wash Cons: - Not as water-resistant as a shower curtain, which may make it less suitable for outdoor use - Requires more frequent laundering to maintain cleanliness and hygiene Based on naive physics reasoning, we can deduce that wrapping the dog bed with an old bed sheet is the more sound option, as it provides better cushioning, comfort, and breathability compared to a shower curtain. Although a shower curtain may offer water resistance, its stiffness and lack of breathability may counteract any potential benefits. In this instance, the softness and added cushioning provided by the bed sheet outweighs its lack of water resistance, making it the more suitable choice for increasing cushioning and enhancing the dog bed's overall comfort."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Josquin was born in the area controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy, and was possibly born either in Hainaut (modern-day Belgium), or immediately across the border in modern-day France, since several times in his life he was classified legally as a Frenchman (for instance, when he made his will). Josquin was long mistaken for a man with a similar name, Josquin de Kessalia, born around the year 1440, who sang in Milan from 1459 to 1474, dying in 1498. More recent scholarship has shown that Josquin des Prez was born around 1450 or a few years later, and did not go to Italy until the early 1480s.Around 1466, perhaps on the death of his father, Josquin was named by his uncle and aunt, Gille Lebloitte dit Desprez and Jacque Banestonne, as their heir. Their will gives Josquin's actual surname as Lebloitte. According to Matthews and Merkley, \\"des Prez\\" was an alternative name.According to an account by Claude Hémeré, a friend and librarian of Cardinal Richelieu whose evidence dates as late as 1633, and who used the records of the collegiate church of Saint-Quentin, Josquin became a choirboy with his friend and colleague the Franco Flemish composer Jean Mouton at Saint-Quentin's royal church, probably around 1460. Doubt has been cast on the accuracy of Hémeré's account, however. Josquin may have studied counterpoint under Ockeghem, whom he greatly admired throughout his life: this is suggested both by the testimony of Gioseffo Zarlino and Lodovico Zacconi, writing later in the 16th century, and by Josquin's eloquent lament on the death of Ockeghem in 1497, Nymphes des bois/Requiem aeternam, based on the poem by Jean Molinet. All records from Saint-Quentin were destroyed in 1669; however the collegiate chapel there was a center of music-making for the entire area, and in addition was...

Article: When we interviewed what the life was like more than 70 years ago, many old soldiers were full of tears in their eyes. They told us that they never forgot those days when they were in the army, during which they lived hard lives but spared no effort to fight against the enemies. Now in the year 2015 comes the first great parade  in the 21stcentury. September 3rdis the 70thanniversary  of the victory of the anti-fascist   war. This day is considered as an important moment for China, as well as the world. 49 countries from all over the world, including South Korea and some European countries attended this special occasion. In preparation for the parade, the soldiers worked hard every day. In order to walk well in the three hundred meters distance on the Tian'anmen Square, they had to receive extremely strict training. Each day, they got up early in the morning and started the 10 hours' practice. When a reporter arrived, it was raining heavily outside, but none of the soldiers stopped training. Nothing can stop their training, and no one can stop their deep love to their motherland. The reporter asked, \\"The training is so hard but why does nobody give up?\\" \\"It's the first time for me to join in such an important ceremony. I consider it a great honor. I must try my best.\\" One of the participants  answered. In fact, everyone takes pride in taking part in this big parade because they want to show the spirit of Chinese army, the power of Chinese army, as well as the determination of keeping the world in peace. From the soldiers, we learned the power of dreams. If one has a dream, he will get over any difficulties that get in the way to make the dream come true.

Please answer the following question: If you turned on the TV towards the end of 2002 you could have been forgiven for thinking that Britain had gone absolutely horseshit mental. Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's. Of course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint. Dr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron. And so it was that one hung-over morning, after reading yet another story about vigilantes who had threatened to stone Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, to death during her high-profile trial for perverting the course of justice, I decided to set up a website parodying this collective national madness. The result of two or three hours of hung-over labour was thinkofthechildren.co.uk, a spoof campaign site which claimed to offer a handy online guide for crazy vigilantes of all stripes to co-ordinate their crazy vigilante efforts. Although there are a few parts of the site I'm still a bit proud of, the majority of it was, I freely admit, satire of the lowest order.

Please answer the following question: Saturated hydrocarbons are given the general name of alkanes . The name of specific alkanes always ends in - ane . The first part of the name indicates how many carbon atoms each molecule of the alkane has. The smallest alkane is methane. It has just one carbon atom. The next largest is ethane, with two carbon atoms. The chemical formulas and properties of methane, ethane, and several other alkanes are listed in Table below . The boiling and melting points of alkanes are determined mainly by the number of carbon atoms they have. Alkanes with more carbon atoms generally have higher boiling and melting points.  Two brothers studied chemistry in school. Ted studied alkanes, while Ned studied cycloalkanes. They both received grade A.  Which brother learned more about methane? Answer:","output":"Ted, the brother who studied alkanes, learned more about methane. To understand this answer, we need to delve into the differences between alkanes and cycloalkanes as well as the nature of methane and its relevance in each of these chemical categories. Alkanes, also known as saturated hydrocarbons, are organic compounds consisting of single bonds between carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms. These molecules are made up of a continuous chain of carbon atoms, each bonded to at least two hydrogen atoms. Alkanes can be subdivided into three types: linear (straight-chain) alkanes, branched alkanes, and cycloalkanes. Cycloalkanes, on the other hand, are a specific subset of alkanes, where the carbon atoms form a closed ring or cyclic structure rather than a continuous chain. Cycloalkanes, like alkanes, are also saturated hydrocarbons containing only single covalent bonds. However, due to their ring structure, they have unique chemical and physical properties compared to their straight-chain counterparts. Methane (CH4) is the simplest and smallest alkane, consisting of a single carbon atom bonded to four hydrogen atoms. Since it is an alkane with a single carbon atom and no possibility of forming a cyclic structure, methane cannot be categorized as a cycloalkane. When comparing the two brothers, Ted, who studied alkanes, would have undoubtedly covered the topic of methane, as it is the smallest and simplest member of the alkane family. As alkanes are characterized by their single-bonded carbon-hydrogen structures, the concept of methane would have been fundamental to Ted's studies. Conversely, Ned, who studied cycloalkanes, would have focused on the ring structures formed by the carbon atoms in these molecules. Methane, being a monatomic (single-carbon atom) alkane, does not fit the cycloalkane category, as it is unable to form a closed ring. Consequently, Ned would have been less likely to learn about methane in his studies of cycloalkanes. Therefore, based on the differences in their respective subjects of study, we can conclude that Ted, the brother who studied alkanes, learned more about methane than his brother Ned, who studied cycloalkanes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is the world's second-largest religion and the fastest-growing major religion in the world, with over 1.7 billion followers or 23% of the global population, known as Muslims. Islam is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion that upholds that God is one and incomparable and that the purpose of existence is to worship God. Muslims consider Muhammad to be the last prophet of God., Head of government is a generic term used for either the highest or second highest official in the executive branch of a sovereign state, a federated state, or a self-governing colony, (commonly referred to as countries, nations or nation-states) who often presides over a cabinet, a group of ministers or secretaries who lead executive departments. The term \\"head of government\\" is often differentiated from the term \\"head of state\\", (e.g. as in article 7 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, article 1 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents and the United Nations protocol list), as they may be separate positions, individuals, and/or roles depending on the country., Jordan ('), officially The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan ('), is an Arab kingdom in Western Asia, on the East Bank of the Jordan River. Jordan is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the east and south, Iraq to the north-east, Syria to the north, Israel, Palestine and the Dead Sea to the west and the Red Sea in its extreme south-west. Jordan is strategically located at the crossroads of Asia, Africa and Europe. The capital, Amman, is Jordan's most populous city as well as the country's economic, political and cultural centre., Judaism (from , derived from Greek , originally from Hebrew , \\"Yehudah\\", \\"Judah\\"; in Hebrew: , \\"Yahadut\\", the distinctive characteristics of the Judean ethnos) encompasses the religion, philosophy, culture and way of life of the Jewish people. Judaism is an ancient monotheistic religion, with the Torah as its foundational text (part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible), and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud.

It is the world's only contiguous Afrasian nation., Holy city is a term applied to many cities, all of them central to the history or faith of specific religions. Such cities may also contain at least one headquarters complex (often containing a religious edifice, seminary, shrine, residence of the leading cleric of the religion and/or chambers of the religious leadership's offices) which constitutes a major destination of human traffic, or pilgrimage to the city, especially for major ceremonies and observances. A holy city is a symbolic city, representing attributes beyond its natural characteristics. Marketing experts have suggested that holy cities may be the oldest brands, and more specifically, place brands because they have value added via the perception of religious adherents., Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians.

The West Bank also contains a significant section of the western Dead Sea shore., The Judaean Mountains or Judaean Hills (\\"Harei Yehuda\\", \\"Jibal Al Khalil\\"), is a mountain range in Israel and the West Bank where Jerusalem and several other biblical cities are located. The mountains reach a height of . The Judean Mountains can be separated to a number of sub-regions, including the Mount Hebron ridge, the Jerusalem ridge and the Judean slopes. These mountains formed the heartland of the Kingdom of Judah, where the earliest Jewish settlements emerged., Israel , officially known as the State of Israel, is a country in the Middle East, on the southeastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea and the northern shore of the Red Sea. It has land borders with Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan on the east, the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the east and west, respectively, and Egypt to the southwest. The country contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area. Israel's financial and technology center is Tel Aviv, while its seat of government and proclaimed capital is Jerusalem, although the state's sovereignty over the city of Jerusalem is internationally unrecognized., The Gaza Strip (' ), or simply Gaza\\"', is a small self-governing Palestinian territory on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, that borders Egypt on the southwest for and Israel on the east and north along a border. Gaza, together with the West Bank, comprise the Palestinian territories claimed by the Palestinians as the State of Palestine. The territories of Gaza and the West Bank are separated from each other by Israeli territory. Both fall under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority, but Gaza has since June 2007 been governed by Hamas, a Palestinian Islamic organization which came to power in free elections in 2006. It has been placed under an Israeli and U.S.-led international economic and political boycott from that time onwards., The Bank of Israel is the central bank of Israel. It is located in Kiryat HaMemshala in Jerusalem, with a branch office in Tel Aviv. The current governor is Karnit Flug, the first female Governor of the Bank of Israel., Hungary is a unitary parliamentary republic in Central Europe. It covers an area of , situated in the Carpathian Basin and bordered by Slovakia to the north, Romania to the east, Serbia to the south, Croatia to the southwest, Slovenia to the west, Austria to the northwest, and Ukraine to the northeast. With about 10 million inhabitants, Hungary is a medium-sized member state of the European Union. The official language is Hungarian, which is the most widely spoken Uralic language in the world. Hungary's capital and largest metropolis is Budapest, a significant economic hub, classified as an Alpha- global city. Major urban areas include Debrecen, Szeged, Miskolc, Pécs and Gyr., The Israel Museum (\\"Muze'on Yisrael\\") was founded in 1965 as Israel's national museum. It is situated on a hill in the Givat Ram neighborhood of Jerusalem, near the Bible Lands Museum, the Knesset, the Israeli Supreme Court, and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. , Jerusalem , is a city located on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. One of the oldest cities in the world, Jerusalem was named as \\"\\"Urusalima\\"\\" on ancient Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets, probably meaning \\"City of Shalem\\" after a Canaanite deity, during the early Canaanite period (approximately 2400 BCE). During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 9th century BCE (Iron Age II), and in the 8th century the city developed into the religious and administrative center of the Kingdom of Judah. It is considered a holy city in the three major Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam., The Academy of the Hebrew Language (\\"Ha-Akademya la-Lashon ha-Ivrit\\") was established by the Israeli government in 1953 as the \\"supreme institution for scholarship on the Hebrew language in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem of Givat Ram campus.\\" It is an educational institution with the mission of creating new Hebrew words to ensure that the language does not die out. , Lebanon , officially known as the Lebanese Republic, is a sovereign state in Western Asia. It is bordered by Syria to the north and east and Israel to the south, while Cyprus is west across the Mediterranean Sea. Lebanon's location at the crossroads of the Mediterranean Basin and the Arabian hinterland facilitated its rich history and shaped a cultural identity of religious and ethnic diversity. At just 10,452 km (4,036 sq. mi.), it is the smallest recognized country on the entire mainland Asian continent., The Kingdom of Judah (\\"Mamlekhet Yehudh\\") was an Iron Age kingdom of the Southern Levant. The Hebrew Bible depicts it as the successor to a United Monarchy, but historians are divided about the veracity of this account. In the 10th and early 9th centuries BCE the territory of Judah appears to have been sparsely populated, limited to small rural settlements, most of them unfortified. Jerusalem, the kingdom's capital, likely did not emerge as a significant administrative centre until the end of the 8th century, prior to this archaeological evidence suggests its population was too small to sustain a viable kingdom. In the 7th century its population increased greatly, prospering under Assyrian vassalage (despite Hezekiah's revolt against the Assyrian king Sennacherib), but in 605 the Assyrian Empire was defeated, and the ensuing competition between the Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt and the Neo-Babylonian Empire for control of the Eastern Mediterranean led to the destruction of the kingdom in a series of campaigns between 597 and 582, the deportation of the elite of the community, and the incorporation of Judah into a province of the Neo-Babylonian Empire., Syria, officially known as the Syrian Arab Republic (\\"\\"), is a country in Western Asia, bordering Lebanon and the Mediterranean Sea to the west, Turkey to the north, Iraq to the east, Jordan to the south, and Israel to the southwest. Syria's capital and largest city is Damascus., \\"Palestinian territories\\" and \\"occupied Palestinian territories\\" (OPT or oPt) are descriptions often used to describe the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and the Gaza Strip, which are occupied or otherwise under the control of Israel. Israeli governments have maintained that the area involved is within territorial dispute. The extent of the territories, while subject to future negotiations, have frequently been defined by the Green Line., Canaan (Northwest Semitic: \\"\\"; Phoenician: ; Biblical Hebrew/ Masoretic: [\\"; nan]\\") was a Semitic-speaking region in the Ancient Near East during the late 2nd millennium BC. In the Bible it corresponds to the Levant, in particular to the areas of the Southern Levant that provide the main setting of the narrative of the Hebrew Bible, i.e., the area of Israel, Philistia, Phoenicia, and other nations., The Mediterranean Sea (pronounced ) is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land: on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia, on the south by North Africa, and on the east by the Levant. The sea is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean, although it is usually identified as a separate body of water., The Dead Sea (lit. Salt Sea), is a salt lake bordered by Jordan to the east and Israel and Palestine to the west. Its surface and shores are below sea level, Earth's lowest elevation on land. The Dead Sea is deep, the deepest hypersaline lake in the world. With 34.2% salinity (in 2011), it is 9.6 times as salty as the ocean, and one of the world's saltiest bodies of water. This salinity makes for a harsh environment in which plants and animals cannot flourish, hence its name. The Dead Sea is long and wide at its widest point. It lies in the Jordan Rift Valley and its main tributary is the Jordan River., West Germany is the common English name for the Federal Republic of Germany or FRG (or \\"RFA\\") in the period between its creation on 23 May 1949 to German reunification on 3 October 1990. During this Cold War era, NATO-aligned West Germany and Warsaw Pact-aligned East Germany were divided by the Inner German border. After 1961 West Berlin was physically separated from East Berlin as well as from East Germany by the Berlin Wall. This situation ended when East Germany was dissolved and its five states joined the ten states of the Federal Republic of Germany along with the reunified city-state of Berlin. With the reunification of West and East Germany, the Federal Republic of Germany, enlarged now to sixteen states, became known simply as \\"Germany\\". This period is also referred to as the Bonn Republic (\\"Bonner Republik\\") by historians, alluding to the interwar Weimar Republic and the post-reunification Berlin Republic., In geology and earth science, a plateau (or ; plural plateaus or plateaux), also called a high plain or tableland, is an area of highland, usually consisting of relatively flat terrain that is raised significantly above the surrounding area, often with one or more sides with steep slopes., The Knesset ( Hebrew :  ( hakneset ) ; lit. the gathering or assembly ; Arabic :   al - K ( e ) neset ) is the unicameral national legislature of Israel .

At one point, word went out that President Obama's transport aboard Marine One was cancelled in lieu of a motorcade due to the weather. We were not privy to the decisions made, but ultimately Marine One complimented by a Chinook haling staff and reporters landed in Elmwood. My producer and I looked at each other under the blue skies and elected to leave our rain coats in the car so we didn't need to haul them the quarter mile to the live location. It wasn't until Marine One landed and the President had already been through a few ceremonial steps that anyone paid any attention to the wall of black clouds massing overhead. There was a brief warning with a trickle of rain and lightening cracking off in the distance. Then the skies opened up. Lots of people headed for the press tent, but the citizens who made the trip to hear the President seemed determined to stick out the weather as long as the commander in chief was still willing to make a go of it. Finally, we saw that the program had been truncated and the President was headed for the podium ahead of a list of speakers. All the media in the press tent huddled around a television monitor in hopes of hearing the speech, however, little could be understood between the sound of the rain and attendees scrambling for a little dry real estate. It seems the President called an audible. With rivers pouring off his black umbrella and thunderclaps drowning him out, President Obama urged all the people who came to hear him speak, to move slowly for their cars. It wasn't safe to be standing outside in a lightning storm. And, he didn't say this but it seemed obvious that we should collectively have enough sense to come in out of the rain.

Article: \\"A photograph that one has taken of oneself, typically with a smart phone or webcam and uploaded to a social media website\\" is the definition of \\"selfie\\" in the Oxford English Dictionary. In fact, it wasn't even in the dictionary until August of last year. It earned its place there because people are now so obsessed with (......) selfies - we take them when we try on a new hat, play with our pets or when we meet a friend whom we haven't seen in a while. But is there any scientific explanation for this obsession? Well, you should probably ask James Kilner, a neuroscientist  at University College London. Through our lifetime we become experts at recognizing and interpreting other people's faces and facial expressions. In contrast, according to Kilner, we have a very poor understanding of our own faces since we have little experience of looking at them - we just feel them most of the time. This has been proved in previous studies, according to the BBC. Kilner found that most people chose the more attractive picture. This suggests that we tend to think of ourselves as better-looking than we actually are. To further test how we actually _ our own faces, Kilner carried out another study. He showed people different versions of their own portrait - the original, one that had been edited to look less attractive and one that was made more attractive - and asked them to pick the version which they thought looked most like them. They chose the more attractive version. But what does it say about selfies? Well, isn't that obvious? Selfies give us the power to create a photograph - by taking it from various angles, with different poses, using filters   and so on - that better matches our expectations with our actual faces. \\"You suddenly have control in a way that you don't have in non-virtual  interactions,\\" Kilner told the Canada-based CTV News. Selfies allow you \\"to keep taking pictures until you manage to take one you're happy with\\", he explained. Question: What is the passage mainly about? - The definition and fun of taking selfies. - A study of why people love taking selfies. - How taking selfies influences people's daily lives. - How to interpret people's facial expressions in their selfies.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Greg Tenorly drove the familiar route from the church to his music studio, studying the homes along the way. He wondered about the families who lived in each one. Like that two-story brick on the corner. What secrets were they hiding? Was the husband abusive? Did a teenager use drugs? Was the family nearly bankrupt? How could anyone know? It was better not to know. The mind can only handle so many problems at one time. He wondered where Troy and Cynthia Blockerman lived. Greg had appeared at the courthouse that morning as part of a jury pool, only to be released. He and the rest of his group would have to return the next morning. He hoped they would not need him. The church would pay his regular part-time salary while he was serving on a jury, but any private lessons he missed would be money lost. Greg's red 1965 Pontiac Bonneville convertible always turned heads as he drove through the small town. He had purchased it two months earlier from a career Navy man down in Longview who had babied the thing for years. It spent most of its life in the man's garage, coming out only when he was on leave. Most trips were to the car wash or the Pontiac dealer for scheduled maintenance. Greg gladly paid 4,000 for it. The sailor called him the very next day and tried to buy it back. He said it was like losing a member of the family. Greg felt bad, but not bad enough to give up the car. How could a 40-year-old car have only 93,000 miles on it? It was dazzling. His little studio was near the town square, nestled between Coreyville Hardware and Susie's Sewing Box. Occasionally he and a student could hear a pipe wrench or hammer hitting the floor on the hardware side. But things were always quiet from Susie's side. At least the soundproofing he had installed kept his neighbors from hearing his students. You can't teach music without hearing both beautiful sounds and sour notes. What is probably true about Greg? - He loves teaching music - He loves horror stories. - not enough information - He's in the Navy. A:","output":"Based on the information provided, it is reasonable to conclude that Greg Tenorly loves teaching music. There are several elements in the passage that support this conclusion. Firstly, Greg has a music studio where he teaches private lessons, indicating that he is passionate and dedicated to his craft. Moreover, he is concerned about losing money from missed private lessons due to potential jury duty, suggesting that he values his work as a music teacher. Additionally, the passage highlights Greg's appreciation for beautiful sounds, as he is aware that teaching music involves both wonderful melodies and less appealing notes. This appreciation for music further supports the notion that Greg loves teaching music. The other statements listed as potential conclusions cannot be definitively confirmed or refuted based on the information provided: - There is no indication that Greg loves horror stories. The passage does mention him contemplating the secrets and potential issues faced by the families in the homes he passes, but there is no clear connection to a love of horror stories. - Not enough information. While it may be true that there is not enough information to have a complete understanding of Greg, based on the passage, it is evident that he loves teaching music. - Greg is not in the Navy. The mention of a career Navy man is in regard to the person from whom Greg purchased his red 1965 Pontiac Bonneville convertible. There is no mention or indication that Greg himself is in the Navy. In fact, Greg is a part-time employee at a church, which is more information that we have about his background. In conclusion, based on the details provided in the passage, it is most accurate to claim that Greg Tenorly loves teaching music."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: This article: Tim Warden, a boy with autism, has supposedly witnessed his parents' double murder. Jake Rainer, a former child psychiatrist turned therapist, is called on to probe the child's mind in order to solve the case. The psychological drama is provided by the fact that not even Jake can entice Tim to communicate what he has or has not seen regarding the crime. Tim's sister, Sylvie, is protective of him. She eventually warms to Jake's efforts, but is concerned when she learns he was implicated in the suicide of another young child who was under his care. Jake gradually befriends Tim. At first, Jake thinks that Tim is trying to communicate by cutting up playing cards, but Sylvie reveals that Tim is good at mimicking voices. Jake is able to trigger Tim's memory so that Tim mimics the voices he heard on the night of the murder by using the trigger phrase \\"God Damn,\\" which were the first words Tim heard from the murder. He attempts to piece together the chronology of the murder, suspecting that Tim interrupted a fight between his parents and an intruder. Sheriff Mitch Rivers threatens to use drugs to get Tim to talk about the murder and Dr. Rene Harlinger successfully hypnotizes Tim into breaking down a locked door. The police chief, seeing this as proof of Tim's strength, concludes that Tim was the murderer, after finding photographs showing that Tim's father was molesting him. That night, Sylvie plans to take Tim away and attempts to convince Jake to run away with them. She fails, and instead paralyzes Jake and throws him into an icy lake to drown him.

Add them together to get: (4941 + 2499)*y = 124259 + 128701 Step 2: Perform the arithmetic operations on both sides Adding 4941 and 2499 gives us 7440, so the equation becomes: 7440*y = 124259 + 128701 Now, add 124259 and 128701: 124259 + 128701 = 252960 So the equation is now: 7440*y = 252960 Step 3: Solve for y by dividing both sides of the equation by 7440 To isolate y, divide both sides of the equation by 7440: y = 252960 / 7440 Step 4: Perform the final arithmetic operation to get the value of y 252960 / 7440 = 34 So the solution for y is: y = 34"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write an article based on this summary: – Slate offers kudos to a Virginia CBS affiliate for \\"breaking the scoop\\" of the Election 2016 campaign cycle: the story of a Midlothian man who says he sees Donald Trump in his bathroom tile. Per WTVR, Clayton Litten was perusing his new bathroom floor from his perch on the porcelain throne when he spotted what he says is a \\"one in a trillion\\" sighting—a \\"perfect\\" depiction of the GOP presumptive nominee within the tile's riveting Rorschach, standing with arms folded. \\"This cannot be. There's no way,\\" Litten tells the station he said when his eyes fell upon this lavatory vision, which he confirmed with workers who were still toiling away on his bathroom remodel. Litten, who's said to be suffering from incurable lung cancer, doesn't leave the house except for doctor visits, and he mainly corresponds with people via email, per the Genorosity.com page set up in his name. He tells WTVR he used that email account to shoot off a pic of the tile to Trump's campaign in the hopes that he might snag a meeting with the candidate when he's in nearby Richmond Friday for a rally.

WTVR reported on a Midlothian man who claims to see Donald Trump's image in his bathroom tile. Clayton Litten was on his porcelain throne scrutinizing his new bathroom floor when he claimed to experience a \\"one in a trillion\\" sighting – a \\"perfect\\" depiction of the then-GOP presumptive nominee within the tile's fascinating Rorschach pattern, standing upright with arms crossed. Astonished by the unexpected vision, Litten told WTVR, \\"This cannot be. There's no way.\\" Having lived with incurable lung cancer, Litten rarely leaves his house, let alone for doctor visits, and communicates primarily via email, as described on the Generosity.com page set up in his name. During the process of his bathroom renovation, Litten confirmed the image's likeness with his contractors who were still working on the remodel. Keen to share his rare discovery, Litten used his email account to send a picture of the tile to Trump's campaign, hoping to arrange a meeting with the presidential candidate when he'd be in Richmond for a rally. Expressing his support for Trump, Litten mentioned that regardless of the tile, he would vote for Trump in November (although he had not received a response from the campaign at the time). Meanwhile, WTVR is gathering public opinions on the \\"Trump tile\\" by sharing an image of Litten's discovery and polling viewers on whether they see Donald, don't see him, or see another candidate like Hillary Clinton.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: The brass instruments were only used for the 1 April 1725 version of what? ?  Bach structured the cantata in eight movements: an instrumental sinfonia and seven vocal movements corresponding to the stanzas of the hymn. The duration is given as 22 minutes.The title of the original parts of the first Leipzig performance is (in Johann Christoph Altnickol's handwriting): \\"Feria Paschatos / Christ lag in Todes Banden / a.4. Voc: / Cornetto / 3 Trombon. / 2 Violini / 2 Viole / con / Continuo / Di Sign. Joh.Seb.Bach\\", In this late version, Bach scored the work for four vocal parts (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T), and bass (B)), and a Baroque instrumental ensemble consisting of strings, brass and continuo. The brass parts, a choir of cornetto (Ct) and three trombones (Tb) playing colla parte with the voices at times, may have been added in the 1720s. They may also possibly represent the original scoring, in the style of the 17th-century polychoral tradition.The scoring of the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden has been described as \\"archaic\\" and its style \\"medieval\\": The string section consists of two violin parts (Vl) and two viola parts (VA); this indicates an older practice as for instance found in 17th-century church cantatas by Bach's ancestors (see Altbachisches Archiv), and in Jesus Christus ist um unsrer Missetat willen verwundet, a Passion setting from the early 18th century (or older) which Bach had performed a few years after composing the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden. In the first half of the 18th century the standard for a string section soon evolved to two violin parts, one viola part and continuo. The cornett used in the cantata was an instrument that belonged to an earlier age: by the second quarter of the 18th century it had almost entirely disappeared from Bach's compositions. The brass instruments were only used for the 1 April 1725 version of the work.  The other performances (24 April 1707, 8 April 1708, and 9 April 1724) were performed without brass instruments (i.e., Cornetto and three Trombones).

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Portugal's colonial history has long since been a cornerstone of its national identity, as has its geographic position at the south-western corner of Europe, looking out into the Atlantic Ocean. It was one of the last western colonial European powers to give up its overseas territories (among them Angola and Mozambique in 1975), turning over the administration of Macau to the People's Republic of China at the end of 1999. Consequently, it has both influenced and been influenced by cultures from former colonies or dependencies, resulting in immigration from these former territories for both economic and/or personal reasons. Portugal, long a country of emigration (the vast majority of Brazilians have Portuguese ancestry), has now become a country of net immigration, and not just from the last Indian (Portuguese until 1961), African (Portuguese until 1975), and Far East Asian (Portuguese until 1999) overseas territories. An estimated 800,000 Portuguese returned to Portugal as the country's African possessions gained independence in 1975. By 2007, Portugal had 10,617,575 inhabitants of whom about 332,137 were legal immigrants.\\"? The answer is:","output":"Based on the passage, \\"Portugal's colonial history has long since been a cornerstone of its national identity,\\" it is clear that colonialism has played a significant role in shaping Portugal's development, culture, and society. Additionally, the country has experienced both emigration and immigration, with individuals of Portuguese ancestry living in countries like Brazil and a large number of people returning to Portugal as its former African territories gained independence in 1975. Furthermore, Portugal has seen immigration not only from its former overseas territories but also from other parts of the world. A good question to test students' ability to read this passage and answer questions about it could be: How has Portugal's colonial history and geographic position impacted its culture, society, and immigration patterns? This question allows students to analyze the passage and draw conclusions about the lasting effects of Portugal's colonial past and its relationships with various countries and regions as both a source of emigration and a destination for immigration. To answer this question, students would need to consider the mentioned aspects of Portugal's colonial history, the return of Portuguese people to the country following the independence of its African territories, as well as the immigration from its former territories in India, Africa, and Far East Asia. Students should discuss the influence of colonialism and Portugal's location at the south-western corner of Europe, which has led to the exchange of cultures between Portugal and its former colonies. Students can also mention that by 2007, about 332,137 legal immigrants lived in Portugal, highlighting the shift from a country of emigration to one of net immigration. They should also acknowledge the impact this immigration has had on the Portuguese society, as people from various backgrounds and experiences contribute to a diverse and evolving culture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Sooner or later, all children will find themselves in a world where they need to obey the rules or suffer harsh consequences. By making your children obey the rules at home, you're actually doing them a favor in the long run. Don't ever punish your children unless they're disrespectful, but when they are, don't hesitate to show them that they've done something wrong. Your rules should be reasonable, simple, and consistent. Be clear with your children about what the rules in your house early on. Don't get upset if your children break a rule that they weren't even aware of. When your child is disrespectful to you, you have two choices: you can lash out in the same way, or you can fight to stay calm. The former option teaches your child that it is acceptable to be rude when someone starts frustrating you. The latter, which is the better choice, teaches that it's important to stay respectful even in the face of people who won't do the same for you. If you can manage to stay respectful, your children will thank you when they eventually have to deal with an annoying boss or an unpleasant teacher. This is vital. Consistent enforcement of your rules shows your children that it's not possible to weasel out of their responsibilities. On the other hand, if you fail to teach your children respect when you're tired or when it's inconvenient, they'll quickly learn that they can get away with bad behavior sometimes. Children are smarter than they're often given credit for. If there's a way for them to get out of learning a valuable lesson, they'll often find it. It's also important to make sure your partner is on the same page as you here. Having one caretaker who is \\"hard\\" and another who is \\"soft\\" will just teach your children to go to the soft one when they've misbehaved. Whenever you can, have the punishment for disrespect be the natural consequences of your child's actions. In other words, if their disrespect causes something bad to happen to them, let this happen (as long as it is not a serious, physical danger, obviously). The earlier children learn that being disrespectful only creates problems for themselves, the better. For example, if your child is repeatedly rude to her friend when they are playing together, a good natural consequence might be to send the friend home, have your child hand-write an apology letter, and hand-deliver it. Summary:","output":"The article stresses the importance of teaching children about the necessity to follow rules and respect others. It highlights that maintaining consistent, simple and reasonable rules at home will help children understand their responsibilities and expectations. It advises parents to establish clear house rules early on and not to punish children for violating rules they weren't aware of. Aggression should not be used in response to a child's disrespect, instead, remaining calm and respectful serves as a more efficient teaching tool. Consistently reinforcing rules and consequences helps children understand that they can't avoid their responsibilities. It suggests that parents should work together to enforce rules and avoid showing conflicting discipline styles. The best punishment for disrespect is allowing children to face the natural consequences of their actions, teaching them that disrespect brings unfavorable outcomes. For instance, if a child is repeatedly rude to a friend, they should be made to apologize personally."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Information:  - A duma () is a Russian assembly with advisory or legislative functions. The term comes from the Russian verb  (\\"dumat\\") meaning \\"to think\\" or \\"to consider\\". The first formally constituted duma was the State Duma introduced into the Russian Empire by Tsar Nicholas II in 1906. It was dissolved in 1917 during the Russian Revolution. Since 1993, the State Duma is the lower legislative house of the Russian Federation.  - Russia is not proportionately populated between the smaller western portion (almost 25%) of the country that is considered part of Europe, and the larger eastern portion (more than 75%) that is part of Asia. European Russia contains about 77% of the country's population (110,000,000 people out of about 144,000,000) in an area comprising almost 4 million km (1.54 million mi); an average of 27.5 persons per km (70 per mi). This territory makes up 38% of Europe. Its eastern border is defined by the Ural Mountains and in the south, it is defined by the border with Kazakhstan. This area includes Moscow and Saint Petersburg, the two largest cities in Russia.  - An upper house, sometimes called a Senate, is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature (or one of three chambers of a tricameral legislature), the other chamber being the lower house. The house formally designated as the upper house is usually smaller, and often has more restricted power, than the lower house. Examples of upper houses in countries include the UK's House of Lords, Canada's Senate, India's Rajya Sabha, Russia's Federation Council, Ireland's Seanad, Germany's Bundesrat and the United States Senate.  - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction.  - Russia (from the  Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.  - A legislature is a deliberative assembly with the authority to make laws for a political entity such as a country or city. Legislatures form important parts of most governments; in the separation of powers model, they are often contrasted with the executive and judicial branches of government.  - Saint Petersburg is Russia's second-largest city after Moscow, with five million inhabitants in 2012, and an important Russian port on the Baltic Sea. It is politically incorporated as a federal subject (a federal city). Situated on the Neva River, at the head of the Gulf of Finland on the Baltic Sea, it was founded by Tsar Peter the Great on May . In 1914, the name was changed from Saint Petersburg to Petrograd, in 1924 to Leningrad, and in 1991 back to Saint Petersburg. Between 17131728 and 17321918, Saint Petersburg was the imperial capital of Russia. In 1918, the central government bodies moved to Moscow.  - Moscow (or ) is the capital and most populous city of Russia, with 12.2 million residents within the city limits and 16.8 million within the urban area. Moscow has the status of a Russian federal city.  - Yekaterinburg, alternatively romanised as \\"Ekaterinburg\\", is the fourth-largest city in Russia and the administrative centre of Sverdlovsk Oblast, located in the middle of the Eurasian continent, on the border of Europe and Asia. At the 2010 Census, it had a population of 1,349,772.  - Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin (1 February 1931  23 April 2007) was a Soviet and Russian politician and the first President of the Russian Federation, serving from 1991 to 1999. Originally a supporter of Mikhail Gorbachev, Yeltsin emerged under the perestroika reforms as one of Gorbachev's most powerful political opponents. During the late 1980s, Yeltsin had been a member of the Politburo, and in late 1987 tendered a letter of resignation in protest. No one had resigned from the Politburo before. This act branded Yeltsin as a rebel and led to his rise in popularity as an anti-establishment figure.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data.  - Novosibirsk is the third-most populous city in Russia after Moscow and St. Petersburg. It is the most populous city in Asian Russia, with a population of 1,473,754 as of the 2010 Census. It is the administrative center of Novosibirsk Oblast as well as of the Siberian Federal District. The city is located in the southwestern part of Siberia on the banks of the Ob River adjacent to the Ob River Valley, near the large water reservoir formed by the dam of the Novosibirsk Hydro Power Plant, and occupies an area of .  - Nikolay Ilyich Travkin ( Russian :    ) ( born 19 March 1947 ) is a Russian and former Soviet politician , former member of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union , member of State Duma and member of the Government of the Russian Federation ( 1994 - 1996 ) . In March 1990 he resigned from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and founded of the Democratic Party of Russia .  - Nizhny Novgorod, colloquially shortened to Nizhny, is a city in the administrative center of Nizhny Novgorod Oblast and Volga Federal District in Russia. From 1932 to 1990, it was known as Gorky, after the writer Maxim Gorky, who was born there. The city is an important economic, transportation, scientific, educational and cultural center in Russia and the vast Volga-Vyatka economic region, and is the main center of river tourism in Russia. In the historical part of the city there are a large number of universities, theaters, museums and churches. Nizhny Novgorod is located about 400 km east of Moscow, where the Oka empties into the Volga. Population:   - A constitution is a set of fundamental principles or established precedents according to which a state or other organization is governed. These rules together make up, i.e. \\"constitute\\", what the entity is. When these principles are written down into a single document or set of legal documents, those documents may be said to embody a \\"written\\" constitution; if they are written down in a single comprehensive document, it is said to embody a \\"codified\\" constitution. Some constitutions (such as the constitution of the United Kingdom) are uncodified, but written in numerous fundamental Acts of a legislature, court cases or treaties.  - The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union (\\"Verkhóvnyj Sovét SSSR\\") was the highest legislative body in the Soviet Union and the only one with the power to pass constitutional amendments. It elected the Presidium serving as the collective head of state of the Soviet Union, formed the Council of Ministers and the Supreme Court, and appointed the Procurator General of the Soviet Union.  - The State Duma ((Gosudarstvennaya Duma), common abbreviation:  (Gosduma)) in the Russian Federation is the lower house of the Federal Assembly of Russia (legislature), the upper house being the Federation Council of Russia. The Duma headquarters are located in central Moscow, a few steps from Manege Square. Its members are referred to as deputies. The State Duma replaced the Supreme Soviet as a result of the new constitution introduced by Boris Yeltsin in the aftermath of the Russian constitutional crisis of 1993, and approved by the Russian public in a referendum.

Let's solve the math problem step by step like we're telling a story. We want to find the number that y stands for. So we start with this problem: 572 * y - 33 + 154 = 693 * y First, let's do the adding part. We have -33 and +154. When we add these two numbers, we get: 121 (Because 154 - 33 = 121) Now our problem looks like this: 572 * y + 121 = 693 * y To find y, we need to get all the \\"y\\" parts on one side. Let's move the 572 * y to the other side by subtracting it from both sides: 693 * y - 572 * y = 121 Now, let's subtract: 121 * y = 121 We're almost there! To find out what y is, we need to divide both numbers by 121: y = 121 / 121 And when we do that, we find that: y = 1 So, in this math problem, y stands for the number 1.

Q: Human protectin (CD59) is a regulator of complement activation that inhibits complement-mediated cell lysis, and thus might confer immune resistance to tumor cells. CD59 expression has been described in a variety of human malignancies, including breast cancer. Since a comprehensive investigation of CD59 expression in prostate cancer has not been conducted yet, we aimed to determine the significance of CD59 expression in prostate cancer.', 'Eighty-six primary adenocarcinomas of the prostate were immunostained using a monoclonal CD59 antibody (clone MEM-43) and a standard detection system. The immunoreactivity of the tumor was evaluated as low versus high for statistical analysis. Additionally, CD59 mRNA levels were determined by real-time PCR in matched (tumor/normal) microdissected tissues from 26 cases.', 'Cytoplasmic CD59 immunoreactivity was found in epithelia of prostate cancer, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, benign hyperplasia, atrophic, and normal glands. High rates of CD59 expression were noted in 36% of prostate cancer cases and were significantly associated with tumor pT stage (P = 0.043), Gleason grade (P = 0.013) and earlier biochemical (PSA) relapse in Kaplan-Meier analysis (P = 0.0013). On RNA level, we found an upregulation in 19.2% (five cases), although the general rate of CD59 transcript was significantly lower in tumor tissue (P = 0.03). A:","output":"Part 1: Construct a question based on the information in the passage. Usage: What is the main aim of the study conducted on CD59 expression in prostate cancer? The question is based on information provided in the passage and focuses on the main aim of the study. Part 2: Ensure the question is unambiguous. Usage: What is the relationship between CD59 expression levels and Gleason grade? The question is clear and directly asks about the relationship between CD59 expression levels and Gleason grade, as mentioned in the passage. Part 3: Make sure the question can be answered using the passage. Usage: How many primary adenocarcinomas of the prostate were studied for CD59 expression? This question can be answered directly from the passage, which states that 86 primary adenocarcinomas were studied. Part 4: Ensure the answer to the question is unique. Usage: In how many cases was CD59 mRNA upregulated in the microdissected tissue samples? The answer to this question is unique, as it is clearly stated in the passage (five cases). Part 5: The answer should use text phrases from the passage. Usage: What is the relationship between high rates of CD59 expression and tumor pT stage in prostate cancer cases? The answer to this question can be found using the text phrase \\"significantly associated\\" from the passage, as it states that high rates of CD59 expression are significantly associated with tumor pT stage. Part 6: Avoid creating questions that cannot be answered correctly without understanding the passage. Usage: What is the function of human protectin (CD59)? The answer to this question requires understanding the passage, which states that CD59 is a regulator of complement activation that inhibits complement-mediated cell lysis. Part 7: Avoid using the same words or phrases given in the passage. Usage: What is the relationship between CD59 expression and biochemical relapse in prostate cancer cases? This question has been rephrased to avoid the exact same words as the passage but still asks about the connection between CD59 expression and biochemical relapse, as discussed in the passage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A woman is seen speaking to the camera while sitting in a chair and leads to hear sitting in a shower holding a dog. she","output":"then begins to explain her story, providing the context for the unusual setting and situation we've just witnessed. The woman, named Sarah, is a devoted animal lover and advocate who dedicates her life to rescuing and rehabilitating animals in need. The dog she's holding in the shower, whom she has named Oscar, is her latest rescue. This particular scene captures her ongoing efforts to support Oscar's physical and emotional recovery. Sarah starts by detailing how she came across Oscar, who was found abandoned and in poor health near a local park. Someone had left him without food or water, and suffering from multiple injuries, most likely inflicted by a previous owner. Oscar was in a severe state of shock and fear, barely responsive to human touch. Sarah's mission was to give him a second chance at life by giving him the care, love, and affection he desperately required. In the video, Sarah discusses the importance of patience and understanding when dealing with traumatized animals. She emphasizes that the first step in rehabilitating any rescued animal is to create a sense of safety and trust. In Oscar's case, this involved introducing him to her home, her other rescued pets, and allowing him to gradually familiarize himself with his new surroundings. The video then transitions to the scene in the shower, where Sarah explains that she's using this space to help Oscar overcome his fear of water. Abused animals often associate water with negative experiences or punishment, so it's crucial for Sarah to gently encourage Oscar to view water as a source of comfort and cleanliness. By sitting alongside him in the shower and calmly talking to him as she cradles him in her arms, she's providing a nurturing environment in which Oscar can slowly learn to let go of his fears and anxieties. Throughout the video, Sarah intersperses her own experiences and tips with expert advice from veterinarians and animal behaviorists. This balanced approach highlights the importance of a well-rounded strategy when it comes to the care and rehabilitation of rescued animals like Oscar. Sarah also emphasizes the value of networking and collaborating with local animal shelters, rescue organizations, and other animal lovers in the community. By working together, these individuals and groups can raise awareness, provide valuable resources, and ultimately create a supportive network to help save the lives of countless animals in need. Towards the end of the video, Sarah shares updates on Oscar's progress. With time, love, patience, and proper care, he has slowly started to trust humans again and is beginning to play with Sarah's other pets. His physical wounds are healing, and he's becoming more comfortable and at ease in his environment. By sharing her experiences and providing helpful advice on how to care for and rehabilitate rescued animals, Sarah aims to inspire others to take action, get involved and make a difference in the lives of abandoned, abused, or neglected animals. Through her video and ongoing advocacy efforts, she hopes to create a more compassionate world where animals like Oscar can find a safe haven and a loving home. In conclusion, the story that most naturally follows the initial scene of a woman sitting in a chair leading to her sitting in a shower holding a dog is one of hope, love, and transformation. It is a journey in which Sarah helps Oscar overcome his past traumas and rediscover the joy and beauty of life with the support of a caring human companion and a nurturing environment."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Let's examine each sentence to identify the similarities and differences. In the first sentence: 1. \\"George Monbiot argued in contrast to Stanage\\" - The phrase \\"in contrast to\\" indicates that Monbiot's argument goes against or has opposite viewpoints from Stanage's argument. 2. \\"who had written that the Iraqi insurgency is comparable to the IRA\\" - The use of the simple present \\"is\\" suggests that the written idea is still relevant and applicable today. In the second sentence: 1. \\"George Monbiot argued in opposition to Stanage\\" - The phrase \\"in opposition to\\" similarly implies that Monbiot's argument is in contrast or disagreement with Stanage. Though the use of \\"opposition\\" is slightly stronger than \\"contrast,\\" both expressions underline this disagreement. 2. \\"who had written that the Iraqi insurgency was comparable to the IRA\\" - Here, the past tense \\"was\\" is employed, indicating that the written idea was relevant at the time of writing but may not necessarily remain true or applicable today.

That question is not difficult to answer if we change the word poetry to songs. I sing when I feel good. When I sing my favorite songs, I feel even better. Sometimes when I am listening to music and to the song words, I feel that it was written for me. A good song always makes me feel something. There are songs that I sing in my head between classes and songs that I want to sing when the school bell rings by the end of the day. They help me get through the day.  _ I like songs about love and friendship. The extraordinary thing is that my feelings are more special when I sing my favorite songs in English. I also like reading. I used to avoid poetry until an e-friend told me I should recite poems and not look up the meaning of the words. Poetry uses many difficult words and idioms, but the best thing is to just forget about them. In the beginning I felt quite strange. Now I always lock the door. Reading aloud gives you a strange feeling, but when you have some practice and fall into the rhythm, and the sounds of the words, it is really a special experience. I started with small poems, but now I think I most like long poems. I have different feelings with different poems. When I have had a bad day at school, I read Keats and forget everything.

Options: - fast food restaurant - mall - high school - job - nightclub  Explain why a human would choose \\"high school\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would likely choose \\"high school\\" as the place that teenagers hate to go to the most but have the most incentive to attend because of the various factors that contribute to teenagers' feelings about high school and the importance society places on education. 1. Peer pressure and social anxiety: High schools are often places where teenagers experience various social pressures, anxiety, and bullying, as they navigate the complex process of building friendships, fitting in, or dealing with social hierarchies. Consequently, students might not enjoy the experience and dread attending school. 2. Academic pressure: Teenagers are often expected to perform well academically to ensure a successful future, sometimes leading to a considerable amount of stress and anxiety. They may have to tackle numerous assignments, prepare for examinations, or maintain good grades, which might contribute to their dislike of high school. 3. Early start times and lack of sleep: High schools typically have early start times, which can be challenging for teenagers, who may biologically be better predisposed to stay up late and sleep in. 4. Rules and discipline: High school is a structured environment with rules, dress codes, and schedules, which might not sit well with some teenagers, especially as they prefer to assert their independence and autonomy. 5. Boredom or disinterest: Teenagers might not enjoy all subjects taught in high school or find the traditional classroom setting unengaging, leading to boredom or lack of motivation. Despite these factors, high school provides significant incentives for teenagers: 1. Education and personal growth: Attending high school is essential for teenagers to acquire knowledge, learn new subjects, and gain essential life skills, all of which contribute to their personal development and growth. 2. Social interactions: High school provides opportunities to build and maintain friendships, engage in extracurricular activities, and gain exposure to diverse perspectives, which can be beneficial for personal and social development. 3. College and career preparation: High school education is typically mandatory for pursuing college education or professional opportunities in most fields. A high school diploma demonstrates a minimum level of academic accomplishment and is usually a prerequisite for further education and many job opportunities. 4. Scholarships and financial aid: Performing well in high school can potentially lead to scholarships and financial aid for college, providing motivation for students to take their academic pursuit seriously. In conclusion, high school is often the place where teenagers may feel the most pressure and dislike attending, but it holds the most incentive due to its crucial role in shaping their future education and career prospects. The other options in the list may not come with as much stress or impact on their future, making \\"high school\\" the most likely answer to the question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does it follow that \\"Those crafty Chinese. \\"?","output":"While it is possible that the original statement, \\"Ah, yes, those wily Asians,\\" might be an attempt to refer to a stereotype or commonly held belief, it's important to note that making sweeping generalizations about any racial, ethnic, or national group is both inaccurate and unfair. In the case of the question \\"Does it follow that 'Those crafty Chinese'?\\", it’s essential to examine the context and implications of such a statement and evaluate it based on the facts. The perception of people from China or any other Asian country as being \\"wily\\" or \\"crafty\\" can stem from a variety of historical, cultural, and socio-political factors. Historically, several Asian countries have been known for their diplomacy and strategic thinking in matters of war, trade, and politics. This historical legacy may contribute to the stereotype that is often associated with them. However, it's important to recognize that individuals from any country, including China, should not be judged or stereotyped based on the actions or beliefs of their fellow citizens, historic events, or governments. There is an enormous amount of diversity in cultures, beliefs, values, and personalities within any given population. In that regard, it is crucial to avoid making any sweeping generalizations or perpetuating stereotypes about any ethnic or cultural group, including Chinese people. Adopting such attitudes can lead to racial and cultural biases, discrimination, and misunderstanding. Moreover, it oversimplifies an entire group of people and disregards the uniqueness and complexity of their individual experiences. Instead of relying on stereotypes to describe or understand others, it is more constructive to evaluate individuals on a case-by-case basis, focusing on their personal qualities and characteristics. By doing so, we can foster greater understanding, compassion, and respect for people from different backgrounds and contribute to a more open and inclusive society. In summary, while it is possible that the statement \\"Those crafty Chinese\\" is using a stereotype based on historical and cultural factors, it is crucial to avoid perpetuating these generalizations.

Inzamam-ul-Haq ( pronunciation ;Punjabi, Urdu: nDmm lHq; born 3 March 1970), also known as Inzy, is a former Pakistani cricketer, and former captain. He is the leading run scorer for Pakistan in one-day internationals, and the third-highest run scorer for Pakistan in Test cricket. He was the captain of the Pakistan national cricket team from 2003-07 and is considered to be one of the best leaders in Pakistan Cricket history. Inzamam rose to fame in the semi-final of the 1992 Cricket World Cup. Inzamam captained Pakistan in thirty Tests, winning eleven, drawing nine and losing ten. Only three players have captained Pakistan in more Test matches, but all have better win-loss records and only Imran Khan has a lower win percentage than Inzamam. Although the Oval Test match in 2006 was poised as a victory for Pakistan before the controversy took place and had it not occurred, Inzamam's record would have had a win more and a loss less. However, Inzamam held the captaincy until March 2007, the longest captaincy tenure since 1992, when Imran Khan retired.  Captaincy had a positive effect on Inzamam's batting, often leading by example in pressure situations, averaging greater as a captain (52) than without (50). In ODI's Inzamam also held the highest average as captain in ODI's and is currently third on that list behind the former Australian skipper Ricky Ponting and the Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni. After early failures in Australia, he took a depleted Pakistan side to India in 2005 and played an important role in securing a draw by winning the final test match from an unlikely position with an innings of 184 runs. He subsequently led his side to an ODI success against West Indies (away), England (home) and Sri Lanka (away) as well as Test Series victories against England (home), India (home), Sri Lanka (away). Inzamam had seemed to have united the Pakistan side and victories led them to 2nd place in the ICC Test Rankings and 3rd place in the ICC ODI Ranking. The latter part of Inzamam's tenure as Pakistan captain was less successful and the team was embroiled in many controversies culminating in a disappointingly early exit from the 2007 Cricket World Cup at the hands of lowly ranked Ireland.  In the 2007 Cricket World Cup, Inzamam captained the Pakistani team to its first loss to associate ICC member Ireland (on St Patrick's Day). This result and their previous loss to West Indies, led to them being knocked out of the tournament. A day later he announced his retirement from One Day International Cricket and resignation as Test captain. The announcement was made the same day that Bob Woolmer, Pakistan's coach, died in his hotel room in Kingston, Jamaica. He dedicated his final ODI to Woolmer to whom he shared a good relationship with for three years and affectionately called him 'The Bob'.

Context: I have a chronic illness, and so I received quite a few sterling gems in the months between onset and accurate diagnosis. I had one GP — let’s call him Dr Douche. I promise, it’s the kindest way I could describe him. “The jacket means I know things.” He came up with wilder and wilder theories as to why I was sick, and kept getting sicker. It should be said beforehand that few of these theories were embodied. He was sure it was something in my ladybrains that was preventing proper function of the rest of me. Dr Douche said so much weird, wild, and just-plain-unbelievable crap over the course of my diagnosis that someday I may create a novel that incorporates it all. But this here has to be the blue ribbon winner. I was describing a symptom to him: every time I got up in the morning, when I first stood, my heart would pound, my heart rate would accelerate, and I’d feel dizzy. After a few probing questions — (only in the morning? — no, but it’s worst in the morning)… “Maybe,” he said sensitively, “you’re afraid.” “Of standing?” I asked, just to be sure. “You think I’m afraid of… standing up.” Maybe he meant there was some kind of existential fear, like, we’re all afraid, it’s a big old universe out there, and he wanted some comfort and reassurance. Nope. The man genuinely thought I had such a profound fear of verticality, that I was having a near-panic in response to being upright. POTS, folks. It was POTS. Literally THE most common sign/symptom/syndrome of autonomic dysfunction. The most common one.

As always, lighting was minimal (as opposed to Bee's workshop out behind the house, which was flooded with fluorescents). A bank of TV sets and computer monitors covered one whole wall, arranged on a precarious system of metal shelves that Bee had installed herself. A low, flat coffee table squatted below the glowing displays, supporting three keyboards, a bank of video editing tools and four different phone carriages. Bee sat in her accustomed place - in the midst of a pile of cushions on the floor, fiddling with a mouse in one hand and typing on one of the keyboards while she talked quietly into her headset. Paul and Chloe didn't bother to knock as they came in - Bee already knew they were there. Paul glanced at one of the screens mounted on the wall. Its display, divided into four quadrants, showed various images from inside the house, including the front door they'd just come through and the stairs they'd just climbed. The screen next to it - which Paul himself had salvaged from a bar on Duval that'd recently renovated into a finedining restaurant - showed images from four other cameras that covered the house's exterior.

This was about a month ago. It was the last day I worked. Memorial Day at the city rec center is SLOW, especially when it's beautiful outside, but for some reason, we had two front desk attendants: me, and “bully #1”. Bully #1 clearly had a major distaste for me. She hated my tattoos, the way I would get into a heated debate one day with a police officer patron, then have a fantastic conversation with him days later about legalizing marijuana. She hated that I was liked, but still could give fuck-all about what others thought of me. Bully #2 was our financial director, who got stuck as the manager on duty that day. I honestly never had a clue she didn't like me. She was intense and sarcastic with everyone. I liked her style. On this day, I really got the feeling they were trash talking me pretty hard, the way they kept disappearing, talking over me, laughing like mean girls. I blew it off, because I was down an internet rabbit hole, trying to wrap my brain around some concepts.

I spun around in my chair, locked eyes with #2, and asked her: “What do you know about Machiavellianism?” I swear to God, all I wanted was her take on it (she's a smart cookie), and all hell broke loose.

Given the question: I can use this background: At the mid-oceanic ridges, two tectonic plates diverge from one another as new oceanic crust is formed by the cooling and solidifying of hot molten rock. Because the crust is very thin at these ridges due to the pull of the tectonic plates, the release of pressure leads to adiabatic expansion (without transfer of heat or matter) and the partial melting of the mantle, causing volcanism and creating new oceanic crust. Most divergent plate boundaries are at the bottom of the oceans; therefore, most volcanic activity on the Earth is submarine, forming new seafloor. Black smokers (also known as deep sea vents) are evidence of this kind of volcanic activity. Where the mid-oceanic ridge is above sea-level, volcanic islands are formed; for example, Iceland.  Now, I have a new situation: Two oceans have divergent plate boundaries at the bottom of their floor. The Arctic ocean has a single dormant divergent plate, while the Pacific ocean has seven diverging tectonic plates under its waters.  Answer this question please: Which ocean experiences less cooling of hot molten rock? The answer is:","output":"The Arctic Ocean experiences less cooling of hot molten rock. In this situation, we have two oceans with divergent plate boundaries at the bottom of their floors. The Arctic Ocean has a single dormant divergent plate, while the Pacific Ocean has seven diverging tectonic plates under its waters.  The cooling of hot molten rock is related to the formation of new oceanic crust at mid-oceanic ridges, where two tectonic plates move away from one another. This process occurs when the mantle beneath the ridge partially melts due to adiabatic expansion, and the molten rock rises, cools, and solidifies, forming new crust. The overall cooling effect will be greater in regions with more active divergent plate boundaries, as there will be more new crust generated. Since the Arctic Ocean has only a single dormant divergent plate, the amount of new ocean crust formation and associated cooling of hot molten rock will be less than in the Pacific Ocean, which has seven diverging tectonic plates. The higher number of diverging plates in the Pacific Ocean indicates a higher level of tectonic activity, and hence, more substantial cooling of hot molten rock as new oceanic crust is formed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Our high school has done many productions of children's stories and almost always receives a positive response, so I was not worried about the content of the play being too infantile. But this play was adapted from the original book to be performed by a group of 6th graders. The age group it was intended for shows blatantly.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. with the introduction of christianity, religious power was transferred to the church and these blót feasts lost their significance. Make this proper case.","output":"With the introduction of Christianity, religious power underwent a significant transition as it was transferred to the Church. This development had a notable impact on the cultural and religious practices of societies that embraced Christianity. One such practice that experienced change was the tradition of Blót feasts. Blót feasts were important pagan rituals performed among Germanic and Norse societies. They had a deep religious significance that centered around the concept of sacrificing to their gods and goddesses, as well as ancestral spirits. These feasts were conducted in sacred places such as temples, groves, or even individual homes. The primary goal of Blót feasts was to maintain a favorable relationship with these deities and ancestral spirits, as well as to seek guidance, protection, and blessings for various aspects of life, such as fertility, successful harvests, and victory in battles. When Christianity began to spread within these societies, religious power was no longer solely vested in the pagan priests or priestesses but instead, it was handed over to the Church. Consequently, the Church became the central authority on religion and spirituality, with its teachings and rituals slowly replacing the traditional practices. As a part of this process, the Church actively discouraged the continued practice of Blót feasts in favor of Christian rites and ceremonies. It is crucial to note that the conversion to Christianity did not happen overnight; it was a gradual process, and sometimes there was a period where both pagan and Christian practices coexisted in these societies. The consequences of transferring religious power to the Church included the decline of the cultural importance and religious significance of Blót feasts. As Christianity became more deeply rooted within these societies, the Church expanded its influence, and the importance of maintaining a relationship with the pagan gods and goddesses began to wane. In turn, this resulted in a diminished emphasis on the power and relevance of the Blót feasts. Over time, the observance of these rituals faded away, and their practice was eventually completely supplanted by Christian ceremonies and rituals. It is essential to acknowledge the broader sociopolitical implications of this transfer of religious power. The Church's growing authority in these societies led to a centralization of power and allowed rulers who adopted Christianity to consolidate their control over others, often using this newfound religious authority as a means of legitimizing their rule. In conclusion, the introduction of Christianity and the subsequent transfer of religious power to the Church marked a pivotal shift in the cultural and religious practices of Germanic and Norse societies. With the decline of traditional pagan practices, Blót feasts lost their significance as they were supplanted by Christian rituals and teachings. The repercussions of this transformation extended beyond the realm of religion, as the emerging role of the Church in society led to broader sociopolitical changes as well."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In this Aug. 30, 2012, file photo, a tour group walks through the campus of Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass. (Elise Amendola/AP)      The Korean math prodigy at one of the nation’s top high schools had Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg on the phone, personally encouraging the teenager to attend Harvard University. She received letters from Harvard professors, encouraging her to bring her brilliant abilities to Cambridge next fall instead of accepting her admission to Stanford University on the opposite coast.      As the student struggled to decide between five-figure scholarship promises from both schools, she received a novel offer: She could spend two years at each elite school as part of an arrangement just for her. The exciting dual-enrollment opportunity garnered star-struck coverage from Korean media outlets, which dubbed her the “Genius Girl.”      But none of it was true.      The baffling hoax has stunned Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Fairfax County, the top-ranked magnet program known as an intellectual proving ground for science wunderkinder, technology gurus, engineering buffs and math wizards — many of whom earn their way to the nation’s most prestigious colleges.      The senior’s tale of academic conquest of admission into what turned out to be a bogus program apparently was designed to impress her parents, peers and teachers as part of the annual cutthroat competition for the relatively tiny number of spots at the nation’s top schools. The faked admission story went much further than most teen fantasies: It made its way to the international media, where the student’s parents admitted the truth and publicly shamed themselves before the Korean community.      Many graduates of TJ, as the school is known, go on to illustrious academic careers. Just recently, a senior who had a 4.57 grade-point average, aced 13 Advanced Placement tests and founded a national nonprofit organization before her 18th birthday earned admission to all eight Ivy League schools, which made national headlines. Another senior, who designed the electronics system for a 6-foot, 120-pound robot capable of lifting crates, received a scholarship from the SpaceX aerospace corporation, founded by Internet billionaire Elon Musk.      [The real deal: Virginia student earns admission to all eight Ivy League schools, and others]      The question now at the school is what caused the student to concoct the elaborate college admissions scheme. The answer seems obvious to students and teachers there: overwhelming pressure to succeed from parents and unrealistic expectations from the teens themselves.      “We celebrate the accomplishment of students who get into all eight Ivies,” said Brandon Kosatka, TJ’s director of student services. “That’s the bar, and our kids are shooting for that. They don’t like to be the second-best. If that’s the bar, then, yes, that creates anxiety for them.”      One student, who spoke anonymously to offer a candid view of the school’s climate, said teenagers are expected to boast impressive extracurricular activities on top of stellar grades.      “You’re going to have pressure to do well,” the student said. “But you also need to play 17 different sports and instruments.”      Fairfax County schools spokesman John Torre declined to comment. School Board member Ilryong Moon, whose two sons graduated from TJ and attended Harvard and Brown, said the school is very popular in Northern Virginia’s Korean community. Admission is highly selective, and Asians are accepted at a higher rate than their peers; next year’s freshman class is 70 percent Asian.      “In general, I feel that it’s not just TJ, but all of our students are feeling more and more pressure to do well,” Moon said. “The competition is becoming stiffer.”      Jung Jong-chul, education attache at the Korean Embassy in Washington, said TJ is known as one of the top high schools in the area and well known “for some Korean people who know or live around the D.C. area.” That might explain why the story exploded overseas.      The college admissions process can be perplexing for students who are used to solving math equations with definitive answers, Kosatka said. Some students measure their academic success based on college admissions, he said, which can lead to devastating moments of realization when rejection letters arrive in mailboxes.      “They are big fish in a small pond,” Kosatka said. “It’s a big self-esteem blow when you learn there are other big fish out there, that you’re just another star among stars. . . . Sometimes it’s not in the cards, and that’s difficult for students who are accustomed to being successful to swallow.”      A lot of the pressure that students feel comes from parents and teachers, he added: “They don’t want to let down the adults in their lives.”      That stress appeared to be too much for at least one young woman at TJ, who goes by her nickname, Sara.      In breathless coverage in the Korean media, the student was hailed as the “Genius Girl,” who made her parents immensely proud by gaining acceptance and scholarships at two of the best schools in the country. According to Korean reports, she had Harvard and Stanford professors fighting for her to enroll. Several news outlets reported that Zuckerberg called her to persuade her to choose Harvard, which he attended for two years. A spokesman for Zuckerberg declined to comment.      The student and her family granted interviews, which appeared in overseas coverage and in Korean American news. The Washington Post is not identifying the student, because she is a minor who has not been accused of a crime. Attempts to reach the student’s family were unsuccessful, and her father did not respond to an e-mailed request for comment.      The student “answered the phone one day, and it was Zuckerberg, so she was surprised,” her mother told the Korean publication Newsis. “He said he was in Panama and that he had called her because it was easier to talk by phone than by e-mail.”      But students at TJ grew suspicious and began questioning the story. That skepticism made its way to online e-mail discussion groups in the Washington region. Then, earlier this month, the entire senior class at TJ received an e-mail from a person claiming to be Harvard mathematics professor Joseph Daniel Harris.      “We’ve heard various rumors related to Sara, and I am here to put it to an end,” the e-mail read. “In addition, we’ve heard numerous comments related to her research and achievements, but we know much more than all of you guys know, so it needs to stop.”      Harvard officials told The Post that the e-mail from Harris was a forgery.      The ruse unraveled when Sara’s father wrote an apology to Korean news publications.      “I am sincerely sorry for causing trouble with what is not true,” he wrote, according to Yonhap, the South Korean news agency. “I am deeply repentant that I failed to watch properly over how painful and difficult a situation the child has been in so far and that I even aggravated and enlarged her suffering. . . . From now on, the whole family will live a quiet life, devoting ourselves to getting the child cured well and taking good care of her. Please forgive me for being unable to offer detailed explanations as the situation has not been completely figured out yet.”      Officials at Harvard and Stanford declined to say whether the student was accepted to either school.      In a statement to The Post, Harvard spokeswoman Anna Cowenhoven wrote that the university was made aware of claims that the student received “three admissions letters and multiple e-mail communications.”      “None of these communications were sent by Harvard, and we can confirm that they are all forgeries,” Cowenhoven wrote. “There is no program in existence through which a student is admitted to spend two years at Harvard College and two years at Stanford University.”      Stanford spokeswoman Lisa Lapin wrote in a statement to The Post that admissions letters Sara provided to Korean media organizations “were not authentic and were not issued by Stanford University.”      Lapin also said that a Stanford professor who was quoted in Korean media about Sara had never spoken to the media about her and neither met nor communicated with her.      “Stanford also does not have any type of program that would allow an undergraduate student to be admitted to two universities,” Lapin said.      TJ’s Kosatka said that instead of emphasizing students’ admission to selective colleges, parents and teachers should focus on ensuring that the teenagers are getting into schools that are the right fit for their talents and interests.      “There’s a disconnect,” Kosatka said. “We spend a lot of time socially saying, ‘Oh, who got into Harvard, Princeton, Brown and Yale?’ We send a mixed message.”      Michelle Lee contributed to this report. ||||| Two weeks ago, a South Korean \\"math prodigy\\" made headlines across the country after claiming that she had been accepted into two prestigious American universities, Stanford and Harvard.      Kim Jung-yoon, a senior at Thomas Jefferson high School for Science and Technology in Virginia, rose to fame after media reported that the top-tier universities had competed to recruit her to their undergraduate programs and ended up creating a special shared programme only for her to study at both schools.      According to the reports, the 18-year-old girl secured a rare chance to study at both schools and choose where to graduate from. Kim showed acceptance letters from the schools to back her claims.      Kim was featured on radio talk shows while her father contributed to the hype by conducting interviews with local news outlets.      The reports on Kim's achievement sparked envy among Koreans who have been living in a climate where admission into top universities is seen as key to elevating their social status.      But about a week later, her whole story was unraveled, with both Harvard and Stanford universities denying the acceptance of the Korean student. The universities confirmed that there was no such joint programme allowing a student to study at both schools, calling the acceptance letters provided by Kim forgeries.      Kim, who appears to have masterminded the whole furor herself, immediately went from being idolized to ridiculed, with her father apologising last week for causing a stir and promising to take care of her mental health.      Putting aside the reason behind her scam, the scandal appeared to leave a bitter aftertaste here, as it bluntly illustrated the country's avid obsession with academic elitism and a competitive media industry prone to lapses of judgment.      A 28-year-old student said he could sympathize with her as he understands what it feels like to fail to enter top-tier universities and to be treated like a \\"loser\\" in Korean society.      \\"I have felt that entering a renowned university is a way to have my voice heard in Korean society,\\" Lee, who wanted to be identified only by his surname, told The Korea Herald. Lee is studying for a master's at a Seoul-based university after receiving a diploma from a lesser-known college.      \\"When I criticise the social structure, people think that I am complaining due to my poor educational background,\\" he said. \\"Then, I become a loser again.\\"      In Korea, it has been considered a norm that one's diploma defines the rest of his or her life, from career to even marriage prospects.      Cliques are formed based on educational backgrounds, with graduates from the nation's top universities taking up high positions on the social ladder and dominating academia, business and politics.      The infamous Korean helicopter moms enroll their toddlers in English-language kindergartens, in desperate hopes that the child will not be left behind in the fierce competition to enter the country's best universities, or if not, prestigious ones abroad.      Kim is one of the kids who might have felt pressured to impress her parents, said Seol Dong-hoon, a sociology professor from Chonbuk National University.      \\"The whole hullaballoo could have only been a family issue, but Kim's father made her lie public by showing off his daughter's achievement through the media,\\" Seol said.      Indeed, Kim's case was only the latest in a long list of academic fabrication cases in Korea.      One of the most high-profile scandals came in 2007 when Shin Jeong-ah, an art history professor at Dongguk University, faked her academic record.      On the back of her distinguished degrees from Yale and University of Kansas, Shin rapidly shot to prominence in the local art world. She was appointed codirector of the Gwangju Biennale, one of the biggest art events in East Asia, at the age of 35.      But Shin fell from grace when her academic accomplishments turned out to be forged. She resigned from all her posts and was eventually convicted of falsifying records and embezzlement.      The Shin case triggered a wave of similar allegations and confessions across the nation involving a professor, movie director, renowned architect, leading actors and actresses and even a respected monk.      Behind the academic fraud cases is Koreans' belief that educational backgrounds indicate \\"status\\" in society, experts said.      \\"Koreans have viewed an academic degree as a prerequisite to success and climbing up the social ladder, which has intensified competition for admission to prestigious universities,\\" Shin Kwang-yeong, a sociology professor from Chung-Ang University, told The Korea Herald.      And the belief has more than 1,000 years of history to it.      \\"Back in history, only aristocrats had a chance to take a state-administered exam to rise in social status,\\" Shin said, referring to the Goryeo (918-1392) and Joseon (1392-1895) dynasties under which people took the Gwageo, the national civil service exam to advance into society.      \\"But now, exams are standardized and institutionalized so that anyone in any class can take an exam, get respectable degrees and enter the upper tier of society,\\" he added.      With the country's leading businesses and key national exams still favouring those with prestigious diplomas, the obsession to embellish one's academic record persists, experts said.      A recent survey suggested that university degrees still have a huge impact on new graduates' job prospects. According to a survey of 418 firms by recruitment site Saramin, 88.5 per cent of the surveyed companies said that they have given an advantage to those holding a degree from renowned universities in the resume screening process.      Asked about the reason behind the practice, the companies said that they saw prestigious degrees as a result of one's efforts and a means of objectively measuring job seekers' abilities.      Other experts pointed out the Kim's scandal was also a result of poor quality journalism.      After it was found to be fabricated, a mainstream media outlet published a lengthy correction after having covered the teenage girl's story.      \\"Kim's story had every element that can excite Koreans ― the success of a Korean abroad and acceptance into prestigious universities,\\" said Choi Jin-bong, who teaches mass communications at Sungkonghoe University.      \\"That's perhaps why Korean media hastily picked up the story.\\"      With the news about Kim going viral in Korea after first being covered by a Korean newspaper in the US, the local media continued to reproduce the story until parents and students at Kim's school raised questions about her credentials, which later prompted a local daily to check the supposed facts.      \\"Amid fierce competition to attract readers and generate traffic online, local news outlets lack a system to check facts before reporting,\\" Choi said, pinpointing a structural problem of online journalism driven by \\"stimulating\\" stories.      \\"Such diminishing media ethics can strike us all in the long run,\\" Choi added.      Above all, the Kim case sounds the alarm to a society that has been pushing its youth to \\"risk their lives\\" to get into top-tier universities, said Kim Ji-ae, an activist campaigning to break academic cliques in society.      \\"The 18-year-old girl is not the only one to blame. Korean society that has made a university degree a source of pride or inferiority should take the blame,\\" Kim said. \\"Kim's behaviour might be a self-portrait of us all.\\" ||||| 2015/06/10 12:09      WASHINGTON, June 9 (Yonhap) -- Harvard and Stanford universities denied Tuesday that a South Korean high school student can attend both schools as part of a special joint program for her, debunking the story of a \\"math prodigy.\\"            Kim Jung-yoon, a senior at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Virginia, has become famous after reports that she was accepted to the two prestigious universities and has even been allowed to attend both schools without having to choose one.      Her family has said the two universities had tried to convince Kim to choose their schools because she was such a brilliant student, especially at mathematics, and they later agreed on a special plan to allow her to study at Stanford for the first two years and then at Harvard for another two years.      Questions have since arisen about her admission, and the two universities have denied the reports.      \\"Despite recent media reports, there is no program in existence through which a student is admitted to spend two years at Harvard College and two years at Stanford University,\\" Anna Cowenhoven, a Harvard Public Affairs and Communications official, said in an email to Yonhap News Agency.      \\"We have been made aware of an alleged admissions letter sent to Ms. Jung Yoon (Sara) Kim by Harvard University.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  In June 1911 Holst and his Morley College students gave the first performance since the seventeenth century of Purcell's The Fairy-Queen. The full score had been lost soon after Purcell's death in 1695, and had only recently been found. Twenty-eight Morley students copied out the complete vocal and orchestral parts. There were 1,500 pages of music and it took the students almost eighteen months to copy them out in their spare time. A concert performance of the work was given at The Old Vic, preceded by an introductory talk by Vaughan Williams. The Times praised Holst and his forces for \\"a most interesting and artistic performance of this very important work\\".After this success, Holst was disappointed the following year by the lukewarm reception of his choral work The Cloud Messenger. He again went travelling, accepting an invitation from H. Balfour Gardiner to join him and the brothers Clifford and Arnold Bax in Spain. During this holiday Clifford Bax introduced Holst to astrology, an interest that later inspired his suite The Planets. Holst cast his friends' horoscopes for the rest of his life and referred to astrology as his \\"pet vice\\".In 1913, St Paul's Girls' School opened a new music wing, and Holst composed St Paul's Suite for the occasion. The new building contained a sound-proof room, handsomely equipped, where he could work undisturbed. Holst and his family moved to a house in Brook Green, very close to the school. For the previous six years they had lived in a pretty house overlooking the Thames at Barnes, but the river air, frequently foggy, affected his breathing. For use at weekends and during school holidays, Holst and his wife bought a cottage in Thaxted, Essex, surrounded by mediaeval buildings and ample rambling opportunities. In 1917 they moved to a house in the centre of the town, where they stayed until 1925.  answer the following question:  Vaughan Williams gave an introductory talk before the performance of what work at The Old Vic?

Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: You don't usually find a mall in what areas outside big groups of people? Possible A: downtown, large city, montana, urban area, suburbs  Why is \\"suburbs\\" an answer aligned with human common sense?","output":"To determine why \\"suburbs\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense, let's analyze the question and other possible answers step by step: 1. Understand the question The question asks about areas where malls are less likely to be found outside of large gatherings of people. 2. Evaluate the other possible answers: - Downtown: Downtown areas usually have larger concentrations of people and frequently have malls or shopping centers. - Large city: Large cities typically have more people and a greater demand for commercial areas like malls. - Montana: Although it's true that malls are less likely to be found in sparsely populated rural areas like Montana, this answer is specific to a location rather than a general concept or region type. It doesn't reflect human common sense as effectively as a more general answer. - Urban area: Urban areas tend to attract significant populations and commercial development, including malls. 3. Consider the context of \\"suburbs\\" Suburbs are residential areas located on the outskirts of cities. They often have smaller populations and lesser commercial density compared to downtown or urban areas. However, they still possess some commercial activity, but it's more spread out than in city centers. 4. Justify the choice of \\"suburbs\\" as an answer aligned with human common sense It is more reasonable to assume that malls are less likely to be found in suburbs, compared to other potential answers like downtown or urban areas. Suburbs often have fewer people and less demand for large-scale commercial establishments. They may have smaller shopping centers or retail outlets, but it's less common to have a full-blown mall. This makes \\"suburbs\\" an answer that aligns well with human common sense in the given context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Tragic: Christian Smith, 38, was killed instantly when he was hit by a suspected drink-driver hours into a 248-mile charity cycle ride. Donations were flooding in last night for a cyclist who was killed by a suspected drink driver during a 24-hour charity ride. Christian Smith, 38, had almost completed the 248-mile trip through Kent and Sussex when he was hit by the car. The married father of three was declared dead at the scene by paramedics early on Saturday. Mr Smith was aiming to raise £1,000 for mental health charity Mind. But by 1.30pm yesterday £1,455 had been donated by 50 people. And as news of the tragedy spread, hundreds more visited his JustGiving donations website. Just two hours later the total had soared to £13,533 from 860 people. Further gifts continued to roll in from generous members of the public, with the total reaching £20,000 before 6pm and £30,000 by 8.30pm. One £1,000 donation came from a stranger who gave his name as James. He wrote: ‘We haven’t met. Like many others, I was very moved by your story. May you rest in peace brother. My deepest sympathies go out to your family, loved ones and friends.’ Mr Smith set off on his ‘Kent Epic’ challenge on Friday and was hit by a blue Peugeot 206 near Chestfield, Whitstable, at 4am the following morning. He is understood to have been less than two hours from home. An 18-year-old woman from Herne Bay was arrested on suspicion of drink driving and causing death by dangerous driving. She has been bailed until July 26. On his JustGiving page, Mr Smith, who was married to Katie, 40, said he wanted to support Mind to help end the stigma attached to mental health problems. Donations: Friends have given thousands of pounds to charity in Mr Smith's memory. He wrote: ‘I have had my own. misfortune to suffer from a spate of poor mental health which was. unexpected and has been a real “game changer” in how I now view the. future. It has been a tough road to get to this point but I have been. fortunate enough to have the support of my family and friends. ‘There. are those who are not so fortunate to have the same level of support. and understanding. They suffer in silence and are alone.’ Mr. Smith, from Boughton Aluph, Kent, planned to celebrate completing the. challenge by having drinks with friends next Saturday. He would have. turned 39 tomorrow. On his. online LinkedIn business profile he said he had worked as an operations. manager for a funeral director until December and was now ‘looking for a. new challenge’. His family. said in a statement: ‘Christian Smith was killed in the early hours of. Saturday morning while cycling to raise money for Mind. Christian leaves. a loving wife and three children.’ Mind chief executive Paul Farmer said: ‘We were shocked and saddened to hear of the tragic death of Christian Smith. ‘Our thoughts go out to his family and friends at this extremely difficult time.’ PC. Jamie Woodhams, of the Kent Police Serious Collision Investigation. Unit, said: ‘We are continuing to appeal for witnesses to come forward. In particular we would like to speak to anybody who saw the Peugeot. travelling along the road prior to the collision.’ The. public response is similar to when 30-year-old hairdresser Claire. Squires died during the London Marathon in 2012. She had hoped to raise. £500 for Samaritans, but news of her death sent the total soaring to. £1.2million.

However, because of differences in definitions of what does and does not constitute an \\"agglomeration\\", as well as variations and limitations in statistical or geographical methodology, it can be problematic to compare different agglomerations around the world. It may not be clear, for instance, whether an area should be considered to be a satellite and part of an agglomeration, or a distinct entity in itself.  - The Kiewa Valley Highway is a minor highway of which traverses the Kiewa Valley near the alpine regions of Victoria, Australia.

Truth being, he is.\\" Wolfe lives in an opulent Manhattan brownstone on West 35th Street, where he enjoys reading, the cultivation of rare orchids, beer, and fine food prepared by his resident chef, Fritz Brenner (Colin Fox). The brownstone is also home to Archie, Wolfe's confidential assistant and legman, whose responsibilities include goading his sedentary boss into working occasionally to replenish the coffers. When Archie joins him in the dining room, Wolfe is unfazed by the news that he is overdrawn at the bank â but he is taken aback at the discovery that Fritz has altered one of his favorite dishes without consulting him. The resulting tantrum prompts Archie to do something uncharacteristic when the doorbell rings: admit one of the neighborhood kids, Pete Drossos (Robert Clark), who says he has to see Nero Wolfe. Pete has a case. He tells Wolfe he works the wipe racket â cleaning the windshields of cars stopped at intersections, for the occasional tip. About an hour before, Pete saw a good-looking woman wearing large gold earrings shaped like spiders, at the wheel of a 1952 Cadillac. As Pete wiped her windshield the woman mouthed the words, \\"Help. Get a cop.\\" A male passenger stuck a gun in her ribs and the car drove off. Pete wrote down the license number. If the woman is found dead, Pete believes he can claim a reward by identifying the man who was with her. Since the case is too big for him to handle alone, Pete asks Nero Wolfe to go 50-50. Wolfe instructs Archie to call the police, to suggest they do a routine check on the license plate number, and Pete hurries home to his mother. The next evening Sergeant Purley Stebbins (R. D.

When the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a “rage” of determination. Using a six foot ladder, three 2x4s and my head(literally) I hefted the heavy wallboard, Using leverage I placed them one by one on the overhead rafters, held and braced them with my head, glued and nailed them there all by myself. About a half hour after I finished, I was standing there smugly trying to figure how I did it so easily when there was a knock at the door. Of course it was the assistant with a lot of excuses. He seemed surprised when I told him I was finished.

Following a dip in popularity over the summer, support for Abe rebounded as concerns rose about the increasing threat from North Korea. His policy of closely aligning with the US is expected to continue. Abe has also pledged to address Japan's second major crisis, its aging and shrinking population, stating, \\"The problem is progressing by the minute, and we cannot afford waiting around.\\" In 2015, Abe's party reinterpreted the constitution to allow the military to fight in overseas conflicts."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: Heisman Is Awarded to a Sophomore “There are a lot of great freshmen and sophomores out there,” Tebow said. “And I’m just glad that I get to be the first one to win this.” In each of his 12 games this season, Tebow had at least one rushing touchdown. He amassed 838 yards on 194 carries and scored 22 times. But that was only half his game. He also passed for 3,132 yards with 29 touchdowns and completed 68.5 percent of his throws. Earlier in the week, Tebow won the Davey O’Brien award as the best quarterback in the country and the Maxwell Award, a prize separate from the Heisman for the nation’s best player. In recent years, however, the Maxwell has seemed somewhat ominous for Heisman hopefuls; no player has won both awards in the same season since Ron Dayne in 1999. Instead, Tebow became the second Florida quarterback in the last 11 years to win the Heisman, following Danny Wuerffel, one of Tebow’s childhood heroes. But Wuerffel did not play in the kind of spread offense that has made 2007 the highest-scoring season in college football history. The moment that stood out for many voters was Tebow’s 23-yard touchdown run against Florida State when he ducked out of a crunching tackle from a lineman and eluded two more defensive backs as he sprinted to the goal line. That was after he had avoided a sack and rushed for 16 yards on third-and-14 to keep the drive rolling. Using his legs under pressure might have helped carry him to the Heisman, and it is also what first put him in the spotlight as a freshman. Playing behind Chris Leak, the 6-foot-3, 235-pound Tebow was Florida Coach Urban Meyer’s choice in short-yardage situations. In his first Southeastern Conference game, against Tennessee, Tebow came in on a fourth-and-1 in the fourth quarter and pounded his way to a critical first down to set up the go-ahead touchdown in a 21-20 victory. He finished his freshman season with 469 yards rushing and a team-high 8 touchdown runs on 89 carries. He threw for only 358 yards, but none meant more than the 358th — a 1-yard touchdown pass on third-and-goal in the national championship game victory against Ohio State. For McFadden, sitting at the ceremony only to hear someone else’s name called was an all-too familiar experience. Last year, he made the trip to New York only to watch Ohio State quarterback Troy Smith claim the trophy by the second-largest margin in history. McFadden, a two-time SEC offensive player of the year and the Walter Camp Player of the Year, made his strongest case for the Heisman with his performance in Arkansas’s 50-48 triple-overtime victory at Louisiana State. He rushed for 206 yards, including a 73-yard touchdown sprint in the third quarter, and threw a 24-yard pass for a touchdown in the fourth. The final Heisman picture did not come into focus until the last month or so, with several other names being mentioned throughout the season. After rushing for a touchdown in each of his first eight games, Oregon quarterback Dennis Dixon seemed like a top candidate. But after a knee injury in a loss to Arizona cut his season short, his 20 touchdowns and 2,106 passing yards were not enough to earn him an invitation to New York. West Virginia quarterback Pat White, who threw for 12 touchdowns and rushed for 14, might have also been considered as he led the Mountaineers to the brink of the national title game before the Mountaineers lost to Pittsburgh. It was that same weekend that Brennan played his way into contention. With Hawaii putting the only perfect Football Bowl Subdivision record on the line against Washington last Saturday, he completed 42 of 50 passes to close a 21-point deficit and win the game with a 5-yard slant pass with 44 seconds to play. But Brennan’s critics are quick to point out that he faced a weak schedule — Hawaii did not play a team in the top 25 until November. Two nationally televised games seemed to make and break Daniel’s chances. On Nov. 24, he led Missouri to a memorable 36-28 victory against Kansas, going 40 of 49 with no interceptions. A week later, he failed to throw a touchdown pass as Oklahoma trounced Missouri, 38-17. But Daniel said he was under no illusions. “I’m just glad to be here; everyone knew it was going to Tim,” he said.

Please answer this question: Before moving to the city of Metropolis in which American town did Superman grow up","output":"Superman, also known as Kal-El, was born on the planet Krypton but was sent to Earth as an infant by his father, Jor-El, to escape Krypton's impending doom. Upon arriving on Earth, baby Kal-El was discovered by a kind farming couple, Jonathan and Martha Kent, who took him in as their own child and named him Clark Kent. Clark grew up in the small, idyllic American town of Smallville, which is situated in the state of Kansas. Smallville was an ideal environment for Clark to grow up in and discover his extraordinary abilities as it provided the perfect balance of safety, community, and opportunities for self-discovery. The Kents instilled strong moral values in Clark, teaching him to use his powers responsibly and emphasizing the importance of helping others. Smallville was also the backdrop for some of Clark's most formative experiences, such as making lifelong friendships and first loves. The town served as a foundation for Superman's steadfast personality and commitment to protecting the innocent. The intimate connection Clark shares with Smallville – the place where his life on Earth began – is integral to the Superman story. As Clark grew older and sought to understand his origins and true purpose, he was inevitably drawn to Metropolis, a bustling and cosmopolitan city that presented him with ample opportunities to use his abilities for the betterment of humankind. Metropolis is where Clark fully embraces his role as Superman, acting as a beacon of hope and symbol of truth, justice, and the American way. Equipped with the strong moral compass instilled in him by his Smallville upbringing, Superman takes it upon himself to keep the citizens of Metropolis safe from harm and to be a shining role model for millions around the world. In essence, Superman grows up in Smallville, Kansas, a small rural town filled with love, support, and a sense of community. This upbringing is the foundation of the superhero he would eventually become, and it shapes his values and commitment to protecting those in need as he transitions to the larger scale of the city of Metropolis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(Photo: KRISTA NILES, AP)      Amazon, Walmart and other retailers are being sued for 50 million for allegedly infringing on the trademark of iconic rap and hip-hop group RUN-DMC.      The stores \\"are trading on the goodwill\\" of the band and confusing consumers by \\"advertising, manufacturing, selling and distributing multiple products\\" that erroneously imply the group endorsed the merchandise, according to the lawsuit filed Thursday in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.      Examples include old-school black-frame glasses often sported by Darryl McDaniels — best known to fans and music lovers as DMC — one of the band's founders and the trademark's owner, the lawsuit charged. He owns 200 pairs of similar glasses, \\"the better to see what's going on in the world,\\" according to an entry on the band's official website.      An exhibit filed with the court complaint also showed shirts, hats and other merchandise like some worn by McDaniels, Joseph \\"Reverend Run\\" Simmons, and Jason \\"Jam Master J\\" Mizell when the trio shot to music and cultural stardom from their 1980s start in the Hollis, Queens neighborhood of New York City.      The band members, inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2009 for a string of hits that include \\"It's Like That,\\" \\"My Adidas,\\" and \\"You Be Illin,\\" no longer perform together but are widely considered as rap elder statesmen. Mizell died in an unsolved 2002 shooting.      \\"The number of infringing materials\\" allegedly marketed and sold by the companies \\"are too numerous to properly list,\\" according to the lawsuit, which alleged the retailers' actions have \\"harmed RUN-DMC in its business.\\"      Along with Amazon and Walmart, the court complaint targets retailers Jet.com, Vision World, Infinity Fashion and SW Global.

File Photo: Darryl McDaniels of the rap group Run DMC takes part in a panel discussion of National Geographic Channel's \\"The 80s\\" during the 2013 Winter Press Tour for the Television Critics Association in Pasadena, California January 4, 2013. REUTERS/Gus Ruelas/File Photo      Darryl McDaniels, the owner of Run-DMC Brand LLC, the plaintiff in the lawsuit, is seeking at least 50 million of damages from the retailers and other defendants over their alleged sale of glasses, hats, patches, T-shirts, wallets and other products that infringe the Run-DMC trademark registered in 2007.      McDaniels called the Run-DMC brand “extremely valuable,” and said it is the subject of several licensing agreements, including to endorse sneakers from Adidas AG.      He said the defendants are confusing consumers into believing that Run-DMC endorsed their products and are trading on the goodwill associated with the name, in violation of federal trademark and New York unfair competition laws.      “Plaintiff will suffer immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage” unless the infringements are stopped, according to the complaint filed in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan.      Other defendants include Jet.com, an online retailer that Wal-Mart bought, and a variety of companies that do business with Amazon or sell products through Amazon.      Amazon, Wal-Mart and Jet.com did not immediately respond to requests for comment. McDaniels’ lawyer did not immediately respond to similar requests.      Run-DMC was founded in the New York City borough of Queens in 1981 by McDaniels, Joseph “Run” Simmons and Jason “Jam Master Jay” Mizell. It became one of the best-known rap acts of the 1980s, including for the album “Raising Hell” and such songs as the Aerosmith cover “Walk This Way” and “My Adidas.”      In 2009, Run-DMC became the second rap act inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Select from the following. a). no b). yes","output":"b). yes The two questions are paraphrases of each other as they both inquire about the amount of money required to initiate a business venture. Starting a business can be both an exciting and challenging endeavor, and one of the critical aspects of ensuring its success is having a clear understanding of the expenses involved in setting up the venture. The amount of money required will depend on various factors, such as the type and scale of the business, location, legal structure, and the overall financial plan. Here is a detailed breakdown of considerations and expenses an entrepreneur might encounter: 1. Type and scale of business: The cost of starting a business can vary significantly based on the industry, as well as whether it will be a small, medium, or large-scale venture. For example, starting a web-based or home-based business may require less capital than a brick-and-mortar retail store or a restaurant. Estimating costs for the specific industry and scale can help determine the necessary initial investment. 2. Startup assets: These include the essential resources needed to kick-start a business, such as machinery, equipment, inventory, office furniture, and computer hardware and software. The cost of these assets will vary depending on the type of business and desired level of quality or capacity. 3. Location: The cost of renting or purchasing a space for business operations is another area to consider. It will depend on factors like geographic location, size, and the type of property. Additionally, the costs associated with utilities, renovations, maintenance, and insurance should be taken into account. 4. Legal structure: Whether starting a sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, or limited liability company, each legal structure comes with distinct setup costs. These may include business registration fees, legal consultation, licenses, and permits needed for specific industries. 5. Marketing and branding: Building a brand and reaching out to potential customers entails expenses like creating a logo and marketing materials, website development and domain hosting, and advertising through various channels such as social media and print media. 6. Professional services: The cost of professional services, such as an accountant, lawyer, consultant, or insurance provider, should be considered before starting a business. These professionals can help manage financial, legal, and regulatory aspects of the business. 7. Payroll and staffing expenses: A business will need to account for the cost of hiring and training employees (if applicable), including the salaries, benefits, and taxes associated with payroll. 8. Emergency fund: Maintaining a buffer or emergency fund is vital for unexpected situations that may arise. It ensures that the business can continue operating during unforeseen challenges, such as equipment breakdowns, a natural disaster, or a sudden decline in sales. 9. Ongoing and working capital expenses: In addition to initial investments, a business must also account for ongoing operational expenses like rent, utilities, inventory replenishment, marketing, and employee salaries. These ongoing costs require working capital. It's worth estimating these expenses for the first few months (or even years) of operation to ensure the business has enough cash flow to cover them. In summary, the amount of money needed to start a business is contingent on the type and scale of the venture, as well as a variety of other factors involving location, startup assets, legal structure, and costs related to marketing, professional services, payroll, and working capital. Estimating these expenses accurately is crucial for a successful and sustainable business venture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Paul wanted to cook the steak on the grill instead of the stovetop because the  Options: (A). grill was hot.. (B). stovetop was hot..","output":"Paul wanted to cook the steak on the grill instead of the stovetop because the grill was hot. By using the grill, he could take advantage of the high, direct heat source to properly sear the steak and create a delicious, caramelized crust. Additionally, cooking on a grill would allow for the excess fat to drip away from the meat, creating a leaner and healthier meal. Moreover, the grilling process would impart a unique, smoky flavor into the steak, which is absent when cooking on a stovetop. While the stovetop was also hot, Paul preferred the grill due to its open flame and practicality when cooking larger cuts of meat. A stovetop requires the use of pans, and the uneven heat distribution often leads to inconsistent and less desirable results compared to a grill. Furthermore, cooking on a stovetop can result in a greasier end product, as the fat doesn't have a chance to escape from the pan, and the steak ends up effectively cooking in its own juice and fat. Grilling also offers the opportunity to cook different sides simultaneously, allowing for a more efficient and convenient cooking process. While the steak is grilled, vegetables like corn and asparagus can also be prepared on the grill, creating a more cohesive and complete meal. This is especially important during a gathering or a barbecue party, where multiple dishes need to be prepared and served at the same time. In summary, Paul wanted to cook the steak on the grill instead of the stovetop because the grill was hot, providing a superior cooking method for searing, flavor enhancement, and health benefits. The grill also offers versatility in cooking multiple dishes simultaneously, adding practicality and efficiency to the meal preparation process. The stovetop, although hot and suitable for cooking various dishes, does not impart the same benefits, particularly when it comes to grilling thick cuts of meat like steak."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Man accused of sex attack on eight-year-old Sydney girl A man has faced court accused of indecently assaulting an eight-year-old girl as she played in her front garden in Sydney’s east yesterday. Police allege the eight-year-old had been sitting on the front fence of her home in Randwick when she was approached by the man about 2.30pm. He then allegedly indecently assaulted her and grabbed her by the arm when she tried to escape. Neighbours heard the commotion and came to the little girl’s aid. One witness, Lolita Lewis, said she saw the incident but did not immediately realise what was going on. “I think that’s what upsets me, that I could have acted sooner,” she told 9NEWS. Another neighbour snapped a photo of the alleged offender as he tried to leave the scene. With her alleged attacker gone, the child ran back inside to her father, who reported the incident to police. Witnesses said the little girl appeared traumatised and clung to her father in obvious distress. “She was really, you know, clinging to her father,” Ms Lewis said. Police, who had been randomly patrolling the area, stopped a 38-year-old South Coogee man a short time later. He was charged with assault with intent to have sexual intercourse and indecent assault.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  ABKCO Industries was formed in 1968 by Allen Klein as an umbrella company to ABKCO Records. Klein hired May Pang as a receptionist in 1969. Through involvement in a project with ABKCO, Lennon and Ono met her the following year. She became their personal assistant. In 1973, after she had been working with the couple for three years, Ono confided that she and Lennon were becoming estranged. She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon, telling her, \\"He likes you a lot.\\" Astounded by Ono's proposition, Pang nevertheless agreed to become Lennon's companion. The pair soon left for Los Angeles, beginning an 18-month period he later called his \\"lost weekend\\". In Los Angeles, Pang encouraged Lennon to develop regular contact with Julian, whom he had not seen for two years. He also rekindled friendships with Starr, McCartney, Beatles roadie Mal Evans, and Harry Nilsson. While Lennon was drinking with Nilsson, he misunderstood something that Pang had said and attempted to strangle her. Lennon relented only after he was physically restrained by Nilsson.In June, Lennon and Pang returned to Manhattan in their newly rented penthouse apartment where they prepared a spare room for Julian when he visited them.  Lennon, who had been inhibited by Ono in this regard, began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends.  By December, he and Pang were considering a house purchase, and he refused to accept Ono's telephone calls. In January 1975, he agreed to meet Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. Lennon told Pang that his separation from Ono was now over, although Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress. Answer:","output":"Harry"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN) -- \\"Easy money, fast and effective.\\"  Investors protest outside the headquarters of DMG, one of many companies accused of defrauding the public.  That was the name of one of the businesses in which millions of Colombians deposited their life savings after being promised short-term returns of as much as 150 percent.  But government officials say the businesses were pyramid schemes that raked in at least 200 million from 3 million people.  The government has said it knows who most of those responsible are, but they have escaped. The government is tracking them down.  Sergio Munoz is among those who lost their savings.  \\"That was for my children,\\" he said. \\"Now, it comes to light that they have robbed us. It was with complicity of the authorities who permit this -- knowing that it is illegal for it to be permitted.\\"  The government says the businesses defrauded the public by offering false promises of a sure investment.  Wilson Rodriguez handed over the equivalent of 80,000 to a money man who offered him what he thought were assets in hotels and property in exchange.

Write a title for this article: Racks on racks: Rapper Yung Chris (aka Christopher Miller) says his single Racks— a \\"rack\\" being a slang term for 1,000 — is gaining momentum for two simple reasons: \\"It's just a club song that everybody vibes to, moves around to,\\" he says. \\"And racks, of course, is the money, so you know everybody wants money.\\" With a chorus like \\"Got racks on racks on racks/racks on racks on racks/racks on racks on racks\\" on top of a club-approved beat, the description is spot-on — this is pure party music. The song hovered just under the top 40 on Billboard's Hot 100 and hit No. 2 (rhythmic) and No. 4 (urban) on USA TODAY's airplay charts. Yung Chris has a hit single out called 'Racks.' Yung Chris has a hit single out called 'Racks.' The payoff: Rapping has been the 26-year-old Decatur, Ga., native's hobby since childhood, but as he grew up and experienced street life, \\"I started taking it a little more serious (and) started recording.\\" Persistence with a healthy dose of confidence eventually led Yung Chris, who usually goes by YC Worldwide, to a record deal. \\"Anything I'm gonna try, I'm gonna succeed in, you know? I kept trying, kept working and it finally started to pay off,\\" he says. Sign him up: After being courted by a number of major labels because of the underground success of Racks, \\"I (was) just looking for somebody to believe in me as much as I believe in myself.\\" He found that with Universal Republic, and signed with the label in March. YC subsequently released his Got Racks mixtape in early April. The 17-song collection includes the rapper's next single, I Know. \\"We've been getting a crazy response off (the track),\\" YC says. \\"A lot of people have been hitting me up about it.\\" He's currently recording his full-length debut in Atlanta in between dates of a solo club tour, which stops next in Las Vegas on July 2. New at the game: The rapper performed Racks at the BET Awards pre-show last weekend, where he met some of the hip-hop scene's biggest names, \\"rappers that have been in the game a little longer (than me). That was a great experience, being very new at this game.\\" Walking the red carpet with industry leaders such as Jay-Z is inspirational, he says. \\"I look up to (them), to try to accomplish some of the goals, or even more goals, than they have accomplished.\\" The highlight of his night? \\"I met the Five Heartbeats,\\" he says, referring to the fictional group from the 1991 film of the same name, which performed at the awards show to celebrate the movie's 20th anniversary. \\"To see them all dressed up — remember the movie?\\" he says with a laugh. As for his own performance, YC couldn't wait to hit BET's stage. When approached by the network to perform, \\"I was like, 'For real, BET? Oh, man, all right, let's go! What? I need to be there now? I'm on my way, I'm ready to go perform for BET,'\\" he says, recalling his enthusiasm. Remix it up: \\"I think I have the world's longest remix,\\" says YC, laughing. \\"It's like 22 minutes.\\" The official remix of Racks is actually more like 13 minutes, but with 15 rappers including Nelly, B.o.B., Wale, Wiz Khalifa and Waka Flocka, the higher estimate isn't too far-fetched. \\"It's crazy. We shot (the video) in Atlanta. I mean, Nelly came down to be in the video — that shocked me.\\" The veteran hip-hop artist approached YC to get in on the remix, rathern than the other way around. \\"For Nelly to do it, that was kind of exciting. He's accomplished a lot, he's sold a lot of records.\\" Identity crisis or not: Yung Chris is one vowel away from Young Chris, another rapper and one half of the duo Young Gunz. YC Worldwide, who uses the initials to help avoid confusion, says the similarity of the monikers actually hasn't caused much of a problem. \\"The only problem I ran into is Twitter.

The chemical element 'Lutetium' is named after which city?","output":"The chemical element Lutetium, with the atomic number 71 and symbol Lu, is named after the city of Paris. The name Lutetium is derived from \\"Lutetia,\\" which is the Latin name for Paris. Lutetium is a rare earth element and falls under the Lanthanide series of the periodic table. It was discovered independently by Austrian scientist Carl Auer von Welsbach and French scientist Georges Urbain in 1907. Georges Urbain initially had the honor of identifying a new element (element 71) while analyzing the impurities of a mineral called \\"Ytterbia.\\" He separated the novel element in the form of an oxide and named it \\"neoytterbia.\\" Later, he renamed the element to Lutetium in honor of the ancient name of Paris, where the discovery was made. Carl Auer von Welsbach, on the other hand, isolated the same element from a different mineral called \\"Ytterbia\\" around the same time and named it \\"cassiopeium\\" after the constellation Cassiopeia. However, priority was ultimately given to Urbain's discovery and naming since he published the findings first. Lutetium has several applications, both scientific and commercial. It is used as a catalyst in petroleum refining, in the production of phosphors for lighting, and in the detection of ions in mass spectrometry. Additionally, stable isotopes of Lutetium, particularly Lutetium-176, are used in geological dating of rocks and minerals. Despite its significance and interesting history, Lutetium remains a relatively obscure and less-known element mainly due to its rarity in nature and limited applications when compared to other elements. Nonetheless, the story of its discovery and naming after the ancient city of Paris highlights the connection between science and history, as well as the global collaboration in the advancement of scientific knowledge."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Learn more ||||| The two posts struck a more combative tone for President Donald Trump, who was decidedly more conciliatory in a statement released by the White House Wednesday night. | AP Photo Trump calls appointment of special prosecutor 'the single greatest witch hunt' The president's tweets are a stark contrast from his more restrained tone on Wednesday night.      President Donald Trump on Thursday blasted the appointment of Robert Mueller to be the special prosecutor overseeing the investigation into Russia’s meddling into the 2016 election, calling the probe “the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history.”      He also accused former President Barack Obama’s administration and the campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton of committing “illegal acts,” complaining that his campaign will now face the scrutiny of a special prosecutor while neither his predecessor nor 2016 opponent ever have.      Story Continued Below      “With all of the illegal acts that took place in the Clinton campaign & Obama Administration, there was never a special councel [sic] appointed!” the president wrote on Twitter on Thursday morning, without elaborating further on the illegal acts he accused the Clinton campaign and Obama administration of committing. (He later fixed the spelling error.)            The flurry of posts comes as Trump's White House is mired in controversy, most of it self-created, stemming from the president's decision to fire FBI Director James Comey last week, a decision he said he made based in part on the bureau's Russia investigation, whichwill now be taken over by Mueller.

Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.      The Trump administration was also left reeling earlier this week in the wake of a Washington Post report alleging that the president divulged highly sensitive intelligence in a meeting with top Russian diplomats last week, a story that the White House has disputed without outright denying that classified information was shared.      The whiff of scandal intensified when allegations surfaced that Trump had pressured Comey to drop a probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn — a charge the White House denies.      All of it has taken the focus away from what was to have been the week's focus , Trump's first international trip as president, an eight-day, five-nation journey that will include stops in Saudi Arabia, at Israel's Western Wall and at the Vatican.      The two Thursday morning posts struck a combative tone for Trump, who was more conciliatory in a statement released by the White House on Wednesday night.      “As I have stated many times, a thorough investigation will confirm what we already know — there was no collusion between my campaign and any foreign entity,” said the Wednesday-night statement, credited to Trump. “I look forward to this matter concluding quickly. In the meantime, I will never stop fighting for the people and the issues that matter most to the future of our country.”      The Department of Justice announced Wednesday night that former FBI Director Mueller will lead an independent investigation into Russian efforts to interfere in last year’s presidential campaign as well as into the possibility of collusion between the Kremlin and Trump associates. The White House had regularly objected to the idea of a special prosecutor, characterizing such an appointment as unnecessary.      With the White House battling multiple scandals, Trump and his allies have adopted a posture of being unfairly under siege.      Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, appearing Thursday morning on CNBC, said “we have to just get on with it, get this over. It's a sideshow. But what the media forgets in the midst of this sideshow of media frenzy, the president is running the country.”      Trump’s aides, both current and former, have come to the president’s defense, as have family members working outside the White House.      Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s combative first campaign manager, who maintains close ties to the White House and recently left the lobbying firm he helped found shortly after last year’s election, said Wednesday on Fox News that “I can tell you firsthand because I was on the campaign for a long time: Never, ever, ever did I ever see anybody have contact with any agent of any foreign government, Russia or anybody else.”      White House social media director Dan Scavino chimed in, citing Lewandowski’s remarks in a post to Twitter, adding that he, too, “was there from the very beginning, and never, ever, ever....did I see either!” Eric Trump, the president’s son who, along with his brother, took over leadership of the family business when their father took office, tacked on his own tweet, linking back to Scavino’s and writing that “I was too! This entire thing is a witch hunt propagated by a failed political campaign.”      House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, who wrote Wednesday evening on Twitter that Mueller was a \\"great selection\\" with \\"impeccable credentials,\\" said Thursday on ABC's \\"Good Morning America\\" that despite his approval of the former FBI director as a special prosecutor, he remained unconvinced that one was necessary in the first place.      Chaffetz also said that congressional inquiries into Russian meddling should continue, even though the possibility exists that the separate probes might interfere with one another. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) took a similar tack, telling MSNBC's \\"Morning Joe\\" that Comey should still testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee.      Even before Mueller’s appointment, Trump was griping about his perceived unfair treatment, telling graduates of the Coast Guard Academy at their commencement ceremony on Wednesday that “no politician in history — and I say this with great surety — has been treated worse or more unfairly.”      He implored the new graduates to take a lesson from his fledgling presidency.      “Over the course of your life, you will find that things are not always fair. You will find that things happen to you that you do not deserve and that are not always warranted,” Trump said. “You have to put your head down and fight, fight, fight. Never ever, ever give up.”       ||||| With all of the illegal acts that took place in the Clinton campaign & Obama Administration, there was never a special counsel appointed! ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"This article talks about how President Donald Trump is not happy about the appointment of a special prosecutor to look into possible connections between his election campaign and Russia.

According to Giles, the label originally started when he saved up money to take his girlfriend on a trip, however they broke up and Giles ended up using the money to help his friends release music. The label produced over 40 recordings, and is seen as an important figure during the second-wave screamo scene during the late 1990s and early 2000s, releasing early recordings by groups such as Usurp Synapse, Love Lost But Not Forgotten, and Pg. 99, as well as releasing the compilation album \\"Relics of Ordinary Life\\", which featured contributions by various screamo acts. Other notable acts that released recordings through the label include The Plot to Blow Up the Eiffel Tower and Racebannon. Currently, the label is inactive, their latest release being issued in 2006.

But whether potassium intake could prevent stroke   or death wasn't clear,\\" said Smoller, professor of the department of population health at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.  Researchers studied 90,137 women, aged from 50 to 79 for an average 11 years. They looked at how much potassium the women consumed, as well as if they had strokes, including ischemic strokes  , or died during the study period. Women in the study were stroke-free at the start and their average dietary potassium intake was 2,611 mg/day. Results of this study are based on potassium from food, not supplements. The researchers found: Women who ate the most potassium were 12 percent less likely to suffer stroke in general and 16 percent less likely to suffer an ischemic stroke than women who ate the least. Women who ate the most potassium were 10 percent less likely to die than those who ate the least. Among women who did not have high blood pressure, those who ate the most potassium had a 27 percent lower ischemic stroke risk and 21 perc ent reduced risk for all stroke types, compared to women who ate the least potassium in their daily diets.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Economist Debates: Fracking Amy Myers Jaffe is an expert on global energy policy, geopolitical risk, and energy and sustainability. She joined the University of California, Davis, in October 2012 as executive director for energy and sustainability and also heads the fossil-fuel component of Next STEPS (Sustainable Transportation Energy Pathways) at the Graduate School of Management and Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS). Before that she was director of the Energy Forum and Wallace S. Wilson Fellow in Energy Studies at Rice University’s James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy. She was also senior editor and Middle East analyst at Petroleum Intelligence Weekly. Publications include “Oil, Dollars, Debt and Crises” (co-author with Mahmoud El-Gamal, CUP, 2010), “Energy in the Caspian Region” (co-editor, Palgrave, 2002) and “Natural Gas and Geopolitics” (co-editor, CUP, 2006). She is a frequent speaker at energy industry conferences and has provided testimony on energy matters to governments throughout the world. Energy is a fundamental service needed for daily living. Lack of access to fuel is a key driver of poverty and premature mortality. But as essential as energy is to human development, the reality is that all forms of energy production have environmental consequences. Michael Brune has been executive director of the Sierra Club for nearly three years. During that time the number of supporters has grown to more than 2m and its \\"Beyond Coal\\" campaign has been recognised as one of the most effective in environmental history. He was previously executive director of the Rainforest Action Network, where he served for seven years. Under his leadership, the organisation won more than a dozen important environmental commitments from America's largest corporations, including Bank of America, Boise, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Home Depot, Kinko's and Lowe's. His book, \\"Coming Clean: Breaking America's Addiction to Oil and Coal\\" (2010), details a plan for a new green economy that will create well-paying jobs, promote environmental justice and bolster national security. Fracking currently enjoys exemptions from parts of at least seven major national statutes, including the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act. If fracking is so safe, why can't the industry be held to the same standards as everyone else? Shale gas, extracted by hydraulic fracturing (\\"fracking\\") of rock formations, has transformed America's energy outlook. The country is set to become self-sufficient in natural gas and could become a big exporter, boosting its economy, while gas substituting for coal in electricity generation has sent carbon emissions plunging. But extracting shale gas is controversial. Opponents claim that fracking and other consequences of extracting shale gas harm the environment through poor practices, leading to water pollution, methane leakage and seismic activity, as well as the industrialisation of the countryside—and big investments are being made in a fossil fuel rather than renewable energy. The gas industry and those in favour of shale gas dismiss most of these assertions as either vastly trumped up or plain wrong. Which side is right?","output":"This news article presents a debate on hydraulic fracturing (fracking) and its environmental consequences among two experts—Amy Myers Jaffe, an expert on global energy policy, and Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club. Fracking, which extracts shale gas from rock formations, has revolutionized America's energy landscape by promoting self-sufficiency in natural gas, potentially enabling exportation and reducing carbon emissions from electricity generation. Despite these benefits, fracking also faces controversy due to allegations of harmful environmental effects, such as water pollution, methane leakage, seismic activity, and industrialization of rural areas, as well as promoting investments in fossil fuels rather than renewable energy. The gas industry and fracking supporters refute these claims as exaggerated or false. The debate examines whether the industry should be held to the same environmental standards as other sectors and weighs the economic impact of fracking against its potential ecological consequences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After a hurling match, Damien witnesses the summary execution of his friend, Micheál Ó Súilleabháin, by British Black and Tans. Although shaken, Damien rebuffs his friends' entreaties to stay in Ireland and join the IRA, saying that the war is unwinnable. As he is leaving town, Damien witnesses the British Army vainly trying to intimidate a railway personnel for refusing to permit the troops to board. In response, Damien decides to stay and is sworn into Teddy's IRA brigade. After drilling in the mountains, the column raids the village's Royal Irish Constabulary barracks to acquire revolvers, then uses them to assassinate four Auxiliaries. In the aftermath, Anglo-Irish landowner Sir John Hamilton coerces one of his servants, IRA member Chris Reilly, into passing information to the British Army's Intelligence Corps. As a result, the entire brigade is arrested. In their cell, Damien meets the train driver, Dan, a union official who shares Damien's socialist views.

The two main tertiary institutions are the Australian National University (ANU) in Acton and the University of Canberra (UC) in Bruce, with over 10,500 and 8,000 full-time-equivalent students respectively. Established in 1946, the ANU has always had a strong research focus and is ranked among the leading universities in the world and the best in Australia by The Times Higher Education Supplement and the Shanghai Jiao Tong World University Rankings. There are two religious university campuses in Canberra: Signadou in the northern suburb of Watson is a campus of the Australian Catholic University; St Mark's Theological College in Barton is part of the secular Charles Sturt University.The Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA) and the Royal Military College, Duntroon are located in the inner-northern suburb of Campbell.

He had German, Scots-Irish, and English ancestry, and was the seventh of nine children of Cynthia Ann (nee Stanton) and Benjamin Ward Baum, only five of whom survived into adulthood. \\"Lyman\\" was the name of his father's brother, but he always disliked it and preferred his middle name \\"Frank\\".  His father succeeded in many businesses, including barrel-making, oil drilling in Pennsylvania, and real estate. Baum grew up on his parents' expansive estate called Rose Lawn, which he fondly recalled as a sort of paradise. Rose Lawn was located in Mattydale, New York. Frank was a sickly, dreamy child, tutored at home with his siblings. From the age of 12, he spent two miserable years at Peekskill Military Academy but, after being severely disciplined for daydreaming, he had a possibly psychogenic heart attack and was allowed to return home.  Baum started writing early in life, possibly prompted by his father buying him a cheap printing press. He had always been close to his younger brother Henry (Harry) Clay Baum, who helped in the production of The Rose Lawn Home Journal. The brothers published several issues of the journal, including advertisements from local businesses, which they would give to family and friends for free. By the age of 17, Baum established a second amateur journal called The Stamp Collector, printed an 11-page pamphlet called Baum's Complete Stamp Dealers' Directory, and started a stamp dealership with friends.  At 20, Baum took on the national craze of breeding fancy poultry. He specialized in raising the Hamburg. In March 1880, he established a monthly trade journal, The Poultry Record, and in 1886, when Baum was 30 years old, his first book was published: The Book of the Hamburgs: A Brief Treatise upon the Mating, Rearing, and Management of the Different Varieties of Hamburgs.  Baum had a flair for being the spotlight of fun in the household, including during times of financial difficulties. His selling of fireworks made the Fourth of July memorable. His skyrockets, Roman candles, and fireworks filled the sky, while many people around the neighborhood would gather in front of the house to watch the displays. Christmas was even more festive. Baum dressed as Santa Claus for the family. His father would place the Christmas tree behind a curtain in the front parlor so that Baum could talk to everyone while he decorated the tree without people managing to see him. He maintained this tradition all his life.

If your tree is unhealthy, it's more likely to die from shock while being replanted. If your tree is dehydrated or diseased, try to treat its ailment as much as possible before moving it. Available options:  -- Trees older than 3 years are more likely to suffer damage while being transplanted. Amateur gardeners should not attempt to transplant trees with a trunk diameter larger than 2 inches (5.1 cm).  -- Your tree's core moisture will also help keep it healthy. If your tree is severely undernourished, reduce the amount of water it gets daily.  -- If possible, put it in a new location for replanting. If your tree is dead, it won't recover until you plan to replant it.  -- Use a pesticide to try to halt the tree from becoming fertilized. Keeping your tree well hydrated and shiny will improve their natural nutrients. Answer:","output":"Trees older than 3 years are more likely to suffer damage while being transplanted. Amateur gardeners should not attempt to transplant trees with a trunk diameter larger than 2 inches (5.1 cm). If you are unsure about the age or size of your tree, consulting a professional arborist or horticulturist can help guide you in making an informed decision. Before you decide to proceed with replanting a tree, you must first assess its overall health, root system, and size to ensure it thrives in its new location. Soil preparation is another critical factor that can influence success. Here are the steps you should follow to replant a tree: 1. Choose the appropriate time: The best time to replant a tree is during its dormant season. For deciduous trees, this means early spring or late fall, while for evergreens, aim for late summer or early fall. Cool temperatures and sufficient rainfall will help the tree establish roots in its new location. 2. Inspect the root system: A healthy root system is crucial for the tree's survival during transplantation. Gently dig around the tree to expose its root ball, which is the mass of roots just below the trunk. Ensure the roots are not circling, girdling, or diseased, as these issues may prevent the tree from thriving in its new location. 3. Dig the new hole: Measure the width and depth of the exposed root ball, and dig a hole in the new location that is about twice as wide as the root ball and as deep as its height. It's essential to loosen the soil at the sides and bottom of the hole, so the roots can easily spread and grow. 4. Carefully remove the tree: Carefully lift the tree out of the hole by its root ball, ensuring that you do not damage its roots or trunk. If the tree is too large or heavy to handle, you may need to use a tree spade or enlist professional help. 5. Transport the tree: While moving the tree to its new location, protect its root ball by wrapping it in a burlap sack or keeping it moist using a tarp. Avoid direct sunlight and excessive wind during transportation. 6. Replant the tree: Place the tree into the prepared hole, ensuring that the top of the root ball is level with the surrounding soil. Fill the hole with soil, gently packing it around the root ball to eliminate air pockets. Be sure not to bury the exposed root flare, as this can lead to root rot and other health issues. 7. Water and mulch: After planting the tree, water it generously to help settle the soil. Apply a layer of organic mulch, like wood chips or shredded bark, around the tree to help retain moisture and maintain a consistent soil temperature. Keep in mind to avoid piling the mulch against the trunk, as this may cause disease and rot. 8. Stake if necessary: If the tree is unable to stand upright on its own, you may need to stake it temporarily. Utilize soft, flexible materials, such as straps or tree ties, to avoid damaging the trunk. Generally, remove the stakes within a year to allow the tree to grow strong and stable. 9. Monitor and care: Keep a close eye on your replanted tree for several weeks, ensuring it receives adequate water, sunlight, and nutrients. Watch for potential signs of stress, such as leaf drop, wilting, or dieback. Consult an arborist or horticulturist for advice if you notice any issues, as they may be able to suggest appropriate treatments. By following these steps, you can help improve the chances of a successful transplantation and ensure your tree thrives in its new home. Remember, replanting a tree is a delicate process that requires patience, care, and attention to detail. If you are unsure about any aspect of the procedure, seeking professional help is always a wise option."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: Barry Redden (born July 21, 1960) is a former American football running back who played for the Los Angeles Rams, the San Diego Chargers, and the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL). He spent much of his career playing in the shadow of Pro Football Hall of Fame running back Eric Dickerson. Hypothesis:  Barry Redden is a very unfortunate man","output":"Based on the provided information, it is not accurate to definitively conclude that Barry Redden is a very unfortunate man. While the paragraph informs us about his professional career and mentions that he played in the shadow of Pro Football Hall of Fame running back Eric Dickerson, this is not enough to determine his overall fortune. It is important to consider that just because Redden might have been overshadowed by Eric Dickerson in his professional football career, it does not automatically make him very unfortunate. There are several factors to take into account before making a judgment on Redden's level of fortune, such as: 1. Personal life: We must assess Redden's personal happiness, relationships, well-being, and fulfillment in life beyond his football career. We do not have any details available regarding his family, friends, or pursuits outside the realm of football to label him as unfortunate. 2. Career achievements: Despite being overshadowed by Dickerson, Redden still had a career as a professional football player in the NFL, which is a remarkable achievement in itself. He played for several teams, including the Los Angeles Rams, the San Diego Chargers, and the Cleveland Browns. This fact suggests that he was talented and skilled enough to be a part of such successful professional sports organizations. 3. Finances: While we don't have any specific details, it is reasonable to assume that Redden was earning money throughout his NFL career. This would suggest that he might have been fortunate in a financial aspect, at least during his playing days. 4. Opportunities post-football: There's no information available to determine if Redden has faced challenges or pursued opportunities beyond his football career. However, playing professional football often opens doors for various ventures, like coaching, sports broadcasting, or entrepreneurship. It would be crucial to evaluate this aspect to determine if Redden is indeed \\"very unfortunate.\\" 5. Health: Information about Redden's physical, emotional, and mental health is essential to understand his level of fortune. Football careers can expose individuals to injuries and long-term health issues. However, we do not have any concrete information to consider in this case. In conclusion, without a comprehensive understanding of Barry Redden's personal life, career achievements, finances, opportunities post-football, and health, it is insufficient to conclude that he is a very unfortunate man based solely on the provided information. Playing in the shadow of a highly talented and successful football player like Eric Dickerson might be one of the challenges Redden faced, but it does not paint the entire picture of his fortune."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Family left homeless after Brooklyn blaze trying its best to endure new hardships BY Joe Jackson and Larry Mcshane DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITERS Sunday, February 27th 2011, 4:00 AM One week afterÂ his family's Brooklyn apartment was gutted in a fire, Patrick Louis wonders when - or even if - life will return to normal. His children, after losing their home, lost their appetites and their smiles. His wife put her career on hold. The present is unpleasant, and the future remains uncertain. \\"We don't know what's going to happen,\\" the family patriarch said Saturday. \\"We're just waiting to see. At least we have a roof over our heads and a place to sleep.\\" His wife, Myralda, tending to four children in a cramped motel room, said the Feb. 19 fire instantaneously turned their lives topsy-turvy. \\"It's changed everything,\\" the 25-year-old said. \\"I was really excited to go to [nursing] school, but there's nothing I can do.\\" She's postponed taking classes at Kingsborough Community College until life is back on track. For now, home is the Gowanus Super 8 motel - where the family of six is enjoying clothes, gifts and other donations from generous Daily News readers. \\"We're so grateful,\\" said Patrick Louis, a 38-year-old Haitian immigrant. \\"New York City has the most caring people.\\" Four-year-old Khealy, who lost all her Valentine's Day birthday gifts in the blaze, was thrilled to receive a pink dollhouse from a Westchester County couple. The family even shared some of its charitable windfall with neighbors displaced by the fire. The devastating blaze was ignited by candles used in a steamy voodoo sex ritual inside the seven-story apartment building. Tenant Nelson (Pepe) Pierre, known as a voodoo priest, is accused of taking 300 from a woman to provide a life-changing experience - starting with a carnal romp in his fourth-floor bedroom. The tryst became so heated that the pair failed to notice that the ritual candles surrounding the bed had ignited the apartment. One woman was killed and dozens left homeless by the raging, five-alarm blaze. The Louis family met yesterday with Housing Preservation and Development officials, who already said the family will stay at the motel for another week before it is permanently relocated. Patrick Louis, a limousine driver, said the family doesn't want to move to one of the other four boroughs. \\"We want to stay in Brooklyn - for the kids,\\" he said. \\"We don't want anywhere that's not safe for them. And they have to go to school.\\" This is the second narrow escape for the oldest kids, 12-year-old Kindersley and 11-year-old Kristelle. Both were living in their native Haiti when last year's devastating earthquake hit. \\"They're survivors,\\" said stepmom Myralda. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of this text center on the plight of the Louis family, who were left homeless after their Brooklyn apartment was gutted in a fire. Patrick Louis, the family patriarch, and his wife, Myralda, along with their four children, are currently living in a cramped motel room, but are uncertain of their future. The fire, oddly ignited by candles used in a voodoo sex ritual by another tenant, has altered the course of this family's life significantly. Myralda, once excited to attend nursing school, had to postpone her education, while the children dealt with loss of their home and normal routines.  Despite their personal losses, the family remains grateful, particularly for the support from generous Daily News readers who donated clothes, gifts, and other items. One significant moment came when their four-year-old daughter, who lost her birthday gifts in the blaze, received a pink dollhouse from a couple in Westchester County. The family is currently in talks with Housing Preservation and Development officials about a permanent relocation plan. However, they wish to stay in Brooklyn considering their children's safety and schooling. A rather striking part of the text highlights their older children's resilience, mentioning how they endured hardships earlier as well, having survived last year's devastating earthquake in their native Haiti.  This event not only portrays the Louis family's immediate struggles and efforts to find stability, but also underscores the broader issue of disaster recovery for families forced into sudden homelessness due to unforeseen circumstances. It also signals the spirit of human resilience and the impact of community support in overcoming such adversities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This was my favorite donut place until I saw the owner kill a cockroach on the donut tray wash off only that part  of the tray and then acted as if  nothing happen.  I did buy the donuts but I couldn't eat them. So I went back about an hour and he did allow me to return the donuts but he put them right back out to sell on that same tray. I do feel bad because he is a very kind man.","output":"Based on the review provided, the sentiment appears to be negative. While it's mentioned that the donut place was initially the reviewer's favorite, the actions of the owner have led to disappointment and discomfort. There are a few key points in the review that provide evidence for considering it negative: 1. Observation of unsanitary conditions and behavior: When the reviewer saw the owner kill a cockroach on the donut tray, it raised hygiene concerns. This incident is a primary reason for the reviewer's negative sentiment, as it implies that the food might be contaminated. 2. Inadequate cleaning measures: The owner only washing off the part of the tray where the cockroach was killed and acting as if nothing happened further contributes to the negative sentiment. This portrays that the owner may not adhere to proper cleaning and sanitizing standards in the establishment. 3. Discomfort with the purchased product: The reviewer's inability to eat the donuts they bought signifies disapproval and discontent with the situation. 4. Returning and reselling of the donut: The fact that the owner allowed the reviewer to return the donuts is a positive aspect. However, the final decision of the owner to put the returned donuts back out to sell on the same tray outweighs the positive sentiment, as it indicates a possible lack of concern for the customers' well-being. Nevertheless, the reviewer does mention that the owner is a very kind man, which is a positive point. However, the kindness of the owner does not outweigh the cumulative negative factors that are related to health and hygiene concerns. Hence, the overall sentiment of this review is negative."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Ever since he was a young boy, Bob had always dreamed of owning a brand-new motorcycle. The freedom of the open road and the adrenaline rush he felt every time he climbed onto the saddle were simply unparalleled. Bob had owned a few used bikes over the years, but it was time for him to treat himself and indulge in the motorcycle of his dreams - something shiny, powerful, and with that intoxicating new-bike smell. Having driven a reliable truck for a few years, Bob appreciated its utility and durability, but the sheer bulkiness of the vehicle was becoming a burden, both physically and mentally. The crowded streets and the never-ending search for parking spots had started to wear on him. Not to mention, the environmental impact of driving a gas-guzzling truck was becoming more and more apparent in the world, and Bob wanted to do his part to reduce his carbon footprint. It was time for a change, and a new motorcycle would help him achieve that goal. Upon arrival at the dealer, Bob couldn't help but feel a thrill of excitement as he caught sight of the gleaming motorcycles lined up in the showroom. He greeted the salesperson with enthusiasm and shared his goal of trading his truck for one of the magnificent machines before him. After evaluating the condition of his truck, the salesperson guided him through the extensive range of motorcycles available, and Bob appreciated the expertise and experience offered by the staff. Bob's eyes were immediately drawn to a sleek, black motorcycle with an air of power and sophistication. He couldn't help but run his hands over the smooth curves of the bike, envisioning himself conquering the highways with precision and style. He asked the salesperson about its features, and the conversation that followed served to fuel his excitement even further. With a fuel-efficient modern engine, high-tech performance features, and cutting-edge safety systems, this motorcycle appeared to have it all. But it wasn't just about the bike's impressive specifications. Bob couldn't help but feel a deep sense of connection with the motorcycle, as though it was calling out to him specifically. This wasn't just a random purchase. This motorcycle truly felt like a manifestation of his dreams, and he knew that owning it would signify a new, exciting chapter in his life. Concluding the tour, the salesperson went over the trade-in value for Bob's truck and provided him with financing options to allow him to take his dream motorcycle home. After careful consideration, Bob signed on the dotted line, feeling certain that he was making the right decision. As he pulled away from the dealership on his brand-new motorcycle, Bob felt a combination of exhilaration and pride. The rumble of the engine beneath him and the wind against his face were exhilarating, and he knew that this was just the beginning of many wonderful adventures on the open road. Bob had successfully traded in his old truck for a new, state-of-the-art motorcycle, and he couldn't help but smile wide as he rode towards the horizon, his spirit soaring with every mile."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Left: Sakita Covington, 38, left four children under the age of 4 alone in her apartment when she went to go get one of her sons from school. A babysitter has been arrested after a 4-year-old girl she was meant to be watching died when left unattended in the sitter's apartment. Naira Bennett was found trapped in a folding futon and rushed to a Newark, New Jersey hospital but pronounced dead hours later after doctors were unable to revive her. The babysitter, Sakita Covington, has been taken into police custody and charged with child endangerment and aggravated assault. Naira was one of four children that Covington, 38, left alone in her apartment in a housing complex on Wednesday morning. All of the children were under the age of four. The Star-Ledger reports that Covington asked a friend who lived in the same complex to watch the children while she rushed out to pick up one of her sons from school but the neighbor told her that she would not be able to until later. 'When I got upstairs the baby was in the futon,' the friend told ABC7 without revealing her name. 'I don't know what happened. I wasn't there.' One of the other children was another one of Covington's sons. The three children who were with Naira at the time were unharmed. An autopsy is being performed which will determine the official cause of death and give more clues as to what happened. Arrested: Covington, seen in a headscarf, has been charged with child endangerment and aggravated assault. Police were called to the apartment at 10.45am on Wednesday and shew as transported to University Hospital. Naira was not officially declared dead until 7pm that evening. It is unclear where the surviving children are currently but Covington is in police custody. Naira's mother does not face any charges in connection to her daughter's death. Dangerous: The incident happened in Covington's apartment in a Newark housing complex called Bradley Court (pictured), where a number of drug busts and shootings have taken place in the past.

He was named after Ray Charles, his mother's favorite singer. The family moved to Washington, D.C., when he was three, and they settled permanently in Palmer Park, Maryland when he was ten. His father worked as a supermarket night manager and his mother was a nurse. On December 7, 1989, Leonard defended the title against Roberto Duran, who was the reigning WBC Middleweight Champion. Duran was guaranteed 7.6 million and Leonard's arrangement guaranteed him over 13 million.  For the Duran fight, Leonard cut his entourage from twenty-one to six. Dave Jacobs was one of the people let go, leaving Correa as the sole trainer. Correa was instructed not to spare the whip. \\"For the first time in a long time, I allowed someone to push me\\", Leonard said.  The fight took place at the new Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas. Leonard used constant lateral movement and won by a lopsided twelve-round unanimous decision over a listless Duran. The scores were 120-110, 119-109, and 116-111. In a fight that many considered to be very boring, both fighters were booed often by the fans and many left the arena before the decision was announced. Pat Putnam of Sports Illustrated wrote, \\"Leonard gave them artistic perfection when they wanted heated battle, and they booed lustily. Most fight fans would not spend a dime to watch Van Gogh paint Sunflowers, but they would fill Yankee Stadium to see him cut off his ear.\\" Although Leonard dominated the fight, he suffered several cuts. His lower lip was cut from a headbutt in the fourth round, his left eye was cut in the eleventh round, and his right eye was cut in the twelfth round. The cuts required a total of 60 stitches.  In January 1990, Leonard relinquished the WBC Super Middleweight Championship, saying that he was unsure whether he would fight again. When Leonard decided to continue his career, he offered Hagler a rematch, but Hagler decided to stay retired. He then offered Hearns a third fight, but Hearns said he could no longer make the weight and moved up to the light heavyweight division.

High lake had a lot of fresh and salt water mixing, therefore presented layers of stratified water.The water was poor in nutrients.Low lake had no such problems and it was a very abundant and prolific fishing spot.  Hint: Water stratification is when water masses with different properties - salinity (halocline), oxygenation (chemocline), density (pycnocline), temperature (thermocline) - form layers that act as barriers to water mixing which could lead to anoxia or euxinia.[1] These layers are normally arranged according to density, with the least dense water masses sitting above the more dense layers.  Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2] A:","output":"Based on the information presented, High lake had fewer dissolved nutrients. The description indicates that this lake showed signs of water stratification, with its separate layers of fresh and salt water. Water stratification occurs when water masses with different properties like salinity, oxygenation, density, temperature, etc., form layers that create barriers to water mixing. This phenomenon can potentially lead to conditions of low oxygen (anoxia) or hydrogen sulfide saturation (euxinia). This stratification of High lake, especially, has important implications for nutrient availability in the water. The layers formed by stratification can act as impediments to nutrient mixing between different levels of the water body. Consequently, essential nutrients from the benthos (the bottom of a water body) are unable to reach the photic zone (the upper layer of a water body that receives light), which can limit the growth and availability of phytoplankton. Phytoplanktons are primary producers in a water ecosystem, thus requiring available nutrients to perform photosynthesis. When nutrient restriction occurs because of the barriers created by water stratification, the primary production decreases. This, in turn, also reduces the overall net productivity of aquatic life, making the ecosystem less nourishing for the organisms living within it. On the other hand, Low Lake was described as 'very abundant and prolific fishing spot', indicating that it likely had higher nutrient levels. The absence of water stratification in Low lake would allow the free movement of nutrients across all layers of the water body. This would ensure a higher nutrient availability and therefore, a more productive ecosystem conducive for the boom in fishing. Thus, compared to the High lake, Low lake is indicated to have more dissolved nutrients, making the former the lake with fewer dissolved nutrients as described in the source text."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: Call emergency services if an emotionally abusive person is physically violent or threatens to hurt you or your loved ones. Take their threats seriously, even if an emotional abusive partner or friend hasn’t been violent in the past.  Describe the person's abusive behavior and threatening language to the emergency services operator. When authorities arrive, they'll question the person and, depending on your local laws and the nature of your complaint, take them into custody. Ask officers for a copy of the police report. After the crisis, file a restraining order against the abusive person if you're concerned about your safety. An emotionally abusive person might threaten to hurt themselves or commit suicide in order to control you. Get emergency help if you believe they will truly attempt to harm themselves, have a plan of doing so, or have immediate access to a weapon or other means of committing suicide.  Tell the emergency services operator if the abusive person has a history of mental illness, and ask for responders trained in diffusing emergencies related to mental illness. If they regularly threaten suicide to control you, don't give in to their threats. Tell them that you are not responsible for their choices and that you will not give in to their demands. Maintaining your boundaries and leaving someone who repeatedly threatens suicide aren't easy. Remind yourself that these patterns are unhealthy, that your partner's intention is to control and intimidate you, and that they are responsible for their own actions. Make sure it’s physically and financially safe to leave an abusive situation before you act. Make arrangements with a friend or relative so you (and your children, if you have any) will have somewhere safe to go.  If you live an emotional abusive romantic partner, try to pack essential documents, such your driver's license, passport, social security card, and birth certificate. Try to pack medications, valuables, and any other essential valuables. If possible, open a new bank account that your abusive partner can’t access. Make a copy of your car keys and hide them in case you need your partner takes away your keys. Memorize the phone numbers of trusted loved ones in case your partner takes away your phone. You could also get an emergency cell phone just in case. Many shelters offer free emergency prepaid phones. Head to your local courthouse to get a protective order. Call ahead to see if you need an appointment. Ask the court clerk for the required forms and ask for instructions about filing them.  It’s helpful to bring a picture of the abuser, their home and work addresses, a written description of their abusive actions, and any photographs, medical records, or police reports related to the abuse. Ask a trusted friend or relative to go to the courthouse with you to provide moral support. There are no fees for requesting a domestic violence protective order, and you do not need a lawyer to file one.

Q:Given the following context:  Now settled into Warner Bros. Records, the Chili Peppers began looking for a suitable producer. One in particular, Rick Rubin, stood out, as he was more broadminded than people the band had worked with in the past, even though Rubin had turned down the chance to produce their 1987 album The Uplift Mofo Party Plan due to the drug problems of Kiedis and guitarist Hillel Slovak (who would die of a heroin overdose a year later). Unlike the Peppers' previous producers, Rubin was someone the band felt confident in to ask for guidance and input during times of difficulty. He would often help arrange drum beats, guitar melodies and lyrics.The band sought to record the album in an unconventional setting, believing it would enhance their creative output. Rubin suggested the mansion magician Harry Houdini once lived in, to which they agreed. A crew was hired to set up a recording studio and other equipment required for production in the house in Los Angeles. The Peppers decided they would remain inside the mansion for the duration of recording, though according to Kiedis, Smith was convinced the location was haunted, and refused to stay. He would, instead, come each day by motorcycle. Smith himself disputes this account, and instead claims the real reason he did not stay at The Mansion was because he wanted to be with his wife. Frusciante, however, disagreed with Smith, and said \\"There are definitely ghosts in the house,\\" and Frusciante felt they were \\"very friendly. We [the band] have nothing but warm vibes and happiness everywhere we go in this house.\\"Frusciante, Kiedis, and Flea each had their own rooms in the house. When not recording with the band, Frusciante would spend his time painting, listening to music, reading and recording songs he'd written. Due to the seclusion, Kiedis ended up recording all his vocals in his room, as it was large enough to accommodate the recording equipment.

[II] We make our guitars to your specifications.. [III] We produce and sell thousands of guitars each year.. [IV] Our guitars are the best quality your money can buy..","output":"Statement [II] \\"We make our guitars to your specifications\\" should be in the advertisement to best emphasize the company's custom production processes. A detailed explanation of why other statements don't fit well and statement [II] is the best choice: [I] \\"Our guitars are made using hand tools\\" While this statement indicates a degree of craftsmanship and attention to detail, it does not specifically emphasize that the company produces custom guitars tailored to the customer's preferences. Additionally, using hand tools doesn't necessarily imply customization, so while it can be a part of the advertisement, it doesn't capture the custom production process as effectively as statement [II]. [II] \\"We make our guitars to your specifications\\" This statement directly addresses the company's custom production processes, emphasizing that the guitars are made to suit the individual customer's needs and preferences. It highlights the flexibility, personalized attention, and dedication to meeting the customer's unique desires, which are core values of a custom-made product. This is the most appropriate statement to focus on the company's custom production processes in the advertisement. [III] \\"We produce and sell thousands of guitars each year\\" This statement highlights the company's output capacity and popularity, but it does not emphasize the custom production processes employed by the company. In fact, mentioning the production of thousands of guitars may suggest a mass production approach rather than a custom, personalized one. This statement could inadvertently downplay the customization aspect the company wants to emphasize in its advertisement. [IV] \\"Our guitars are the best quality your money can buy\\" Although this statement highlights the high-quality nature of the company's guitars, it does not specifically mention or emphasize the custom production processes. It is possible to have high-quality products without custom production; therefore, this statement may not convey the unique value proposition the company is aiming for. It can be included in the advertisement in addition to statement [II], but it doesn't directly address the custom production process. In conclusion, statement [II] \\"We make our guitars to your specifications\\" is the most effective statement to emphasize the company's custom production processes in the advertisement. It clearly demonstrates the commitment to meeting customer requirements and highlights the primary differentiation factor for custom-made guitars. Other statements could be used to expand or support the overall message of the advertisement but don't specifically focus on the custom production aspect."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Consider the factors involved The factors involved in this scenario are: - Hot weather leading to less food for male birds - The number of chicks hatched by female birds Step 3: Analyze the relationship between the factors If male birds have less food, they may be less healthy and, as a result, have reduced chances of successful mating. This could lead to fewer fertilized eggs for female birds to hatch.  Step 4: Determine the effect on the number of chicks hatched Since male birds with less food may have limited mating success, this could subsequently limit the number of eggs available for the female birds to incubate and hatch. Step 5: Provide the answer Considering the relationship between food availability for male birds and the number of chicks hatched by female birds, the answer is B: less. As male birds have less food due to hot weather, it will negatively impact the number of chicks female birds can hatch."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Passenger pigeons  once flew over much of the United States in unbelievable numbers. Written accounts from the 18th and 19th centuries described flocks  so large that they darkened the sky for hours. It was calculated that when its population reached its highest point, there were more than 3 billion passenger pigeons--a number equal to 24 to 40 percent of the total bird population in the United States, making it perhaps the most abundant bird in the world. Even as late as 1870 when their numbers had already become smaller, a flock believed to be 1 mile wide and 320 miles (about 515 kilometers) long was seen near Cincinnati. Sadly, the abundance of passenger pigeons may have been their _ . Where the birds were most abundant, people believed there was an ever-lasting supply and killed them by the thousands. Commercial hunters attracted them to small clearings with grain, waited until pigeons had settled to feed, then threw large nets over them, taking hundreds at a time. The birds were shipped to large cities and sold in restaurants. By the closing decades of the 19th century, the hardwood forests where passenger pigeons nested had been damaged by Americans' need for wood, which scattered   the flocks and forced the birds to go farther north, where cold temperatures and spring storms contributed to their decline. Soon the great flocks were gone, never to be seen again. In 1897, the state of Michigan passed a law prohibiting the killing of passenger pigeons, but by then, no sizable flocks had been seen in the state for 10 years. The last confirmed wild pigeon in the United States was shot by a boy in Pike County, Ohio, in 1900. For a time, a few birds survived under human care. The last of them, known affectionately as Martha, died at the Cincinnati Zoological Garden on September 1, 1914. Question: What can we infer about the law passed in Michigan? Options: A: It was ignored by the public. B: It was declared too late. C: It was unfair. D: It was strict. Answer:","output":"B: It was declared too late. Justification: The article states that by the time the law was passed in Michigan in 1897, no sizable flocks of passenger pigeons had been seen in the state for 10 years. This implies that the law was passed after the passenger pigeons' population had significantly declined, suggesting it was too late to have a meaningful impact on their survival."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. pick from the following. (a). Kyle lived.; (b). Joel lived.; Complete the following sentence. While Kyle owned snow tires, Joel owned standard tires because it often snowed where","output":"While Kyle owned snow tires, Joel owned standard tires because it often snowed where Kyle lived while Joel lived in a region with a milder climate, which did not experience such harsh winters. Kyle lived in the hilly and snow-laden region where winters were long, harsh, and often came with heavy snowfall. He needed snow tires on his vehicle to be able to commute safely and easily during the winter months. Snow tires provided an extra layer of traction, grip, and adaptability to the snowy and slippery conditions that plagued the roads. This was particularly important because, in his rural community, roadways were regularly covered with ice, and snowplows could take several hours or even days to clear the roads. Kyle knew that having these snow tires would not only significantly increase the safety of his daily commutes but also allow him to drive without any major concerns of getting stuck or needing to wait for the roads to be cleared. On the other hand, Joel lived in a region that experienced a mild, almost Mediterranean climate with very little chance of snow. In this temperate climate, the winters were mild, roads didn't freeze over, and the temperature rarely dropped below freezing. Consequently, for Joel, snow tires would have been unnecessary, and he could well manage with the standard, all-season tires that his car came equipped with when he bought it. Joel's standard tires were designed to provide adequate performance in most driving conditions, including wet and dry roads, and they worked reasonably well for him all year round. The milder winters in his region meant that snow and ice coverage on the roads was a rare event, and any rare occurrences of snow accumulation were usually dealt with promptly by the local authorities. Additionally, investing in snow tires would have been financially impractical for Joel. Snow tires are more expensive than standard tires, and typically, they require the additional cost of separate rims. Storing the unused set of tires would also have taken up more of Joel's limited storage space, which he needed for other equipment and belongings. Finally, the choice of owning standard tires was environmentally conscious for Joel as well. Snow tires were made from a softer rubber compound, specifically designed to stay flexible and maintain grip in cold temperatures. While this made them ideal for winter driving in Kyle's area, using them in the warmer climates where Joel lived would have resulted in shorter tire life and increased wear, leading to more frequent replacements and greater adverse environmental impact due to tire waste. In conclusion, while Kyle owned snow tires as a result of the snowy and harsh winters in his region, Joel owned standard tires due to the milder climate in which he lived. This difference in tire ownership was not only practical but also financially sensible and environmentally responsible for both individuals, given the specific weather conditions in their locations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: In October, news broke that the CIA was preparing options to launch a cyberattack against Russia following revelations that the country was likely behind hacks at the Democratic National Committee earlier this summer. Now, a source has told NBC News that the US has penetrated key Russian systems, and will be ready to take action in case the country decides to interfere with next week’s elections.      The US is preparing in case it is \\"attacked in a significant way\\"      The systems allegedly include some of Russia’s telecommunications networks, its electrical power grid, and command systems at the Kremlin. NBC reported that the preparations are being made in the event that the US is \\"attacked in a significant way,\\" according to an anonymous intelligence official and top secret documents that the network had reviewed.      While US election infrastructure has significant flaws with outdated voting machines and voter data, the decentralized nature of the election makes it much harder for attackers to outright change the final outcome.      Digital security has become a concern during this election cycle, although NBC notes that the officials it spoke with \\"do not expect Russia to attack critical infrastructure,\\" although they do expect some \\"cyber mischief,\\" such as releases of fake documents and digital misinformation campaigns. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.      / Updated By Ken Dilanian, William M. Arkin, Cynthia McFadden and Robert Windrem      U.S. military hackers have penetrated Russia’s electric grid, telecommunications networks and the Kremlin’s command systems, making them vulnerable to attack by secret American cyber weapons should the U.S. deem it necessary, according to a senior intelligence official and top-secret documents reviewed by NBC News.      American officials have long said publicly that Russia, China and other nations have probed and left hidden malware on parts of U.S critical infrastructure, \\"preparing the battlefield,\\" in military parlance, for cyber attacks that could turn out the lights or turn off the internet across major cities.      It’s been widely assumed that the U.S. has done the same thing to its adversaries. The documents reviewed by NBC News — along with remarks by a senior U.S. intelligence official — confirm that, in the case of Russia.      U.S. officials continue to express concern that Russia will use its cyber capabilities to try to disrupt next week’s presidential election. U.S. intelligence officials do not expect Russia to attack critical infrastructure — which many believe would be an act of war — but they do anticipate so-called cyber mischief, including the possible release of fake documents and the proliferation of bogus social media accounts designed to spread misinformation.      On Friday the hacker known as \\"Guccifer 2.0\\" — which U.S. officials say is a front for Russian intelligence — tweeted a threat to monitor the U.S. elections \\"from inside the system.\\"      Related: Exclusive: White House Readies to Fight Election Day Cyber Mayhem      As NBC News reported Thursday, the U.S. government is marshaling resources to combat the threat in a way that is without precedent for a presidential election.      The cyber weapons would only be deployed in the unlikely event the U.S. was attacked in a significant way, officials say.      U.S. military officials often say in general terms that the U.S. possesses the world’s most advanced cyber capabilities, but they will not discuss details of highly classified cyber weapons.      James Lewis, a cyber expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says that U.S. hacks into the computer infrastructure of adversary nations such as China, Russia, Iran and North Korea — something he says he presumes has gone on for years — is akin to the kind of military scouting that is as old as human conflict.      \\"This is just the cyber version of that,\\" he said.      In 2014, National Security Agency chief Adm. Mike Rogers told Congress that U.S. adversaries are performing electronic \\"reconnaissance\\" on a regular basis so that they can be in a position to disrupt the industrial control systems that run everything from chemical facilities to water treatment plants.      \\"All of that leads me to believe it is only a matter of when, not if, we are going to see something dramatic,\\" he said at the time.      Rogers didn't discuss the U.S.’s own penetration of adversary networks. But the hacking undertaken by the NSA, which regularly penetrates foreign networks to gather intelligence, is very similar to the hacking needed to plant precursors for cyber weapons, said Gary Brown, a retired colonel and former legal adviser to U.S. Cyber Command, the military's digital war fighting arm.      \\"You'd gain access to a network, you'd establish your presence on the network and then you’re poised to do what you would like to do with the network,\\" he told NBC News. \\"Most of the time you might use that to collect information, but that same access could be used for more aggressive activities too.\\"      Brown and others have noted that the Obama administration has been extremely reluctant to take action in cyberspace, even in the face of what it says is a series of Russian hacks and leaks designed to manipulate the U.S. presidential election.      Administration officials did, however, deliver a back channel warning to Russian against any attempt to influence next week’s vote, officials told NBC News.      The senior U.S. intelligence official said that, if Russia initiated a significant cyber attack against critical infrastructure, the U.S. could take action to shut down some Russian systems — a sort of active defense.      Retired Adm. James Stavridis, who served as NATO commander of Europe, told NBC News’ Cynthia McFadden that the U.S. is well equipped to respond to any cyber attack.      \\"I think there's three things we should do if we see a significant cyber-attack,\\" he said. \\"The first obviously is defending against it. The second is reveal: We should be publicizing what has happened so that any of this kind of cyber trickery can be unmasked. And thirdly, we should respond. Our response should be proportional.\\"      The U.S. use of cyber attacks in the military context — or for covert action — is not without precedent.      During the 2003 Iraq invasion, U.S spies penetrated Iraqi networks and sent tailored messages to Iraqi generals, urging them to surrender, and temporarily cut electronic power in Baghdad.      In 2009 and 2010, the U.S., working with Israel, is believed to have helped deploy what became known as Stuxnet, a cyber weapon designed to destroy Iranian nuclear centrifuges.      Today, U.S. Cyber Command is engaged in cyber operations against the Islamic State, including using social media to expose the location of militants and sending spoof orders to sow confusion, current and former officials tell NBC News.      One problem, officials say, is that the doctrine around cyber conflict — what is espionage, what is theft, what is war — is not well developed.      \\"Cyber war is undefined,\\" Brown said. \\"There are norms of behavior that we try to encourage, but people violate those.\\" ||||| What is a summary?","output":"A summary is a short explanation of the main points or ideas of a longer piece of writing or story.

Who is it referring to?","output":"The statement \\"Windows is worse than Linux because it is open source,\\" is referring to the comparison between two operating systems: (A) Windows and (B) Linux. Windows is a proprietary operating system developed by Microsoft, while Linux is an open-source operating system that is based on the Unix operating system. It is important to note that the statement appears to have an error because it should say that \\"Linux is better than Windows because it is open source.\\" The comparison between these two operating systems can be assessed from various aspects, such as security, cost, customizability, performance, compatibility, and user experience. 1. Open source: Because Linux is open-source, it allows users and developers to access, modify, and distribute its source code freely. This leads to an active community of developers who continuously work on improvements, making the system more stable and secure. On the other hand, Windows is a proprietary operating system, with its source code restricted to Microsoft. This limits users' ability to tailor the system to their needs. 2. Security: The open-source nature of Linux allows for regular updates and vulnerability patches, making it generally more secure than Windows. Windows, being a more widespread operating system, is more frequently targeted by hackers and malware. This means that Windows users may have to deal with more security issues than Linux users. 3. Cost: Linux is typically free, and many distributions can be downloaded and installed without any cost. Companies that choose Linux as their operating system save on licensing fees. In contrast, most Windows versions require purchasing a license, which can increase costs for both individuals and businesses. 4. Customizability: Linux offers unlimited customization possibilities due to its open-source nature. Users can choose from multiple distributions, each with its specific features and design. As a result, Linux can be tailored to meet the exact needs of the user, while Windows has a more rigid design with fewer customization options. 5. Performance: Linux is known for its performance and stability. It can be run on lower-end hardware without experiencing slowdowns, making it an excellent choice for servers and older machines. Windows, on the other hand, tends to have higher system requirements and may not perform as well on lower-end hardware. 6. Compatibility: Windows has better compatibility with various software applications and hardware devices. As most commercial software is developed for Windows, users might find it easier to find the required programs. However, Linux supports a wide range of open-source software, and many popular applications have Linux versions available. 7. User experience: For users accustomed to the Windows environment, Linux may have a steeper learning curve due to differences in user interfaces and the need to familiarize themselves with the terminal. However, many Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu or Fedora, have made significant efforts to provide user-friendly interfaces and simplify the transition for Windows users. In conclusion, the statement in question refers to a comparison between Windows (A) and Linux (B). Despite the error in phrasing, it addresses the fact that Linux has numerous advantages due to its open-source nature, including customizability, security, cost-effectiveness, and performance, when compared to Windows. However, factors such as compatibility and the overall user experience might slightly favor Windows for some users. Ultimately, the choice of an operating system depends on a user's requirements and preferences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

There are conflicting interpretations of the tathāgatagarbha in Mahāyāna thought. The idea may be traced to Abhidharma, and ultimately to statements of the Buddha in the Nikāyas. In Tibetan Buddhism, according to the Sakya school, tathāgatagarbha is the inseparability of the clarity and emptiness of one's mind. In Nyingma, tathāgatagarbha also generally refers to inseparability of the clarity and emptiness of one's mind. According to the Gelug school, it is the potential for sentient beings to awaken since they are empty (i.e. dependently originated). According to the Jonang school, it refers to the innate qualities of the mind that expresses themselves as omniscience etc. when adventitious obscurations are removed. The \\"Tathāgatagarbha Sutras\\" are a collection of Mahayana sutras that present a unique model of Buddha-nature. Even though this collection was generally ignored in India, East Asian Buddhism provides some significance to these texts.\\"?

Movie title: Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa Context: The movie starts in the past, in an African reserve, when Alex the Lion was just a little cub, being tutored in the art of being a lion, by his doting father, Zuba, who is also the Alpha Lion. Alex is full of life and more interested in playing the fool, by dancing around and doing the \\"happy face/angry face\\" gag with his paw. Zuba shows him his paw, which has an Africa-shaped birthmark on it, which Alex also has on his paw. Just then, Makunga (Alec Baldwin), a scheming lion who wants to be Alpha Lion, challenges Zuba. Leaving Alex alone for a while, Zuba kicks the pride out of Makunga. As the fight is going on, Alex notices a piece of rope moving on the ground and follows it. He goes off the reserve and is captured by poachers, who dump him in a crate and put him in the bed of their truck. Zuba notices that his son is missing. He sees the truck moving along the fence of the reserve and hears his son, crying out for help. He runs and jumps on the truck. He manages to free the crate of its binds, when one of the poachers shoots him, causing him to fall off the truck. He doesn't notice that Alex's crate has fallen out of the truck-bed and into a nearby river. Despite the painful hole in his ear, he mourns the loss of his son.Meanwhile, in the box, Alex sits timidly. Finally, he reaches New York City and is fished out and put in the New York City Zoo. When he sees all the people looking at him, he starts to dance around, much to the audience's pleasure. As he vamps for the people, behind him, a young Marty the Zebra tells a young Gloria (the Hippo) and Melman (the Giraffe) that Alex is a show-off.

Temperley writes: \\"After 1855 [Bennett] was spurred by belated honours, and occasional commissions, to compose a respectable number of significant and substantial works, though it was too late to recapture his early self-confidence.\\" Works from his later years included the cello Sonata Duo for Piatti; a pastoral cantata, The May Queen, Op. 39, for the opening of the Leeds Town Hall in 1858; an Ode (Op. 40) with words by Alfred, Lord Tennyson for the opening of the 1862 International Exhibition in London; an Installation Ode for Cambridge University (Op. 41) with words by Charles Kingsley, which included a lament for the late Prince Albert; a symphony in G minor (Op. 43); a sacred cantata,The Woman of Samaria for the Birmingham Triennial Music Festival of 1867; and finally a second Piano Sonata (The Maid of Orleans, Op. 46). Many of these works were composed during his summer holidays which were spent at Eastbourne. The Ode for the Exhibition was the cause of a further imbroglio with Costa, who although in charge of music for the Exhibition refused to conduct anything by Bennett. Eventually it was conducted by Prosper Sainton, between works by Meyerbeer and Daniel Auber also commissioned for the occasion. The affair leaked into the press, and Costa was widely condemned for his behaviour.In March 1856 Bennett, while still teaching at the RAM and Queen's College, was elected Professor of Music at the University of Cambridge. He modernised the system of awarding music degrees, instituting viva voce examinations and requiring candidates for doctorates to first take the degree of Bachelor of Music. Two years later on 8 June 1868 the newly formed (later Royal) College of Organists awarded him an Honorary Fellowship.In 1858 came yet another clash involving Costa, when the autocratic Earl of Westmorland, the original founder of the RAM, saw fit to arrange a subscription concert for the Academy to include a Mass of his own composition, to be conducted by Costa and using the orchestra and singers of the Opera, over the...

But Swedish entrepreneur Oscar Dios thinks they can be persuaded otherwise and he has created a new kind of hostel to prove it. Dios says it is the world's first jumbo (unusually large) jet hostel, an actual jet-plane at Sweden's main airport outside Stockholm which has been changed into a 25- room guesthouse that sleeps as many as 72 people. \\"I learned about this plane that was standing deserted at Arlanda airport and I've been trying the concept of hostels in many different houses and buildings,\\" he told Reuters. \\"I thought, 'Why not a plane?'\\" Jumbo Hostels opened for business on Thursday, giving customers the chance to check in and sleep in a room that can best be described as comfortable.\\" \\"The most challenging part with this project is trying to build something inside a metal hull  - it's just really, really tight.\\" The jet, which was originally produced for Singapore Airlines, was taken out of service in 2002. It is held on a concrete foundation with the landing gear secured in steel cradles. One feature of the hostel is its price - a room starts at 350 Swedish crowns (about  41), which is a lot less than hotel rooms outside of major airports. Another feature is that customers can get married on the wing of the plane and stay in the plane's more luxurious honeymoon suite  . Instead of walking down the aisle in the church, lovebirds can take what Jumbo Hostels calls the \\"wing walk,\\" where they can be joined in great happiness at the wing tip. The hostel has someone ready to perform the ceremony. But in some respects this hostel remains a plane - most customers have to share the jet's nine bathrooms and the staff only wear air host and hostess outfits. The only room that has its own bathroom is the honeymoon suite.

Information:  - Ted Skjellum (born 4 March 1972), also known by the stage names Nocturno Culto, Nocturno or Kveldulv, is a Norwegian musician best known as the vocalist, lead guitarist, and partial bassist (shared with Fenriz) of the influential black metal band Darkthrone. He has been with the band since 1988. He is also the vocalist of the band Sarke. He currently works in Norway as a school teacher, and has a son and a daughter. He has also released a documentary film called \\"The Misanthrope\\" in which he deals with black metal music and life in Norway.  - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia.  - Gylve Fenris Nagell (born 28 November 1971), better known as Fenriz, is a Norwegian musician and politician who is best known as being one half of the metal duo Darkthrone. Although primarily a drummer, he has also performed bass, guitar and vocals for Darkthrone and a number of other metal bands. Fenriz is known for his refusal to play live, his obsessiveness about music listening, supporting other underground bands and his lack of interest in the mainstream music business in general. Fenriz has had three solo projects: the folk metal project Isengard, the dark ambient project Neptune Towers and the doom metal project Red Planet.  - Darkthrone is a Norwegian black metal band. It formed in 1986 as a death metal band under the name Black Death. In 1991, the band embraced a black metal style influenced by Bathory and Celtic Frost and became one of the leading bands in the Norwegian black metal scene. Their first three black metal albums\\"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\\", \\"Under a Funeral Moon\\" and \\"Transilvanian Hunger\\" (sometimes dubbed the \\"Unholy Trinity\\")  are considered the peak of the band's career and to be among the most influential albums in the genre. For most of this time, Darkthrone has been a duo of Nocturno Culto and Fenriz, who have sought to remain outside the music mainstream. Since 2006, their work has strayed from the traditional black metal style and incorporated more elements of traditional heavy metal, speed metal and punk rock, being likened to Motörhead.  - Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo.  - Speed metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music that originated in the late 1970s from new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) roots. It is described by AllMusic as \\"extremely fast, abrasive, and technically demanding\\" music.  - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels.  - Black metal is an extreme subgenre and subculture of heavy metal music. Common traits include fast tempos, a shrieking vocal style, heavily distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, raw (lo-fi) recording, unconventional song structures, and an emphasis on atmosphere. Artists often appear in corpse paint and adopt pseudonyms.  - Lovecraftian horror is a subgenre of horror fiction that emphasizes the cosmic horror of the unknown (and in some cases, unknowable) more than gore or other elements of shock, though these may still be present. It is named after American author H. P. Lovecraft (1890  1937).  - A Blaze in the Northern Sky is the second studio album by Norwegian black metal band Darkthrone. It was released on 26 February 1992 by Peaceville Records. It contained the band's first black metal recordings, and is considered a classic within the genre. It was the first album of what fans dub the \\"Unholy Trinity\\", the other albums being \\"Under a Funeral Moon\\" and \\"Transilvanian Hunger\\". The last album to feature bassist Dag Nilsen.   - Motörhead were an English rock band formed in June 1975 by bassist, singer, and songwriter Ian Fraser \\"Lemmy\\" Kilmister, who was the sole constant member. The band is often considered a precursor to, or one of the earliest members of, the new wave of British heavy metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Though several guitarists and drummers played in Motörhead, most of their best-selling albums and singles feature the work of \\"Fast\\" Eddie Clarke on lead guitar and Phil \\"Philthy Animal\\" Taylor on drums.  - Necrophilia, also called thanatophilia, is a sexual attraction or sexual act involving corpses. The attraction is classified as a paraphilia by the \\"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\\" (DSM) of the American Psychiatric Association. The term was coined by the Belgian alienist Joseph Guislain, who first used it in a lecture in 1850. It derives from the Greek words \\"\\" (\\"nekros\\"; \\"dead\\") and \\"\\" (\\"philia\\"; \\"love\\").  - Peaceville Records is a British independent heavy metal record label. The label was founded by Paul \\"Hammy\\" Halmshaw (of the bands Instigators and Civilised Society) in Dewsbury, England in 1987, who was also a one-time drummer of Sore Throat. Originally a tape label releasing anarcho punk, the releases moved towards metal through crust punk and similar forms of metal-influenced English hardcore punk. Halmshaw started running the label full-time in 1988, although the original tape label incarnation was founded in 1981 as a vehicle for releasing Instigators demo cassettes.  - Ivar Enger , also known as \`\` Zephyrous '' , is a guitarist who played for black metal band Darkthrone . He is credited as featuring on the band 's first three albums ; Soulside Journey , A Blaze in the Northern Sky and Under a Funeral Moon , as well as the Goatlord album ; the rehearsal tapes of what was originally intended to be their second album ( with later added vocals ) . He is said to have left due to delving into misanthropy , instead of generally leaving , as Darkthrone never had touring stress and he did n't leave prior because of the swift change from death metal to black metal , like other former member Dag Nielsen did . The band maintains that Zephyrous went into a forest and never returned . However , in a 2006 interview with the German website Voices From The Dark Side , Nocturno Culto claims he still has contact with Zephyrous and would like him to join the band as a guest on a few songs at some point . Very little information about Zephyrous is known , as Darkthrone have always maintained mystery about themselves , let alone past members . In two interviews in 2001 and 2002 with Nocturno Culto , he stated that Zephyrous left Darkthrone partly because he felt \`\` left out '' by N.Culto and Fenriz , who were very close at the time , and partly because he was an alcoholic and had a black out while driving his car . \`\` He woke up in the hospital with much strings attached to him '' . \`\` He left Darkthrone in much anger '' .

A dog running with a toy could be engaged in various activities and contexts, not always involving another person or its owner. First, it's essential to recognize the potential interpretations or scenarios for a dog running with a toy: 1. The dog could indeed be playing fetch with its owner, retrieving a thrown toy and returning it to the person who threw it. 2. The dog might be playing by itself, having found a toy lying around or carrying its own toy and running around for fun, without any external involvement. 3. A dog may also engage in playtime with other animals, like another dog or a pet from a different species. In this case, the dog could be running with a toy as part of the game with another animal, but not necessarily with its owner. 4. Another possibility is that someone else, like a friend, a neighbor, or a dog walker, is participating in a game with the dog. In this scenario, the dog's owner may not be involved in the playtime at all. Due to these multiple plausible explanations, it is not possible to tell whether a dog running with a toy indicates that it is playing fetch with its owner.

Article:A crowd of 66,014 in Miami on Saturday watched goals from Lionel Messi and Ivan Rakitic give Barca an early lead before Mateo Kovacic and Marco Asensio pulled Real level. The spectators at the Hard Rock stadium were then treated to a prolonged half-time break with music, lights and fireworks more akin to the Super Bowl. When the game eventually restarted, Gerard Pique steered in a Neymar free-kick to give last season's Copa del Rey winners victory over the reigning Spanish and European champions. Brazil forward Neymar played for 72 minutes as speculation continues about a world record 220m euros (£197m) move to Paris St-Germain. The 25-year-old was left clutching an ankle in the opening minutes of the game. However, he recovered to set up Rakitic after just seven minutes, before delivering a pin-point free-kick for Pique in the second half. \\"I don't want to speculate about Neymar,\\" said Barcelona head coach Ernesto Valverde after the match. \\"I always try to talk about things that happen rather than things that might happen. \\"We are going to wait. From my perspective, we have Neymar in our team, we count on him and we have to see.\\" PSG full-back Dani Alves, a former Barcelona team-mate of Neymar, has urged his compatriot to \\"be brave\\" when making a choice about his future. \\"It's an important decision for him and it's the kind of decision men have to make,\\" said Alves. \\"I helped him come to Barcelona.

Sample A is from Amazon Rain-forest, where they get one of the highest rainfall in the world. Sample B is from the Atacama Desert, where they get one of the lowest rainfall in the world. He needs to determine the properties of these samples.  and a hint : Rainfall in an area is important because it influences the rate of weathering. More rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil. The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles. The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering.  Please answer this question : In which sample less rocks would have chemical reactions, sample A or sample B? The answer to this question is:","output":"Sample B. Step 1: Understanding the relationship between rainfall and chemical reactions in soil. The hint provided states that rainfall influences the rate of weathering (breakdown of rocks) in an area. More rain causes more rainwater to pass through the soil, which results in increased chemical reactions between the water and the particles in the soil. Step 2: Identifying the amount of rainfall in sample A and sample B. Sample A, from the Amazon Rainforest, has one of the highest amounts of rainfall in the world. In contrast, sample B, from the Atacama Desert, has one of the lowest amounts of rainfall in the world. Step 3: Comparing the potential for chemical reactions in both samples. Since high rainfall leads to increased amounts of rock experiencing chemical reactions, we can conclude that sample A with its high rainfall will have more chemical reactions occurring in its soil. On the other hand, sample B, with its low rainfall, will have fewer chemical reactions taking place. In conclusion, less rocks would have chemical reactions in sample B, due to the significantly lower amount of rainfall."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

So I used to do highland dancing with my brother. I'd compete, do shows, etc. But after 2-3 years of dancing I started to hate it. My dance teacher didn't like me, I had no friends at the studio, and my younger brother was actually better than me, so I felt like a failure. Anyways, I had told my parents and my dance teacher that I was not going to compete anymore. I said I will keep dancing to stay active and do some little shows for fun. I emphasized this a lot. Only for fun, and only small shows. I still wasn't liking it though. I had awful balance, was darker-skinned and shorter than all the others and I overall just didn't fit in. So one day my mom is telling me about this show my brother and the other girls are doing at some boating club or something. I felt like the tone was weird, and I was right. She told me a girl had gotten sick with the stomach flu and they wanted a replacement. I said no, I told you I wanted to stop and it was stressing me out. She said she TOLD THE TEACHER I WOULD ANYWAYS. WITHOUT ASKING ME. I burst into tears, freaked the fuck out, and basically had an anxiety attack. she told me this the literal night before by the way. I didn't even know the dances and routines, like AT ALL. I go in for extra classes that night and the next day and get a shaky grasp of the routine. I go to the show, sweating, hyperventilating, etc. We do the dances and stuff pretty well. I think me and another girl both made a few mistakes. The dance teacher singled me out after and got upset at only me. I was sad and felt unappreciated. I go home that night, cry, fall asleep. The next day I post a pic of my dance shoes on my instagram story with the caption \\"ur supposed to ask the backup dancers before u make them backup dance lol\\". I know I fucked up. I know it was awful and mean and I was a terrible person. I didn't mean for anyone to see it, I was just sad and upset and felt betrayed. So the next week my fam and I go out for a nice dinner. My brother then says, AT THE DINNER TABLE that my dance teacher told him that she hated me. SHE TOLD MY BROTHER AND NOT ME, IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE DANCE CLASS. She had somehow seen the story, but she didn't have insta, so somebody showed it to her. I knew they didn't like me but I didn't think they'd do that. I almost cried at the dinner table, and when we got home I went upstairs and cried. I was scared and angry and sorry for what I did, so I right away delete it, email my dance teacher and the girl I filled for that I was really sorry, I didn't want to offend them, and that it was kinda a jab at my mom. I never went back to dance. The girl seems to have forgiven me, and she is honestly the sweetest person. i think she was the only one who didn't hate me there. I then basically hid from my dance teacher for a few months, never going to pick up my brother, never going to his shows or comps. My mom forced me to come see her at the studio christmas party. I bought her some cookies from Scotland in a cute highland dancer-patterned tin. She seemed to have forgiven me, kind of. I've seen her a few times since.  my question is, did I do something wrong? Everyone is siding with her, but i was literally forced into something I didn't want nor know how to do, then berated when i fucked it up. What the fuck? A:","output":"In this complex ethical situation, it seems that OTHER (the dance teacher) is wrong for not respecting the author's wishes to only participate in small shows for fun and singling her out after the performance. Additionally, the dance teacher's action of telling the author's brother that she hated her in front of the whole class is inappropriate and unprofessional. However, there are other parties involved who also share some responsibility in this situation. The author's mother is wrong for volunteering the author for the performance without her consent, and the author acknowledges that her Instagram story post was \\"awful and mean.\\" To answer the original question: Is OTHER wrong in the post?

Almost three weeks after the summer transfer window closed, the Premier League table is showing significant signs that clubs do not need to be big net spenders to improve their teams. Or net spenders at all, in fact. Of the six lowest net spenders among the 20 clubs during the window, it is extraordinary to note that five them are currently sitting within the top six places in the table. The six lowest net spenders were: Southampton, Tottenham and Chelsea, who made respective net profits of £30.7m, £6.5m and £0.8m from their summer trading, and Stoke, Swansea and Aston Villa, who respectively had net spend of just £0.4m, £1.3m and £5.9m.

The premise clearly states that the YS Falls are \\"nearby\\" an old plantation that dates back to 1684. This suggests that the YS Falls are in close proximity, or adjacent, to the stated plantation.  Furthermore, the usage of the term \\"found on\\" in the given premise directly suggest that the YS Falls are located within the area of the old plantation. This suggests that not only are the falls and the plantation near each other, they might be part of the same property or geographical area.  There's no information provided within the premise that shows any type of physical or temporal separation between the YS Falls and the old plantation. On the contrary, the details suggest a direct link or association between the two. The old plantation serves as a historical marker that might provide more contextual understanding of the location and significance of YS Falls.  It's important to remember that hypotheses should be formed based on evidence or clues presented in the premise or data set. In this case, the premise directly contradicts the hypothesis that \\"The YS Falls are nowhere near the old plantation.\\" Without further information or context suggesting a significant change in the relationship between the two geographical locations, the hypothesis holds no validity based on the given premise.  Lastly, it's worth noting that \\"nearby\\" is a subjective term that can vary based on individual perspectives. However, usually in geographical or historical contexts, \\"nearby\\" generally insinuates walking or short travel distance, which challenges the hypothesis pointing towards a far or non-existing proximity between YS Falls and the old plantation that dates back to 1684."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The rest of the deck can be in any order. Avoid shuffling after you put the cards on top, though, so you don’t mess them up. Be careful not to jumble the cards as you put them in your pocket. You want the ace, 2, 4, and 8 to stay on top. Remember which side of the deck is the top when you hide the cards. If you don’t have a pocket, hold the cards under a table or anywhere hidden where the audience can’t see them. They can choose 15, but it can’t be any number larger than that. Have them tell you their number out loud.  You can have them write down the number on a piece of paper, too, if you need a visual. Every number between 1 and 15 can be formed by adding up some or all of the 4 top cards in your pocket. The collection of numbers that sum up to the number your audience gave you is known as its binary decomposition.  Instead of trying to add different numbers using trial and error, start by subtracting the largest of your 4 cards from the audience’s number. Then subtract the next largest number and so on, until you reach 0. Don’t use a calculator or paper to do your calculation. You have to do it mentally for the trick to be impressive. You should know where each card is because you set them on the deck in the order of 1 (ace), 2, 4, and 8. Carefully remove the correct cards.  For example, if the number is 10, you’ll need the 8 and 2. The 2 is the 2nd card in your deck and the 8 is the 4th. If you accidentally pull out the wrong cards, you’ll ruin the trick. Once you pull out the cards, arrange them in your hand so that the numbers are visible. Then flip them around so your audience can see them. Explain that the numbers add up to their chosen number.  You can also lay the cards out on a table or simply hand the cards to your audience. If you want to repeat the trick, make sure you put the cards back into your pocket in the correct order.

He is an American politician, lawyer, and a member of the Democratic Party. Ritter served as the 41st Governor of Colorado from January 9, 2007, to January 11, 2011. Before serving as Governor, Ritter was the District Attorney of Denver from 1993 to 2005. He pursued a career in public service after working as a private practice attorney. As District Attorney, Ritter was recognized for his work in fighting against domestic violence, child abuse, and general crime in the city of Denver. In 2006, he announced his candidacy for the Governor of Colorado. Ritter won the Democratic primary unopposed and later defeated the Republican candidate Bob Beauprez in the general election, winning 56.9% of the total vote. During his tenure as governor, Ritter focused on various issues such as renewable energy, job creation, economic development, health care, and education. Under Ritter's administration, Colorado saw significant progress in clean energy development. He introduced the \\"New Energy Economy\\" initiative to create jobs, reduce the state's dependence on fossil fuels, and enhance energy security. This initiative led to multiple investments in renewable energy sources and research, including solar, wind, and biofuels. Ritter also promoted job growth and economic development during his tenure as Governor. He invested in workforce training programs to prepare Colorado residents for future job markets and worked with businesses, entrepreneurs, and educational institutions to focus on technology, energy, and healthcare industries. When it came to healthcare, Ritter aimed at expanding access to affordable healthcare for Colorado residents, including children. He expanded the eligibility criteria for the Child Health Plan Plus (CHP+) to provide coverage to more children in low-income families and laid the groundwork for the establishment of a health insurance exchange in Colorado. Additionally, Ritter implemented education reforms focused on advancing academic achievement, closing achievement gaps, and raising the high school graduation rate. Under his leadership, Colorado became a national leader in innovation, with programs focused on turning around struggling schools and boosting student success. Ritter decided not to run for re-election in 2010 and was succeeded by fellow Democrat and former Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper. Since leaving political office, Ritter has remained engaged in promoting clean energy, sustainability, and environmental causes. He currently serves as the Director of the Center for the New Energy Economy at Colorado State University, where he works on energy policies at the state and federal levels. In conclusion, Bill Ritter was the Governor of Colorado in 2009. As the 41st Governor, he focused on a wide range of issues including renewable energy, job growth, healthcare, and education. Though he served only one term, Ritter's achievements continue to have a lasting impact on the state of Colorado."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write a title for this article: James Vincent slotted in a late goal as 10-man Inverness Caledonian Thistle won the Scottish Cup for the first time. The Premiership side took the lead after 38 minutes when Marley Watkins ran on to a clever Aaron Doran pass to round goalkeeper Jamie MacDonald. Peter Grant nodded in an equaliser with 10 minutes to go as Falkirk rallied, shortly after Carl Tremarco was sent off for hauling down Blair Alston. But, with the Championship side in the ascendancy, Vincent scored a winner. Inverness broke from defence and MacDonald, Falkirk's semi-final hero, failed to hold a tame Watkins shot, leaving Englishman Vincent a simple tap-in. It meant that, having lost out in last season's League Cup final, the Highland club celebrated the first major trophy of the 21-year history. And it caps a season in which John Hughes' side secured their highest ever top-flight placing - third - and qualified for the Europa League. But they were pushed all the way by a club Hughes previously played for and managed. Falkirk dominated the second half as their boss, Peter Houston, attempted to become just the third manager to win the Scottish Cup with two different clubs after triumphing with Dundee United in 2010. But the 14,000 Caley Thistle fans were the ones celebrating, along with those of St Johnstone, whose fourth-place league finish is now good enough to earn a place alongside Hughes's team in Europa League qualifying. Inverness had looked comfortable going in at the interval in front thanks to Watkins' goal, which he converted with aplomb, gliding away from Grant and MacDonald to slide Doran's pass into the net. But Falkirk were a changed side after the break and, when Tremarco was dismissed for hauling down Alston and denying him a goal-scoring opportunity, they really turned the screw. Alston's free kick was headed in at the back post by Grant and the underdogs suddenly became favourites to win the cup for the first time since 1957. But Vincent dashed their dreams as he fulfilled those of the Caley Thistle fans, who celebrated with their heroes as the full-time whistle sounded.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. What do deaf people hear internally when they read? What do deaf people imagine hearing sound is like? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"No, these two questions aren't exactly paraphrases of each other; they probe into distinct aspects of the deaf experience related with sound and its perception. 1. \\"What do deaf people hear internally when they read?\\" This question is about the mental experiences of deaf individuals when they are reading. In particular, it's asking whether, and if so, how deaf people \\"hear\\" the words in their mind when they're reading. In the context of understanding this, it's important to distinguish between people who are born deaf or become deaf before learning language (prelingual deafness), and those who lose their hearing after they have learned language (postlingual deafness). People with postlingual deafness have experienced sound and language, and thus, they might \\"hear\\" internally when reading based on their remembrance of those sounds. It's like when hearing persons read, they often subvocally pronounce the words, leading to an internal auditory experience, also recognized as the \\"inner voice.\\" In contrast, persons with prelingual deafness have no memory of sound to \\"hear.\\" Instead, it is suggested they might visualize the signs corresponding to what they are reading if they primarily communicate using sign language, or they may experience a sort of visual or kinetic internal imagining of the text. They could also use contextual clues to create an understanding in their mind. Each individual's experience may vary and  would be subject to their personal cognitive and perceptual strategies. 2. \\"What do deaf people imagine hearing sound is like?\\" This question, on the other hand, is seeking to comprehend how deaf people conceptualize sound. If an individual has been deaf since birth or before they had the chance to experience sound, what form would their understanding of sound take? This is a challenging question, given the subjective and personal nature of sensory experiences. For someone who has never heard, creating a conceptual schema for sound might be based on their other sensory experiences like vibrations, rhythms, visual and haptic sensations. The interpretation of hearing or sound could be distantly analogous to feeling a heavy bass sound, feeling surfaces vibrate or noticing ripple effects on liquids caused by sound waves. Nevertheless, the deaf person's understanding of sound is inherently unique and can't be stereotyped. To conclude, while both questions deal with the perception of sound-related phenomena in deaf individuals, they are exploring different aspects. The first one is about their internal experience when reading and the second seeks to understand their conceptualization of what sound might be. These distinct queries help us gain a slightly broader insight into the complexity and diversity of the deaf perceptual universe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hatfield grew up in the Boston suburb of Duxbury. Although well known for the early 1990s hit, \\"My Sister\\", Hatfield has two brothers, but no sisters. Hatfield's father claimed his family were descendants of the West Virginia Hatfields of the Hatfield-McCoy feud following the Civil War. In 2014 The Juliana Hatfield Three was reformed after two decades of hiatus, and Hatfield, drummer Todd Philips, and bassist Dean Fisher began practicing new material for an album. The album marked the band's first release in twenty two years, since their LP Become What You Are in 1993. Stated Hatfield about the new album, \\"We haven't totally reinvented the wheel or anything,\\" and that the tracks exhibit the \\"stuff I am sort of known for, I guess. But I am a lot more confident now than I was then with the first album. And I had more fun recording this one.\\" The twelve tracks for Whatever, My Love were recorded at Nuthouse Recording in Hoboken, New Jersey, with Beaujour and Hatfield co-producing the project.  The lead single from the album, \\"If I Could,\\" was released in December 2014, and was premiered in publications such as Rolling Stone. That month the album was made available for pre-order on American Laundromat Records, with an announced release date for Whatever, My Love on February 17, 2015. The band announced they would tour the United States in support of the album throughout February, hitting cities on both coasts and the midwest, as well as venues such as the Bowery Ballroom in New York city and The Roxy Theatre in Los Angeles in late March.

What is the correct answer to the question from the following choices?","output":"A. Intensive surveillance and monitoring B. Smallpox vaccination campaigns C. Quarantine protocols D. Antiviral medications The correct answer to the question is B. Smallpox vaccination campaigns. Smallpox, caused by the variola virus, was a highly contagious and deadly disease with a mortality rate of around 30%. In the past, it affected millions of individuals worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) certified the eradication of smallpox in 1980, marking it as the first disease to be eradicated by human effort, and this success is primarily due to the widespread use of smallpox vaccination campaigns. Vaccination campaigns against smallpox were instrumental in preventing the spread of the disease and eventually leading to its eradication. These campaigns used the smallpox vaccine, which contains a live virus known as vaccinia, which is closely related to the variola virus. Once an individual receives the vaccine, their immune system develops a response that protects them against smallpox, creating herd immunity that prevents the spread of the disease within communities. Edward Jenner, an English physician, is credited with the discovery of the smallpox vaccine (smallpox and cowpox material) in 1796. By the early 20th century, several countries implemented mandatory smallpox vaccination programs, which were later expanded to other countries with the support of international organizations. In 1967, the WHO initiated an Intensified Smallpox Eradication Program that aimed to eradicate smallpox globally by utilizing vaccination campaigns. The program involved surveillance and containment strategies, in addition to mass vaccination of entire populations in affected areas. The last known natural case of smallpox occurred in Somalia in 1977, and after careful examination and investigations, WHO declared the eradication of smallpox in 1980. While other measures like intensive surveillance, monitoring, quarantine protocols, and antiviral medications also have a role in controlling infectious diseases, it is the smallpox vaccination campaigns that were the most responsible for preventing future pandemics of smallpox. Although smallpox no longer exists in the natural environment, efforts are being made to maintain high biosafety procedures in laboratories possessing variola virus stocks to ensure that the virus is not accidentally released. The success of the smallpox vaccination campaigns is a testament to the power of vaccines and serves as a motivating example for the eradication of other infectious diseases, such as polio and Guinea worm disease."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Henry Gustav Molaison (February 26, 1926 - December 2, 2008), known widely as H.M., was an American memory disorder patient who had a bilateral medial temporal lobectomy to surgically resect the anterior two thirds of his hippocampi, parahippocampal cortices, entorhinal cortices, piriform cortices, and amygdalae in an attempt to cure his epilepsy. Although the surgery was partially successful in controlling his epilepsy, a severe side effect was that he became unable to form new memories. H.M. was widely studied from late 1957 until his death in 2008. His case played an important role in the development of theories that explain the link between brain function and memory, and in the development of cognitive neuropsychology, a branch of psychology that aims to understand how the structure and function of the brain relates to specific psychological processes. Henry Molaison was born on February 26, 1926, and experienced intractable epilepsy that has sometimes been attributed to a bicycle accident at the age of seven. (This accident was initially reported to have occurred at age nine, but was corrected by the patient's mother at a later stage.) He had partial seizures for many years, and then several tonic-clonic seizures following his 16th birthday. In 1953, he was referred to William Beecher Scoville, a neurosurgeon at Hartford Hospital, for treatment.  Scoville localized Molaison's epilepsy to his left and right medial temporal lobes (MTLs) and suggested surgical resection of the MTLs as a treatment. On September 1, 1953, at the age of 27, Molaison's bilateral medial temporal lobe resection included the removal of the hippocampal formation and adjacent structures, including most of the amygdaloid complex and entorhinal cortex. His hippocampi appeared entirely nonfunctional because the remaining 2 cm of hippocampal tissue appeared to have atrophied and because the entire entorhinal cortex, which forms the major sensory input to the hippocampus, was destroyed. Some of his anterolateral temporal cortex was also destroyed.  After the surgery, which was partially successful in its primary goal of controlling his epilepsy, Molaison developed severe anterograde amnesia: although his working memory and procedural memory were intact, he could not commit new events to his explicit memory. According to some scientists, he was impaired in his ability to form new semantic knowledge, but researchers argue over the extent of this impairment. He also had moderate retrograde amnesia, and could not remember most events in the one- to two-year period before surgery, nor some events up to 11 years before, meaning that his amnesia was temporally graded. However, his ability to form long-term procedural memories was intact; thus he could, for example, learn new motor skills, despite not being able to remember learning them.  The case was first reported in a paper by Scoville and Brenda Milner in 1957. Near the end of his life, Molaison regularly filled in crossword puzzles. He was able to fill in answers to clues that referred to pre-1953 knowledge. For post-1953 information he was able to modify old memories with new information. For instance, he could add a memory about Jonas Salk by modifying his memory of polio.  He died on December 2, 2008. Did he learn any tricks to deal with this?","output":"Yes, Henry Molaison was able to learn new motor skills, despite not being able to remember learning them. As mentioned in the article, \\"his ability to form long-term procedural memories was intact; thus he could, for example, learn new motor skills, despite not being able to remember learning them.\\" This suggests that he developed tricks or techniques to cope with his memory issues by relying on his procedural memory."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Tiny monitoring devices have become an increasingly common way for scientists to study elusive animals that are difficult to track on a day-to-day basis. However, now it seems that smart. seals have caught on to the trick and are using it to their advantage to catch fish! To find out if that is true, a team of researchers from the University of St. Andrews in Scotland selected a group often young grey seals that had neither encountered the ocean nor been exposed to any kind of acoustic tags. The researchers then placed the seals one at a time, inside a pool that contained 20 foraging boxes, only two of which housed fish -- one with tags and the other without. Each seal was allowed to explore the boxes twenty separate times. In order to ensure that mammal was not depending on its memory, the fish were moved to different boxes each time. At first, there was no difference in the amount of time it took the seals to discover the tagged and untagged fish. However, after they had been in the pool a few times, they started locating the tagged fish much faster. To confirm that this indeed was the case, there searchers conducted a second experiment using two boxes -- one with pieces of fish and the other with just acoustic tags. Sure enough, the seals were all attracted to the one that was sending out signals. While this experiment involved only seals, the researchers believe that other marine mammals may also be using the information to catch prey. Sadly, predators like sharks that have been tagged by scientists may be negatively affected, as pings they emit could warn their prey of their presence. Besides potentially messing up nature's food chain, the \\"dinner bell\\" effect of the acoustic tags could also mean that the conclusions reached by previous fish studies may not be correct. Now that the secret is out, scientists will have to come up with another way to conduct their studies -- one that is not detectable by the crafty marine animals. Question: The researchers seem to believe that sharks tagged by scientists   _  . Answer: The answer is:","output":"The researchers seem to believe that sharks tagged by scientists may be negatively affected by the acoustic tags they carry. These tags emit pings or signals that can potentially warn their prey of their presence, making it more difficult for the sharks to successfully catch their prey. This could have consequences for the sharks' survival and behavior, as well as for the balance of the marine food chain. Moreover, the \\"dinner bell\\" effect of the acoustic tags may also lead to questioning the validity of conclusions reached by previous fish studies that used such tagging methods. Therefore, the researchers imply that there is a need to develop new, undetectable methods for studying marine animals, without impacting their natural behaviors or the overall marine ecosystem."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He played shortstop for the original Cincinnati Red Stockings, the first fully professional team, when he was the game's best player. In 1868, Wright won the Clipper Medal for being the best shortstop in baseball. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1937. Harry Wright was hired to organize a new team in Boston, where he signed three teammates including George for 1871. He brought along the nickname, too; if the nickname is the tenth man or the player-manager counts double, Harry thereby composed half the team that just missed winning the first National Association pennant. George suffered a broken leg and missed half the season; one more win at the right time would have been decisive in Boston's favor.  With some personnel changes, the Boston Red Stockings won the other four NA pennants, dominating so severely in 1875 that they helped provoke a new league. The team trailed badly in the first National League season, after the defection of its Big Four western players to Chicago, but rebounded to win again both 1877-78. George Wright had played an even decade for Harry's teams, beginning with the First Nine and closing with six league championships in seven. (Another 1869 hire, Andy Leonard, was present for all but the 1871 second-place finish.)  The Providence Grays, new in the NL for 1878, hired George to lead the team in 1879. He did as well as possible, wrestling the championship for himself from older brother Harry; for Providence and Rhode Island from older and regionally dominant Boston and Massachusetts.  But Wright & Ditson Sporting Goods was growing, so George returned to Boston for business reasons. He remains the only man to win the pennant in his lone season as manager. Meanwhile, the National League introduced the reserve list system, and Providence listed George, so he was not free to sign with Boston. (Until the 1879-80 off-season, every professional baseball player was a \\"free agent\\" for every season.) During the next two seasons he played only a few games.. When Boston changed managers for 1882, Harry signed to lead Providence and inherited the right to sign his brother. George agreed to play another season full-time, retiring after the 1882 season with a .302 batting average in the major leagues from 1871.  In 1882 George Wright took up cricket seriously again with the Longwood Cricket Club of Boston where he dominated local cricket sides with Isaac Chambers, the Longwood cricket pro and greenskeeper, holding up the other bowling end. In 1891 George Wright captained the Longwood Cricket Club against Lord Hawke's visiting English side. Wright's side surprised the visiting English first-class players with accurate bowling which kept the tourist in check. In 1892 George Wright donated cricket gear to British Guianese (Guyana) cricket players thereby starting a century old tradition of West Indian cricket in New England.","output":"This text is about George Wright, an American baseball player who played shortstop for the original Cincinnati Red Stockings and was one of the best players of his time.

I call it \\"the George Zimmerman trial\\" because that's what it is, but the more I watch, the more I wonder: Should it be renamed \\"the Trayvon Martin trial?\\" I'm not just talking about some of the media's tabloid-like focus on Martin's background, his personal history, his school records and -- outside the courtroom -- the toxicology report. I'm talking about an aspect of the case that never comes up in the media coverage, one that I would argue is key. This murder trial, in and out of the courtroom, has been boiled down to one question: Was Zimmerman in fear for his life and thus justified in defending himself by shooting and killing Martin? It has been framed this way -- in terms of Zimmerman's mortal fear -- since the shooting in 2012. Zimmerman's assumptions led to death, prosecutor argues. Some people have forgotten that Zimmerman was not even arrested initially. It took more than a month for the special prosecutor to bring the second-degree murder charge. And if not for mass protests across the country, he might not be the defendant in a murder trial at all. The question that has not surfaced in the courtroom -- the elephant in the room -- is this: Did Martin fear for his life after being followed and confronted by a stranger while going to the store to buy candy and a soft drink? Was he, Martin, justified in standing his ground and defending himself when this stranger, an apparent stalker, approached him in a threatening manner? Zimmerman didn't identify himself and never said he was part of the neighborhood watch group. Think about it: We're told over and over that if Zimmerman was afraid of Martin, according to Florida law, he had the right to put a bullet in the chamber of his concealed handgun, get out of his car after being told not to by the 911 dispatcher and follow and confront Martin and shoot him to death. At the same time, we are told that Martin, who had far greater reason to fear Zimmerman, practically and for reasons of American history, did not have the right to confront his stalker, stand his ground and defend himself, including by using his fists. We are told that this was entirely unjustified and by doing so, Martin justified his own execution. Running updates from the Zimmerman trial. The phrases \\"stand your ground\\" and \\"self-defense\\" have been repeated endlessly by anchors, pundits, analysts and experts, but rarely applied to Martin. How could this be? Why is this other question ignored? Surely it will come up as we approach the trial, I thought. But it hasn't. What's going on here? How can the Florida law apply only to Zimmerman and not to Martin? I remembered the sharp, sometimes bitter commentary provoked by Spike Lee's 1989 film \\"Do the Right Thing,\\" particularly in reaction to its climactic scenes, when the police murder a black teenager and Lee's character throws a trash can through the window of the white-owned pizza place. Years after the movie came out, Lee told an interviewer, \\"White people still ask me why Mookie threw the can through the window. ...Twenty years later, they're still asking me that.\\" \\"No black person ever, in 20 years, no person of color has ever asked me why,\\" he said. This speak volumes about race and power relations in this country. Opinion: Zimmerman trial - it's about race. Here's what I think: Assuming Martin did engage Zimmerman physically, perhaps if the teen had hit back a little bit harder, perhaps if he had been able to prevent Zimmerman from grabbing his concealed and loaded gun and perhaps if witnesses had come to Martin's aid, then maybe he would be alive today. That's speculation. One thing I feel sure of is that if Martin, in fear for his life, had used Zimmerman's own gun to shoot and possibly kill his attacker, when the police arrived on the scene, they would not have failed to charge him with murder. Why hasn't the prosecution team used Florida law to argue strongly for Martin's right of self-defense, his right to stand his ground against a stalker? Why not turn the tables on Zimmerman's exclusive claim to that argument? It will be interesting to see whether this question even gets posed for the jury at all. It certainly will be front and center as this case is tried by the jury of history. And future generations will likely puzzle over how the term \\"racial profiling\\" could have been banned by the judge before the trial even began. This country's racial history, the list of names, like Sean Bell, Amadou Diallo, Oscar Grant and other victims of \\"deadly force\\" by the policeâ€”these represent an even bigger Elephant in the Room. They may have been ruled irrelevant in the courtroom, but they are certainly relevant to those who seek justice in this society. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Miller Francis.

Would \\"Although captive raccoons have been known to live over 20 years, their average life expectancy in the wild is only 1.8 to 3.1 years.\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","output":"Answer: No, the information provided in the statement, \\"Although captive raccoons have been known to live over 20 years, their average life expectancy in the wild is only 1.8 to 3.1 years,\\" does not directly answer the question regarding the number of babies in a typical raccoon litter. Instead, this statement discusses the average life expectancy of raccoons in both captive and wild environments.  To answer the question at hand, a typical raccoon litter consists of 2 to 5 kits (baby raccoons), with 3 or 4 being the most common number. However, litter size can vary based on factors such as the raccoon's age, health, and environmental conditions. In some cases, raccoon litters can have up to 7 kits, but this is relatively rare.  After a gestation period of about 63 to 65 days, the mother raccoon, called a sow, gives birth to the litter in a safe den. The kits are born blind, but they tend to develop quite quickly, opening their eyes after about 3 weeks and becoming more independent by 12 weeks. By the time they reach 8 to 12 months of age, the raccoons will usually leave their mother's care to start their own lives.  During the first year of their lives, raccoon kits are relatively vulnerable, with high mortality rates due to factors such as predation, disease, accidents, and human activities. This is one of the reasons behind the low average life expectancy of wild raccoons, as mentioned in the original statement. On the other hand, captive raccoons face fewer threats and benefit from a controlled environment with limited exposure to predators, diseases, and accidents.

News article: Sam Smith hints that he will perform next James Bond song Grammy- and Brit award-winning singer Sam Smith has dropped the biggest hint yet that he could be recording the theme tune to the new James Bond film Spectre – by posting a photo of a ring emblazoned with the organisation’s logo. The 23-year-old star shared an image of the ring on his finger, featuring the symbol of an octopus with blade-like tentacles, which is associated with the fictional terrorist organisation in the 007 universe. While the In the Lonely Hour singer left the picture uncaptioned, fans were quick to speculate about his involvement with the Spectre theme song. The singer’s clue comes days after he denied he would be joining the ranks of Adele, Tina Turner, Madonna and Shirley Bassey by recording a Bond theme. He told BBC Radio 2 about his busy schedule, saying: “That’s not me. That’s definitely not me. “I’ve still got loads to do, I’ve got an Australia tour, but I kind of finish in December which is great, it gives me a chance to be in London, be in my home and go out with my friends.” Ed Sheeran, Ellie Goulding, Paloma Faith and Lana Del Rey have also been linked to the Spectre theme song, although Sheeran claimed he was “too wet” for the gig and Faith said she had chased it too avidly. Sheeran said Smith would be the perfect choice: “I think Sam Smith would be perfect suited up with his strong voice.” Daniel Craig will reprise his role as the secret service agent, alongside Naomie Harris, Ralph Fiennes and Rory Kinnear, and newcomers Andrew Scott, Christoph Waltz, Dave Bautista and Bond girls Monica Bellucci, Lea Seydoux and Stephanie Sigman. Sam Mendes will direct Spectre, the 24th official Bond film, which will open on 26 October.

Choose your answer from: [-] Clean the sponge in the microwave. Make sure the sponge is wet and microwave on high for one minute to kill bacteria. [-] Clean the sponge in the microwave. Make sure the sponge is dry and microwave on high for one hour to kill bacteria.","output":"The better solution to make a sponge last longer by killing the germs in it would be to: Clean the sponge in the microwave. Make sure the sponge is wet and microwave on high for one minute to kill bacteria. This is the better solution for various reasons, such as: 1. Effectiveness in killing germs and bacteria: Microwaving a wet sponge for one minute on high has been proven to kill around 99.9% of bacteria, according to a study published in Scientific Reports. The heat and steam generated from a wet sponge can effectively eliminate the majority of pathogenic microorganisms, ensuring a cleaner and longer-lasting sponge. 2. Safety: Microwaving a dry sponge for an extended period, such as one hour, could potentially lead to a fire hazard due to the excessive heat without any moisture to dissipate the energy. On the other hand, a wet sponge being microwaved for a minute would not pose such risks, ensuring a safer method of cleaning while achieving the desired outcome of killing germs. 3. Energy efficiency: Microwaving a wet sponge for one minute is a more energy-efficient method compared to microwaving a dry sponge for one hour. By using less energy and accomplishing the goal in a shorter time frame, this solution is not only more environmentally friendly but also more cost-effective in the long run. 4. Preservation of sponge material: Microwaving a wet sponge for a shorter duration prevents the sponge from drying out and becoming brittle. A dry sponge subjected to one hour of microwaving could experience degradation of its materials, reducing its effectiveness and overall lifespan. 5. Mold and odor prevention: A wet sponge left sitting on the kitchen counter is an excellent breeding ground for fungi and bacteria that cause mold and unpleasant odors. Cleaning the sponge regularly using the one-minute microwaving method helps to keep it fresh and prevent the growth of mold and bad odors. In conclusion, the best and most efficient solution to make a sponge last longer and kill germs is to clean the sponge in the microwave, ensuring that it is wet and microwaving on high for one minute. This method is not only effective in eliminating bacteria but also in ensuring safety, energy efficiency, preservation of sponge material, and mold and odor prevention."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Give me a possible correct answer to the question \\"what does michael vick do?\\" Answer:","output":"Michael Vick is a former professional American football player, who played as a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL).

Summarize the following: Before attempting to remove a broken lens, make sure to wash your hands well. Wash them for thirty seconds, and make sure to remove any dirt or oils under your fingernails. Dry them with a lint-free towel. Use a soap that is free from perfumes to reduce the risk of irritation. Get close to a mirror and use your thumb to hold your lower eyelid open and your index finger to hold your upper eyelid open. Try to locate the bits of contact lens in your eye with your other seeing eye. You might need a helper to direct you, especially if your eyesight prevents you from clearly seeing the lens fragments. Your helper should stick to giving direction and should not put their fingers in your eye or attempt to remove it themselves. Remove any large or easy to find pieces first as you would an intact lens. Move these pieces to the white of your eye. Carefully pinch them with the tips of your thumb and index finger (don't use your nails). Don’t throw any pieces away. Keep them in your contact lens case so they can help you determine if you’ve located and removed all fragments from your eye. Carefully move your eye up and down and side to side in order to locate smaller pieces. Try to hold your eyelids open as widely as possible in order to avoid scratching the surface of your eye. Small, jagged fragments might cause damage if they rub in between your eyelid or fingers and eye surface, so be very gentle in removing them. Check the label of your contact lens disinfectant to ensure that it’s safe to use for flushing your eye, or saline eye drops if you have them handy. Flush your eye with the solution, and try to let the liquid guide any remaining tiny pieces out of your eye. Continue to hold your eyelids wide open to let the solution and any leftover fragments drip out from your eye and socket. You may still feel like you have pieces stuck in your eye, since the fragments could have caused irritation. Use the pieces that you recovered and stored in your lens case to try to judge whether or not any pieces actually remain. If you’re unable to remove lens fragments using pinching or flushing techniques, you might have to visit your eye doctor. Making a quick visit to the doctor might seem like a hassle, but it’s certainly preferable to doing yourself harm by trying to get the broken lens out yourself. Your doctor will have more sensitive tools than you have at your disposal, and will more than likely be able to quickly and easily remove the pieces for you. See your doctor right away if your lens has scratched your eye. Summary:","output":"To remove a broken lens, first wash and dry your hands properly with perfume-free soap.

Select from: [a]. World; [b]. Sports; [c]. Business; [d]. Science/Tech;","output":"[d]. Science/Tech The issue raised in the article about Britain considering new anti-terrorism laws, including the establishment of special courts to try terror suspects without a jury, as stated by Home Secretary David Blunkett in an interview, falls under the broader category of Science/Tech. This is because the implementation and development of such laws involve significant use and application of advanced technology and scientific methods to counter and prevent acts of terrorism. In recent years, addressing the threat of global terrorism has become a pressing concern for nations around the world. Advanced technology and innovative scientific methods have come to play a vital role in identifying, tracking, and apprehending terror suspects and disrupting their networks. Some ways in which technology and science are being utilized in the fight against terrorism include: 1. Surveillance systems: Governments are increasingly relying on advanced surveillance systems, such as CCTV cameras, facial recognition software, and license plate readers, to monitor public spaces and identify potential terror suspects. 2. Data mining and analysis: Massive amounts of data can be collected, stored, and analyzed using cutting-edge technology to glean crucial intelligence on possible terror threats. Sophisticated algorithms, for instance, can analyze patterns in communication and financial transactions to identify suspicious activities or connections between individuals. 3. Biometric identification: Technologies like fingerprint, facial, and iris recognition can help to confirm the identities of terror suspects and ensure that known terrorists cannot evade detection through the use of false documents or aliases. 4. Cybersecurity: Terrorist organizations are increasingly using the internet and social media to radicalize, recruit, fundraise, and plan attacks. As a result, ensuring robust cybersecurity measures forms an essential component of an effective counter-terrorism strategy. 5. Drones and robotics: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), more commonly known as drones, can be used to gather intelligence on terror suspects, conduct targeted surveillance, and even carry out strikes against high-value targets. Additionally, robotics can be deployed in hazardous situations such as bomb disposal or the investigation of potential terrorist hideouts. In this context, the decision by the British government to consider implementing new anti-terrorism legislation, including special courts to try terror suspects without a jury, reflects the growing reliance on science and technology to counter terrorism threats effectively. The suggestion that this topic fits under the Science/Tech category captures the important role that innovations and advancements in technology and science play in shaping modern counter-terrorism initiatives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

All of their items get sold (except for the death ray which Megamind used to \\"kill\\" Metro Man in the original film). As for the De-Gun (Megamind's weapon of choice used for a number of different destructive functions) it gets sold to a boy named Damien, who accidentally uses it (in its dehydration mode) on his mother and turns her into a cube. Megamind tells Damien to soak the cube in water to get her back to normal, but unknown to Megamind, Damien decides not to do it and instead revels in his freedom from his mother. After the auction is over, Megamind reveals a suit he created that contains all of Metro Man's powers, which he will wear to protect Metro City. Minion finds a seemingly harmless button that had also not had been sold. Not knowing what the button does, Megamind pushes the button, and it reveals a giant robot called the Mega-Megamind, which Megamind put his evil self in. The robot thinks that Megamind is Metro Man, and starts attacking him. Megamind fights the robot with his new powers, but is defeated. He and Minion hide in the Invisible Car. Megamind decides that they should live in the car from then on, because he programmed the robot to not stop until the hero (and his assistant) is destroyed. Minion reveals that he still kept the Spiderbot, a robot that Megamind wanted to throw away, suggesting that Megamind should try to be a hero his way rather than try to do the job the way Metro Man did it.

Молибден является ксантиноксидазой / дигидрогеназой альдегидоксидазой и сульфитом окисдазы, таким образом он известен как незаменимый микроэлемент для человека, животных и растений. Translate this to English?","output":"Translation: Molybdenum is a xanthine oxidase / aldehyde dehydrogenase and a sulfite oxidase, making it a known essential trace element for humans, animals, and plants. Molybdenum is an important micronutrient required for the proper functioning of various enzymes in the human body, as well as in animals and plants. Among these, molybdenum is an essential component of xanthine oxidase (also known as xanthine dehydrogenase), crucial for the metabolism of purines, which are the building blocks of DNA and RNA. Another key enzymatic function of molybdenum is its role in aldehyde dehydrogenase, an enzyme that oxidizes aldehydes to their corresponding carboxylic acids. This process is particularly important in the detoxification of various endogenous and exogenous aldehydes, including ethanol-derived acetaldehyde, which is a highly toxic substance. By assisting in the detoxification process, molybdenum contributes to cellular protection and overall health. Moreover, molybdenum functions as a cofactor in sulfite oxidase, an enzyme responsible for the conversion of sulfites to sulfates. This reaction is critical for the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids, such as methionine and cysteine, which are essential components of proteins. Sulfur compounds are also vital for the synthesis of numerous molecules, including coenzyme A, glutathione, and biotin. Consequently, molybdenum plays a significant role in overall metabolic health and the synthesis of vital biomolecules. Deficiency of molybdenum is quite rare, given its low dietary requirements and widespread availability in various food sources, such as legumes, nuts, whole grains, and leafy vegetables. Nonetheless, deficiency may lead to problems like impaired sulfur metabolism, an increased risk of certain cancers, and neurological disorders. In conclusion, molybdenum serves as a vital trace element for humans, animals, and plants due to its essential roles in multiple enzymatic reactions. This micronutrient contributes significantly to various metabolic processes and the synthesis of essential biomolecules, highlighting its indispensability to life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Nina Simone (; born Eunice Kathleen Waymon; February 21, 1933 - April 21, 2003) was an American singer, songwriter, pianist, arranger, and activist in the Civil Rights Movement. Simone employed a broad range of musical styles including classical, jazz, blues, folk, R&B, gospel, and pop. Born in North Carolina, the sixth child of a preacher, Waymon aspired to be a concert pianist. In an interview for Jet magazine, Simone stated that her controversial song \\"Mississippi Goddam\\" hurt her career. She claimed that the music industry reprimanded her by boycotting her records. Hurt and disappointed, Simone left the US in September 1970, flying to Barbados and expecting Stroud to communicate with her when she had to perform again. However, Stroud interpreted Simone's sudden disappearance, and the fact that she had left behind her wedding ring, as an indication of a desire for a divorce. As her manager, Stroud was in charge of Simone's income.  Simone recorded her last album for RCA, It Is Finished, in 1974, and did not make another record until 1978, when she was persuaded to go into the recording studio by CTI Records owner Creed Taylor. The result was the album Baltimore, which, while not a commercial success, was fairly well received critically and marked a quiet artistic renaissance in Simone's recording output. Her choice of material retained its eclecticism, ranging from spiritual songs to Hall & Oates' \\"Rich Girl.\\" Four years later Simone recorded Fodder on My Wings on a French label.  During the 1980s, Simone performed regularly at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in London, where she recorded the album Live at Ronnie Scott's in 1984. Although her early on-stage style could be somewhat haughty and aloof, in later years, Simone particularly seemed to enjoy engaging her audiences sometimes by recounting humorous anecdotes related to her career and music and by soliciting requests. In 1987, the original 1958 recording of \\"My Baby Just Cares for Me\\" was used in a commercial for Chanel No. 5 perfume in Britain. This led to a re-release of the recording, which stormed to number 4 on the UK's NME singles chart, giving her a brief surge in popularity in the UK.  When Simone returned to the United States, she learned that a warrant had been issued for her arrest for unpaid taxes (as a protest against her country's involvement with the Vietnam War), and returned to Barbados to evade the authorities and prosecution. Simone stayed in Barbados for quite some time and she had a lengthy affair with the Prime Minister, Errol Barrow. A close friend, singer Miriam Makeba, then persuaded her to go to Liberia. Later, she lived in Switzerland and the Netherlands, before settling in France in 1993. During a 1998 performance in Newark, she announced, \\"If you're going to come see me again, you've got to come to France, because I ain't coming back.\\"  Simone published her autobiography, I Put a Spell on You, in 1992. She recorded her last album, A Single Woman, in 1993, where she depicted herself as the \\"single woman\\". She continued to tour through the 1990s but rarely traveled without an entourage. During the last decade of her life, Simone had sold more than one million records, making her a global catalog best-seller.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What happened later in 1993?","output":"Later in 1993, Nina Simone settled in France after having lived in Switzerland and the Netherlands.

Write an article with the title: \\"Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama both wrong\\" Article:","output":"Title: Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama both wrong Introduction:   In the world of politics, disagreements and differing opinions are inevitable. Even within a political party, members may not always see eye-to-eye on every issue. This statement holds true for prominent Democratic figures Hillary Clinton, former Secretary of State, and Barack Obama, the 44th President of the United States. In this article, we will explore instances where both Clinton and Obama have been wrong in their views or decisions, and evaluate the impact of their missteps. 1. Healthcare Reform In 2008, during the Democratic primaries, Clinton and Obama debated on healthcare reform. Clinton championed an individual mandate requiring every citizen to have health insurance, while Obama wanted to focus on reducing costs to make insurance more affordable. As President, Obama adopted the individual mandate in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) of which Clinton once argued. However, he failed to address the increasing premiums and high deductibles that emerged from the legislation, leaving many Americans still struggling to afford coverage. Both Clinton's and Obama's approaches to healthcare fell short of adequately addressing the issue, demonstrating that even well-intentioned policies can possess critical flaws. 2. Military Interventions While serving as Secretary of State during Obama's presidency, Clinton advocated for military interventions in Libya, leading to the overthrow of dictator Muammar Gaddafi. The intervention and the subsequent vacuum of power led to instability and havoc in the region, contributing to the rise of extremist groups such as ISIS. Similarly, Obama's decision to withdraw troops from Iraq between 2010 and 2011 led to the resurgence of violence and further empowered extremist groups. Both Clinton and Obama misjudged the consequences of their respective decisions, showing that even experienced politicians may not always choose the best course of action. 3. Financial Crisis of 2008 In response to the 2008 financial crisis, Obama implemented the controversial Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), and Clinton voiced her support for it. The program ultimately bailed out large financial institutions with taxpayer money, igniting significant criticism as it was perceived by many to prioritize corporate interests over citizens in need. While the initial intent may have been to stabilize the economy, TARP left a residue of distrust between the public and the government. Consequently, Obama and Clinton's support for the program can be seen as a misstep in adequately addressing the financial crisis. Conclusion: Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, despite being key figures in the Democratic Party, have not always made the right decisions. In areas such as healthcare, military interventions, and financial management, both politicians have demonstrated shortcomings. It is important to remember that no political figure is infallible and that constructive criticism is vital in a democratic society. By recognizing and examining past mistakes, we can move forward with a more informed perspective and make better decisions for the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

With a slender waist and curves in all the right places, Marilyn Monroe’s physique has long been coveted by women – and admired by men. But it seems the classic hourglass figure that the star epitomised could be on borrowed time. The waist size of the average British woman has increased by more than seven inches since the 1950s, research has found, giving her more in common with a rectangle than an hourglass. Marilyn Monroe's physique has long been coveted by women - and admired by men. But it seems the classic hourglass figure that the star epitomised could be on borrowed time. Christina Hendricks is famed for her curvy hourglass physique, but British women are getting further and further away from this ideal, with waist sizes increasing by 7in since the 1950s. The hourglass figures of Man Men characters January Jones, left, Elisabeth Moss, centre, and Christina Hendricks, right, are now largely a thing of the past in the UK, with waist sizes ever increasing. For a perfect hourglass figure, a. woman’s hip and bust must be of equal size, with a narrow tapered waist. But a study has found that this shape is becoming increasingly rare. In 1951, the average woman’s waist was 27 inches, with her bust and hips around ten inches larger. But researchers who surveyed 5,500. women found the average waist now measures 34 inches. Hip and bust. dimensions, meanwhile, have grown by only an inch, leaving them just. four inches larger than the waist. As a result, almost half of British. women are now classed as a ‘rectangle’ – with little difference between. bust, waist and hip measurements. The data compiled for women's sizes. showed that while the average waist size has increased by more than 25. percent, women's hips and busts haven't seen increases on the same scale. This. has led to a change in women's figures from svelte hourglass to a. more rotund, stout shape. -  and 38 per cent of women in Britain being classed as overweight. Women. in the UK now weigh 7.5 lbs more than they did in 1951 - and even though. they are 1.5in taller this still shows a general trend to higher. BMI and greater levels of obesity nowadays. Audrey Hepburn had a figure typical of the 1950s, while Kelly Brook has a body typical of 2013. The changing shape of British women: As well as larger wasitlines they have grown by 1.5in and are an average of 7.5lb heavier than women in 1951. Since Mad Men season six - a series. based on the 1960s world of advertising - premiered on 7 April, one. Harley Street clinic has reported a 40 per cent increased interest in. body-sculpting waistline-reduction treatments from women wishing to. emulate Hendricks' shape. Donnamarie McBride, beauty director at LoveLite, said:. 'Our most popular treatment with our Lipoglaze system is the \\"Mad Men. waistline\\" and since the show came back on to TV we've been inundated. with bookings. 'The reason why it's in such demand is because the waistline is one of the hardest areas to shift weight. 'Even with regular work-outs and a good diet this is often the last area that a women will lose fatty tissue.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"The article discusses the changing body shapes of British women since the 1950s, highlighting the increase in waist sizes and the move away from the classic hourglass figure exemplified by Marilyn Monroe. Researchers found that the waist size of the average British woman has increased by more than seven inches since the 1950s, while hip and bust dimensions have only grown by an inch. Consequently, the hourglass figure has become less prevalent in British women, with 50% now classified as having a \\"rectangle\\" shape, where there is little difference between bust, waist, and hip measurements. The increase in waist size has also contributed to a rise in women being classified as overweight in the UK, with women in the country now weighing 7.5 lbs more than they did in 1951. This general trend towards higher BMI and higher levels of obesity is viewed with concern. The return of the popular TV show Mad Men, set in the 1960s, has sparked renewed interest in the hourglass figure, with a Harley Street clinic reporting a 40% increase in interest for body-sculpting waistline reduction treatments.

We have the equation: 0 = -52 * p - 164 - 44 First, let's add 164 and 44 to both sides of the equation. 0 + 164 + 44 = -52 * p - 164 + 164 - 44 + 44 Now we have: 208 = -52 * p Next, we need to find the value of 'p'. To do that, we should divide both sides of the equation by -52. 208 / -52 = (-52 * p) / -52 After dividing, we get: -4 = p So, the solution for the equation is p = -4. That means if you replace 'p' with -4 in the original equation, it will be true. Just like solving our fun little puzzle!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Read this: American Idol was based on the British show Pop Idol created by Simon Fuller, which was in turn inspired by the New Zealand television singing competition Popstars. Television producer Nigel Lythgoe saw it in Australia and helped bring it over to Britain. Fuller was inspired by the idea from Popstars of employing a panel of judges to select singers in audition. He then added other elements, such as telephone voting by the viewing public (which at the time was already in use in shows such as the Eurovision Song Contest), the drama of backstories and real-life soap opera unfolding in real time. The show debuted in 2001 in Britain with Lythgoe as showrunner‍—‌the executive producer and production leader‍—‌and Simon Cowell as one of the judges, and was a big success with the viewing public.

SEOUL — The recent U.S. missile strikes against Syria could increase pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, or reinforce in Pyongyang the need for nuclear deterrence. The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

At that time, a Parisian ballet audience typically consisted of two diverse groups: the wealthy and fashionable set, who would be expecting to see a traditional performance with beautiful music, and a \\"Bohemian\\" group who, the poet-philosopher Jean Cocteau asserted, would \\"acclaim, right or wrong, anything that is new because of their hatred of the boxes\\". Monteux believed that the trouble began when the two factions   began attacking each other, but their mutual anger was soon diverted towards the orchestra: \\"Everything available was tossed in our direction, but we continued to play on\\". Around forty of the worst offenders were ejected—possibly with the intervention of the police, although this is uncorroborated. Through all the disturbances the performance continued without interruption. The unrest receded significantly during Part II, and by some accounts Maria Piltz's rendering of the final \\"Sacrificial Dance\\" was watched in reasonable silence. At the end there were several curtain calls for the dancers, for Monteux and the orchestra, and for Stravinsky and Nijinsky before the evening's programme continued.Among the more hostile press reviews was that of Le Figaro's critic, Henri Quittard, who called the work \\"a laborious and puerile barbarity\\" and added \\"We are sorry to see an artist such as M. Stravinsky involve himself in this disconcerting adventure\\". On the other hand, Gustav Linor, writing in the leading theatrical magazine Comoedia, thought the performance was superb, especially that of Maria Piltz; the disturbances, while deplorable, were merely \\"a rowdy debate\\" between two ill-mannered factions. Emile Raudin, of Les Marges, who had barely heard the music, wrote: \\"Couldn't we ask M. Astruc ... to set aside one performance for well-intentioned spectators? ...

Information:  - Charles Thomas Kowal (November 8, 1940  November 28, 2011) was an American astronomer known for his observations and discoveries in the Solar System. As a staff astronomer at Caltech's Mount Wilson and Palomar Mountain observatories between 1961 and 1984, he found the first of a new class of Solar System objects, the centaurs, discovered two moons of the planet Jupiter, and discovered or co-discovered a number of asteroids, comets and supernovae. He was awarded the James Craig Watson Medal for his contributions to astronomy in 1979.  - Asteroids are minor planets, especially those of the inner Solar System. The larger ones have also been called planetoids. These terms have historically been applied to any astronomical object orbiting the Sun that did not show the disc of a planet and was not observed to have the characteristics of an active comet. As minor planets in the outer Solar System were discovered and found to have volatile-based surfaces that resemble those of comets, they were often distinguished from asteroids of the asteroid belt. In this article, the term \\"asteroid\\" refers to the minor planets of the inner Solar System including those co-orbital with Jupiter.  - The Apollo asteroids are a group of near-Earth asteroids named after 1862 Apollo, discovered by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth in the 1930s.

Choose the suitable option:     In this case, we have two options - (1) Use some sandpaper over the painted wood to induce a scuffed up and rustic look, and (2) Use some sandpaper before painting the wood to induce a scuffed up and rustic look. Option (1) is the better choice, as sanding the painted wood will create a more authentic rustic appearance by exposing some of the wood grain and allowing the paint to wear in a natural-looking way. 2. Gather materials:     To get started, gather the necessary materials including sandpaper (medium and fine grit), paint, paintbrush, and a soft cloth. 3. Prep the wooden furniture:     Ensure the furniture is clean and free of dirt or dust. If it is painted, make sure the paint is dry before beginning. 4. Apply option (1) - Sand the painted wood:    Using medium-grit sandpaper, gently scuff up the surface of the painted wood in a random pattern, focusing on areas that would naturally show wear and tear over time such as corners, edges, and raised details. The goal is to create an uneven and distressed look, allowing the wood to show through in some areas. 5. Smooth the surface:     After distressing the painted wood with medium-grit sandpaper, use fine-grit sandpaper to smooth out any rough patches and blend the distressed areas with the surrounding paint. 6. Clean the surface:     Wipe the furniture with a soft cloth to remove any dust and debris from sanding. 7. Apply a topcoat if desired (optional):     If you want to protect the distressed finish and add additional depth, consider applying a clear topcoat, such as a wax or polyurethane finish. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for application and drying time. By following these steps and selecting option (1), you will successfully add a rustic look to your wooden furniture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She lives in a Brooklyn brownstone with her 10-year-old son Alex (Danny Corkill). One March morning, Susan sees Alex off to school, which is only two blocks away. Alex turns to wave to his mother, then disappears around the corner. Susan returns home after work, and becomes increasingly alarmed when Alex is late. She calls her friend and neighbor Jocelyn Norris, whose daughter is a classmate of Alex's, and learns Alex never went to school. She immediately calls the New York City Police Department, and officers descend on the townhouse, led by Lieutenant Al Menetti. Susan is questioned closely on all aspects of her life and her son's, and initially suspect her estranged husband, Graham, a professor at New York University, but he produces an alibi. Susan's case generates attention from the local media, and citizens help in the search by distributing posters. Susan is initially criticized for allowing her son to walk to school by himself. Susan takes a polygraph test that clears her as a suspect. Numerous leads are checked out, including several reports that Alex may have been seen in the back seat of a blue 1965 Chevy. A psychic is also called in, but each lead fizzles. The investigation drags on, and Graham is at odds with Menetti after budget cuts force Menetti to dismantle the command center in Susan's apartment and run the case from the precinct. Menetti's attention is soon diverted to other cases, but the Selky case is always a priority. At one point, Graham takes matters into his own hands after he receives a ransom call. Given a beating, he requires a hospital stay. A break in the case finally happens on the Fourth of July, when Susan's housecleaner, Philippe, is arrested as a suspect. A pair of Alex's bloody underpants was found in his apartment, where the gay Philippe was picked up with a 14-year-old male prostitute.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which person studied less about volcanoes in an island arc? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Pete is the person who studied less about volcanoes in an island arc. Pete focused his research on earthquakes, while Gill directed her studies towards mantles and volcanoes.  Island arc volcanoes are formed due to the subduction of one tectonic plate beneath another, which leads to the formation of a chain of volcanic islands. This geological phenomenon is closely related to the study of the Earth's mantle, as well as the processes that drive volcanic activity. Gill's area of expertise in mantles and volcanoes makes her more knowledgeable about the complexities and mechanisms behind island arc volcanoes. On the other hand, Pete's specialization in earthquakes provides him with a solid understanding of the seismic activity associated with tectonic plate movements and interactions. Earthquakes are indeed a crucial aspect of the Earth's geological processes, and their study may offer valuable insights into the forces that shape our planet. However, it does not specifically focus on the details of volcanic activity, particularly in the context of island arc systems. In conclusion, Pete's research on earthquakes, while essential for understanding broader geological processes, does not delve as deeply into the study of island arc volcanoes as Gill's work on mantles and volcanoes.

Domestic violence survivors in Jackson, Vicksburg, Hattiesburg, Oxford and Pascagoula can all get help. Julia Crockett, deputy director of Central Southwest Mississippi Legal Services Corp., said the program expects to help nearly 1,000 domestic violence victims. Crockett said legal help gives domestic abuse survivors a way to rebuild their lives. \\"They have been made to feel by the abuser that no one is going to help them do anything, so when they come to us they are desperate,\\" she said. \\"Those who need legal help and don't get it feel totally lost. Because then they feel like they are forced to stay in that situation.\\" Crockett said the program, funded by a 300,000 grant from the U.S. Justice Department, has no economic restrictions on who can get help. Legal services typically helps the poor. Gladys Bunzy, who said she was in an abusive relationship with a boyfriend for eight years, said such a program is long overdue and could be a lifeline for those escaping violent relationships. \\"When I finally made up my mind to leave, I had a restraining order put against him and that was 50 but that was 50 well spent to me,\\" said Bunzy, 40. \\"For people who can't afford it, this will be a godsend ...

Combine the constant terms on the right side: -104483 = 20933*k + (157892 + 51620) 2. Add the constants: 157892 + 51620 = 209512 So, the equation becomes: -104483 = 20933*k + 209512 3. Now, isolate k by getting rid of the constant on the right side. To do this, subtract 209512 from both sides: -104483 - 209512 = 20933*k + 209512 - 209512 4. Perform the subtraction: -313995 = 20933*k 5. Now, to find the value of k, divide both sides by 20933: -313995 / 20933 = 20933*k / 20933 6. Perform the division: k = -313995 / 20933 7.

Context: Hubertus \\"Huib\\" Wilton (12 March 1921 in Rotterdam – 29 October 1959) was a Dutch tennis player. He was on the 1953 Netherlands Davis Cup team which also included among others Hans van Swol (his partner in the men's doubles), Boebi van Meegeren and Ivo Rinkel. In 1950 Wilton reached the second round at Wimbledon, losing to Henry Billington of Great Britain 6–1 7–5 11–9. Hypothesis: Hubertus \\"Huib\\" Wilton is an athlete.","output":"Yes, we can draw the following hypothesis from the given context: Hypothesis: Hubertus \\"Huib\\" Wilton is an athlete. The detailed explanation behind this hypothesis can be based on the following evidence mentioned in the context: 1. Huib Wilton is a Dutch tennis player: This statement directly indicates that Wilton is, indeed, an athlete, as tennis is a competitive sport that requires physical activity and skill. 2. He was on the 1953 Netherlands Davis Cup team: The Davis Cup is a prestigious international tennis competition, where teams represent their respective countries. Being a part of this team not only further establishes Wilton as an athlete but also suggests that he was a high-performance one, as his talent must have been significant enough to be chosen for the Dutch national team. 3. He had partners in tennis events like Hans van Swol in men's doubles: Participating in a doubles tennis event requires collaboration and coordination with a partner. This adds another dimension to Wilton's athletic abilities, highlighting his teamwork and gelling capabilities within a tennis context. 4. In 1950, Wilton reached the second round at Wimbledon: Wimbledon is one of the four Grand Slam tournaments in tennis, demonstrating once again that Wilton was a competitive and skilled athlete as he managed to compete and progress in such a widely renowned event. 5. Losing to Henry Billington 6–1 7–5 11–9: The mention of Wilton's highly competitive match at Wimbledon, where he battled it out against Billington in multiple sets, gives us an insight into the athlete's endurance and their ability to strategize in this physically demanding sport.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? You can't go into a presentation sweating bullets or stuttering because you're so nervous that you can barely see straight. Instead, take a breather at least a few hours before a presentation, whether it means drinking a cup of camomile tea, meditating, or going for a walk. If you want to relax, then you have to prepare well in advance -- you won't be able to relax if you're perfecting and practicing your speech minutes before you have to present. Remember that the more relaxed you are, the easier it will be for your audience to connect to you, and the more fun you'll have.  Drink a tall glass of water to lubricate your vocal chords before you go on stage. Keep a glass or bottle of water with you on stage if it helps you relax and to pause occasionally.     {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f2/681016-07b01.jpg/v4-460px-681016-07b01.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/f/f2/681016-07b01.jpg/aid681016-v4-728px-681016-07b01.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\\">Creative Commons</a><br>n</p><p><br />n</p></div>\\"}  Arrive early to feel comfortable in the space where you'll be presenting. If you're presenting in an auditorium or another large building, then walk around the place or even sit in the audience to get a feel for it. If you want to help yourself relax, then remember that your aim is connection, not perfection. You want to connect with your audience instead of giving a bullet-proof presentation, and it's much easier to connect if you feel like you're being yourself. Kill 'em with confidence before you even say your first word. If you look like you're confident about who you are and believe in what you're saying, then the audience will be much more likely to have faith in you. So, look sharp, have a big smile on your face, and make eye contact with your audience to show them that you're unafraid and know your stuff. Even if you're not feeling very confident, giving off confident vibes will help you feel at ease, and will make people more likely to believe in you.  Don't slouch. Keep your head high and your spine straight. Don't fidget or play with your hands. You can use your hands occasionally to gesture for emphasis, but don't do it too much or you'll look even more nervous. Be able to laugh at yourself. If you've made a little mistake, laugh it off and the crowd will laugh along with you instead of feeling awkward. Use forceful words and speak as if everything you say is a fact. Don't say, \\"I think that San Francisco may be a better city than LA\\" if the goal of your presentation is to prove that San Francisco is vastly superior to its southern cousin city; say, \\"San Francisco is a better city than LA, hands down,\\" and your audience will be more likely to agree with you. You have to wow your audience from the get-go. If you have them hooked from the first word, then they'll be more likely to follow along the rest of the way. Start with a shocking or relevant fact, a funny and engaging anecdote, or with an inspiring quote. Whatever you start with, make sure that it's conducive to your presentation and isn't just there for the entertainment value. Whatever you do, do not apologize for having to give the presentation, even if it's a required presentation for work or school. Nothing will make your audience zone out faster than if you say, \\"Sorry to bore you guys with all this technical mumbo-jumbo, but I've gotta do it…\\" Being articulate is the key to improving your presentation skills. You can plan the most fascinating presentation of all time but your audience won't get a thing out of it if you're speaking too quietly or too fast or are rambling on so much that they don't get your main point. Focus on speaking clearly and slowly, and loudly enough for everyone to hear you. Let your expression match your words and people will be more likely to understand your words and to connect with you.  Pause between sentences for emphasis, and work on eliminating as many \\"ums\\" and \\"uhs\\" as possible without freaking out if you use a few of them -- after all, even President Obama has been known to use a healthy dose of \\"ums\\" when getting his point across. Keep it concise. Work on trimming down any extra words and focus on what's important. You don't need a million adjectives to get your point across -- just one perfectly-chosen adjective will do. Read as much as you can to improve your knowledge base and vocabulary. This, in turn, will make you sound more intelligent and articulate. If you want to fully articulate your points, then you'll need to use stories, anecdotes, statistics, and facts to support your ideas. If you tell your audience that a healthy diet is the key to a happy life but have no evidence to back it up, why should they believe you? Even if you're charming and funny, if there's no substance to your speech, your audience will be able to tell. Stories are a great way to create a human connection and to illustrate a point effectively without slowing down your momentum.  You don't need a million facts and statistics, either; one or two carefully-chosen facts or statistics can really blow your audience away. A story or a statistic can be an effective, engaging way to open a presentation. You can also return to it at the end to wrap things up. \\" Though you should avoid the second person when you're writing a formal essay, the word you is crucial to connecting to your audience during a presentation. You want to make each and every person feel that you're talking to them so that the person feels that your presentation can actually benefit them. You should say, \\"You can learn to manage conflict effectively in under an hour with five simple points,\\" instead of \\"Any person can learn to manage conflict…\\" Though you're essentially saying the same thing, using you whenever it's appropriate will get your audience more involved in your presentation. Connect through your emotion. Nobody likes a boring speaker so infuse some energy into your gestures, inflect your voice as you would when talking to someone one-on-one, attempt self-deprecating humor and don't be afraid to show your failures as an example to learn from. Though every word in your presentation should count, undoubtedly there will be at least two or three points that you want your audience to walk away with. It's okay to remind your audience of these points by repeating them for emphasis; you can even do so without getting boring or repetitive. If you use a story or anecdote to illustrate a point, remind your audience of what the point is, and return to it later in your presentation, if not at the end. Let your audience see that some of the points you've made are more important than others.  Another way to emphasize your important points is to slow down when you want your audience to really home in on your words. Use your hands to gesture for emphasis if it's necessary. Having a question and answer period can help your audience really understand your material, connect with you and your presentation, and feel like they have gotten the full story on the subject you presented about. If you feel that your presentation calls for a question and answer period and that you can effectively make time for one without derailing your presentation, then you should plan for having a question and answer period after you've given the body of your presentation -- but before the closing.  You should give a time limit for questions, say, 5-10 minutes. Tell your audience that you're going to make this much time for questions so that you don't get off track by answering so many questions that your audience has forgotten the gist or your presentation. Make sure you have a conclusion after the question period. You don't want to give a stellar presentation and then have it peter off into a series of irrelevant questions. End your presentation on a solid note. Don't let your presentation taper off or wrap things up when you or the audience looks bored. Give a firm conclusion that continues to engage your audience while reminding them about the most important points of the presentation. It's okay to \\"tell 'em what you told them,\\" as a reminder about the central message of the presentation. Stay confident up until the very end, keep your head high, and even thank your audience for their participation if it's necessary. Avoid looking bored with your own presentation or eager to get off stage. Don't say something like, \\"Well, that about covers it,\\" or \\"That's all I've got\\" -- be confident that you've given a great presentation and be excited about wrapping it up with a nice little bow.","output":"To give a good presentation, relax, be confident, speak clearly, use stories and facts, and engage with your audience by using \\"you\\" and answering their questions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Trailing varieties of Lantana are pretty robust and will tolerate drought but do need plenty of light. They will tolerate a small amount of shade for some of the day but you’ll see them grow leggy (with long stems rather than compact bushy growth) and produce fewer blooms if they aren’t getting enough sun and water. You can encourage bushy growth to make good ground cover by pinching the plant back. To do this, remove the stem tips just above where each stem branches into two stems. This will encourage more side branches to form. Although Trailing Lantana tolerates drought, it will bloom better if it doesn’t get too dry. Water once or twice a week during dry periods. Removing spent flowers will encourage new ones to form so don’t be shy about trimming the bush during the growing season. You should try to trim just above a leaf set. Every few years the Trailing Lantana may get a little too woody and overgrown. A vigorous prune to within a foot of the base will usually rejuvenate the plant.

Write an article based on this \\"Include a piece of dark chocolate. Add a small package of ibuprofen or naproxen if you're allowed. Put a travel-sized container of hand sanitizer in the bag. Consider including a pocket calendar if you want to track your period.\\" Article:","output":"Title: \\"Essentials for a Healthy and Prepared Menstruation Care Kit\\" Introduction Dealing with menstruation can be a challenge for many women worldwide, as it comes with a variety of physical and emotional stages, ranging from abdominal pain and bloating to mood swings and anxiety. While the experience of menstruation varies for each individual, one factor that can make managing these monthly occurrences easier is having a thoughtfully created menstruation care kit. A well-prepared kit helps deal with irregularity, discomfort, and promotes a healthier outlook throughout the menstrual period. In this article, we will discuss some essentials to include in your menstruation care kit, aiming to alleviate discomfort, keep you hygienic, and help track your periods more efficiently. 1. Dark Chocolate Including a piece of dark chocolate in your care kit can be a delicious and satisfying way to combat period cravings while providing health benefits. Dark chocolate with a high cocoa content (above 70%) is rich in magnesium, which can help alleviate muscle cramps and reduce mood swings associated with the menstrual cycle. It also contains flavonoids that are known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which can help improve mood and overall well-being. 2. Over-the-counter (OTC) Pain Relievers Aside from satisfying a sweet craving, it's also essential to address physical discomfort during menstruation. A small package of ibuprofen or naproxen can be a helpful addition to your care kit, as these over-the-counter medications can relieve cramps and reduce inflammation. However, consult with a healthcare professional before adding such medication to your care kit if you have existing health conditions or are taking prescription drugs, as some may interfere with other medications or cause complications. 3. Hand Sanitizer Maintaining proper hygiene is crucial during menstruation, as it can help prevent infections and discomfort. Including a travel-sized container of hand sanitizer in your care kit ensures that you will always have a means of cleaning your hands on the go, especially when you need to change sanitary products and don't have immediate access to soap and water. Opt for hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol, as they effectively kill harmful bacteria and viruses on your hands. 4. Pocket Calendar Keeping track of your menstruation helps monitor any irregularities and predict when your upcoming period may arrive. This information is beneficial to both personal and medical reasons: understanding personal patterns can help you prepare better or identify whether any triggering factors contribute to irregularities. A pocket calendar is a convenient way to track your periods, as it provides both visual and tactile input. By marking the days you are menstruating and consistently maintaining a record, you can better understand your body and identify any potential irregularities.  Conclusion Creating a customized menstruation care kit not only helps maintain daily activities and routines during menstruation but also promotes a sense of self-awareness and understanding of one's body. By including a piece of dark chocolate, a small package of ibuprofen or naproxen, hand sanitizer, and a pocket calendar, we can address the cravings, pain, and cleanliness associated with periods. Through this proactive preparation, we can feel empowered and gain essential tools for managing menstruation and promoting overall wellness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Who is the brigade's commander? Title: Gallipoli Movie plot: In Western Australia, May 1915, Archie Hamilton (Mark Lee), an 18-year-old stockman and prize-winning sprinter, longs to enlist in the Australian Imperial Force. He is trained by his uncle Jack (Bill Kerr) and idolises Harry Lascelles, the world champion over 100 yards. Archie wins a race with a bullying farmhand, Les McCann (Harold Hopkins), Archie running bare-foot and Les riding his horse bareback. Frank Dunne (Mel Gibson) is an unemployed ex-railway labourer who has run out of money. He's an accomplished sprinter and hopes to win the prize money at the athletics carnival, he also bets a lot of money on himself winning. Archie and Uncle Jack journey to the athletics carnival. Frank is surprised when Archie defeats him and is bitter at first and he feels robbed of his bet. Eventually Frank approaches Archie in a cafe after getting over his loss and they both decide to travel to Perth to enlist. Before leaving, Archie gives all the prize money he won at the race to Jack and tells him that he will not be coming home for he had decided to enlist. As Archie and Frank are penniless, they secretly hop on a freight train, then walk across the desert and stop for the night at a cattle station. Upon arriving in Perth, they arrange to stay with Frank's father, an Irish immigrant. Due to Frank's Irish heritage and general cynicism, he has little desire to fight for the British Empire. However, Archie persuades him to try to enlist in the Light Horse. Failing to ride a horse, Frank enlists in the infantry with three co-workers from the railway: Bill (Robert Grubb), Barney (Tim McKenzie), and Snowy (David Argue). Many of the motivations for enlistment are revealed: wartime ultra-nationalism, anti-German propaganda, a sense of adventure and the attraction of the uniform. All soldiers embark on a transport ship bound for Cairo. Frank and Archie are separated and embark on different troopships.

Which sister had the same disease as the royal families of Europe did?  Two twin sisters were taken to the doctor's office by their parents. It turned out that Mary had hemophilia while Ann didn't have any blood disease.  Hint: Hemophilia is the name of a group of hereditary diseases that affect the body's ability to control blood clotting. Hemophilia is caused by a lack of clotting factors in the blood. Clotting factors are normally released by platelets. Since people with hemophilia cannot produce clots, any cut can put a person at risk of bleeding to death. The risk of internal bleeding is also increased in hemophilia, especially into muscles and joints. This disease affected the royal families of Europe.

Pick from: - scratch them off until they're all gone.. - don't scratch them until they heal on their own..","output":"The goal of getting rid of chickenpox can be achieved through several methods focused on alleviating the symptoms, as there is no cure for the viral infection itself. Among the two choices provided, the option that makes much more sense to accomplish this goal is \\"don't scratch them until they heal on their own.\\" Scratching chickenpox blisters can lead to scarring, bacterial infection, and may prolong the healing process. Chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, and while not everyone's experience with the virus is the same, generally, symptoms like fever, headache, and an itchy rash are shared by most sufferers. The rash often develops into fluid-filled blisters that can become very itchy. However, scratching them is not recommended and should be avoided for the reasons mentioned above. Instead, multiple approaches should be taken to ensure safe and effective recovery from chickenpox: 1. Rest and hydration: Getting enough rest and staying hydrated is crucial in the recovery process, as it allows the body to focus on fighting off the virus. 2. Antiviral medication: In some cases, your doctor may prescribe antiviral medications, such as acyclovir, within the first 24 hours of developing symptoms. This can help to reduce the severity and duration of the illness, especially in high-risk patients. 3. Anti-itch remedies: To reduce the urge to scratch, apply calamine lotion, which can help soothe the itchiness. Taking cool baths with colloidal oatmeal or baking soda may also help relieve itchiness. Over-the-counter antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine, can help relieve itching as well. 4. Fever and pain management: Paracetamol (acetaminophen) or ibuprofen may be used to reduce fever, headaches, or body aches. However, avoid using aspirin in children due to the risk of Reye's syndrome. 5. Nail care: Keep nails short and clean to minimize the risk of skin infections if scratching inadvertently occurs. 6. Dress comfortably: Wear lightweight, loose-fitting, and breathable clothes to avoid further irritation of the skin. 7. Bacterial infection prevention: If any of the blisters become infected, you may need antibiotic ointments or oral antibiotics to treat the infection. Consult your doctor if you notice any signs of bacterial infection, such as increased redness or pus. Keep in mind that while you're contagious, it's important to stay away from people who may be more vulnerable to the virus, such as newborns, pregnant women, and those with weakened immune systems. Ultimately, allowing the chickenpox to heal on its own, in combination with the methods listed above, will provide the safest and most effective route to recovery."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Choose the correct sentiment from candidates: Select from: (I) negative; (II) positive; TEXT:When I began watching The Muppets Take Manhattan, the choppy presentation and dialogue had me convinced I was watching something recent, so you can imagine my surprise when I came to the IMDb and read that it was made in 1984. Jim Henson may have ended The Muppet Show when it was at its peak, but spin offs like this and Muppet Babies (which apparently is based upon a very terrible sequence in this film) are the absolute nadir of all things Muppet. I used to wonder why Muppets attracted such derision from such film reviewers as Mr. Cranky, so I am glad that The Muppets Take Manhattan (henceforth: TMTM) set me straight on that one. Of course, many series have had a massive drop off in quality when the third episode came around: Aliens, RoboCop, The Evil Dead, even Night Of The Living Dead. So while it is no surprise that TMTM is less than The Muppet Movie or The Great Muppet Caper, the surprise lies entirely in how much less than the awesome debut or its slightly lesser follow-up TMTM is. Not only is the music far less satisfying, the scenes that link it all together are utterly terrible. There are, of course, some redeeming and genuinely funny moments, but they are few and far between. The Swedish Chef is great in any scene he inhabits, so thank the spirit of small mercies that he appears in one sequence where his eccentricity is exploited to the fullest. The problem is that there are just no scenes that work. The story, such as it is, revolves around a Broadway musical Kermit is attempting to get produced. He goes through many trials and tribulations along the way, including the sneaking suspicion the viewer has that we have seen this all before. The biggest problem is that Kermit does not have a decent antagonist to work off this time. Charles Durning was cinematic gold as Doc Hopper, the proprietor of a fast food chain who wants to exploit Kermit for his business. Charles Grodin was dynamite as Nicky Holiday, a jewel thief the Muppets must fight in order to save Miss Piggy from a lifetime in prison. The saying is that a hero is only as good as his antagonist, and these two are at least half responsible for the greatness of the previous two films. Charles Grodin also highlights what is wrong with TMTM. Namely, the music sucks. The opening number of the Manhattan Melodies show that is at the centre of TMTM, to put it nicely, makes the drivel that now dominates the airwaves seem coordinated. I might just be letting my peculiar sensitivity to the sounds of words and phrases getting to me, but songs like The Rainbow Connection inspired tears of joy, not irritation. Grodin's big solo during The Great Muppet Caper, while not having the same resonation, he lifts the tone of the film eight steps on his own. He is all class. And if there is one thing TMTM could use, it is rising eight steps in addition to attaining a semblance of class. TMTM also feels severely time-compressed, with the story leaping from scene to scene without any consideration for making sense or giving the story cohesion. Maddox himself pointed out that transition and cohesion make a film feel like a coherent whole rather than a mess of thrown-together pieces. See if you can find them in TMTM. While TMTM does have its guest stars, they are either poorly utilised (Brooke Shields and John Landis), or totally out of their element (Liza Minelli, Dabney Coleman). To call this a waste of time for puppeteer and actor alike is flattery. The absence of an end credits routine is especially sore here, after Animal's \\"go home\\" postscript for The Muppet Movie in particular. Which highlights another problem. The characters are poorly written at best, with none of their individual quirks to be seen or heard. Animal shouts singular words at times, but they have nothing to do with the plot, or the conversation going on around him. Say what you will about set pieces designed to show off characters, but think of Animal's moment after eating the instant growth pills, or his \\"sowwy\\" after the incident when he pulled the window down on top of his fellow Muppets. Now see if you can remember a single memorable moment with an individual Muppet other than Swedish Chef's hilarious misunderstanding of three-dimensional film involving popcorn. Give up? Then you have proved my point. Given that Labyrinth, one of the Henson company's best and most timeless products outside of the Muppets, arrived some two years later, it makes TMTM all the more puzzling. Perhaps this misfire convinced Jim Henson to rethink his strategy regarding character development and usage. Or perhaps the misfire can be attributed to Frank Oz, who at the time had just finished working with George Lucas on what many would agree is the most childish episode in the original Star Wars saga. The writers were also involved with The Great Muppet Caper, so I will let them off the hook for this in spite of the fact that a script is one of the most essential pieces of a film. The production is also substantially improved here, with Muppets appearing capable of moving in ways that were previously beyond them. Had the story and script been better thought-out, TMTM might have been at least comparable to The Great Muppet Caper. As it stands now, it is a great answer to the question of whether Muppets write under the influence, or excrete. For that reason, I gave The Muppets Take Manhattan a three out of ten. Two to denote its actual quality, and a bonus for the Swedish Chef's moments. Without him, this film would be unwatchable.","output":"The correct sentiment for this text is: (I) negative.

What food might it contain? He was astonished to discover that it was a mouse trap! Running to the farmyard, the mouse shouted, warning, \\"There is a mouse trap in the house; there is a mouse trap in the house.\\" The chicken with her head high, said, \\"Shut up, Little Ugly. This is a great concern to you, but it has nothing to do with me; I cannot be bothered by it.\\" The mouse turned to the pig and told him, \\"There is a mouse trap in the house.\\" \\"I am so very sorry, Mr. Mouse,\\" said the pig, \\"but there is nothing I can do about it but pray; you are always  in my prayers.\\" The mouse turned to the cow, who said, \\"A mouse trap; am I in great danger, huh?\\" So the mouse had to face the farmer's mouse trap alone. That very night a sound was heard through the house, like the sound of a mouse trap catching its prey. The farmer's wife rushed to see what was caught. In the darkness, she did not see that it was a poisonous snake whose tail the trap had caught. The snake bit the farmer's wife. The farmer rushed her to the hospital. She returned home with a fever. It is said that drinking fresh chicken soup will help treat fever, so the farmer took his sharp knife to the farmyard for the soup's main ingredient. His wife's sickness continued so that friends and neighbors came to sit with her around the clock. To feed them, the farmer killed the pig.   The farmer's wife did not get well, in fact, she died, and so many people came for her funeral. The farmer had the cow killed to provide meat for all of them to eat. So next time someone is facing a problem, don't say that has nothing to do with you. Options: A Traps can always cause chain reactions B Sometimes when the least of us are threatened, we all might be at risk. C It is better to be safe than to be sorry. D To keep the balance of nature is the duty of us all. Answer: B Sometimes when the least of us are threatened, we all might be at risk. Question:","output":"In the story of the mouse warning the farm animals about a mouse trap in the house, what moral lesson can be learned from the consequences that followed? A. Traps can always cause chain reactions  B. Sometimes when the least of us are threatened, we all might be at risk. C. It is better to be safe than to be sorry. D. To keep the balance of nature is the duty of us all. Answer: B. Sometimes when the least of us are threatened, we all might be at risk."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Solve 6 = -6*u - 12 for u.","output":"First, let's make the equation a bit easier to work with. We can add 12 to both sides to balance it out. If we do that, the -12 and +12 on one side will cancel out, so we won't see it anymore. On the other side, 6 plus 12 equals 18. Our new, simpler equation will be: 18 = -6 * u. Next step: we'll get rid of that '-6' multiplying 'u'. It might be a negative number, and that can be a tricky concept. Remember when you share 18 toys among 6 friends, each friend gets 3 toys. This time it is -6 friends, but let's just forget about the negative for a moment. Pretend we have 18 stickers and we share them among 6 friends, each friend would get 3 stickers, right? So we could say u is 3. But wait, we forgot about that negative concept! In this case, it's like saying you owe 3 stickers to each friend instead of giving to them. Owing or losing something is like going backwards, or like a negative. So the answer is actually not 3, but -3. So, in answer to your question, if 6 = -6*u - 12, then u = -3."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following context and answer the question. Context: I have another guest post for you today. This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin.  After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. Question: When will fresh skin cells ready for treatment occur when cleansing skin? Answer: Options are: (1). not enough information; (2). after using water; (3). after using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser; (4). after using soap; Answer:","output":"Fresh skin cells ready for treatment will occur after using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser (Option 3)."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I'm not a Gackt fan by any means, though he is talented, despite the weird pseudonym that sounds like a cat coughing up a hairball. I always thought Hyde was talented though, Faith is an interesting album. But on topic here folks. This movie is ridiculous. It's so over the top and nonsensical it's almost like a parody of supernatural action films. The movie has almost no plot here, except it's just about vampires with gangster friends. In a way, this film almost reminded me of Spider-Man 3, with how there were too many ideas, which resulted in not enough time to pay attention on one of them. The action scenes were laughable. Quickly edited, almost hard to understand, with choreography that's so laughably bad. Though Hyde looked very stylish during the action scenes, but that's this film's only such redemption. I'm a sucker for good action movies, but the action was horribly done. Though the final shootout was OK and the highlight of this otherwise depressing movie. It keeps jumping between genres, not a good thing. It wants to be a drama, or an action flick, or a horror, or a romance... what the hell. If this review is making you mad, why?

In this snippet, there are two characters: Ridmark and Joram. They seem to be old friends with a history together. Joram is described as a solid knight but not someone to take the lead in a crisis. The conversation indicates that Ridmark is asking Joram about his current position, and Joram responds that he's just a caretaker of Dun Licinia instead of the Comes (a title of nobility). Step 2: Maintain the tone and style of the original text. The text has a casual, conversational tone between the two friends. The writing style is fairly simple, and I'll ensure the continuation is consistent with that. Step 3: Develop the conversation between the characters while adding relevant details. The next part of the conversation should focus on Joram's role as a caretaker, elaborate on how he feels about it, and establish what led him to become one.

Information:  - The is an 8-bit handheld video game device with interchangeable cartridges developed and manufactured by Nintendo, which was first released in Japan on , in North America on and in Europe on . It is the first handheld console in the Game Boy line and was created by Satoru Okada and Nintendo Research & Development 1. This same team, led by Gunpei Yokoi at the time, is credited with designing the Game & Watch series as well as several popular games for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Redesigned versions were released in 1996 and 1998 in the form of Game Boy Pocket and Game Boy Light (Japan only), respectively.  - A board game is a tabletop game that involves counters or moved or placed on a pre-marked surface or \\"board\\", according to a set of rules. Some games are based on pure strategy, but many contain an element of chance; and some are purely chance, with no element of skill.  - The action game is a video game genre that emphasizes physical challenges, including handeye coordination and reaction-time. The genre includes diverse subgenres such as fighting games, shooter games and platform games which are widely considered the most important action games, though some real-time strategy games are also considered to be action games.  - Shooter games are a subgenre of action game, which often test the player's speed and reaction time. It includes many subgenres that have the commonality of focusing on the actions of the avatar using some sort of weapon. Usually this weapon is a gun, or some other long-range weapon. A common resource found in many shooter games is ammunition. Most commonly, the purpose of a shooter game is to shoot opponents and proceed through missions without the player character being killed or dying. A shooting game is a genre of video game where the player has limited spatial control of his or her character, and the focus is almost entirely on the defeat of the character's enemies using long-range weaponry.   - The Atari 8-bit family is a series of 8-bit home computers introduced by Atari, Inc. in 1979 and manufactured until 1992. All of the machines in the family are technically similar, and differ primarily in packaging. They are based on the MOS Technology 6502 CPU running at 1.79 MHz, and were the first home computers designed with custom co-processor chips. This architecture allowed the Atari designs to offer graphics and sound capabilities that were more advanced than contemporary machines like the Apple II or Commodore PET, and gaming on the platform was a major draw. \\"Star Raiders\\" is widely considered the platform's killer app.  - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.  - A video game developer is a software developer that specializes in video game development  the process and related disciplines of creating video games. A game developer can range from one person who undertakes all tasks to a large business with employee responsibilities split between individual disciplines, such as programming, design, art, testing, etc. Most game development companies have video game publisher financial and usually marketing support. Self-funded developers are known as independent or indie developers and usually make indie games.  - , sometimes transliterated Gumpei Yokoi, was a Japanese video game designer. He was a long-time Nintendo employee, best known as creator of the Game & Watch handheld system, inventor of the Control Pad (whose plus-shaped design nearly all video game controllers attempt to mimic today), the original designer of the Game Boy, and producer of a few long-running and critically acclaimed video game franchises, such as \\"Metroid\\" and \\"Kid Icarus\\".  - Atari Corporation was an American manufacturer of computers and video game consoles from 1984 to 1996. Atari Corp. was founded in July 1984 when Warner Communications sold the home computing and game console divisions of Atari, Inc. to Jack Tramiel. Its chief products were the Atari ST, , Atari 7800, Atari Lynx, and Atari Jaguar. The company reverse merged with JTS Inc. in 1996, becoming a small division, which itself closed when JTS liquidated the IP to Hasbro Interactive in 1998.  - The Nintendo Entertainment System (commonly abbreviated as NES) is an 8-bit home video game console that was developed and manufactured by Nintendo. The best-selling gaming console of its time, the NES helped revitalize the US video game industry following the video game crash of 1983. With the NES, Nintendo introduced a now-standard business model of licensing third-party developers, authorizing them to produce and distribute titles for Nintendo's platform.  - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming.  - Cross-promotion is a form of marketing promotion where customers of one product or service are targeted with promotion of a related product. A typical example is cross-media marketing of a brand, for example Oprah Winfrey's promotion on her television show of her books, magazines and website. Cross-promotion may involve two or more companies working together in promoting a service or product, in a way that benefits both. For example, a mobile phone network may work together with a popular music artist and package some of their songs as exclusive ringtones; promoting these ringtones can benefit both the network and the artist. Some major corporations, for example Burger King, have a long history of cross-promotion with a range of partners (see Burger King advertising). The Disney Channel has also made extensive use of cross-promotion. Movie tie-ins are good examples of cross-promotion. On occasion, badly planned cross-promotions can backfire spectacularly such as 1992 Hoover free flights promotion fiasco.  - A tie-in work is a work of fiction or other product based on a media property such as a film, video game, television series, board game, web site, role-playing game or literary property. Tie-ins are authorized by the owners of the original property, and are a form of cross-promotion used primarily to generate additional income from that property and to promote its visibility.  - The megabyte is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information. Its recommended unit symbol is MB, but sometimes \\"MByte\\" is used. The unit prefix \\"mega\\" is a multiplier of (10) in the International System of Units (SI). Therefore, one megabyte is one million bytes of information. This definition has been incorporated into the International System of Quantities.  - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA). The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such as \\"Pong\\" and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s.  - Guinness World Records, known from its inception in 1955 until 1998 as The Guinness Book of Records and in previous U.S. editions as The Guinness Book of World Records, is a reference book published annually, listing world records and national records, both of human achievements and the extremes of the natural world. The book itself holds a world record, as the best-selling copyrighted book of all time. As of the 2017 edition, it is now in its 63rd year of publication, published in 100 countries and 23 languages. The international franchise has extended beyond print to include television series and museums. The popularity of the franchise has resulted in \\"Guinness World Records\\" becoming the primary international authority on the cataloguing and verification of a huge number of world records; the organisation employs official record adjudicators authorised to verify the authenticity of the setting and breaking of records.  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - Real-time strategy (RTS) is a subgenre of strategy video games where the game does not progress incrementally in turns.  - Dundee, officially the City of Dundee, is Scotland's fourth-largest city and the 51st-most-populous built-up area in the United Kingdom. The mid-year population estimate for 2015 was 148,210 which gave Dundee a population density of 2,477/km or 6,420/sq mi, the second-highest in Scotland. It lies within the eastern central Lowlands on the north bank of the Firth of Tay, which feeds into the North Sea. Under the name of \\"Dundee City\\", it forms one of the 32 council areas used for local government in Scotland.  - The Motorola 68000 (\\"'sixty-eight-thousand'\\"; also called the m68k or Motorola 68k, \\"\\"sixty-eight-kay\\"\\") is a 32-bit CISC microprocessor with a 16-bit external data bus, designed and marketed by Motorola Semiconductor Products Sector (later Freescale Semiconductor, now NXP). Introduced in 1979 with HMOS technology as the first member of the successful 32-bit m68k family of microprocessors, it is generally software forward compatible with the rest of the line despite being limited to a 16-bit wide external bus. After 37 years in production, the 68000 architecture is still in use.  - The Game Boy line is a line of handheld game consoles developed, manufactured, and marketed by Nintendo. The product line has sold 200 million units worldwide.  - A microprocessor is a computer processor which incorporates the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) on a single integrated circuit (IC), or at most a few integrated circuits. The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock driven, register based, programmable electronic device which accepts digital or binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic. Microprocessors operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary numeral system.  - A role-playing game (RPG and sometimes roleplaying game) is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting or through a process of structured decision-making or character development. Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines.  - Abandoning previous ventures in favor of toys in the 1960s, Nintendo then developed into a video game company in the 1970s, ultimately becoming one of the most influential in the industry and Japan's third most-valuable company with a market value of over 85 billion. From 1992 until 2016, Nintendo was also the majority shareholder of Major League Baseball's Seattle Mariners.  - The ZX Spectrum is an 8-bit personal home computer released in the United Kingdom in 1982 by Sinclair Research Ltd. It was manufactured in Dundee, Scotland, in the now closed Timex factory.  - Ocean Software Ltd (also known in the United States as Ocean of America, Inc.), commonly referred to as Ocean, was a British software development company, that became one of the biggest European video game developers/publishers of the 1980s and 1990s. It was acquired by a French holding company, Infogrames in 1996 and renamed to \\"Infogrames UK\\" in 1998, and again in 2004 to Atari UK, and once again in 2009 now known as Atari, Inc.  - A fighting game is a video game genre in which the player controls an on-screen character and engages in close combat with an opponent, which can be either an AI or controlled by another player. The fight matches typically consist of several rounds and take place in an arena, while each character has widely differing abilities but each is relatively viable to choose. Players must master techniques such as blocking, counter-attacking, and chaining attacks together into \\"combos\\". Since the early 1990s, most fighting games allow the player to execute special attacks by performing specific input combinations. The fighting game genre is related to but distinct from beat 'em ups, which involve large numbers of enemies against the human player.  - The Addams Family is the title of a video game released for the original Game Boy , as well as differing versions for the Amiga , Amstrad CPC , Atari ST , Commodore 64 , Game Gear , Genesis , NES , SNES , and the ZX Spectrum . The games are a tie - in with the 1991 movie , The Addams Family . It was published and developed in 1992 by Ocean Software . It is a platform side - scrolling action game .  - The Amiga is a family of personal computers sold by Commodore in the 1980s and 1990s. Based on the Motorola 68000 family of microprocessors, the machine has a custom chipset with graphics and sound capabilities that were unprecedented for the price, and a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS. The Amiga provided a significant upgrade from earlier 8-bit home computers, including Commodore's own C64.  - A Platform game (or platformer) is a video game which involves guiding an avatar to jump between suspended platforms and/or over obstacles to advance the game. The player controls the jumps to avoid letting the avatar fall from platforms or miss necessary jumps. The most common unifying element of games of this genre is the jump button, but now there are other alternative like swiping in touchscreen. \\"Jumping\\", in this genre, may include swinging from extendable arms, as in \\"Ristar\\" or \\"Bionic Commando\\", or bouncing from springboards or trampolines, as in \\"Alpha Waves\\". These mechanics, even in the context of other genres, are commonly called \\"platforming\\", a verbification of \\"platform\\". Games where jumping is automated completely, such as 3D games in \\"The Legend of Zelda\\" series, fall outside of the genre.  - The Atari ST is a line of home computers from Atari Corporation and the successor to the Atari 8-bit family. The initial ST model, the 520ST, saw limited release in the spring of 1985 and was widely available in July. The Atari ST is the first personal computer to come with a bit-mapped color GUI, using a version of Digital Research's GEM released in February 1985. The 1040ST, released in 1986, is the first personal computer to ship with a megabyte of RAM in the base configuration and also the first with a cost-per-kilobyte of less than US1.  - The Commodore 64, also known as the C64, C-64, C= 64, or occasionally CBM 64 or VIC-64 in Sweden, is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International. It is listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time, with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units. Volume production started in early 1982, marketing in August for . Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET, the C64 took its name from its of RAM. It had superior sound and graphical specifications compared to other earlier systems such as the Apple II and Atari 800, with multi-color sprites and a more advanced sound processor.  - AmigaOS is the proprietary native operating system of the Amiga and AmigaOne personal computers. It was developed first by Commodore International and introduced with the launch of the first Amiga, the Amiga 1000, in 1985. Early versions of AmigaOS required the Motorola 68000 series of 16-bit and 32-bit microprocessors. Later versions were developed by Haage & Partner (AmigaOS 3.5 and 3.9) and then Hyperion Entertainment (AmigaOS 4.0-4.1). A PowerPC microprocessor is required for the most recent release, AmigaOS 4.  - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea.  - Satoru Okada (  \\"Okada Satoru\\") was the general manager of Nintendo Research & Engineering, the division designing and developing Nintendo handheld game consoles (such as the Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP, and Nintendo DS consoles). He is best known for creating the original Game Boy. He was also assistant producer and director of and contributor to several Nintendo games, notably \\"Metroid\\", released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1986.  - Digital Research, Inc. (also known as DR or DRI; originally Intergalactic Digital Research) was the company created by Dr. Gary Kildall to market and develop his CP/M operating system and related products. It was the first large software company in the microcomputer world. Digital Research was based in Pacific Grove, California.    What entity does 'the addams family ' has the relation 'genre' with?
