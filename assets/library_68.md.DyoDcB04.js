Thus, he is known as \\"the Turcophile Pope,\\" by the Turkish society which is predominantly Muslim. Roncalli took up this post in 1935 and used his office to help the Jewish underground in saving thousands of refugees in Europe, leading some to consider him to be a Righteous Gentile (see Pope John XXIII and Judaism).

Despite the predominant Muslim population in Turkey, Pope John XXIII, also known as Roncalli, earned this nickname due to his close connection and diplomacy efforts in these regions. During his time as Apostolic Delegate, he actively engaged with the local communities and leveraged his position to help save thousands of Jewish refugees in Europe through the Jewish underground. This work led some to consider him a Righteous Gentile, reflecting his dedication to foster interfaith relationships and advocate for social justice. Additionally, in October 1935, he brought Bulgarian pilgrims to Rome and introduced them to Pope Pius XI, further highlighting his commitment to strengthening ties between different cultural and religious groups."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Michael Bennett (April 8, 1943 - July 2, 1987) was an American musical theatre director, writer, choreographer, and dancer. He won seven Tony Awards for his choreography and direction of Broadway shows and was nominated for an additional eleven. Bennett choreographed Promises, Promises, Follies and Company. In 1976, he won the Tony Award for Best Direction of a Musical and the Tony Award for Best Choreography for the musical A Chorus Line. Bennett was born Michael Bennett DiFiglia in Buffalo, New York, the son of Helen (nee Ternoff), a secretary, and Salvatore Joseph DiFiglia, a factory worker. His father was Roman Catholic and Italian American and his mother was Jewish. He studied dance and choreography in his teens and staged a number of shows in his local high school before dropping out to accept the role of Baby John in the US and European tours of West Side Story.  Bennett's career as a Broadway dancer began in the 1961 Betty Comden-Adolph Green-Jule Styne musical Subways Are for Sleeping, after which he appeared in Meredith Willson's Here's Love and the short-lived Bajour. In the mid-1960s he was a featured dancer on the NBC pop music series Hullabaloo, where he met fellow dancer Donna McKechnie.  Bennett made his choreographic debut with A Joyful Noise (1966), which lasted only twelve performances, and in 1967 followed it with another failure, Henry, Sweet Henry (based on the Peter Sellers film The World of Henry Orient). Success finally arrived in 1968, when he choreographed the hit musical Promises, Promises on Broadway. With a contemporary pop score by Burt Bacharach and Hal David, a wisecracking book by Neil Simon and Bennett's well-received production numbers, including \\"Turkey Lurkey Time\\", the show ran for 1,281 performances. Over the next few years, he earned praise for his work on the straight play Twigs with Sada Thompson and the musical Coco with Katharine Hepburn. These were followed by two Stephen Sondheim productions, Company and Follies co-directed with Hal Prince.  In 1973, Bennett was asked by producers Joseph Kipness and Larry Kasha to take over the ailing Cy Coleman-Dorothy Fields musical Seesaw. In replacing the director Ed Sherin and choreographer Grover Dale, he asked for absolute control over the production as director and choreographer and received credit as \\"having written, directed, and choreographed\\" the show. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: How many musicals did he work on in the early years?","output":"In the early years, Michael Bennett worked on at least four musicals: A Joyful Noise (1966), Henry, Sweet Henry (1967), Promises, Promises (1968), and Coco.

UPDATED:. 14:51 EST, 9 November 2012. About eight thousand refugees fleeing violence in Syria have crossed into Turkey in the last 24 hours, a Turkish foreign ministry official said on Friday. It followed an offensive by rebels, who have driven President Bashar al-Assad's troops from much of northern Syria, on a frontier town on Thursday night. The rebels are now in control of a number of crossing points on the Syrian-Turkish border. Their latest assault captured the town of Ras al-Ain, an Arab and Kurd town in the north-eastern oil-producing province of Hasaka, 600km (375 miles) from Damascus. Ten people were killed in clashes as residents fled a few hundred metres across the border to the Turkish town of Ceylanpinar, according to unverified reports overnight. Scroll down for video. Fleeing the violence: Syrian refugees from the town of Ras al-Ain run for the Turkish border last night as clashes between rebels and Bashar al-Assad's troops escalated. Dangerous: An injured man is helped towards the Turkish town of Ceylanpinar. Ten people were reported dead as rebels took control of the neighbouring Syrian town of Ras al-Ain. 'The crossing is important because it opens another line to Turkey, where we can send the wounded and get supplies,' said Khaled al-Walid, a commander in the Raqqa Rebel Division. In the last three months, the mainly Sunni Muslim Arab rebels have captured a string of outposts on the 910km (560 mile) northern border, steadily moving towards the northeast which is home to many of Syria's one million Kurds. However, the encroachments have enraged many Kurds, who want no part in the violence. The Kurdish Council, a coalition of Kurdish parties opposed to Assad, called on the Free Syrian Army to leave Ain al-Arab, a border town of 54,000 people further west. Anxious moments: Syrian refugees of all ages scramble through barbed wire fences in broad daylight as they escape fierce fighting. They said the clashes, as well as the fear of reprisals by the Syrian army, had prompted most of the town's inhabitants to flee. 'While the Kurdish Council affirms it is part of the revolution to bring down this totalitarian regime, the province of Hasaka must remain a safe area for thousands of refugees who had fled to it from other regions,' a statement said.. 'Military elements have to pull out so their presence would not serve as an excuse to shell the town and destroy it.' Guard: Turkish soldiers watch Syrians trying to flee into their country at a border checkpoint close to the town of Ras al-Ain. Adrian Edwards, spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency, said in Geneva that there had been a 'large movement' of Syrian refugees into Turkey's Urfa province in the past 24 hours, a period co-inciding with the rebel offensive. Turkey is already sheltering more than 120,000 Syrian refugees. The Turkish state-run Anatolian news agency also reported that 26 Syrian military officers had also arrived in Turkey with their families overnight - the biggest mass desertion of senior soldiers from Assad's forces in months. Meanwhile, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 12 people were killed by army shelling in the eastern town of al-Qurriya. There were further clashes in the capital Damascus, with rebels and soldiers fighting in Kfar Souseh, a rich neighbourhood just a couple of miles from the presidential palace. On Wednesday, rebels fired mortars at the palace but missed. Air strike: Smoke rises from the eastern Damascus suburb of Arbeen on Thursday following an attack by a MIG fighter jet. An opposition activist in central Damascus said police stations and state buildings had been fortified in anticipation of further rebel attacks. 'First we saw the most important buildings protected. Now we are seeing police stations protected,' said the activist, who asked not to be named for security reasons. Damascus has become steadily more militarised as a result of rebel attacks and battles rage in pro-opposition suburbs. The activist added that extra guards were posted months ago at security centres, the central bank and government offices. Concrete blocks had been installed in recent weeks. The Syrian Observatory, which is based in Britain, said at least 38,000 people have now been killed since the revolt against Assad started 20 months ago.

Samir Saleh Abdullah (Arabic: smr SlH \`bd llh; 14 April 1969 - 20 March 2002), more commonly known as Ibn al-Khattab or Emir Khattab (also transliterated as Amir Khattab and Ameer Khattab, meaning Commander Khattab, or Leader Khattab), was a Saudi Arabian-born mercenary and terrorist military leader in the First Chechen War and the Second Chechen War. The origins and real identity of Khattab remained a mystery to most until after his death, when his brother gave an interview to the press. He died on 20 March 2002 following exposure to a poison letter delivered via a courier who had been recruited by Russia's Federal Security Service. At the age of 18, Khattab left Saudi Arabia to participate in the fight against the Soviet Union during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. During this time, he permanently incapacitated his right hand and lost several fingers after an accident with improvised explosives. The injury was treated with honey by Khattab on himself.  Khattab, while leader of Islamic International Brigade, publicly admitted that he spent the period between 1989 and 1994 in Afghanistan and that he had met Osama Bin Laden. In March 1994, Khattab arrived in Afghanistan and toured fighter training camps in Khost province. He returned to Afghanistan with the first group of Chechen militants in May 1994. Khattab underwent training in Afghanistan and had close connections with al-Qaeda. Several hundred Chechens eventually trained in al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan.  Armenian sources claim that in 1992 he was one of many Chechen volunteers who aided Azerbaijan in the embattled region of Nagorno-Karabakh, where he allegedly met Shamil Basayev. However, the Azerbaijani Ministry of Defense denied any involvement by Khattab in the Nagorno-Karabakh war.  From 1993 to 1995, Khattab left to fight alongside Islamic opposition in the Tajikistan Civil War. Before leaving for Tajikistan in 1994, al-Khattab gave Abdulkareem Khadr a pet rabbit of his own, which was promptly named Khattab.  In an interview, Khattab once mentioned he had also been involved in the War in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The fragment of this interview in which he makes this statement can be found in the 2004 BBC documentary The Smell of Paradise, though he did not specify his exact role or the duration of his presence there. What is al-Khattab's connection to central asia?","output":"Al-Khattab was a military leader who fought in various conflicts in Central Asia. He started by fighting against the Soviet Union during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. After that, he went to Afghanistan and trained with al-Qaeda, where he also helped train Chechen militants. He was also involved in other conflicts in Central Asia, like the Tajikistan Civil War, and possibly the Nagorno-Karabakh war and the War in Bosnia and Herzegovina. So, his connection to Central Asia is that he was a fighter and military leader who participated in different wars and conflicts in the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information:  - A persona (plural personae or personas), in the word's everyday usage, is a social role or a character played by an actor. The word is derived from Latin, where it originally referred to a theatrical mask. The Latin word probably derived from the Etruscan word \\"phersu\\", with the same meaning, and that from the Greek  (\\"prospon\\"). Its meaning in the latter Roman period changed to indicate a \\"character\\" of a theatrical performance or court of law, when it became apparent that different individuals could assume the same role, and legal attributes such as rights, powers, and duties followed the role. The same individuals as actors could play different roles, each with its own legal attributes, sometimes even in the same court appearance. According to other sources, which also admit that the origin of the term is not completely clear, \\"persona\\" could possibly be related to the Latin verb \\"per-sonare\\", literally: \\"sounding through\\", with an obvious link to the above-mentioned theatrical mask.  - Paul Daniel \\"Ace\\" Frehley (born April 27, 1951) is an American musician, singer and songwriter best known as the former lead guitarist and founding member of the rock band Kiss. He invented the persona of the \\"Spaceman\\" or \\"Space Ace\\" and played with the group from its inception in 1973 until his departure in 1982. After leaving Kiss, Frehley embarked on a solo career, which was put on hold when he rejoined Kiss in 1996 for a highly successful reunion tour.  - Hard rock is a loosely defined subgenre of rock music that began in the mid-1960s, with the garage, psychedelic and blues rock movements. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with pianos and keyboards.  - Casablanca Records is an American recording label owned by Universal Music Group and operated under Republic Records. The label became most successful as a disco label in the 1970s and currently operates as an Electronic dance music label under the direction of Tommy Mottola.  - Love Gun is the sixth studio album by American hard rock band Kiss, released on June 30, 1977 by Casablanca Records. The album was remastered in 1997. It is notable for being their first album to feature a lead vocal performance from Ace Frehley, making it the first Kiss album to feature lead vocal performances from all four band members.

Write an article based on this summary: – Not a phrase you typically see associated with climate change: \\"a wonderful, happy surprise.\\" But that's what the science director at the Save the Redwoods League had to say to the Los Angeles Times about the news that coast redwoods and giant sequoias have grown at their fastest rate ever over the last four decades, possibly thanks to climate change. The San Jose Mercury News reports the growth rates over those 40 years are as much as 45% faster than they've been in the last 200 years. (It's the girth, not height, that is increasing at a record pace, notes the Marin Independent Journal.) The league, along with a number of university scientists, studied tree rings and took corings no wider than a pencil from 78 redwoods in order to create their chronology. That allowed them to calculate historic growth rates, which led to the discovery that things have gotten speedier of late. The researchers aren't sure climate change is the culprit, but one explains a few working theories: that increased temps have elongated the growing season, or that a reduction in fog is providing more sunlight. But reductions in air pollution or wildfire damage could also be at the root of it. Two neat side notes: The oldest redwood tree known was found by the researchers. It's at least 2,520 years old and, as the Mercury News points out, \\"had already been growing for 400 years when Julius Caesar was born.\\" Researchers found that many redwoods didn't grow at all in 1580, \\"the year Sir Francis Drake reported having ice on his sails as he sailed the coast of California,\\" says the league's director.","output":"Title: Climate Change's Unexpected Upside: Record-Breaking Redwood Growth Climate change often evokes thoughts of natural disasters, habitat loss, and suffering ecosystems, but recent news has brought about an unusual term relating to the phenomenon: \\"a wonderful, happy surprise.\\" This phrase, uttered by the science director at the Save the Redwoods League, comes as a result of new findings that suggest coast redwoods and giant sequoias have experienced their fastest growth rate in the past four decades, potentially due to climate change. According to the San Jose Mercury News, the growth rates of these giant trees have been 45% faster than in the previous 200 years. This increase in girth, rather than height, has been noted by the Marin Independent Journal as happening at a record pace. In order to study the redwoods' growth, the Save the Redwoods League collaborated with numerous university scientists to analyze tree rings and take narrow core samples from 78 redwoods. This data allowed the researchers to create a chronology and calculate historical growth rates, leading to the discovery of a recent rapid increase. While the exact cause of this accelerated growth remains uncertain, researchers have proposed some possible theories. One suggestion is that increased temperatures due to climate change have led to an extended growing season. Another possibility is that the reduced fog in the area is providing the trees with additional sunlight. Alternatively, reductions in air pollution or wildfire damage could have contributed to this surprising development. This study has also uncovered intriguing side notes related to the redwoods. The oldest known redwood tree, dating back 2,520 years, was discovered by the researchers. This ancient titan had already been growing for four centuries by the time Julius Caesar was born. Additionally, the researchers found that many redwoods experienced almost no growth in 1580. This observation coincides with records from Sir Francis Drake, who reported having ice on his sails while sailing along the coast of California during the same year. While the precise reason for the record-breaking growth of coast redwoods and giant sequoias remains to be determined, the phenomenon provides an unexpected and positive outcome potentially related to climate change. The colossal trees, ancient testaments to the power and resilience of nature, remind us of the complexity and interconnectedness of our planet's ecosystems. Further research into the causes of this accelerated growth will yield valuable insight into the myriad ways climate change affects our world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Captain Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) reads Patrick a telephone transcript of the drug lord setting up an exchange for Amanda. The exchange at a nearby quarry in Quincy is botched and it is believed Amanda drowned; her doll is found in the quarry and returned to Helene. Doyle, whose own daughter was killed years before, takes responsibility for the death and goes into early retirement. Two months later, a seven year old boy is abducted in Everett and Patrick receives information that the boy was taken by a known child molester.

Answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: In the face of rising gas costs, many consumers are beginning to consider the choice of a hybrid vehicle--one which operates on both gas and electricity. All of the models of hybrid car will save money, but are they really effective when all of the costs of maintenance and other considerations are included in? First of all, consider the cost of buying a hybrid vehicle. Depending on the model, hybrid vehicles can cost anywhere from 2,000 to 5,000 more than the traditional models. However, some say that as the hybrid cars become increasingly more available as a reflection of demand, the prices can be expected to drop, making them more cost effective when it comes to the initial investment. Also important to keep in mind is the fact that the hybrid cars have a much more specialized system than the standard vehicle, and will therefore require more specialized workers to repair them when they break down. It seems as though, at least for the time being, the purchase of a hybrid vehicle for the average consumer may not be the best choice when it comes to saving money. It is important to keep several things in mind, however, when considering purchasing a hybrid model. Many consumers are choosing to purchase these cars because they represent a significant development in terms of environmental concerns over standard models. They also mean that as a whole, Western nations will become less dependent on oil as the only means of power. Finally, it is necessary to remember that the hybrid car is a very new technology. Developed only within the last few years, the technology is still in the starting stage, where costs will continue to be high. As time passes, the development of the hybrid technology will begin to push prices down to the point where hybrids are more competitive with the traditionally fueled models of the past.

Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"Yes, the answer correctly identifies the Chola dynasty as the one that conquered southern India and parts of Southeast Asia, along with providing additional details about their territorial expansions. The Chola dynasty, which ruled from the early 9th century to the early 13th century, was one of the most powerful and prominent ruling dynasties of southern India. Under the ambitious and influential leadership of rulers like Raja Raja Chola I and Rajendra Chola I, the Chola dynasty saw an era of expansion, prosperity, and cultural achievements. Raja Raja Chola I ascended the throne in 985 AD, and during his reign, the Chola dynasty expanded to control the entire southern part of the Indian peninsula. He conquered the Pandya and Chera kingdoms in the south, and the Gangavadi and Nolambavadi regions in present-day Karnataka. Additionally, his conquests included territories of the Pallava and Tondaimandalam dynasties. Raja Raja Chola I also invaded Sri Lanka and succeeded in annexing the northern part of the island. Rajendra Chola I, the son of Raja Raja Chola I, continued the expansion of the Chola dynasty in the early 11th century. He conquered the entirety of Sri Lanka, allowing the Cholas to govern the island for nearly 50 years. Rajendra Chola I also led expeditions to Southeast Asia, specifically to the Srivijaya kingdom, which is present-day Indonesia and Malaysia. By 1025, Rajendra Chola's naval forces overpowered and conquered the Srivijaya kingdom, expanding the Chola empire to its greatest territorial extent. Under the Chola rule, both the Maldives and Bengal were influenced and became tributaries – the Maldives in the early 11th century and Bengal in the mid-11th century. The Chola dynasty's control over southern India and parts of Southeast Asia was also marked by the development of distinctive architecture, art, sculpture, and literature. The rule of the Chola dynasty can be seen as a golden period in the history of southern India, during which considerable cultural, economic, and military achievements took place."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

These include: 1. Toxins: Toxins are harmful substances produced by living organisms or released by human activities. They can contaminate water sources, soil, and air, leading to hazards for humans, animals, and plants. Examples include pesticides, industrial chemicals, and heavy metals. 2. Cars: Cars, especially those with internal combustion engines, emit greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide and methane) and air pollutants (like nitrogen oxides and particulate matter) that contribute to climate change, air pollution, and health problems. Cars also require roads and parking spaces, which can contribute to habitat loss and fragmentation. 3. Cattle: As mentioned in the question, cattle can cause soil erosion, which can lead to the loss of fertile topsoil, degradation of land quality, and sedimentation of waterways. Additionally, cattle farming produces significant amounts of greenhouse gases (primarily methane from their digestive processes) and can contribute to deforestation for pasture expansion, leading to habitat loss and biodiversity reduction. 4. Tar: Tar is a thick, sticky substance derived from petroleum, coal, or peat, and is used in various applications, such as road construction and as a waterproofing agent. It can be toxic when in contact with soil or water, leading to contamination of nearby habitats and water sources. Tar is also derived from nonrenewable sources, and its production and use can contribute to air pollution and climate change. 5.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"The two surnames 'Rasel' or 'Rassel' and 'Levrenz' are not paraphrases of each other as they refer to different family names, with potentially different origins and meanings. Let's explore them individually. 1) Rasel/Rassel: The surnames Rasel and Rassel both appear to have Germanic roots. However, it is important to note that surname origins can be complex, and the same surname may have different origins for different families, depending on regional, linguistic, and historical factors. One possible origin of Rasel/Rassel comes from the Germanic personal name \\"Rathwulf,\\" which is composed of the elements \\"rathu,\\" meaning advice or counsel, and \\"wulf,\\" meaning wolf. The transition from the given name Rathwulf to the surname Rassel could have occurred when the modern surname system was developed and people began to adopt surnames based on their father's or ancestor's names. Another theory connecting Rasel/Rassel to Germanic roots comes from the Middle High German word \\"rase,\\" which means quick or rash. In this case, the surname may have been an occupational or nickname associated with a person's quickness, or perhaps their temperament, if they were seen as rash or impulsive. Regarding geographic distribution, while the surname has primary roots in Germany, it might also be found in neighboring countries such as Austria, Switzerland, and others, depending on migration patterns over the centuries. 2) Levrenz: Levrenz does not appear to be a widely recognized or common surname. It may be a variation of another surname, possibly due to transcription errors, changes in spelling over time, or the merging of different names. A more common alternative spelling to Levrenz might be \\"Levrentz\\" or \\"Lewerenz.\\" One possibility is that the surname Levrenz is derived from a geographical or topographical location. In some cases, surnames were created based on a person's place of origin or residence, such as a town or village. Levrenz could potentially be related to a location in Germany (or another European region) where the name was taken as a surname by its inhabitants. For example, if there is a town or village named Levern or Leverenz, the surname may have originated from people who resided in or came from that place. Another possibility is that the Levrenz surname is derived from a given name, similar to the Rasel/Rassel origin. However, due to the rarity of the name and potential variations in spelling, it is difficult to determine its specific origins and meanings. In summary, the surnames Rasel/Rassel and Levrenz are not paraphrases of each other, as they refer to distinct family names derived from different sources. Rasel/Rassel appears to have Germanic origins and could be related to the ancient Germanic personal name \\"Rathwulf\\" or the Middle High German word \\"rase.\\" Levrenz, on the other hand, is a relatively uncommon surname, and its origin is less clear, possibly stemming from a geographical location or a given name."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Now, US scientists have discovered not only does retail therapy exist,but that it could be caused by an individual's fear of sudden death. Researchers found materialistic people thought terrorism and war more stressful than others. Psychologists believe the rise of materialism around the world and its treatment effect on extreme stress might be a response to fear of death caused by acts of terrorism, disease and natural disasters. The scientists from Michigan State University said people with possession obsessions often have lower self-esteem than others so are more likely to shop as the result of severe psychological suffering. Ayalla Ruvio,a business professor studying people's shopping habits while rockets fell in Israel, said, \\"When the going gets tough, the materialistic people go shopping. This stress spending is likely to produce even greater stress and lower well-being. Essentially, materialism appears to make bad events even worse. Dr Ruvio led a two-part study of Israeli citizens living in a town that came under extreme rocket attacks for about six months in 2007. She compared 139 residents of the southern town with 170 from another town that was not under attack to see how their symptoms of post-traumatic stress and shopping habits varied. Dr Ruvio found that, when faced with a deadly threat, those who are highly materialistic suffered much higher levels of stress,while their tendency to shop was increased. Dr Ruvio said, \\"The relationship between materialism and stress may be more harmful than commonly thought.\\" The second stage of their research surveyed 855 Americans about their materialistic nature and fear of death. They found shopping was used to relieve feelings of stress and anxiety about death but this was in response to fear of a variety of life-threatening events like car accidents, criminal attacks and natural disasters. Options: A Terrorism is believed to easily cause the rise of materialism. B The materialistic find terrorism and war more stressful than others.

Context: Former President Barack Obama unveiled plans for his future presidential library and museum on the south side of Chicago where he raised his family and launched his political career. The designs show a complex of modern buildings, with a library, museum and event center, plus a community garden, a children's play area and possibly an athletic field. \\"What we want this to be is the world-premiere institution for training young people and leadership to make a difference in their communities, in their countries and in the world,\\" he told the crowd that included Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, his one-time chief of staff. Flanked by drawings and renderings, Obama also announced that he and former first lady Michelle Obama will be donating 2 million to fund a Chicago summer jobs program. The museum, the tallest of the three buildings, will hold exhibition space, public spaces, offices and education and meeting rooms, according to the Obama Foundation. The forum and library buildings are intended to be used for study and foundation programming. Obama said his foundation, which is overseeing the project, is also looking into the possibility of locating a Chicago Public Library branch on the site. Obama said he envisioned recording studios where musicians could help young people work on music, and space for movie directors who could take on community storytelling. The center will also have exhibits with campaign memorabilia and personal artifacts. \\"Let's face it, we want to see Michelle's dresses,\\" the former president joked. Obama also squashed any notion that the library was ever going to be elsewhere. Multiple locations in three states — Illinois, New York and Hawaii — had initially pitched proposals. \\"The best things that have happened to me in my life happened in this community,\\" he said. \\"Although we had a formal bidding process to determine where the presidential library was going to be, the fact of the matter was it had to be right here on the south side of Chicago.\\" Question: How does Obama feel about the museum?

The Agencies Confer When they learned a second plane had struck the World Trade Center, nearly everyone in the White House told us, they immediately knew it was not an accident. The Secret Service initiated a number of security enhancements around the White House complex. The officials who issued these orders did not know that there were additional hijacked aircraft, or that one such aircraft was en route to Washington. These measures were precautionary steps taken because of the strikes in New York. The FAA and White House Teleconferences. The FAA, the White House, and the Defense Department each initiated a multiagency teleconference before 9:30. Because none of these teleconferences-at least before 10:00- included the right officials from both the FAA and Defense Department, none succeeded in meaningfully coordinating the military and FAA response to the hijackings. At about 9:20, security personnel at FAA headquarters set up a hijacking teleconference with several agencies, including the Defense Department. The NMCC officer who participated told us that the call was monitored only periodically because the information was sporadic, it was of little value, and there were other important tasks. The FAA manager of the teleconference also remembered that the military participated only briefly before the Pentagon was hit. Both individuals agreed that the teleconference played no role in coordinating a response to the attacks of 9/11. Acting Deputy Administrator Belger was frustrated to learn later in the morning that the military had not been on the call. At the White House, the video teleconference was conducted from the Situation Room by Richard Clarke, a special assistant to the president long involved in counterterrorism. Logs indicate that it began at 9:25 and included the CIA; the FBI; the departments of State, Justice, and Defense; the FAA; and the White House shelter. The FAA and CIA joined at 9:40. The first topic addressed in the White House video teleconference-at about 9:40-was the physical security of the President, the White House, and federal agencies. Immediately thereafter it was reported that a plane had hit the Pentagon. We found no evidence that video teleconference participants had any prior information that American 77 had been hijacked and was heading directly toward Washington.

Often we believe that our child will pick up on our values if they live in the same home. While they may pick up many of our values, parents need to remember they are not the only influence in their child's life. These outside values often compete with family values for your child's attention. If we do not make a conscious  effort to _ our children, they may not get instilled at all. I wish I had learned that lesson a little earlier. I thought if I lived my values for my children they would pick them up and make their own. Sometimes this happened and sometimes it didn't. I often see twenty-something \\"kids\\" who have no faith in many of the values of their family in favor of the values of their friends. Children will often pick up the negative you show quicker than the positive, so the positive things need extra focus to set them. Some of the influences your children face every day include their church, their school, their friends, any clubs or sporting groups they are part of and more. Kids spend many hours a day at school and with their friends. Sometimes in the business of life, we suppose our children will obtain that foundation we want for them. Instilling a foundation of family values to sustain  your child requires more than living it in front of them. That is important, but building up your child with this important foundation must become intentional. That means we plan times to gather as a family. We plan activities together that show the values we want to pass on. We talk about our values; we live our values; we discuss the values of others and how they differ from ours; we constantly look for opportunities and make our own opportunities to share these values in word or deed with our children.

Write an article based on this summary: – Victoria Rexach had previously had two cesarean sections, and her doctor—a high-risk specialist—wanted her to have another when she gave birth to her twin girls. But when the 30-year-old went into premature labor on Aug. 28, before her pregnancy had hit the six-month mark, doctors at Richmond University Medical Center in Staten Island proceeded with a natural childbirth instead, and Rexach and both babies died two minutes after the birth, NBC New York reports. The family believes she would have survived had she been given a C-section, and according to News 12, they say the hospital knew she could not deliver naturally. \\"She screamed, and then she was just holding my hand and then her eyes closed and I kept smacking her face, telling her, 'Don't fall asleep on me, don't fall asleep,'\\" says Tafari Brathwaite, the babies' father and Rexach's common-law husband. \\"She looked at me and said 'OK' and then closed her eyes, and that was the last time I saw her.\\" The medical examiner is still investigating and no cause of death has yet been determined, but family members say Rexach lost a lot of blood and suffered cardiac arrest; the hospital, in a statement, calls the twins \\"non-viable fetuses.\\" Brathwaite plans to sue the hospital, the New York Post reports. \\"She told them she couldn't push, but they made her push and they let her die,\\" says an activist who is working with the family.

Does it follow that \\"The estimates for costs are pretty accurate for the mailings.\\"? OPT: *yes *it is not possible to tell *no","output":"It is not possible to tell if the estimates for costs are pretty accurate for the mailings just based on the information provided. The described approach of dividing the costs for each postal activity by the total volume to obtain an estimate of the marginal cost is a common method used in cost accounting. However, the accuracy of these estimates greatly depends on various factors, including the accuracy of the cost data, the stability of the costs and volumes over the period, the assumptions made when calculating the costs, and the method employed in allocating overhead costs. Here are some factors that can affect the accuracy of cost estimations for mailings: 1. Cost data accuracy: If the cost data being used to calculate the marginal cost is not accurate, the resulting cost estimates will also be inaccurate. The cost data primarily includes the direct and indirect costs involved in various postal activities, such as labor, materials, energy, and maintenance. 2. Stability of costs and volumes: The accuracy of the cost estimates can be affected by fluctuations in volumes or costs associated with postal activities over time. If there is a significant change in either the volume or costs, the marginal cost estimates may be less accurate. It is crucial to monitor and update the cost data and assumptions to maintain the accuracy of the estimates. 3. Assumptions: The method used to allocate costs to various postal activities can involve several assumptions. These assumptions must be accurate and reasonable for the cost estimates to be reliable. For example, if the overhead costs are allocated using a predetermined basis such as square footage or labor hours, it is essential to ensure that the chosen basis represents a fair allocation of the overhead costs. 4. Allocation of overhead costs: The allocation of overhead costs to various postal activities can be challenging due to their indirect nature. The choice of the method used to allocate the overhead costs, such as activity-based costing or traditional costing, can significantly affect the accuracy of the cost estimates. Using an appropriate costing method that accurately allocates overhead costs can improve the accuracy of the estimated costs for mailings. 5. Variability in cost drivers: If some postal activities have a higher level of variability in their cost drivers than others, the estimated marginal cost may not accurately reflect the true cost of these activities. This can lead to under- or overestimation of the costs associated with certain mailings. In conclusion, while the described approach is commonly used to estimate the marginal cost of postal activities, the accuracy of these estimates relies on multiple factors. To determine the accuracy of the cost estimates for mailings, it is necessary to consider the quality of the data, the stability of costs and volumes, the assumptions used in cost allocations, and the appropriateness of the chosen costing methods. Without more information on these factors, it is not possible to conclude if the estimates for costs are pretty accurate for the mailings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: When a solid substance is involved in a chemical reaction, only the matter at the surface of the solid is exposed to other reactants. If a solid has more surface area, more of it is exposed and able to react. Therefore, increasing the surface area of solid reactants increases the reaction rate. Look at the hammer and nails pictured in the Figure below . Both are made of iron and will rust when the iron combines with oxygen in the air. However, the nails have a greater surface area, so they will rust faster.  and the situation: Andy is participating in this years science fair. He is testing how fast metal takes to rust. He rakes 3 pieces of iron one is a cube, and the other is a sheet both weighing the same. It takes the cube almost a week to fully rust but the sheet only takes 2 days. The only difference between the two is that the sheet has more surface area. He tries this again with a cylinder so the surface area is larger than the cube but smaller than the sheet and it takes about 4 days to fully rust.  Answer the following question: Which will rust faster given they contain the same amount of iron, a sheet or a cylinder? Answer:","output":"Based on the given background information and the experimental results from Andy's science fair project, it can be concluded that the sheet of iron will rust faster than the cylinder. As mentioned previously, when a solid substance is involved in a chemical reaction, the matter at its surface is exposed to other reactants. Therefore, the surface area of the solid reactant has a significant impact on the rate of the reaction. In this case, the reaction being observed is the rusting of iron, which occurs as iron combines with oxygen in the air to form iron oxide. From Andy's experiments, we can see that the time taken for each piece of iron to rust is related to their surface area. The cube took the longest time to rust (almost a week), followed by the cylinder (about 4 days), and finally, the sheet with the shortest time (only 2 days). This order correlates with the surface area of each shape, as the sheet has the largest surface area, the cylinder has a surface area larger than the cube but smaller than the sheet, and the cube has the smallest surface area. Given that the sheet and the cylinder contain the same amount of iron, the sheet's larger surface area enables more of it to be exposed to oxygen in the air, leading to a faster rate of reaction and a quicker rusting process. Therefore, the sheet will rust faster than the cylinder when considering the relationship between surface area and reaction rate."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Israeli Secret Service views the neighboring lemon grove of Salma Zidane (Hiam Abbass), a Palestinian widow whose family has cared for the area for generations, as a threat to the minister and his wife. The security forces soon set up a guard post and a barbed wire fence around the grove. They then obtain an order to uproot the lemon trees.[3][8] Salma feels isolated given that her son has moved to Washington, D.C. and her daughters are now married. The local village elder Abu Kamal (Makram Khoury) advises her to give in, but Salma decides to work with the young lawyer Ziad Daud (Ali Suliman). They take their case all the way to the Supreme Court. Mira Navon (Rona Lipaz-Michael), the minister's wife, sympathizes with Salma.

A:","output":"In the movie \\"Lemon Tree,\\" Salma Zidane (played by Hiam Abbass) is a Palestinian widow who owns a lemon grove that has been in her family for generations. The lemon grove comes under threat when the Israeli Defense Minister, Israel Navon (played by Doron Tavory), moves into a house nearby, just on the Israeli side of the border between Israel and the West Bank. Although Salma does not directly establish forbidden ties with anyone in the movie, she does form a complex, unspoken bond with Mira Navon (played by Rona Lipaz-Michael), the wife of the Israeli Defense Minister. This bond develops as both women share a sense of personal loneliness and are affected by the impending court case and the eventual construction of a concrete wall between their homes.  When the Israeli Secret Service starts viewing Salma's lemon grove as a threat, Salma teams up with the young lawyer Ziad Daud (played by Ali Suliman) to take her case to the Supreme Court. The court case receives significant media attention, and during the process, Mira expresses her sympathy for Salma and her disagreement with her husband and the Israeli military's actions. The story unfolds, highlighting the resilience and determination of these two women amidst the conflict and their struggles. Ultimately, the Palestinian cause is dismissed, Mira decides to leave her husband, and a concrete wall is built between Salma's land and the Defense Minister's house in a tragic turn of events. The film ends with a sobering shot of the lemon trees having been cut down. While no explicit forbidden ties are established between the characters, the emotional connection and mutual understanding between Salma and Mira represent a symbolic crossing of the divide that separates their lives due to political and cultural circumstances. The movie showcases the shared humanity and the power of empathy transcending boundaries amidst ongoing tensions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I read this background article the other day: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).  I am facing a new situation today: Jimmy is currently shopping at his local grocery store during his weekly trip to get food and other necessities. He first picks up some frozen pizzas, his favorite meal when he is feeling lazy after work, and then stops off to pick up a loaf of bread. He then walks over to the dairy section to pick up some cheese for his lunches. Jimmy never buys milk, but today he has a sudden urge to get some. He walks over to the milk refrigerators and looks at all the options. He is currently debating between two brands, Luchene and Jean's. While trying to decide, he notices a sticker on the Luchene gallon that says \\"organic,\\" but is unable to find any such indication on the gallon of Jean's milk. After asking an employee, it is confirmed that Jean's is not organic milk. Unable to make up his mind, Jimmy simply leaves without buying any milk.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which brand requires more cows to produce the same amount of milk? The answer to this question is:","output":"The Luchene brand, which produces organic milk, would require more cows to produce the same amount of milk. The steps taken to arrive at this conclusion are: 1. Reviewing the background article, it reveals that organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. This conclusion is drawn based on the fact that organic farms tend to use lower levels of concentrates for cows. 2. Since Luchene produces organic milk, it falls into the category of organic dairy farms and, thus, produces less milk per cow. 3. On the other hand, Jean's milk does not indicate it's organic. Therefore, it can be inferred that it may fall into the category of conventional milk production, which generally produces more milk per cow. 4. Therefore, to produce the same amount of milk, Luchene (organic milk producer) would need more cows compared to Jean's (presumed conventional milk producer).  5.

The total amount of borrowing reached a record 2.84 trillion, with student loans reaching 1 trillion. Borrowing in the category that includes credit cards was at its highest level since 2010.

In the first sentence, it is stated that \\"Rice played a tour with Maria Taylor of Azure Ray and played the Sunset Junction Festival in Los Angeles.\\" Here, the sentence implies that Rice went on a tour alongside Maria Taylor, who is a member of the band Azure Ray.

In the second sentence, it is stated that \\"Rice played a tour with Maria Taylor of Azure Ray and directed the Los Angeles Sunset Junction Festival.\\" In this sentence, Rice is still going on tour with Maria Taylor, a member of Azure Ray. However, the difference lies in the latter part of the sentence: Rice is said to have directed the Sunset Junction Festival in Los Angeles instead of playing at the festival. This means that Rice was involved in organizing or overseeing the creative aspects of the festival.

These men were on trial on serious charges, namely conspiracy to murder police or prison officers.  The courtroom drama occurred in Belfast Crown Court, where the most recent unexpected development took place when the prosecution stated that they were \\"offering no further evidence against any of the accused\\". This means that the prosecution admitted that they have exhausted their resources and were unable to present more evidence to support the allegations made against the trio. Even though the suspects have always denied any involvement in the alleged offenses, this sudden decision by the prosecution inferred a significant turn in the proceedings. Consequently, the defense seized this opportunity to address the court, requesting that all three men be acquitted of all charges in light of the absence of further evidence coming from the prosecution’s side. After considering the indications and deliberating within the current conditions of the trial, the judge complied with the defense's request. He returned not guilty verdicts for all charges related to conspiracy to murder police or prison officers against the three defendants, and subsequently told them they were formally discharged. Officially declaring someone not guilty of any accusations against them implies that the person is completely exonerated, which means that in the eyes of the law, their record remains clean as if they were never accused or tried for the crime in the first place. Therefore, these men are now free of the restraining confines of an impending trial and can go back to their regular lives without any pending charges over their heads. In conclusion, the article discusses a complex court case in Belfast Crown Court involving three men initially charged with conspiracy to murder police and prison officers. However, due to the prosecution's inability to offer additional evidence, all three accused pleaded not guilty, and the judge acquitted them, formally discharging them from all the previously held accusations."},{"instruction":"Information:  - Brutalist architecture is a movement in architecture that flourished from the 1950s to the mid-1970s, descending from the modernist architectural movement of the early 20th century.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the building that remains in use by the Church of England? ?  St Denys' Church, Sleaford, is a medieval Anglican parish church in Sleaford, Lincolnshire, England. While a church and a priest have probably been present in the settlement since approximately 1086, the oldest parts of the present building are the tower and spire, which date to the late 12th and early 13th centuries; the stone broach spire is one of the earliest examples of its kind in England. The Decorated Gothic nave, aisles and north transept were built in the 14th century. The church was altered in the 19th century: the north aisle was rebuilt by the local builders Kirk and Parry in 1853 and the tower and spire were largely rebuilt in 1884 after being struck by lightning. St Denys' remains in use for worship by the Church of England. The church is a Grade I listed building, a national designation given to \\"buildings of exceptional interest\\". It is a prime example of Decorated Gothic church architecture in England, with the architectural historians Sir Nikolaus Pevsner and John Harris noting that \\"it is a prolonged delight to follow the mason's inventiveness\\". The church's tracery has attracted special praise, with Simon Jenkins arguing that its Decorated windows are \\"works of infinite complexity\\". Built out of Ancaster stone with a lead roof, St Denys' is furnished with a medieval rood screen and a communion rail, possibly by Sir Christopher Wren, and has a peal of eight bells, dating to 1796. The church also houses several memorials, including two altar tombs commemorating members of the Carre family, Sleaford's lords of the manor in the 17th century.

Emphasis on the significance of the album: The reviewer states that the album has introduced the world to a new \\"super-band,\\" suggesting that this is a critically important release, not just for fans of the band but for music as a whole. This demonstrates the perceived influence and impact of the album and generates curiosity. 5. Limited edition with value-added content: The review specifically mentions that this particular edition of the album is a limited version containing extra tracks. For potential buyers, this adds value to the product and could serve as a deciding factor between purchasing this edition or a standard one. 6. A solution to the perceived decline in modern music: By stating that the album offers \\"the true marriage of songwriting, performance, and production that has been lacking in modern music for way too long,\\" the reviewer shows that this release is seen as a rare gem in the current music landscape. As a result, potential buyers who share the same opinion about the lack of quality in contemporary music may be more inclined to make the purchase. Overall, the gushing and positive nature of the review, backed by thoughtful arguments and comparisons, would significantly increase my chances of buying the album, as it presents the product as unmissable and essential for any music enthusiast."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Orthodox believe that she was and remained a virgin before and after Christ's birth. The Theotokia (i.e., hymns to the Theotokos) are an essential part of the Divine Services in the Eastern Church and their positioning within the liturgical sequence effectively places the Theotokos in the most prominent place after Christ. Within the Orthodox tradition, the order of the saints begins with: The Theotokos, Angels, Prophets, Apostles, Fathers, Martyrs, etc. giving the Virgin Mary precedence over the angels.

Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"Seasons cause change to what of animals?\\" with the following options:  - genetic material  - species of offspring  - native habitats  - most organisms  - color of nails  - Quality of life  - an external framework  - shape of head","output":"Seasons cause change to the native habitats of animals.  Given Fact 1 that seasons cause change to the environment, it is important to understand how these changes affect various aspects of the natural world. As the Earth revolves around the Sun, the tilt of the Earth's axis causes certain areas to receive varying amounts of sunlight and warmth, resulting in the four distinct seasons: spring, summer, autumn, and winter. These changes in temperature and light conditions have significant effects on both plant and animal life.  Fact 2 states that wildlife habitat is the native environment of an animal, which is the area where a particular species has adapted to live and thrive. The habitat provides the species with suitable conditions for feeding, breeding, and raising offspring. Additionally, it enables the animals to find shelter from predators and other threats to their survival.  Considering both of these facts, it becomes evident that seasons have a significant impact on the native habitats of animals. Seasonal changes have numerous consequences on the plants and animals that are found within these wildlife habitats. For example, seasonal fluctuations in temperature and precipitation can alter the availability and distribution of food resources, such as the abundance of certain plants or the migration patterns of other animals. These environmental changes also affect the breeding cycles and behavior of various species, ultimately leading to noticeable shifts in animal populations. From the options presented above, the notion that seasons cause change to the genetic material or species of offspring is incorrect. While environmental factors might influence the individual development of an organism, they do not directly change the genetic makeup or the species of the offspring.  Furthermore, statements like changing the color of nails, quality of life, an external framework, or shape of the head are unrelated to the given facts and do not accurately describe the effects of seasons on animal life. Based on the relationship between Fact 1 and Fact 2, and the given options, the most accurate answer is that seasons cause change to the native habitats of animals. These environmental changes, which occur as the Earth moves through its seasonal cycle, have a profound impact on the complexity and the delicate balance of ecosystems worldwide."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Plot title: Airport '77 Movie plot: A privately owned luxury Boeing 747-100, Stevens' Flight 23, flies invited guests to an estate in Palm Beach, Florida, owned by wealthy philanthropist Philip Stevens, who also owns the jetliner. Valuable artwork from Stevens's private collection is also on board the jetliner, to be eventually displayed in his new museum. Such a collection motivates a group of thieves led by co-pilot Bob Chambers to hijack the aircraft. Once Captain Don Gallagher leaves the cockpit and is knocked unconscious, the hijackers' plans go into action. A sleeping gas, which one of the hijackers secretly installed before the flight, is released into the cabin and the passengers lose consciousness. Knocking out the flight engineer, Chambers moves forward with the hijacking, and Stevens' Flight 23 \\"disappears\\" into the Bermuda Triangle. Descending to virtual wave-top altitude, Flight 23 heads into a fog bank, reducing visibility to less than a mile. Minutes later, a large offshore drilling platform emerges from the haze, Flight 23 heading straight for it at nearly 600 knots. Chambers pulls back on the yoke in a banking left turn, but an engine clips the derrick and catches fire. Chambers immediately hits the fire extinguishing button, and the flames are momentarily extinguished. Because the aircraft is at such a low altitude, the sudden loss of airspeed threatens to stall the airplane. As the engine reignites, Chambers is forced to use another fire suppression bottle. But by this time, the aircraft stall alarm is activated and the aircraft's tail hits the water. All the passengers wake up, and realizing what is happening, most panic.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. You are given a new situation: Jimmy is currently shopping at his local grocery store during his weekly trip to get food and other necessities. He first picks up some frozen pizzas, his favorite meal when he is feeling lazy after work, and then stops off to pick up a loaf of bread. He then walks over to the dairy section to pick up some cheese for his lunches. Jimmy never buys milk, but today he has a sudden urge to get some. He walks over to the milk refrigerators and looks at all the options. He is currently debating between two brands, Luchene and Jean's. While trying to decide, he notices a sticker on the Luchene gallon that says \\"organic,\\" but is unable to find any such indication on the gallon of Jean's milk. After asking an employee, it is confirmed that Jean's is not organic milk. Unable to make up his mind, Jimmy simply leaves without buying any milk.  and a hint : Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).  Please answer this question : The farm of which brand of milk has a higher crop yield per hectare? A:","output":"Based on the information provided, it is not possible to definitively determine which brand of milk, Luchene or Jean's, has a higher crop yield per hectare. However, we can infer that since Luchene is organic and organic milk production tends to have lower crop yields per hectare compared to conventional milk production (due to decreased utilization of pesticides and fertilizers), it is likely that Jean's, the non-organic brand, might have a higher crop yield per hectare."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Title: not pleased Product review: bought this for a cross draw. holster is a little bulky. the draw is stiff and catchy with no tension adjustment. going back the shoulder setup. would not recommend. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? The answer is:","output":"The review provided for the product depicts it in an unflattering light. This conclusion is drawn based on an analysis of the different aspects mentioned by the reviewer and their overall dissatisfaction with their purchase. Firstly, the reviewer indicates that the purchased item's intended purpose was for a cross draw, which implies that the product in question is a holster for firearms. However, their experience with the holster turned out to be unsatisfactory, leading to several points of criticism. One of the main concerns expressed in the review is the holster's overall bulkiness. This characteristic is unfavorable, as an ideal holster should be comfortable and streamlined to allow smooth, unobstructed movement while carrying a firearm. A bulky holster, on the other hand, may cause discomfort, draw attention, or hinder activities, particularly when worn for extended periods or during physical exertion. Another issue highlighted by the reviewer is the stiffness and \\"catchy\\" nature of the draw. Ideally, a holster should enable the wearer to efficiently and quickly draw the weapon in a smooth motion, which is a crucial factor during emergencies or self-defense situations. The lack of a tension adjustment feature further exacerbates this problem, as it prevents the user from customizing the fit of the holster to their specific preferences. This flaw is particularly significant, as firearms users often seek holsters that provide a tailored carrying option in terms of retention and ease of access. Lastly, the reviewer's decision to revert back to a shoulder setup is a clear indication of their disappointment with the product. This choice suggests that they found the holster's performance to be suboptimal compared to their previous setup, rendering it unsuitable for their needs. Moreover, the reviewer explicitly states their negative recommendation, which is a direct indication of their dissatisfaction with the product. Considering these points, it is evident that the provided product review portrays the holster in an unflattering light, highlighting its shortcomings rather than endorsing its features or performance. Potential customers encountering this review may be inclined to explore alternative options, as the expressed dissatisfaction could reasonably discourage them from purchasing the product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Group A presented gemline mutations, while group B presented somatic mutations. He was fascinated by these organisms.  But I can use this background: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.  What is an answer for this question: Which group had more organisms having mutations that can be passed to the next generation? A:","output":"To answer this question, let's examine the two groups and their types of mutations: - Group A presented germline mutations, which occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and can be passed to the next generation. - Group B presented somatic mutations, which occur in somatic or body cells, and cannot be passed to the next generation.

To determine the difference in length between his longest and second longest field goals, first identify the longest and second longest field goals. The longest field goal Stover made in the game was from 43 yards, while his second longest was from 28 yards. To find the difference in length, subtract the distance of the second longest field goal from the distance of the longest field goal: 43 yards (longest field goal) - 28 yards (second longest field goal) = 15 yards So, Matt Stover's longest field goal was 15 yards longer than his second longest field goal during the game against the Arizona Cardinals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Some learned to survive within her harsh burning grip. Some even learned to thrive in her, building stone monuments to themselves and living their lives surrounded in the lavish luxuries of Gods. How puny their monuments were compared to the desert herself. Where they had castles surrounded by dry moats, the desert had mountains surrounded by thousand year sandstorms. Where they had silks and the most beautiful slaves serving their every greatest desire, she had dunes that stretched for a thousand leagues and a sun that burned huge and deep crimson in the violet sky. Where desert kings, the Danken, dined on the finest food and drank the finest wine, the desert drank every drop of water from the air itself and feasted on men. Kadin knew the desert. He knew her voice whispering in the dark of night like a dangerous lover. The sound he heard now was not her voice but a cry from one trapped within the desert's teeth. It was the cry of a woman. Kadin rose from his makeshift bed in the dip of two dunes. He stood quickly, tying the leather straps of his knife belt around his waist. He pulled on his boots and silently mounted White Ash. THe mare felt his soft touch and made no sound. Kadin listened and heard the cry again. He studied the dunes in the darkness of night. THe blood moon painted the desert a deep red. He felt the echos and turned White Ash towards their origin. He rode quietly into the night. Kadin saw the glow of torchlight long before cresting the hill. He guessed four riders from the sound of their horses and confirmed it when he rose above them. Three men, now on foot, chased a woman in black across the dune. Their horses stood back, panting from a hard ride. The woman's own stallion lay dead, a black arrow buried in its flank. Kadin must make a decision about: Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. Whether to build a castle in the desert.  B. Whether or not to sell his horse White Ash.  C. Whether or not to help the woman.  D. not enough information A:","output":"C. Whether or not to help the woman. Justification: In the given situation, Kadin is observing a woman in distress being chased by three men. Based on the context, it is clear that Kadin must decide whether to intervene and help the woman. Building a castle in the desert (option A) is not relevant to the current situation, selling his horse White Ash (option B) is not connected with the events, and there is sufficient information for him to make a decision (thus eliminating option D).

The reviewer also appreciates its value for money, stating that it achieves a similar functionality to a more expensive alternative at a much lower cost. However, there are a few negative points mentioned by the reviewer. The first one is the large size of the product, which may not suit those who prefer more compact and light options. The second issue is the difficulty in keeping the product in place on its mount, which can be problematic in certain scenarios, such as during an off-road activity where the product could be knocked off its mount by tree branches.

Write a summary based on this article: Photos: Getty and AP      Peter Thiel,      Nearly a decade ago, after you had opened up to friends and colleagues, a gay writer for Gawker shared an item with the readers of Valleywag, a section for news and gossip about the rich and powerful of Silicon Valley. “Peter Thiel, the smartest VC in the world, is gay,” wrote Owen Thomas. “More power to him.”      And more power did indeed come to you. Your investments in Facebook and other companies have given you a net worth of more than 2 billion. You have tapped some of that fortune to support gay groups such as HomoCon. It is now clear that gay people are everywhere, not just in industries such as entertainment, but at the pinnacles of Silicon Valley power.      I thought we had all moved on, not realizing that, for someone who aspires to immortality, nine years may not be such a long time as it seems to most of us. Max Levchin, your fellow founder at Paypal, told me back in 2007 you were concerned about the reaction, not in Silicon Valley, but among investors in your hedge fund from less tolerant places such as Saudi Arabia. He also warned of the retribution you would exact if a story was published about your personal life.      Your revenge has been served well, cold and (until now) anonymously. You admit you have been planning the punishment of Gawker and its writers for years, and that you have so far spent 10 million to fund litigation against the company. Charles Harder, the Hollywood plaintiff’s lawyer who has marshaled your legal campaign, is representing not just the wrestler Hulk Hogan on your behalf, but two other subjects of stories in suits against Gawker and its editorial staff.      You told the New York Times that you are motivated by friends who had their lives ruined by Gawker coverage, and that your funding is a “philanthropic” project to help other “victims” of negative stories. Let us run through a few examples so that people can actually read the articles you find so illegitimate, and make their own judgment about their newsworthiness.      Sean Parker, a partner in your Founders Fund and an early backer of Facebook, is one of the friends who was covered extensively on Gawker’s Valleywag. Those stories, some of them by me, helped define the colorful character played by Justin Timberlake in The Social Network, the David Fincher movie about the founding of Facebook. Parker was stung more recently by criticism from his neighbors of the disruption to 10th St. in Manhattan when the street was dug up to get a Fios line to Bacchus House, the famous party venue where Parker had been planning to live. Valleywag covered that story, as well as his lavish and controversial wedding in the redwoods near Big Sur.      Hulk Hogan was the first client represented by Charles Harder in a suit against Gawker. As we now know, the famous wrestler and entertainer sued over snippets of a sex tape apparently in order to shut down reporting of a racist rant against a black man dating his daughter.      Ashley Terrill, also represented by Harder, is suing Gawker for 10 million for defamation. She is a reporter who offered information about the conflict between the founders of two dating apps, Tinder and Bumble, who herself became part of the story after claiming she was being harassed and surveilled by agents of Tinder co-founder Whitney Wolfe.      Shiva Ayyadurai is a Massachusetts entrepreneur who says he invented email—about a decade after email was actually invented. A story on Gizmodo, Gawker’s tech property, said straight out that his claims were false, as did the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times. Represented also by the lawyer you hired, Ayyadurai is suing Gawker for 35 million for defamation, though not the other news organizations that made the same point.      Peter Thiel—that is, you. Yes, Gawker has often been critical. Our writers have derided your views on female suffrage, mocked the libertarian separatist vision of offshore seasteads free of government interference, and questioned some of the businesses you have backed. There is much more. They don’t find you very likable.      I can see how irritating Gawker would be to you and other figures in the technology industry. For Silicon Valley, the media spotlight is a relatively recent phenomenon. Most executives and venture capitalists are accustomed to dealing with acquiescent trade journalists and a dazzled mainstream media, who will typically play along with embargoes, join in enthusiasm for new products, and hew to the authorized version of a story. They do not have the sophistication, and the thicker skins, of public figures in other older power centers such as New York, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.      And I can see how tempting it would be to use Silicon Valley’s most abundant resource, a vast fortune, against the harsh words of the writers of a small New York media company. We have our devices; you have yours.      Among the million posts published by Gawker and other properties since the company was founded, there have undoubtedly been occasions we overstepped the line. In offsetting the fawning coverage of tech luminaries and others, sometimes our stories swing too far for my taste toward snark.      But this vindictive decade-long campaign is quite out of proportion to the hurt you claim. Your plaintiff’s lawyer, Charles Harder, has sued not just the company, but individual journalists.      A.J. Daulerio, author of the 2012 story on Hulk Hogan, is out of work and unable to pay the 100,000 in punitive damages awarded by the jury. In the Ayyadurai and Terrill complaints, Harder cynically paints author Sam Biddle as an abuser of narcotics, basing this claim on Biddle’s own writing about his struggle with anxiety and depression, and the physician-prescribed medication he takes to treat his mood disorders. John Cook, our executive editor, is accused of negligent hiring and retention.      Peter, this is twisted. Even were you to succeed in bankrupting Gawker Media, the writers you dislike, and me, just think what it will mean.      The world is already uncomfortable with the unaccountable power of the billionaire class, the accumulation of wealth in Silicon Valley, and technology’s influence over the media.      You are a board member of Facebook, which is under congressional investigation after our site Gizmodo reported on the opaque and potentially biased way it decides what news sources are seen by its billions of users.      Now you show yourself as a thin-skinned billionaire who, despite all the success and public recognition that a person could dream of, seethes over criticism and plots behind the scenes to tie up his opponents in litigation he can afford better than they.      You were the basis for the affectless venture capitalist in the HBO show, Silicon Valley; with this diabolical decade-long scheme for revenge, you are redefining yourself as a comic-book villain.      This story will play out in the press and the courts. Both are adversarial forums, in which each side selects facts and quotes to undermine the reputation and credibility of the other. We are confident of our arguments on the newsworthiness of our Hogan story, once it reaches the appeals court. Your main proxy, Hulk Hogan, has his.            We, and those you have sent into battle against us, have been stripped naked, our texts, online chats and finances revealed through the press and the courts; in the next phase, you too will be subject to a dose of transparency. However philanthropic your intention, and careful the planning, the details of your involvement will be gruesome.      I’m going to suggest an alternative approach. The best regulation for speech, in a free society, is more speech. We each claim to respect independent journalism, and liberty. We each have criticisms of the other’s methods and objectives. Now you have revealed yourself, let us have an open and public debate.      The court cases will proceed as long as you fund them. And I am sure the war of headlines will continue. But, even if we put down weapons just for a brief truce, let us have a more constructive exchange.      We can hold the discussion in person with a moderator of your choosing, in front of an audience, under the auspices of the Committee to Protect Journalists, or in a written discussion on some neutral platform such as Medium. Just tell me where and when.      At the very least, it will improve public understanding of the interplay of media and power. Considering the amount spent on lawyers, 20 million between us at this point, there should be some public benefit.      In the meantime, here are some more pointed and immediate questions. ||||| Billionaire investor Peter Thiel has admitted to secretly funding wrestler Hulk Hogan's lawsuit against Gawker Media. In an interview with The New York Times, Thiel called the suit “one of my greater philanthropic things that I’ve done.\\"      The news raises thorny questions about litigation financing and whether wealthy individuals ought to be able to use our court systems as a tool for revenge. (The site revealed in 2007 that Thiel is gay.) But what makes the situation even more complicated is the fact that Thiel sits on the board at Facebook.      In recent weeks, the social network faced accusations that it intentionally suppresses conservative news in its Trending Topics feature. Following its own internal investigation and a Senate inquiry, Facebook denied that any such bias exists.      Still, the Trending Topics debacle forced the American public to wake up to the fact that, for better or worse, Facebook plays an outsized role in the news they read everyday. Over the last few weeks, the company has scrambled to restore trust among its users, even inviting prominent conservatives to meet with CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Thiel, a known libertarian and Republican donor. Facebook subsequently updated its guidelines on Trending Topics and has renewed its vow to wield its power responsibly.      In the end, Facebook seemed to have escaped from that controversy relatively unscathed. The last thing the company now needs is a board member—a powerful one at that—funding revenge lawsuits against news outlets he believes have done him wrong.      To be clear, none of this is to say that Thiel has any direct influence over what does or does not appear on Facebook. The issue is not even whether lawsuits paid for by third parties are appropriate. The issue is whether it's appropriate for someone who sits atop a company that claims to be a bastion for free speech to fund such lawsuits.      Is Facebook a platform that protects free speech, regardless of ideology or personal vendettas?      For critics who doubt Facebook's motives, Thiel's actions may look like yet another example of how the company has failed to acknowledge its position as perhaps the most powerful media outlet in the world. That position comes with certain ethical obligations, which include avoiding conflicts of interest at all costs. It's hard to imagine a bigger conflict than spending 10 million to put a company out of business that depends on Facebook for survival.      Complicating matters even further is the recent news that Thiel is a pledged delegate for presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, another litigious billionaire. Among his campaign promises, Trump has said he would \\"open up our libel laws\\" if he becomes president to make it easier to sue media outlets.      Neither Facebook nor Thiel responded to WIRED's requests for comment.      At the heart of both the Thiel controversy and the Trending Topics debate is the issue of free speech, and whether Facebook is in fact a platform that protects free speech, regardless of ideology or personal vendettas. We're entering an age in which new media companies are becoming more powerful than the traditional gatekeepers they wanted to unseat—but much less aware of the responsibilities that come with the power of the press. |||||","output":"This story talks about someone named Peter Thiel, who is very rich and famous. About ten years ago, a news website called Gawker shared information about his personal life, which made him unhappy.

Negev Desert: This is a desert in southern Israel that covers over half of the country's total land area. This desert is categorized as an arid desert. Its climate is typical of an arid desert, with hot summers and cool winters. The Negev contains numerous interesting geological features, including Ramon Crater (Makhtesh Ramon), a unique type of crater formed by erosion, rather than an impact or a volcanic eruption. Despite its arid conditions, the Negev Desert is also home to a number of communities, primarily consisted of people from Bedouin tribes. In terms of flora and fauna, the desert houses various species adapted to the desert climate, such as leopards, hyenas, and Ibex. 2. Atacama Desert: Known as the driest desert in the world, the Atacama Desert is located in northern Chile, stretching 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) from the southern tip of Peru to Chile's central Pacific coast. It’s a virtually rainless plateau made up of salt basins (salares), sand, and lava flows. This desert is so arid that many mountains higher than 20,000 feet are totally free of glaciers. Only the Cordillera de Domeyko, a range of high mountains to the east, sees significant snow. Despite its harsh environment, the Atacama Desert contains various plant species like llareta and cacti. It also hosts wildlife like flamingoes, vicunas, and chinchillas. Interestingly, it’s stark, Martian-like landscapes have made it an ideal location for shooting movies or conducting research for Mars missions. 3. Namib Desert: Recognized as one of the oldest deserts in the world, the Namib Desert spans an area of around 81,000 square kilometers and stretches along the Atlantic coasts of Angola, Namibia, and South Africa. It is distinguished by its iconic red sand dunes, some of the tallest in the world, and barren gravel plains. Due to fog rolling in from the cold Atlantic Ocean, the Namib Desert is not entirely rainless, unlike the Atacama. The mist serves as a vital source of moisture for the desert's unique ecosystem, supporting a notable array of endemic, desert-adapted plants, and animals, like the Welwitschia plant and desert elephants.  In conclusion, while all three - Negev, Atacama, and Namib - are deserts, each features a unique combination of geological, climatic, and biological characteristics that distinguish them from one another. Whether it's the arid Negev with its erosion-formed craters, the hyper-arid Atacama with its salt flats and \\"Martian\\" landscapes, or the ancient Namib with its fog-supported ecosystems and massive sand dunes, these deserts are fascinating and diverse examples of adaptation and survival."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the real name of the person who honed the finished songs in collaboration with other writer-producers?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  In 2001, M.I.A. (Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) had worked exclusively in the visual arts. While filming a documentary on Elastica's 2001 tour of the US, she was introduced to the Roland MC-505 sequencer/drum machine by electroclash artist Peaches, whose minimalistic approach to music inspired her. She found Peaches' decision to perform without additional instrumentation to be brave and liberating and felt that it emphasised the artist. Returning to London, she unexpectedly gained access to a 505 owned by her friend, former Elastica singer Justine Frischmann. M.I.A. used the 505 to make demo recordings in her bedroom. She initially planned to work as a producer. To this end, she approached Caribbean girls in clubs to see if they would provide vocals for the songs, but without success. M.I.A. secured a record deal with XL Recordings after Frischmann's manager overheard the demo. M.I.A. began work on the album by composing lyrics and melodies, and she programmed drum beats at home on the drum machine. Having produced rough tracks via trial and error, she honed the finished songs in collaboration with other writer-producers. Through these collaborations, she sought to produce a diverse style and \\"drag [her collaborators] out of their boxes, musically\\".DJ Diplo introduced elements of Brazilian baile funk to \\"Bucky Done Gun\\". Fellow composer-producer Richard X worked on the track \\"Hombre\\", which featured a drum pattern created from the sounds made by toys that M.I.A. had bought in India, augmented with sounds produced by objects such as pens and mobile phones. Steve Mackey and Ross Orton, known professionally as Cavemen, worked on \\"Galang\\", which M.I.A. had initially produced with her 505 and a basic four-track tape recorder. Working with Cavemen in a professional studio, she added a bass line and new vocals to give the song \\"a more analogue sound\\" than was possible with the 505. The track was co-written by Frischmann, whose input M.I.A. described as \\"refreshing\\". She initially hoped to feature guest vocalists on...

Richard \\"Richie\\" Twat and Edward \\"Eddie\\" Elizabeth Ndingombaba run the worst guest house in the United Kingdom. Their staff include a chef, an idiotic drunkard and an illegal immigrant who is unable to cook, and a waiter, whom Richie believes has checked into a psychiatric hospital (Or more likely getting a new job). Both leave because of nonpayment for their employment, with the latter quitting because of the verbal abuse from his boss. The guests, including Mr Johnson, who reside in the pair's hotel are thoroughly dissatisfied by the poor service, and eventually decide to leave, except for Mrs Foxfur who lives there. Life seems bleak for Eddie and Richie, until it seemingly improves with the arrival of the \\"Nice family\\", headed by Mr Nice, and the famous Italian actress Gina Carbonara.  Gina's decision to stay in the grotty house is primarily down to her need to seek safety from her ill-tempered fiancé Gino Bolognese.

Question: Title: Middling Hayworth Review: This WWII story of a musical hall that never quit as the bombs fell is unavoidably a bit sappy, but it's mainly a star vehicle for Hayworth, midway between and with elements of both the pert and plucky ingenue of Cover Girl and the Astaire musicals and the sultry sex symbol of Gilda. She's better at the extremes, but perfectly adequate as actor and dancer in this middle ground. If you've seen samba, you'll find that the one referred to in other reviews is really nothing special; the terrific dance routine, also mentioned elsewhere, is the solo by Marc Platt, itself worth the price of admission.

Does \\"Before the establishment of the Modern Greek state, the link between ancient and modern Greeks was emphasized by the scholars of Greek Enlightenment especially by Rigas Feraios.\\" correctly answer the question of What foundation was laid that is the demographics of Modern Greek Enlightenment Era ?","output":"While the statement \\"Before the establishment of the Modern Greek state, the link between ancient and modern Greeks was emphasized by the scholars of Greek Enlightenment especially by Rigas Feraios\\" provides some information about the efforts of Greek Enlightenment scholars in bridging the gap between ancient and modern Greeks, it does not fully address the question about the foundation laid concerning the demographics of the Modern Greek Enlightenment Era. The Modern Greek Enlightenment Era marked an important cultural, educational, and intellectual movement that spanned from the late 17th century to the 19th century. It served as a precursor to the Greek War of Independence (1821-1830) and played a vital role in shaping the modern Greek identity and nation-state. As part of the wider European Enlightenment movement, it sought to revive the intellectual and cultural aspects of ancient Greece, as well as to inspire national pride and aspirations for self-determination. To better understand the foundation laid in terms of demographics during the Modern Greek Enlightenment Era, it is essential to consider the following aspects: 1. Education and intellectual centers: Across the Eastern Mediterranean and Western Europe, schools and educational establishments, often linked to major cities and ecclesiastical centers, played a significant role in connecting different regions and promoting the exchange of ideas. Cities like Venice, Vienna, Leipzig, and Paris became prominent centers for Greek scholars, while cities like Athens, Ioannina, and Patmos became key players in intellectual advancements within the Ottoman Empire. 2. Diaspora communities: Demographically, the Greek diaspora communities in key European cities like Venice, Vienna, and London provided invaluable support to the spread of Enlightenment principles. Their economic success, cultural engagement, and political lobbying contributed to both the growth of the movement and the convergence of various demographics around Enlightenment ideals. 3. Interaction with European scholars: Greek Enlightenment scholars had ongoing communication and exchanges with European scholars, philosophers, and writers, leading to the broader dissemination and incorporation of Enlightenment ideas into Greek culture and society. This, in turn, influenced the demographics and groups that became interested in and supportive of the Enlightenment, building bridges across previously existing social divides. 4. The clergy’s role: In terms of demographics, the clergy played an essential role in the dissemination and promotion of Enlightenment ideas. As religious leaders and educators, they contributed to the development of the Greek national consciousness and identity, influencing a wide range of societal groups, from the aristocracy to the peasants in rural areas. 5. Secular and religious works: During the Modern Greek Enlightenment, there was a significant increase in the production of both secular and religious works in the vernacular language (Demotic Greek). This made the ideas of the Enlightenment more accessible to a broader audience and offered a vast range of people a connection to the ancient Greek heritage. In conclusion, the foundation laid in terms of demographics during the Modern Greek Enlightenment Era was an intricate network of education and intellectual centers, diaspora communities, exchanges with European scholars, the influential role of the clergy, and the growing accessibility of secular and religious works in the vernacular language. These factors worked together to create diverse participation across different groups in society and helped pave the way for the revival and continuation of Greek culture and the eventual establishment of the Modern Greek state."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Kronos and his companion, the hunchback Hieronymus Grost, are professional vampire hunters. Grost explains to the initially sceptical Marcus that the dead women are victims of a vampire who drains not blood but youth, and that there are \\"as many species of vampire as there are beasts of prey.\\" The discovery of another victim confirms Grost's explanation. Along the way, Kronos and Grost take in a local barefoot girl, Carla, who had been sentenced to the stocks for dancing on the Sabbath. She repays them by helping them hunt the vampire; she later becomes Kronos' lover. Grost and Kronos conduct a mystical test that indicates the presence of vampires. Their findings are contradicted by an eyewitness who claims to have seen \\"someone old, very old\\", whereas a youth-draining vampire should appear youthful. Marcus visits the family of his late friend, Lord Hagen Durward, and speaks with Durward's son, Paul (Shane Briant), and his beautiful sister Sara (Lois Daine). He must leave before speaking with the bed-ridden Lady Durward. While riding through the woods, Marcus encounters a cloaked figure that leaves him shaken, and he finds blood on his lips.

Dead, Sick and Filthy Animals Discovered at PetSmart and Petco Supplier Federal inspectors discovered a gruesome scene at a Pennsylvania small-animal dealer that supplied animals to both Petco and PetSmart. According to The Associated Press, the U.S. Department of Agriculture inspected the Holmes Chinchilla Ranch in January and just released its report about the visit. The report says that several dead animals were found on the premises — which houses thousands of hamsters, guinea pigs, rabbits, chinchillas and more — along with dozens of animals in desperate need of veterinary treatment for aliments like hair loss and eye abnormalities. USDA inspectors, who spent several days at the Barto-based ranch, also found unsanitary conditions throughout the facility and untrained employees performing procedures. The USDA learned of the inhumane conditions at the dealer after receiving a video from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. The video PETA sent includes footage of dead animals, live rats stuffed in plastic bags and stored in a freezer and numerous small animals being dumped in a “waste-filled cooler” and gassed to death. Holmes employees who performed these gassings told inspectors they learned how to euthanize animals online. The USDA's investigation into Holmes remains open, and the dealer claims to be working with the department to resolve any issues. Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service could choose to issue a warning or fine against the dealer, or start the process of revoking the ranch's license. While Holmes remains in operation, the dealer, who has provided animals to both PetSmart and Petco, has suffered severe business losses after the inspection. Petco dropped Holmes as a supplier shortly after the January inspection. PetSmart, who is in hot water after a dog died under the care one of its groomers, refuses to announce if the company is still buying pets from Holmes. “As a standard practice, we do not comment on the status of relationships with our vendors,” Michelle Friedman, PetSmart's vice president of corporate communications, said in a statement. “Nothing is more important to us than the health and safety of pets, and we take any allegation of mistreatment very seriously. We immediately review and thoroughly investigate, taking appropriate steps and corrective actions as needed to ensure our high standards of pet care continue to be met.” Dan Paden, PETA's associate director of evidence analysis, says a Holmes employee told the animal rights group that PetSmart is still receiving animals from the ranch. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Inspectors found many dead and sick animals at a place called Holmes Chinchilla Ranch, which gave animals to big stores like Petco and PetSmart. The place was very dirty and not good for the animals, and now some stores stopped using them as a supplier."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The location of that threat, the department said in a bulletin, is \\"particularly in the Middle East and North Africa, and possibly occurring in or emanating from the Arabian Peninsula.\\" As a result, an unprecedented 22 embassies and consulates in 17 countries in the Middle East, North Africa and South Asia closed for a day on Sunday. Sunday is also the 27th day of Ramadan and a particularly holy day for the world's Muslims as it is the \\"Night of Power,\\" when the first verses of the Koran were revealed to the Prophet Mohammed. For al Qaeda, these diplomatic compounds are attractive targets because they symbolize","output":"the power and reach of the United States and its allies. Furthermore, attacking such sites serves multiple purposes for the terrorist group. First, it allows them to demonstrate their operational capabilities and instill fear in the international community. Second, it directly challenges the strength and security measures of targeted countries, undermining the perception of the US and its allies as a global superpower. And third, it advances al Qaeda's overarching goal of sowing chaos and discord on both a regional and international scale.   Al Qaeda has targeted diplomatic facilities in the past, as evidenced by the 1998 bombings of the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which resulted in the deaths of over 200 people. Additionally, the 2012 attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya, in which four Americans were killed, including Ambassador Chris Stevens, remains fresh in the minds of the global community. By exploiting the symbolic significance of these locations, al Qaeda aims to reinforce its extremist narrative and recruit new members from vulnerable populations. The recent alert highlights the ongoing and evolving threats posed by al Qaeda and its affiliates. While the core leadership of al Qaeda has been weakened after the death of Osama bin Laden in 2011 and numerous targeted strikes against high-level operatives, its various regional branches continue to operate, devise new tactics, and foster coordination among different factions. For instance, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) has emerged as one of the most potent branches of the terrorist group, orchestrating numerous attempted attacks against US and Western interests. The \\"Night of Power\\" during Ramadan is an especially significant date in the Islamic calendar, as it is believed to be a night of Divine Decree and forgiveness. The heightened religious symbolism of this day makes it an opportune time for al Qaeda to carry out attacks; not only could such acts potentially resonate with their extremist religious narrative, but they could also capitalize on believers' increased vulnerability during this time, as many engage in prayers and religious reflection. While the closures of the embassies and consulates on Sunday may have represented a practical security measure, it also sends a message to the broader international community about the enduring influence and danger of al Qaeda. Governments and security agencies must continue to work together to counter this threat, adapting to the ever-changing tactics and techniques employed by extremist groups.  This means increased intelligence-sharing among nations, as well as the development of more sophisticated security measures and the fostering of social cohesion through countering extremist narratives in vulnerable communities. The US State Department's travel alert serves as an important reminder that even as we face new challenges and threats around the world, the specter of al Qaeda and similar groups remains very much a reality that requires our collective vigilance and determination to address."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: My piano weighs 1000 pounds so I need at least four people to help me with the heavy lifting. A:","output":"True. A piano, especially a grand or upright one, can easily weigh between 200 to 1000 pounds, or even more in some cases. Therefore, if your piano weighs around 1000 pounds, it would indeed require the collective strength of several individuals to move it safely and efficiently. However, the exact number of people needed would be contingent on their individual strength and lifting capacities.  Many professional moving companies recommend a team of at least four to six individuals to handle such a heavy object. This provides enough manpower not just to lift and move the piano, but also to safely navigate doorways, steps, and any other obstacles that might be encountered during the move.  Besides the actual weight of the piano, there are other factors such as balance and fragility that need to be considered. Pianos are not just heavy, they are also finely tuned instruments that can easily be damaged if not handled with the utmost care. Special equipment often used by professional movers, such as a piano dolly and piano board, can further carry some of the weight and make the process safer and smoother.  Therefore, your statement of requiring at least four people to help with moving your 1000-pound piano aligns with common recommendations and makes perfect sense."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Koma Movie plot: The movie begins with a young woman, who attended a wedding party held in a hotel and became drunk, waking up in one of the hotel rooms; only to realize in horror that her kidney has been surgically removed. Socialite Ching (Angelica Lee), who also attended the party, identified Ling (Karena Lam) as the prime suspect because she found out that Ling was the only stranger presented in the ball room. She is unknown to everyone in the party, even to the hotel staff. During the police investigation, Ching discovers that Ling has been secretly involved with her boyfriend Wai (Andy Hui Chi-On), and this is the very reason why she was in the hotel when the crime was committed. Ling was released uncharged due to insufficient evidence as police believed Ching could be framing her for cheating with her boyfriend.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The group of 21, led by North Lincolnshire farmer David Cundall, is expected to to begin digging at Yangon International Airport. Mr Cundall, who first heard stories of the buried planes in 1996, said: \\"We think we have found them.\\" Scientists and archaeologists including staff from Leeds University will join Mr Cundall on the expedition. Mr Cundall said he hoped to restore any planes found by the team to flying condition in the UK. He believes a large number of brand new Mark XIV Spitfires were buried in wooden crates on the orders of Lord Mountbatten during August and December 1945 as \\"surplus to requirements\\" at the end of World War II, said Mr Cundall. Before flying out to Burma, he said the finds could be on the \\"same level as the Tutankhamun find in Egypt\\". There could be up to 36 buried planes at the end of the airport's runway in Mingaladon and up to 124 aircraft in total, it is thought. Mr Cundall said he expected the search to include three different airfields and to last about six weeks. He said: \\"They'll be in a very good condition.  If they haven't been damaged they should be easily restorable to flying condition.\\" Mr Cundall has been searching for, and digging up, crashed aircraft for 36 years. In 2004, he conducted an electromagnetic survey of the site with the help of Dr Adam Booth, then of the University of Leeds, along with a further ground-penetrating radar survey. Dr Booth, of Imperial College London, is still involved in the search for the planes. The excavation team will also include war veteran Stanley Coombe, from Eastbourne, who responded to Mr Cundall's appeal for witnesses who saw them being buried 68 years ago. Mr Coombe, who is now in his early 90s, was stationed in Burma at the end of World War II and is one of eight eye-witnesses to come forward. It took Mr Cundall a further eight years following the electromagnetic survey, to sign an actual contract to start digging for the planes. The contract allows the dig to go ahead and would see the Burmese government take 50% of the value of aircraft recovered, while Mr Cundall's share will be 30% and his agent 20%. Mr Cundall said: \\"It's about preserving aeroplanes. The Spitfire was a very special aeroplane, it saved our neck in 1940 in the Battle of Britain. \\"Built as a tool of war I am hoping to use them as a tool of friendship to bring Burma and Great Britain closer together.\\" This article was about:","output":"A group of 21 people, led by a farmer named David Cundall, is going to dig at Yangon International Airport.

Question: Fish have fins to move underwater, but can't walk because what? Options:  A. no legs  B. they're stupid  C. scales  D. gills  E. bones Answer:","output":"A. no legs Fish have fins to move underwater, but they can't walk because they don't have legs. Legs are the necessary appendages for walking on land, while fins are adapted for swimming in water. Fish have evolved to live in aquatic environments, and their bodies are designed to suit that purpose.  Fins allow fish to maintain balance, direction, and propulsion in the water. They are made of a bony or cartilaginous framework covered with skin and, often, scales. Fin shapes and positions vary among different species of fish depending on their specific needs for moving through their habitat. In comparison, terrestrial animals like humans, dogs, or birds have limbs with joints and muscles that are adapted for walking, running, or climbing. These limbs, just like fish fins, have evolved to suit the specific needs of the animals within their environment. Option B, stating that fish can't walk because they're stupid, is not in line with common sense as the ability to walk or not walk is not related to the intelligence of the species. Options C, D, and E (scales, gills, and bones) are also not suitable options as they don't directly contribute to the fish's inability to walk on land. Scales are external coverings that protect their body, gills are the respiratory organs for extracting oxygen from water, and bones are part of their skeletal structure, which in the case of fish, do not include legs for walking on land."},{"instruction":"Q: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: This was required reading for a class I took.

Sanger worked with African American leaders and professionals who saw a need for birth control in their communities. In 1929, James H. Hubert, a black social worker and the leader of New York's Urban League, asked Sanger to open a clinic in Harlem. Sanger secured funding from the Julius Rosenwald Fund and opened the clinic, staffed with black doctors, in 1930. The clinic was directed by a 15-member advisory board consisting of black doctors, nurses, clergy, journalists, and social workers. The clinic was publicized in the African-American press as well as in black churches, and it received the approval of W. E. B. Du Bois, the co-founder of the NAACP and the editor of its magazine, The Crisis. Sanger did not tolerate bigotry among her staff, nor would she tolerate any refusal to work within interracial projects. Sanger's work with minorities earned praise from Martin Luther King, Jr., in his 1966 acceptance speech for the Margaret Sanger award.  From 1939 to 1942 Sanger was an honorary delegate of the Birth Control Federation of America, which included a supervisory role--alongside Mary Lasker and Clarence Gamble--in the Negro Project, an effort to deliver birth control to poor black people. Sanger, over the objections of other supervisors, wanted the Negro Project to hire black ministers in leadership roles. To emphasize the benefits of hiring black community leaders to act as spokesmen, she wrote to Gamble:  We should hire three or four colored ministers, preferably with social-service backgrounds, and with engaging personalities. The most successful educational approach to the Negro is through a religious appeal. We don't want the word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population, and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members.  New York University's Margaret Sanger Papers Project says that though the letter would have been meant to avoid the mistaken notion that the Negro Project was a racist campaign, conspiracy theorists have fraudulently attempted to exploit the quotation \\"as evidence she led a calculated effort to reduce the black population against their will\\".  In 1929, Sanger formed the National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control in order to lobby for legislation to overturn restrictions on contraception. That effort failed to achieve success, so Sanger ordered a diaphragm from Japan in 1932, in order to provoke a decisive battle in the courts. The diaphragm was confiscated by the United States government, and Sanger's subsequent legal challenge led to a 1936 court decision which overturned an important provision of the Comstock laws which prohibited physicians from obtaining contraceptives. This court victory motivated the American Medical Association in 1937 to adopt contraception as a normal medical service and a key component of medical school curriculums.  This 1936 contraception court victory was the culmination of Sanger's birth control efforts, and she took the opportunity, now in her late 50s, to move to Tucson, Arizona, intending to play a less critical role in the birth control movement. In spite of her original intentions, she remained active in the movement through the 1950s.  In 1937, Sanger became chairman of the newly formed Birth Control Council of America, and attempted to resolve the schism between the ABCL and the BCCRB. Her efforts were successful, and the two organizations merged in 1939 as the Birth Control Federation of America. Although Sanger continued in the role of president, she no longer wielded the same power as she had in the early years of the movement, and in 1942, more conservative forces within the organization changed the name to Planned Parenthood Federation of America, a name Sanger objected to because she considered it too euphemistic.  In 1948, Sanger helped found the International Committee on Planned Parenthood, which evolved into the International Planned Parenthood Federation in 1952, and soon became the world's largest non-governmental international women's health, family planning and birth control organization. Sanger was the organization's first president and served in that role until she was 80 years old. In the early 1950s, Sanger encouraged philanthropist Katharine McCormick to provide funding for biologist Gregory Pincus to develop the birth control pill which was eventually sold under the name Enovid. Pincus had recruited Dr. John Rock, Harvard gynecologist, to investigate clinical use of progesterone to prevent ovulation. (\\"The Pill\\" (2009). PBS series. Retrieved November 29, 2009.)

Answer: The answer is:","output":"No, based on the given review, it is evident that the user would not recommend this product. Their experience with Pennies by Marcia Muller was underwhelming as they found it difficult to finish even half of the book, which clearly indicates their dissatisfaction with the content. The reviewer points out two significant issues they faced while reading the book: it being slow and a lack of connection or care for the case or the characters involved in the story. A good book, especially a mystery, should ideally engage the reader in its central conflict or case and evoke emotions from them for the characters. Unfortunately, in this instance, these essential elements seem to be missing for the reviewer. Additionally, the reviewer also appears to have had previous positive experiences reading Marcia Muller's works, setting a certain level of expectation for this book that was not met. The phrase \\"Don't make this one a priority\\" further reinforces the reviewer's stance on not recommending Pennies as it suggests that there are better books out there worth investing time into, and this particular one might not be the best choice.

Question: I have a new situation: Two neighboring islands inhabited by thousands of birds each were hit by extreme weather. While Port island experienced wet weather over the past 3 summers, Bank island experienced severe drought, therefore the food supply on the island diminished.  But I can use this background: While the Grants were on the Galápagos, a drought occurred. As a result, fewer seeds were available for finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks could crack open and eat only the smaller seeds. Birds with bigger beaks could crack and eat seeds of all sizes. As a result, many of the small-beaked birds died in the drought. Birds with bigger beaks survived and reproduced (see Figure below ). Within 2 years, the average beak size in the finch population increased. Evolution by natural selection had occurred.  What is an answer for this question: Which island had observed the occurrence of natural selection? Answer:","output":"In the given situation, Bank island experienced a severe drought, leading to a diminished food supply. This scenario is similar to the background information provided, where a drought on the Galápagos Islands led to a decrease in seed availability, and ultimately, natural selection. Birds with bigger beaks were able to survive and reproduce due to their ability to crack and eat seeds of all sizes, whereas birds with smaller beaks were limited to smaller seeds and many died during the drought. As a result, the average beak size in the finch population increased within two years.  Based on the similarities between the Galápagos scenario and the current situation with Bank island, we can conclude that Bank island is the location where the occurrence of natural selection was observed. The extreme weather conditions led to a scarcity in food supply, causing certain bird populations with preferable traits (in this case, bigger beaks) to have a better chance of survival and reproduction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Combine facts and answer this: Are the Catalan Sheepdog and the Can de Palleiro both bred in Spain? Answer:","output":"Yes, both the Catalan Sheepdog and the Can de Palleiro are breeds that originated in Spain. Let's take a closer look at both of these dog breeds: 1. Catalan Sheepdog: The Catalan Sheepdog, also known as Gos d'Atura Català, is a breed that originated in the Catalonia region of Spain. They were initially bred for herding livestock, particularly sheep, and protecting them from predators. This breed is highly intelligent, agile, and energetic, with a strong herding instinct. They have a distinctive shaggy coat, which can come in a variety of colors, including fawn, gray, black, and sable. The Catalan Sheepdog is known for being loyal, hardworking, and incredibly adaptable, making them suitable not only for herding tasks but also as search and rescue dogs, agility dogs, or family pets. 2. Can de Palleiro: The Can de Palleiro is a lesser-known breed that also comes from Spain, specifically from the Galicia region. This breed has been used for centuries as a multipurpose working dog, fulfilling tasks such as herding cattle, guarding properties, and even hunting small game. The Can de Palleiro is a robust and athletic breed, with a dense coat that can range from light to dark brown, with or without white markings. They are intelligent, independent, and adaptable dogs, known for their excellent problem-solving abilities and strong territorial instincts. In summary, both the Catalan Sheepdog and the Can de Palleiro are breeds that were developed in different regions of Spain for different working purposes. However, their intelligence, adaptability, and strong working instincts make them similar in many ways."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Sentence from a movie review: with their memorable and resourceful performances  Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","output":"The sentence provided from the movie review indicates a positive view. Two key words make this clear: \\"memorable\\" and \\"resourceful.\\" The term \\"memorable\\" suggests that the performances in the movie left a significant impact on the reviewer. These might have been emotive, powerfully delivered, or highly individual, making them stand out in the mind of the reviewer. Using \\"memorable\\" to describe a performance often signifies that the reviewer appreciated the acting work, as they were left with a concrete and lasting image of it. The word \\"resourceful\\" is used to indicate that the performances were clever and inventive. This implies that the performance wasn't just competent or perfunctory, it was inspired, imaginative and innovative to the point that it used whatever was at its disposal in a creative or original way to impress the audience. This could mean that the reviewer believed the actors triumphed over any limitations they might have had (like a low budget, poor script, or logistical difficulties), to still deliver a performance that was impressive.  These two terms combined not only suggest a positive reception but a deeply admiring one. Not all good performances are memorable or resourceful. These words indicate that the reviewer felt the actors went beyond the ordinary or expected in their craft. This doesn't necessarily mean the reviewer saw the overall movie positively - they could have had issues with other aspects, such as plot, pacing, cinematography, etc. But in terms of performances specifically, this fragment of the review indicates a positive view.

Movie title: The Fourth Kind Context: Chapman University hosts a televised interview with psychologist Dr. Abigail Tyler (Milla Jovovich/Charlotte Milchard). She tells a story of a close encounter incident at Nome, Alaska, in October 2000. In August 2000, Tyler's husband, Will, is mysteriously murdered one night in his sleep, leaving her to raise their two children, Ashley (Mia Mckenna-Bruce) and Ronnie (Raphael Coleman). Tyler tapes hypnotherapy sessions with three patients who have the same experience: every night a white owl stares at them through their windows. Tyler hypnotizes two of them, and both recount similar terrifying stories of creatures attempting to enter their homes. Tommy Fisher (Corey Johnson), her first patient to go under hypnosis, refuses to admit what he sees and returns home. Later that night, Abbey is called by the police to Tommy's house, where she finds him holding his wife and their two children at gunpoint. He insists that he remembers everything and keeps asking what \\"Zimabu Eter\\" means. Despite Abbey's attempts to get Tommy to put his gun down, he shoots his family and turns the gun on himself. After hearing the similarities in the accounts of nightly occurrences, Abbey suspects these patients may have been victims of a non-human kidnapping. There is evidence that she herself may have been abducted, when an Assistant gives her a tape recorder, which plays her voice and the sound of something with a distorted electronic voice entering her home and attacking her. It speaks in an unknown tongue; Abbey, though, has no memory of it. Dr. Abel Campos (Elias Koteas), a colleague from Anchorage, is suspicious of the claims. Later, Tyler calls upon Dr. Awolowa Odusami (Hakeem Kae-Kazim), a specialist in ancient languages who was a contact of her late husband, to identify the mysterious language on the tape. Odusami identifies it as Sumerian. Another, more willing patient named Scott (Enzo Cilenti) wishes to communicate. He admits that there was no owl and speaks of \\"them\\", but cannot remember anything further, but does say...

Please write a short summary for the following article: Meriam Ibrahim freed again after rearrest at Sudan airport Meriam Ibrahim was detained in Khartoum on Tuesday while trying to leave the country. Photograph: Uncredited/AP A Sudanese Christian woman whose death sentence for apostasy was overturned has been freed again after being detained on accusations of forging travel documents. Eman Abdul-Rahman, the lawyer for 27-year-old Meriam Ibrahim, said she had been released from a police station after foreign diplomats pressed the government to free her. She was detained along with her husband and two small children, one born behind bars, at Khartoum's airport on Tuesday while trying to leave the country with her family. Ibrahim, whose father was Muslim but who was raised by her Christian mother, was convicted of apostasy for marrying a Christian man from southern Sudan in a church ceremony in 2011. As in many Muslim nations, Muslim women in Sudan are prohibited from marrying non-Muslims, though Muslim men can marry outside their faith. By law, children must follow their father's religion. Sudan's penal code forbids Muslims from converting to other religions, a crime punishable by death. The sentence drew international condemnation, with Amnesty International calling it abhorrent. The US state department said it was \\"deeply disturbed\\" by the sentence and called on the Sudanese government to respect religious freedoms. On Monday, Sudan's court of cassation threw out Ibrahim's death sentence and freed her after a presentation by her legal team. Summary:","output":"Meriam Ibrahim, a Sudanese Christian woman who had her apostasy death sentence overturned, has been freed once again after being detained for accusations of forging travel documents.

There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).  - Very Hard Choices is a science - fiction / suspense - mystery novel from Canadian science fiction author Spider Robinson , released in June 2008 . The novel , set in British Columbia , is a sequel to Very Bad Deaths and continues the story of the reclusive telepath known as Smelly .  - The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \\"superntrlis\\": \\"supra\\" \\"above\\" + \\"naturalis\\" \\"natural\\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature.  - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.  - The Canadian titles debate has been ongoing since the presentation to the Canadian House of Commons of the Nickle Resolution in 1917. This resolution marked the earliest attempt to establish a Canadian government policy requesting the sovereign not to grant knighthoods, baronetcies, and peerages to Canadians and set the precedent for later policies restricting Canadians from accepting titles from foreign countries. Dissatisfaction with the British honours system led to the gradual creation of a separate system for Canada.  - Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres. It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \\"speculative literature\\".  - The Rocky Mountains, commonly known as the Rockies, are a major mountain range in western North America. The Rocky Mountains stretch more than from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada, to New Mexico, in the southwestern United States. Within the North American Cordillera, the Rockies are somewhat distinct from the Pacific Coast Ranges and the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada which all lie further to the west.  - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.  - British Columbia (BC) is the westernmost province of Canada, with a population of more than four million people located between the Pacific Ocean and the Rocky Mountains.  British Columbia is also a component of the Pacific Northwest and the Cascadia bioregion, along with the U.S. states of Idaho, Oregon, Washington and Alaska.  - A baronet (or ; abbreviated Bart or Bt) or the rare female equivalent, a baronetess (, or ; abbreviation \\"Btss\\"), is the holder of a baronetcy, a hereditary title awarded by the British Crown. The practice of awarding baronetcies was originally introduced in England in the 14th century and was used by James I of England in 1611 as a means of raising funds.  - The Pacific Northwest (in the United States, commonly abbreviated as PNW), sometimes referred to as Cascadia, is a geographic region in western North America bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the west and loosely, by the Rocky Mountains on the east. Though no agreed boundary exists, a common conception includes the U.S. states of Oregon and Washington and the Canadian province of British Columbia. Broader conceptions reach north into Alaska and Yukon, south into far northern California and east to the Continental Divide, thus including Idaho, Western Montana, and western Wyoming. Narrower conceptions may be limited to the northwestern US or to the coastal areas west of the Cascade and Coast mountains. The variety of definitions can be attributed to partially overlapping commonalities of the region's history, geography, society, and other factors.  - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton.  - Time travel is the concept of movement (such as by a human) between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in time. Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel \\"The Time Machine\\", which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction.  - Spider Robinson (born November 24, 1948) is an American-born Canadian Hugo Award- and Nebula Award-winning science fiction author.  - A knight is a person granted an honorary title of \\"knighthood\\" by a monarch or other political leader for service to the monarch or country, especially in a military capacity. Historically, in Europe, knighthood was conferred upon mounted warriors. During the High Middle Ages, knighthood was considered a class of lower nobility. By the Late Middle Ages, the rank had become associated with the ideals of chivalry, a code of conduct for the perfect courtly Christian warrior. Often, a knight was a vassal who served as a fighter for a lord, with payment in the form of land holdings. The lords trusted the knights, who were skilled in battle on horseback. Since the early modern period, the title of knight is purely honorific, usually bestowed by a monarch, as in the British honours system, often for non-military service to the country. The modern female equivalent in the United Kingdom is Dame.  - Very Bad Deaths (Baen Books, 2004, ISBN 0-7434-8861-X), is a science-fiction/suspense-mystery novel from Canadian science fiction author Spider Robinson. The book was followed in 2008 by a sequel, \\"Very Hard Choices\\". It explores the personal implications of uncontrolled telepathy, social responsibility, and the idea of evolutionary, biological evil, while, as usual, expounds on Spider's own political and social views.  - Baen Books is an American publishing house for science fiction and fantasy. In science fiction, it emphasizes space opera, hard science fiction, and military science fiction. The company was established in 1983 by science fiction publisher and editor Jim Baen. After his death in 2006, he was succeeded as publisher by long-time executive editor Toni Weisskopf.  - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.  - Alaska is a U.S. state located in the northwest extremity of North America. The Canadian administrative divisions of British Columbia and Yukon border the state to the east; its most extreme western part is Attu Island; it has a maritime border with Russia to the west across the Bering Strait. To the north are the Chukchi and Beaufort seasthe southern parts of the Arctic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean lies to the south and southwest. Alaska is the largest state in the United States by area, the 3rd least populous and the least densely populated of the 50 United States. Approximately half of Alaska's residents (the total estimated at 738,432 by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2015) live within the Anchorage metropolitan area. Alaska's economy is dominated by the fishing, natural gas, and oil industries, resources which it has in abundance. Military bases and tourism are also a significant part of the economy.

Turn off all the lights inside the house, open all the windows and the doors. The bird will go toward the light. The correct answer is option 2 because birds tend to be attracted to natural light sources. By turning off all the lights inside the house and opening windows and doors, the bird is likely to fly towards the natural light outside. This method provides the best chance of the bird leaving the house on its own. Option 1 is not as effective because turning on all the lights inside the house creates multiple light sources, which might confuse the bird and make it harder for it to find the exit. Additionally, birds might perceive artificial light as a potential threat, making them less likely to approach those areas. Therefore, it would be more reasonable to turn off the lights and let the bird go towards the natural light outside."},{"instruction":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Write a summary based on this article: As any long distance traveler knows, a journey can be especially unpleasant when motion sickness sets in. But new research holds the promise of putting that queasy, nauseous feeling to an end.      \\"We don't know what currently causes motion sickness,\\" Dr. Qadeer Arshad, the lead researcher from the Department of Medicine at Imperial College London told CBS News. \\"It's thought to be due to a conflict between what the eye perceives as motion and what the ears perceive as motion.\\"      So researchers set out to determine whether suppressing a signal from the inner ear to the brain, via a mild electrical current applied to the scalp, could be effective in alleviating the condition.      First they had to produce the symptoms in a panel of twenty intrepid volunteers.      Each volunteer was strapped into a motorized chair. The chair was rotated and tilted in order to simulate the motions that tend to make people sick on boats or roller coasters.      \\"\\"It can make you very sick, very quickly,\\" said Arshad. And in fact, it did -- all of the volunteers felt sick. They reported the time it took for the symptoms to kick in.      After they recovered, the volunteers wore a cap with electrodes on their heads. One group received treatment with the mild electrical current; then they took a ride in the chair for a second time.      Imperial College London      The result: those who received treatment \\"lasted a significantly longer amount of time before the sickness started to develop,\\" Arshad explained. They also recovered \\"significantly quicker\\" than they had before.      The study, published today in the journal Neurology, shows that a mild electrical current applied to the scalp can dampen responses in an area of the brain that is responsible for processing motion signals, according to a press release from the college. This helps the brain deal with the confusing inputs it receives, and can prevent the problem that causes motion sickness.      Motion sickness can affect almost anyone, with about a third of people experiencing symptoms like dizziness and severe nausea that are hard to bear, the researchers say. There are medications to treat the condition, such as scopolamine or dimenhydrinate (Dramamine), but they can have drawbacks.      \\"The problem with treatments for motion sickness is that the effective ones are usually tablets that also make people drowsy,\\" said Professor Michael Gresty from Imperial College, who collaborated on the study, in a statement. \\"That's all very well if you are on a short journey or a passenger, but what about if you work on a cruise ship and need to deal with motion sickness whilst continuing to work?\\"      In contrast, the research team says the experimental treatment is as effective as the best medication available, with no apparent side effect.      But it will take some time before practical applications are developed. Arshad envisions within five to ten years, people will be able to buy an anti-seasickness device at the drugstore.      \\"We hope it might even integrate with a mobile phone, which would be able to deliver the small amount of electricity required via the headphone jack,\\" said Arshad in a statement. \\"You would temporarily attach small electrodes to your scalp before travelling -- on a cross channel ferry, for example.\\" ||||| The misery of motion sickness could be ended within five to ten years thanks to a new treatment being developed by scientists.      The cause of motion sickness is still a mystery but a popular theory among scientists says it is to do with confusing messages received by our brains from both our ears and eyes, when we are moving.      It is a very common complaint and has the potential to affect all of us, meaning we get a bit queasy on boats or rollercoasters. However, around three in ten people experience hard-to-bear motion sickness symptoms, such as dizziness, severe nausea, cold sweats, and more.      We are confident that within five to ten years people will be able to walk into the chemist and buy an anti-seasickness device. – Dr Qadeer Arshad      Research from Imperial College London, published today (4 September) in the journal Neurology, shows that a mild electrical current applied to the scalp can dampen responses in an area of the brain that is responsible for processing motion signals. Doing this helps the brain reduce the impact of the confusing inputs it is receiving and so prevents the problem that causes the symptoms of motion sickness.      This technique offers a safe and effective intervention that is likely to be available for anyone to buy, in the future.      Dr Qadeer Arshad from the Department of Medicine at Imperial College London led the research. He said: “We are confident that within five to ten years people will be able to walk into the chemist and buy an anti-seasickness device. It may be something like a tens machine that is used for back pain.      \\"We hope it might even integrate with a mobile phone, which would be able to deliver the small amount of electricity required via the headphone jack. In either case, you would temporarily attach small electrodes to your scalp before travelling – on a cross channel ferry, for example.”      Simulating seasickness      In the study, volunteers wore electrodes on their heads for about 10 minutes. They were then asked to sit in a motorised rotating chair that also tilts to simulate the motions that tend to make people sick on boats or rollercoasters. Following the treatment, they were less likely to feel nauseous and they recovered more quickly.      Professor Michael Gresty from Imperial College who collaborated in this study and is a world expert on motion sickness said: “The problem with treatments for motion sickness is that the effective ones are usually tablets that also make people drowsy. That’s all very well if you are on a short journey or a passenger, but what about if you work on a cruise ship and need to deal with motion sickness whilst continuing to work?      “We are really excited about the potential of this new treatment to provide an effective measure to prevent motion sickness with no apparent side effects. The benefits that we saw are very close to the effects we see with the best travel sickness medications available.”      Multiple benefits      The research team are already beginning to talk to partners in industry about developing the device. In particular, there is interest from the military for various aspects of their work. This might include helping people who are remotely controlling drones using a visual interface that can lead to nausea.      Dr Arshad said: “From other studies we also have evidence that stimulating the brain in this way can enhance attention and concentration. This aspect is of great interest to the military and we imagine that other groups such as students and people who spend long periods playing computer games will also want to try it out.      “The currents involved are very small and there is no reason to expect any adverse effects from short term use.”      -      “Electrocortical Therapy for Motion Sickness” by Qadeer Arshad, Niccolo Cerchiai, Usman Goga, Yuliya Nigmatullina, R.

There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school.

UPDATED:. 19:29 EST, 24 September 2013. For many mothers-to-be and bashful husbands, they have been a ritual of pregnancy for decades and regarded as a source of invaluable skills. But the digital age and pressure of time is consigning antenatal classes to online tutorials. A drop in women going to classes - currently attended by less than 25 per cent of mothers - has led to a decision to phase them out but critics are disappointed that the classes are being 'abandoned'. Parenting charity NCT said the move online will put parents at a disadvantage but York Hospital insists the virtual classes will allow expectant mothers to access important information. A hospital is to become the first in the country to replace antenatal lessons. with 'virtual classes' to be watched online. A drop in women going to classes - currently attended by less than 25 per cent of mothers - has led to the decision. All of the same information will be available online with virtual classes filmed at the maternity suite at York Hospital showing its staff and labour rooms. The filmed classes will include learning about relaxation and breathing, the early stages of labour, and explanation of what happens in labour and information about pain relief as well as breast feeding and what can be expected after birth. Midwife Sue Jackson said the films will familiarise the majority of women who are not going to classes with the staff and facilities. She said: 'It should open up the information available to women much more effectively than what we have at the moment. We have to make sure the service is appropriate and is being accessed appropriately.' York Hospital said antenatal classes will still be held for teenage mothers and women giving birth to more than one baby. The filmed classes will include learning about relaxation and breathing and the early stages of labour. They will also include an explanation of what happens in labour and information about pain relief, breast feeding and what can be expected after the birth. Women will continue to see a midwife who will answer any questions and give guidance. But the parenting charity NCT has said it is disappointed antenatal classes were being 'abandoned altogether'. Belinda Phipps, chief executive, said: 'There is currently no evidence to show that online courses are as good as traditional antenatal courses. 'Replacing the courses with an online-only system could put parents at a disadvantage. 'Antenatal education is not just about the transfer of information, but also the support you get from the parents that you meet.' York Hospital said other relevant information to mums will also be available on the site, including information about healthy eating and frequently asked questions.

Please answer the following question: In the cosmic scheme of things, this was relatively minor. But very annoying. I had met a woman. Actually, at 19, she was still a girl. I lived in Pittsburgh. She lived in London, Ontario. She was, to put it bluntly, hotter than hell. On top of that, she’s one of the sweetest, nicest people you were ever going to meet. Needless to say, I was quite smitten, and quickly arranged to spend a week in London with her. When I showed up, she was wearing very interesting pajamas. At least for a few minutes. Unfortunately, my two cats, who had never spent a night in my home without me being there, were, less than impressed when I didn’t show up by 5 PM the day I left, despite having arranged for one of my parents to come over each day to feed them and make sure they had water, etc. Playing with them was optional, but neither would show themselves during that week. Nothing looked amiss on the first floor to Mom or Dad. The food was eaten, the water, apparently drunk, etc. When I got home and went upstairs I found something quite different. There was a trail of toilette paper strewn all over the hallway. My pillow was in the bedroom door and shredded. My alarm clock was on the floor. The power cord had been pulled from the wall and chewed through. There were several…uhmmm… “presents” in the middle of the bed, where they had pulled the sheets back. Some of them were still wet. I figure that trip cost me somewhere in the neighborhood of 1k to repair the damage. So I did what any 24 year old would do when faced with that situation. I cleaned up, went to bed, and went back to London a few weeks later. But I cat proofed the house first. (Yes, they still lived with me for another 12 years before passing away.)

The countrywide conflict of 1911-12 was the culmination of a series of revolts led by Dom Boaventura, the liurai  of the native kingdom of Manufahi. The first lasted from 1894 to 1901, the second from 1907 to 1908. In 1911 Boaventura led an alliance of local kingdoms in the last and most serious revolt against the Portuguese. In February 1912 rebels from one kingdom entered the colonial capital of Dili, killing and burning as they went. They looted Government House and decapitated several Portuguese soldiers and officers. In August, the Portuguese brought in troops from Mozambique and a gunboat from Macau to suppress the revolt. The revolt cost 3,424 Timorese killed and 12,567 wounded, and 289 Portuguese killed and 600 wounded. After 1912 the Portuguese pacification of East Timor was complete. They also ceased to appoint hereditary liurais and the native states went extinct.

Dou's father took action to address her low-grade fever as part of being a caring and responsible parent. When a child has a fever, it is essential to provide comfort and relief, as well as monitor the fever's progression. The fever patch is a non-invasive and convenient method to help manage the symptoms of a fever, and it also works well for children who may have difficulty with medication intake. The option of him being paid to write an Amazon review of the fever patch brand or testing out a new brand of fever patch is less likely, as the primary goal would be to ensure the health and comfort of his child.

Given these facts, what creates compost among the following options: - green manures  - eukyarotes  - haploid plants  - Most plants  - chemical reaction  - peachleaf willow  - some invertebrates  - Decomposition","output":"To create compost, I will go through each option step-by-step and consider which ones are involved in the decomposition of organic matter that leads to the formation of compost. 1. Green manures: Green manures are plants that are grown and then incorporated into the soil to improve its fertility and structure. They contribute to the organic matter in the composting process when they break down and decompose. Therefore, green manures contribute to creating compost. 2. Eukaryotes: Eukaryotes are organisms with complex cells containing a nucleus and organelles. Some eukaryotes, such as fungi and certain protists, play a role in decomposition by breaking down organic matter. So, some eukaryotes are involved in creating compost. 3. Haploid plants: Haploid plants have a single set of chromosomes. Their ploidy level doesn't directly affect the composting process. Therefore, haploid plants are not specifically involved in creating compost. 4. Most plants: Most plants contribute to the composting process by shedding leaves, stems, and other plant parts. When these plant parts decompose, they increase the organic matter in the soil. Therefore, most plants contribute to creating compost. 5. Chemical reactions: Chemical reactions, such as oxidation and hydrolysis, play a significant role in breaking down complex organic compounds into simpler compounds during the decomposition process. Therefore, chemical reactions are involved in creating compost. 6. Peachleaf willow: Peachleaf willow is a specific type of plant. Like most plants, it contributes to the composting process by shedding leaves, stems, and other plant parts. Therefore, peachleaf willow contributes to creating compost. 7. Some invertebrates: Certain invertebrates, such as earthworms and insects, play a crucial role in decomposing organic matter by breaking it down and helping to aerate the soil. Therefore, some invertebrates are involved in creating compost. 8. Decomposition: Decomposition is the natural breakdown of organic matter, which is the core process in creating compost. In conclusion, among the given options, green manures, some eukaryotes, most plants (including peachleaf willow), chemical reactions, and some invertebrates directly contribute to the creation of compost through their involvement in the decomposition process.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Wilhelmus Simon Petrus Fortuijn, known as Pim Fortuyn (Dutch: ['pIm for'toeyn] ( listen); 19 February 1948 - 6 May 2002), was a Dutch politician, civil servant, sociologist, author and professor who formed his own party, Pim Fortuyn List (Lijst Pim Fortuyn or LPF) in 2002. Fortuyn was often regarded as controversial due to his outspoken views about multiculturalism, immigration and Islam in the Netherlands. He called Islam \\"a backward culture\\", and was quoted as saying that if it were legally possible, he would close the borders for Muslim immigrants. He was labelled a far-right populist by his opponents and in the media, but he fiercely rejected this label. In 1992 Fortuyn wrote \\"Aan het volk van Nederland\\" (To the people of the Netherlands), declaring he was the successor to the charismatic but controversial 18th-century Dutch politician Joan Derk van der Capellen tot den Pol. A one-time communist and former member of the social-democratic Labour Party, Fortuyn was elected \\"lijsttrekker\\" of the newly formed Livable Netherlands party by a large majority on 26 November 2001, prior to the Dutch general election of 2002.  On 9 February 2002, he was interviewed by the Volkskrant, a Dutch newspaper (see below). His statements were considered so controversial that the party dismissed him as lijsttrekker the next day. Fortuyn had said that he favoured putting an end to Muslim immigration, if possible and wanted to abolish Article 1 of the Dutch constitution, the equality before the law. Having been rejected by Livable Netherlands, Fortuyn founded his own party Pim Fortuyn List (LPF) on 11 February 2002. Many Livable Netherlands supporters transferred their support to the new party.  Heading the list of the Livable Rotterdam party, a local issues party, he achieved a major victory in the Rotterdam municipal council elections in early March 2002. The new party won about 36% of the seats, making it the largest party in the council. For the first time since the Second World War, the Labour Party was out of power in Rotterdam.  Fortuyn's victory made him the subject of hundreds of interviews during the next three months, and he made many statements about his political ideology. In March he released his book The Mess of Eight Purple Years (De puinhopen van acht jaar Paars), which he used as his political agenda for the upcoming general election. Purple is the colour to indicate a coalition government consisting of left parties (red) and conservative-liberal parties (blue). The Netherlands had been governed by such a coalition for eight years at that time. What else was he known for?","output":"Pim Fortuyn was also known for writing the book \\"Aan het volk van Nederland\\" (To the people of the Netherlands) in 1992, declaring himself as the successor to the charismatic but controversial 18th-century Dutch politician Joan Derk van der Capellen tot den Pol. Additionally, he was known for being a one-time communist and former member of the social-democratic Labour Party.

Here is a premise: Behind him rode the boy and girl Drew had seen in the Tubacca alley, mounted on rangy, nervous horses that had speed in every line of their under-fleshed bodies. Here is a hypothesis: Drew knew they would catch up to him momentarily. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis lies in the context given, as well as the logical progression and assumptions we make from the information provided. Premise: Behind him rode the boy and girl Drew had seen in the Tubacca alley, mounted on rangy, nervous horses that had speed in every line of their under-fleshed bodies. From the premise, we gather the following information: 1. There are three characters involved: Drew, the boy, and the girl. 2. Drew had previously seen the boy and girl in Tubacca alley. 3. The boy and girl are currently riding rangy, nervous horses. 4. The horses have speed in every line of their under-fleshed bodies, suggesting they are fast and agile creatures. Hypothesis: Drew knew they would catch up to him momentarily. The hypothesis includes two components: 1. The boy and girl would catch up to Drew. 2. Drew is aware that they would catch up to him. To determine if the hypothesis is concluded true or not based on the premise, let's analyze what we can logically infer from the premise. 1. The presence of fast and agile horses ridden by the boy and girl provides the likelihood that they can catch up to Drew. However, we don't have any information on Drew's own speed or his current means of transportation. Given only that information, it is plausible that the boy and girl can catch up to Drew, but we cannot be certain. 2. The hypothesis also suggests that Drew knows about the boy and girl catching up to him. We know from the premise that Drew had seen the boy and girl earlier, but there's no indication of whether Drew knows the speed of their horses or if he can estimate how quickly they might catch up to him. We can only assume that Drew has some knowledge about their approach, but we cannot definitively confirm that he knows they would catch up to him momentarily. In conclusion, the hypothesis cannot be stated as certainly true based solely on the premise provided. While the premise suggests that the boy and girl have the potential to catch up to Drew due to their fast horses, the information given does not establish with certainty that they would catch up to him, or whether Drew is aware that they will catch up to him momentarily. Additional information would be necessary to draw a more definitive conclusion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

News article: Terence Moore is an Atlanta-based national sports columnist and commentator. He's a CNN sports contributor and a visiting professor of journalism at Miami University in Ohio. Follow him on his website at Tmooresports.com . The views expressed in this commentary are his own.      (CNN) By adopting a policy that could fine teams for players on the field who don't stand during the National Anthem , the NFL owners have settled on a highly questionable approach to the issue that President Donald Trump used as a battering ram against the league. And they failed to seize on a much better policy that would have taken the issue off the table.      The NFL has spent months agonizing over players refusing to stand during the National Anthem, but solutions were everywhere. Instead, the league's owners ignored the best one on Wednesday to worsen an issue that Trump used last season to help tweet the league into controversy      When those NFL owners began their yearly spring meetings on Monday in Atlanta, after months of criticism over their league's handling of protests by players during the National Anthem to highlight social injustice, they discussed everything from assessing 15-yard penalties while fining players for kneeling during \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" to creating a wild, wild West approach by allowing all 32 teams to make their own rules.      By Wednesday, they'd lost their minds -- or possibly just panicked -- and agreed unanimously to give players and others associated with NFL franchises the option of remaining in their locker room for the anthem. Those owners added that, if players and others choose to take the field for the playing of the National Anthem, they can't sit or kneel or do anything else that doesn't involve standing -- or else.      Or else what? In its statement, the NFL left that part totally unclear. According to the new policy , players and other franchise people who don't \\"show respect\\" during the National Anthem will cause their team to get fined.      How much is the fine, and what do the owners mean when they say you must \\"show respect\\"? And why did the players union leadership proclaim during a statement that it would \\"challenge any aspect\\" of the new policy \\"that is inconsistent with the collective bargaining agreement\\"?      Nothing NFL owners did Wednesday will make those legal matters (or any others on the horizon from players) go away. In addition, there is little incentive under this new policy for a player with deep convictions not to kneel or to sit anyway during the National Anthem.      Whatever the fine, the players won't have to pay it, and NFL owners aren't exactly in soup lines. The league just approved the sale of the Carolina Panthers to hedge-fund manager David Tepper for a record 2.27 billion , and he's paying most of it in cash.      I'm guessing the players association will discover more than a few things with this new policy that don't jibe with the last collective bargaining agreement , signed in August 2011.      As for the biggest one, the owners didn't consult with the players before unilaterally deciding to do something that likely violates the First Amendment rights of the NFL's most important employees -- the players, the same players that these same owners tried to silence by throwing a few bucks at a few of their favorite social causes here and there (more on that below).      The NFL's old policy regarding the National Anthem also was nothing worth mentioning, either -- something along the lines that the NFL would encourage players to stand during the National Anthem. That was opposed to requiring them to do so, which meant that old policy gave quarterback Colin Kaepernick, safety Eric Reid and a slew of other players the right to do what they've done for two seasons.      While Kaepernick is out of the league, the players he inspired continued to use their kneeling and sitting to protest social injustice across the country directed toward African-American males in particular.      Thus the nasty tweets and curse words from President Donald Trump. The protests may also have contributed to the nearly 10% drop in TV viewership      Near the end of last season, NFL officials puffed out their chests after they announced they would give the players 89 million for causes supporting the end to social injustice, but a couple of things here: That's nothing for a league that was projected to make 14 billion in 2017, and the players weren't falling for the football in the tailpipe.      About those players: They're mostly seething over the NFL's new policy, and Kaepernick and Reid are the epitome of why Wednesday's action won't solve much. They both played for the San Francisco 49ers, and Kaepernick was so effective that he took the team as quarterback to the Super Bowl after the 2012 season. Reid was a standout defensive player, and he joins Kaepernick these days as a free agent. Neither has gotten a serious call from another NFL team, and they are suing the league for alleged collusion.      Sorry, NFL owners. You were clueless during your spring meetings (beyond letting Tepper join your billionaire club and a few other minor improvements). The solution to your controversy involving players kneeling during the National Anthem wasn't difficult, and you blew it.      Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook      A simple answer.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) (Associated Press)      WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump says the NFL is \\"doing the right thing\\" with a policy banning kneeling during the national anthem.      Trump spoke to \\"Fox & Friends\\" in an interview airing Thursday. The policy forbids players from sitting or taking a knee on the field during the anthem but allows them to stay in the locker room. Any violations of the new rules would result in fines against teams.      Trump says he doesn't \\"think people should be standing in locker rooms,\\" but he praised the plan overall.      He says, \\"You have to stand proudly for the national anthem. Or you shouldn't be playing, you shouldn't be there, maybe you shouldn't be in the country.\\"      Trump criticized players kneeling during the anthem during a rally last fall. ||||| ATLANTA — Despite the NFL’s approval of a revised policy that requires players on the field to stand during the national anthem, Jets chairman Christopher Johnson told Newsday on Wednesday that his players are free to take a knee or perform some other protest without fear of repercussion from the team.      League owners unanimously adopted a policy that allows players who don’t want to participate in the anthem to remain in the locker room. Players who do appear on the field for the anthem must stand; if they don’t, their respective club faces a league-issued fine and teams can levy additional fines.      “I do not like imposing any club-specific rules,” Johnson said. “If somebody [on the Jets] takes a knee, that fine will be borne by the organization, by me, not the players. I never want to put restrictions on the speech of our players. Do I prefer that they stand? Of course. But I understand if they felt the need to protest. There are some big, complicated issues that we’re all struggling with, and our players are on the front lines. I don’t want to come down on them like a ton of bricks, and I won’t. There will be no club fines or suspensions or any sort of repercussions. If the team gets fined, that’s just something I’ll have to bear.”      Johnson has been highly critical of the possibility that owners would require players to stand. During the owners meetings in Orlando in March, Johnson told reporters he didn’t feel a change in protocol was necessary. “I know there’s some discussion of keeping players off the field until after the anthem. I think that’s a particularly bad idea . . . I just think that trying to forcibly get the players to shut up is a fantastically bad idea.”      No Jets players took a knee last season. Instead, the players, coaches and Johnson locked arms during the playing of the anthem. Johnson also has worked closely with several Jets players, as well as former linebacker Demario Davis, who now plays with the Saints, to promote social justice and criminal reform issues. He wants that work to continue and will speak with players and coaches in the coming days to make sure the new workplace guidelines don’t interfere with that mission.      “I seriously struggled with this,” he said of the anthem modifications approved by the owners. “You know my position on the anthem, and you have to understand that the plan we ended up with, due to some serious work in the [meeting] room, was vastly less onerous than the one that was presented to me late last week. In the end, I felt I had to support it from a membership standpoint.”      The fact that Johnson will pay any fines out of his own pocket and not sanction any players who may want to demonstrate during the anthem made it more palatable that he join his fellow owners in approving the anthem protocol.      “Even without those fines, this is going to be tough on the players, and I want a chance to speak with the coaches and other players to get feedback on this policy and to build on the good work and momentum that we have built up on these issues of social justice, on legislation, and all the things that we can do,” he said. “I don’t think that this policy will interfere with that at all.

However, if they choose to be on the field during the anthem, they must stand, and any sign of disrespect will result in the player's team getting fined.

Given the following passage  \\"The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \\"favoured races\\" as \\"perfected races\\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Clémence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until a translation by Edmond Barbier was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860. By 1864, additional translations had appeared in Italian and Russian.

Stimulants can lead both humans and rats to overestimate time intervals, while depressants can have the opposite effect. The level of activity in the brain of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and norepinephrine may be the reason for this. Such chemicals will either excite or inhibit the firing of neurons in the brain, with a greater firing rate allowing the brain to register the occurrence of more events within a given interval (speed up time) and a decreased firing rate reducing the brain's capacity to distinguish events occurring within a given interval (slow down time). Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\"): The level of what is the reason stimulants and depressants change human perceptions of time?","output":"The level of activity of neurotransmitters in the brain, such as dopamine and norepinephrine, is the reason stimulants and depressants change human perceptions of time. These neurotransmitters play a significant role in modulating the firing of neurons, which in turn affects how the brain perceives and processes the passage of time.  When there is an increased level of activity of these neurotransmitters due to stimulants, the firing rate of neurons is enhanced, leading to a perception of time speeding up. This heightened neuronal activity allows the brain to register and process more events within a given time interval, giving the impression that time is passing faster than usual. On the other hand, depressants decrease the level of activity of these neurotransmitters, which results in a reduced firing rate of neurons. This lower firing rate hampers the brain's ability to distinguish between events occurring within a given time interval, consequently creating a sensation of time slowing down. In summary, the activity level of neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine is the primary reason behind the altered perception of time when under the influence of stimulants and depressants. These chemicals modulate the firing of neurons in the brain, which in turn affects how we perceive and process the passage of time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Most were from London airports - Luton, Stansted, Gatwick and Heathrow. The BBC analysed Civil Aviation Authority data from 25 airports. The figures do not cover flights that were cancelled. Gatwick had the biggest proportion of flights delayed by 30 minutes or more, with almost a third of all international departures affected. BBC England's data unit found: Radio presenter Steve Power was flying on a British Airways flight from Gatwick to Limoges in France last week that was delayed by almost three hours. He said: \\"It's the total lack of information as to why there is a delay. So many social platforms and nothing but estimated time of departure updated. Other passengers were equally in the dark and shared the exasperation over the lack of detailed information. \\"Surely in these days of social media platforms a little more transparency would go a long way in raising passenger confidence in the service.\\" Under EU law, you have the right to claim compensation if your flight arrives at its destination over three hours late. EU law covers flights departing from or arriving to an EU country. You can claim compensation if the delay was the fault of the airline, such as aircraft problems or flight crew being unavailable, according to the Civil Aviation Authority. However, delays caused by extreme weather, airport or air traffic control employee strikes, airport closures or other extraordinary circumstances are not eligible for compensation. Even if you cannot claim compensation, your airline must provide you with care and assistance. Care and assistance include a reasonable amount of food and drink and accommodation if delayed overnight, as well as transport to and from the accommodation. If you end up paying for any of the above yourself, the CAA recommends keeping every receipt and not spending more than is reasonable. Advice on claiming compensation and a standard letter are available on the CAA website. A spokesman for Gatwick said the airport would continue to do everything possible to prevent delays occurring. \\"Repeated strike action on the continent over recent years and heavily congested airspace above parts of Europe and London, have led to a significant increase in the number of delays caused by wider air traffic control issues outside Gatwick's control,\\" he added. \\"Gatwick has more flights to Europe than any UK airport and is impacted disproportionately by events on the continent.\\" A spokesperson for Belfast International Airport said: \\"We do all we can to minimise delays. \\"Our on-time performance is generally very good but sometimes we, too, fall victim to things that are outside our control. \\"There is congested airspace in London and across Europe and it is clear there is a need to make improvements in aviation infrastructure.\\" Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"Between June and September 2016, around 38,000 out of 199,000 daily international flights experienced delays.

However, now it seems that smart. seals have caught on to the trick and are using it to their advantage to catch fish! To find out if that is true, a team of researchers from the University of St. Andrews in Scotland selected a group often young grey seals that had neither encountered the ocean nor been exposed to any kind of acoustic tags. The researchers then placed the seals one at a time, inside a pool that contained 20 foraging boxes, only two of which housed fish -- one with tags and the other without. Each seal was allowed to explore the boxes twenty separate times. In order to ensure that mammal was not depending on its memory, the fish were moved to different boxes each time. At first, there was no difference in the amount of time it took the seals to discover the tagged and untagged fish. However, after they had been in the pool a few times, they started locating the tagged fish much faster. To confirm that this indeed was the case, there searchers conducted a second experiment using two boxes -- one with pieces of fish and the other with just acoustic tags. Sure enough, the seals were all attracted to the one that was sending out signals. While this experiment involved only seals, the researchers believe that other marine mammals may also be using the information to catch prey. Sadly, predators like sharks that have been tagged by scientists may be negatively affected, as pings they emit could warn their prey of their presence. Besides potentially messing up nature's food chain, the \\"dinner bell\\" effect of the acoustic tags could also mean that the conclusions reached by previous fish studies may not be correct. Now that the secret is out, scientists will have to come up with another way to conduct their studies -- one that is not detectable by the crafty marine animals.

Please write a short summary for the following article: SpaceX's Rockets Are On A Roll Just under a month after SpaceX finally managed to land the first stage of a Falcon 9 rocket on a floating drone ship, Elon Musk’s space company has done it again. And this time, it landed its rocket under tougher conditions. The rocket was tasked with launching a Japanese communications satellite, JCSAT-14. After launch, the second stage of the Falcon 9 continued its journey up to geosynchronous orbit, while the first stage headed back down to the Of Course I Still Love You ship, which was waiting in the Atlantic. Compared with the April descent, this time the first stage was coming in faster and heating up more. This was because it had to take its payload higher —the first payload was only going up to the International Space Station, which has an altitude of around 250 miles, but this time it was sending a satellite around 22,000 miles up. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. Rocket reentry is a lot faster and hotter than last time, so odds of making it are maybe even, but we should learn a lot either way — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 6, 2016 SpaceX’s own commentators on the livestream of the attempt did not expect a successful landing. But it made it back. This wasn’t the same rocket stage that landed in April—SpaceX intends to relaunch that one later this year. Being able to reuse rockets is the primary point of this exercise; it would drastically lower the cost of sending stuff into space. The company made its first successful first-stage landing in December at Cape Canaveral (from which the latest launch took place). The option of sea landings is useful, though, as those rocket stages may not have enough fuel to take them back to where they took off. SpaceX said in March that it intended to ramp up its tests. It will help that it now has three first stages that made it back in one piece. May need to increase size of rocket storage hangar — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 6, 2016","output":"SpaceX has successfully landed a second rocket, this time under more difficult conditions. The first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket launched a Japanese communications satellite before coming in faster and heating up more due to taking its payload higher, however, it still landed successfully on the drone ship.

The Czech language is a West Slavic language spoken by over 10 million people, mainly in the Czech Republic, where it is the official language. It is closely related to the Slovak language and has many similarities with other Slavic languages such as Polish and Sorbian. The phrase \\"Hodně cestování\\" can be translated to \\"A lot of traveling\\" or \\"Happy travels\\" in English. The word \\"Hodně\\" means \\"a lot\\" or \\"much,\\" while the word \\"cestování\\" means \\"traveling\\" or \\"journey.\\" So the phrase is wishing someone a good time while traveling or emphasizing that a person travels a lot. The Czech language has its roots in the Proto-Slavic language, which developed around the 5th to 6th centuries AD. The modern form of the language has evolved over time and is now written using the Latin alphabet system with several special characters, such as diacritics (ě, š, č, ř, ž, ý, á, í, é, ú, ů, ó), which indicate different pronunciation.  In contemporary times, the Czech language is primarily spoken in the Czech Republic, but it can also be found in nearby countries, such as Slovakia, Poland, Austria, and Ukraine, due to historical, cultural, and political connections. In terms of grammar, Czech is a highly inflected language that features a case system with seven cases (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative, locative, and instrumental), a rich system of declensions for nouns, pronouns, and adjectives, and various verb forms to indicate tense, mood, voice, and aspect. Additionally, Czech's vocabulary has been influenced by Latin, German, and more recently, English. For example, many technical and scientific terms in Czech are borrowed from German or English languages, and these loanwords are integrated into Czech's grammar and pronunciation rules. This results in a language that, while distinct in itself, shares connections and similarities with other regional languages and cultures. In conclusion, the phrase \\"Hodně cestování\\" is in the Czech language, which is a West Slavic language primarily spoken in the Czech Republic. The phrase can be translated to \\"A lot of traveling\\" or \\"Happy travels\\" in English and is an example of the rich and unique linguistic characteristics of the Czech language."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It's like when you play your favorite game, and you continue playing it for hours because it's fun and you don't want to end, even though your fingers might get tired.

Discipline is like when your mommy or daddy reminds you to clean up your toys or finish your vegetables even when you really don’t want to. But you do it because it's the right thing to do. Athletes, like our friend, also need discipline to wake up early, train hard and follow a healthy diet every day so they can become better at their sport. One more skill was determination. Imagine that there's a toy at the top of a high shelf and you want to play with it. Determination is that little voice inside your head that tells you to keep trying to reach the toy even when it seems too high. In races, determination helps the athlete keep going, even when they feel they can't, to reach the finish line.

It's a sign of how rapidly technology develops that my crappy Spectrum, with its 48k of memory, already had 12k more storage power than the computer that had guided the Apollo 11 moon landing eighteen years earlier* With power like that, there seemed to be no limit to what I could do. While my other computer-owning peers would sit for hours while their tape drives squawked away loading 'Manic Miner' or 'Bubble Buster' I was more fascinated by learning to write my own programs. The first of these consisted of just two lines of code* that made the word 'shit' appear again and again on my screen, to the huge amusement of my friends and the irritation of my parents, who obviously had more educational motives for bringing a computer into the house.

The appearance of the Cadurcis family on the limited stage of her life, and the engrossing society of her companion, had entirely distracted the thoughts of Venetia from a subject to which in old days they were constantly recurring, and that was her father. By a process which had often perplexed her, and which she could never succeed in analysing, there had arisen in her mind, without any ostensible agency on the part of her mother which she could distinctly recall, a conviction that this was a topic on which she was never to speak. This idea had once haunted her, and she had seldom found herself alone without almost unconsciously musing over it. Notwithstanding the unvarying kindness of Lady Annabel, she exercised over her child a complete and unquestioned control. Venetia was brought up with strictness, which was only not felt to be severe, because the system was founded on the most entire affection, but, fervent as her love was for her mother, it was equalled by her profound respect, which every word and action of Lady Annabel tended to maintain.  In all the confidential effusions with Plantagenet, Venetia had never dwelt upon this mysterious subject; indeed, in these conversations, when they treated of their real and not ideal life, Venetia was a mere recipient: all that she could communicate, Plantagenet could observe; he it was who avenged himself at these moments for his habitual silence before third persons; it was to Venetia that he poured forth all his soul, and she was never weary of hearing his stories about Morpeth, and all his sorrows, disgusts, and afflictions. There was scarcely an individual in that little town with whom, from his lively narratives, she was not familiar; and it was to her sympathising heart that he confided all his future hopes and prospects, and confessed the strong pride he experienced in being a Cadurcis, which from all others was studiously concealed.

Jerome John Garcia (August 1, 1942 - August 9, 1995) was an American singer-songwriter and guitarist, best known for his work as the lead guitarist and as a vocalist with the band Grateful Dead, which came to prominence during the counterculture era in the 1960s. Although he disavowed the role, Garcia was viewed by many as the leader or \\"spokesman\\" of the group. One of its founders, Garcia performed with the Grateful Dead for their entire thirty-year career (1965-1995). Garcia also founded and participated in a variety of side projects, including the Saunders-Garcia Band (with longtime friend Merl Saunders), the Jerry Garcia Band, Old and in the Way, the Garcia/Grisman acoustic duo, Legion of Mary, and the New Riders of the Purple Sage (which Garcia co-founded with John Dawson and David Nelson). On August 9, 1995, at 4:23 am, eight days after his 53rd birthday, Garcia was found dead in his room at the rehabilitation clinic. The cause of death was a heart attack. Garcia had long struggled with drug addiction, weight problems, sleep apnea, heavy smoking, and diabetes--all of which contributed to his physical decline. Lesh remarked that upon hearing of Garcia's death, \\"I was struck numb; I had lost my oldest surviving friend, my brother.\\" Garcia's funeral was held on August 12, at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church in Belvedere. It was attended by his family, the remaining Grateful Dead members, and their friends, including former basketball player Bill Walton and musician Bob Dylan. Deborah Koons barred Garcia's former wives from the ceremony.  On August 13, approximately 25,000 people attended a municipally sanctioned public memorial at the Polo Fields of San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. Crowds produced hundreds of flowers, gifts, images, and a bagpipe rendition of \\"Amazing Grace\\" in remembrance. In the Haight, a single white rose was reportedly tied to a tree near the Dead's former Ashbury house, where a group of followers gathered to mourn.  On the morning of April 4, 1996, after a total lunar eclipse earlier that day, Weir and Deborah Koons, accompanied by Sanjay Mishra, spread half of Garcia's ashes into the Ganges River at the holy city of Rishikesh, India, a site sacred to Hindus.

Write some highlights for the following article: ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Four people in two states have been arrested as part of an investigation into the Final Exit Network, an organization that police believe helped a Georgia man end his life in June, authorities said Thursday. Claire Blehr, 76, of Georgia, and Thomas E. Goodwin, 63, of Florida and Georgia, were two of the four arrested. John Celmer, 58, lived in Cumming, north of Atlanta. Cumming police, the Forsyth County coroner and the man's relatives all had suspicions that his death was an assisted suicide, and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation  launched an investigation, the agency said in a news release. The GBI on Wednesday set up a sting operation at a residence in adjoining Dawson County, using an undercover agent who had posed as a terminally ill man seeking assistance with his suicide, the statement said. Claire Blehr, 76, of Atlanta, Georgia, and Thomas E. Goodwin, 63, of both Punta Gorda, Florida, and Kennesaw, Georgia, were arrested, the GBI said. Meanwhile, authorities in Baltimore, Maryland, arrested Dr. Lawrence D. Egbert, 81, of Baltimore in connection with the investigation. A second person, Nicholas Alec Sheridan, 60, also of Baltimore, was arrested Wednesday night, GBI spokesman John Bankhead said Thursday. All four face charges of assisted suicide, tampering with evidence and violation of the Georgia's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, the GBI said. The Final Exit Network, based in the north Atlanta suburb of Marietta, identifies itself on its Web site as \\"an all-volunteer organization dedicated to serving people who are suffering from an intolerable condition. Network volunteers offer you counseling, support and even guidance to self-deliverance at a time and place of your choosing, but you always do the choosing. We will never encourage you to hasten your death.\\" Celmer suffered from \\"very, very severe mouth and throat cancer,\\" his 85-year-old mother, Betty Celmer, said from her home in the Buffalo, New York, suburb of East Amherst. \\"They were rebuilding the whole mouth,\\" she said. \\"He was suffering terribly, that I know.\\" She said her son had undergone numerous surgeries and \\"sounded depressed.\\" When he died, she said she had no idea his death might have been a suicide. In a statement released by the GBI, Celmer's widow, Susan, said that she and her family \\"are gratified that the GBI and other law enforcement agencies have pursued this matter vigorously and that their investigation has led to the arrests reported today.\\" She said she will not comment further and requested privacy, referring future questions to her attorneys. An e-mail to Jerry Dincin, a man listed as Final Exit Network's vice president and treasurer on its Web site, was not answered Thursday. A call to Final Exit was answered by a recording. The method used in the suicide was helium inhalation, according to the GBI statement. People pay 50 to join the Final Exit Network, according to the GBI, and complete an application process. They are then visited by an \\"exit guide\\" assigned to the case. \\"During the visitations, the member is instructed to purchase two helium tanks of a specific size and brand and a specific type of hood known as an 'exit bag,' \\" according to the GBI statement. \\"On the day of the event, the member is visited by the 'exit guide' and a 'senior exit guide.' The senior exit guide instructs the member through the process.\\" Goodwin and Blehr were told the GBI agent suffered from pancreatic cancer, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. At the Dawson County residence on Wednesday, Goodwin allegedly walked the undercover agent through the steps and demonstrated how he would hold the agent's hands to stop him from removing the exit bag, Bankhead said. The GBI said that after the death occurs, \\"all evidence is removed from the scene by the 'guides' and discarded, as evidence indicated happened in the Cumming case.\\" Goodwin's former neighbors in Kennesaw told CNN he moved to Florida a few years ago but still owns his large home there and returns to check on it occasionally. Kay Makarenko, 69, who lives behind Goodwin's home, said she was shocked to hear of his arrest. \\"I said, 'It can't be the same Ted Goodwin.' \\" After the arrests Wednesday, authorities in Georgia, Florida, Maryland, Michigan, Ohio, Missouri, Colorado and Montana began executing search warrants and conducting interviews as part of the probe into the Final Exit Network, the GBI said, adding that GBI agents were in each state except Colorado to assist. In Phoenix, Arizona, police have linked the 2007 death of a 58-year-old woman to the Final Exit Network, Maricopa County Attorney Andrew Thomas said Wednesday, according to CNN affiliate KPHO-TV in Phoenix. Thomas said the woman, Jana Van Voorhis, was not terminally ill but suffered from mental illness and depression. He said a police investigation turned up records of visits from Final Exit guides to Voorhis, according to KPHO. No arrests have been made, but Thomas said he expects his office to wrap up its investigation and decide if charges are warranted within 60 days. CNN affiliate WDIV-TV in Detroit, Michigan, reported that search warrants were executed regarding two Michigan residents who sit on Final Exit's board of directors. The Final Exit Network Web site features a \\"Wall of Fame\\" with photos of Dr. Jack Kevorkian, among others. Kevorkian was released on parole in June 2007 after serving more than eight years of a 10- to 25-year sentence in the 1998 death of a man suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. \\"We believe the needs of those who are suffering are paramount,\\" the organization says. \\"We applaud the work of organizations that seek legislative action to strengthen our right to die a peaceful and painless death at the time and place of our choosing. However, we feel that legislative change will not come soon enough for the many people who need help now and in the interim.\\" Betty Celmer, meanwhile, declined to share her thoughts on assisted suicide or the Final Exit Network's alleged involvement in her son's death, saying she lacks specifics. \\"He's in a far better place,\\" she said. \\"That's the only comment I'm going to make.\\" CNN's Ashley Broughton and Jim Kavanagh contributed to this report.","output":"1.

In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.  and the situation: Two women have just undergone different types of mutations without them being aware of it. Kim has just had a mutation in the DNA of her sex cells. Holly has had a mutation in her body cells. Both mutations would be able to be discovered if they happen to go to a doctor, and the doctor knows to look for it, but that is unlikely since the women are unaware these changes happened.

Summarize this article: After six years of waiting for the president's promise to overhaul the country's immigration system, Latinos listened carefully as he announced sweeping measures to protect up to five million undocumented migrants from being deported. Defying the wintry weather, many supporters met in front of the White House waving American flags and carrying signs that read \\"Gracias, Presidente Obama,\\" while others gathered around the country to watch and discuss the announcement. Hispanic advocacy organisations quickly reacted to the news. It was \\"a positive first step in putting our nation on a path that will benefit all Americans,\\" according to the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO). The unilateral actions are definitely important, not only for the Hispanic community but for the many families around the country who will be shielded from deportation. A detailed look at President Obama's speech reveals that this is about much more than just immigration. It touches on highly sensitive issues for the United States, such as national security, border protection and economic development. It also has the potential to influence not only Mr Obama's domestic agenda in his remaining two years in office, but more importantly the 2016 presidential campaign, where Democratic and Republican hopefuls will be vying for the increasingly influential Hispanic vote. At the same time, though, Thursday's announcement is not a permanent change to what President Obama has called the country's \\"broken\\" immigration system, nor does it offer a path to citizenship. Moreover, the move covers only a portion of the country's undocumented population (five million out of an estimated 11 million), and also falls short of the eight million that was mentioned as part of the 2013 bill that passed in the Senate but stalled in the House of Representatives. Even though they can bring about important policy change, executive actions are by definition limited in scope and in time, and the White House knows that the only way that the system can be changed in a permanent way is through Congress. Hispanic groups are aware of that too, and many have been pressing for broader action from both the White House and Congress. Voto Latino, an organisation focussed on Latino youth, described President Obama's measures as \\"legally and morally right, but not enough,\\" and added they were \\"deficient in its scope.\\" Meanwhile, Hector Sanchez, chair of the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda, said he will \\"obviously continue to fight so that there can be a legislative solution.\\" \\"This move can spark Congress to finally act,\\" he told the BBC shortly before President Obama's announcement. But it is precisely in Congress where Thursday's measures will face their biggest challenge. Republicans have gained control of both houses of Congress and have promised to fight this executive action vehemently. On Friday, John Boehner, the speaker of the House of Representatives, told reporters that Mr Obama had acted unilaterally \\"like a king or emperor\\" and vowed that his party would \\"rise to this challenge.\\" \\"With this action, the president has chosen to deliberately sabotage any chance of enacting bipartisan reforms that he claims to seek,\\" Mr Boehner added. The big question now is whether and to what extent Republicans will be able to block or delay President Obama from delivering his promise to millions of undocumented immigrants in the US. Immigrants who have waited for six years for action may find themselves waiting longer.","output":"President Obama announced sweeping measures to protect up to five million undocumented migrants from deportation, a move that was well-received by Hispanic advocacy organizations. While the measure is a positive step, it does not provide a permanent change to the immigration system or offer a path to citizenship. The move covers only a portion of the undocumented population, and executive actions are limited in scope and time. The only way for a permanent change is through Congress, and Hispanic groups are aware of this, pressing for broader action. However, the measures face their biggest challenge in Congress, with Republicans vowing to fight the executive action. The question remains whether Republicans will be able to block or delay the President's promise to millions of undocumented immigrants in the US."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

What is the difference between ETF and mutual funds? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"Yes, both questions are inquiring about the same information. They seek to understand the difference between Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and mutual funds with respect to the Indian markets. Therefore, I will provide a detailed and long answer explaining the main differences between the two investment options. 1. Structure and Trading: Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and mutual funds are pooled investment vehicles that allow investors to diversify their portfolios by investing in a wide range of assets. However, the main difference between the two lies in their structure and trading mechanism. ETFs are traded on stock exchanges just like stocks, whereas mutual funds are bought and sold at the end-of-day Net Asset Value (NAV) through the fund house. In the Indian market, ETFs are listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), allowing investors to buy and sell ETFs throughout the trading day at real-time market prices. Mutual funds, on the other hand, are not traded on exchanges; they are directly bought from, and sold to, the Asset Management Companies (AMCs) at the NAV, which is published at the end of each trading day. 2. Pricing: ETFs are priced dynamically throughout the trading day, which means their price fluctuates according to the market's supply and demand. The price that investors pay or receive for an ETF is close to the market value of the underlying securities, known as the intraday net asset value (iNAV). Mutual funds, conversely, have their NAV calculated only once at the end of the trading day. When an investor buys or sells mutual fund units, the transaction occurs at the end-of-day NAV, regardless of the price fluctuations that occurred during the trading day. 3. Investment Management Style: ETFs predominantly follow a passive investment strategy, tracking benchmark indices like Nifty 50 and Sensex to replicate their performance, and are hence called index funds. By employing this passive approach, ETFs aim to mirror the index's market performance with minimal tracking errors. Actively managed ETFs do exist but are relatively less common. Mutual funds, however, can be either actively managed or passively managed. Actively managed mutual funds employ fund managers who make investment decisions based on market research and analysis to outperform a specific benchmark index. Passively managed mutual funds simply track the benchmark index, similar to most ETFs. 4. Expense Ratio: Expense ratios for ETFs are generally lower than those of mutual funds, primarily due to their passive management style. An ETF's expense ratio covers the administrative and management costs of running the fund. The lower expense ratio often results in cost savings for investors, making ETFs a more cost-efficient investment option compared to mutual funds, especially actively managed ones. 5. Minimum Investment Requirement: In India, ETFs can be bought and sold in quantities as low as one unit, making them accessible to investors with limited capital. Mutual funds, on the other hand, usually have minimum investment requirements, either in the form of minimum lump sum investments or minimum investments through Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs). 6. Systematic Investments and Dividends: ETFs do not offer Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) like mutual funds. To invest systematically in ETFs, one would have to do so through periodic manual transactions. Additionally, ETFs distribute dividends to the investors through a separate fund called the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) in India, while mutual fund investors have the option to either receive dividends directly or reinvest them in the fund. In conclusion, while both ETFs and mutual funds offer diversification and professional management, they differ in terms of trading mechanism, pricing, investment management style, expense ratio, minimum investment requirement, and the handling of systematic investments and dividends. Choosing between ETFs and mutual funds largely depends on an individual investor's objectives, risk tolerance, time horizon, and preferences for trading flexibility and cost efficiency."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 2: The Internet is being used as a fund-raising tool. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"Yes, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, though it only captures a part of the information presented in the first sentence. Entailment, in the context of natural language processing, refers to a relationship between two statements where if one statement is true, the other must also be true. In this case, the first sentence conveys that campaigns are using the Internet in two ways: as an organizational tool and a fund-raising tool. The second sentence specifically focuses on one of these uses, which is the use of the Internet as a fund-raising tool.  Since the first sentence clearly states that the Internet is being used for fund-raising, the second sentence, which also claims that the Internet is being used as a fund-raising tool, must be true if the first sentence is true.

Write an article based on this summary: Eat slower to prevent recurring hiccups. Eat smaller meals. Stop drinking fizzy or carbonated drinks. Avoid chewing gum so you don’t swallow gas. Cut out alcohol Article:","output":"Title: Effective Dietary Changes to Prevent Recurring Hiccups Hiccups are an involuntary condition that can strike anyone unexpectedly, leading to discomfort and, in some cases, recurrent situations that can disrupt normal routines. Though hiccups are typically short-lived, recurrent cases may call for close attention. One underutilized but highly effective method of preventing recurring hiccups is making simple dietary changes. A closer look reveals how regulating meal sizes, moderating drink choices, and adjusting certain habits can significantly contribute towards preventing this issue. Eating slower is a relatively straightforward, yet surprisingly effective strategy to prevent recurring hiccups. The reason for this lies in the science behind the process of consuming food. When you eat too quickly, you are likely to swallow excess air along with your food, triggering your diaphragm's spasms, which induce hiccups. By consciously slowing down, you give your body ample time to process food and minimize the chance of swallowing extra air, thereby reducing the likelihood of hiccup onset. The size of your meals also plays a critical role in preventing hiccups. When you eat, your stomach expands to accommodate the food, putting pressure on the diaphragm located just beneath it. Eating smaller meals can help alleviate this strain, further preventing hiccups. Smaller meals allow for slower digestion, offering the body more time to process the food without overwhelming the digestive system. The type of beverages you consume also affects how frequent or persistent hiccups can become. Fizzy or carbonated drinks introduce additional gas into your stomach, heightening the pressure on the diaphragm and triggering hiccups. By replacing these drinks with flat, non-carbonated options, you can reduce the risk of swallowed air and, consequently, hiccups. Our habitual activities, such as chewing gum, although seemingly harmless, can contribute to the problem. Chewing gum often leads to swallowing more air, which, as we have seen, can induce hiccups. Avoiding gum and replacing it with alternatives, such as mints or lozenges, can help maintain oral freshness without the hiccup-inducing side effect. The consumption of alcohol, with its notorious reputation as a diuretic and a stomach irritant, is another significant hiccup trigger. Alcohol can cause the stomach lining and esophagus to become inflamed, which can induce hiccups. Cutting out alcohol, or at least moderating its consumption, can therefore go a long way towards preventing recurrent hiccups. In conclusion, preventing recurring hiccups can be as simple as making mindful choices in our eating and drinking habits. By consuming meals slowly, reducing meal portions, substituting fizzy drinks with non-carbonated ones, avoiding gum, and moderating alcohol, we can decrease the likelihood of recurrent hiccups while improving overall digestive health. These simple strategies serve as a testament to the significant impact that mindful living and conscious consumption can have on our quality of life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write the answer: A caracal is what type of animal?","output":"A caracal (Caracal caracal) is a type of wild felid, belonging to the family Felidae, which comprises several species of cats, including the common domestic cat, lions, tigers, and leopards. The caracal is a medium-sized, slender, and athletic mammal native to Africa, the Middle East, and certain parts of Central Asia. It is known for its distinctive and striking features, such as large, pointy ears with black tufts at the tips, and a coat that varies in color from tawny brown to reddish hues. The caracal's coat lends it an advantage in blending with its surroundings. The caracal is a skilled hunter, well-adapted to its environment, and primarily hunts at night. However, it is capable of adapting to various habitats, including savannas, woodlands, and semi-desert regions. It can also exist at elevations of up to 3,000 meters in mountainous regions. The caracal is solitary by nature and has a highly territorial behavior, marking its territory with pheromones released from glands located on the face. Its diet consists of a variety of prey, such as birds, rodents, and small ungulates like antelopes. The caracal is renowned for its impressive leaping abilities, which it utilizes to catch birds in mid-flight. It is estimated that a caracal can jump vertically up to 3 meters (10 feet) into the air, placing it among nature's most agile predators. In addition to its remarkable hunting prowess, the caracal is also a proficient climber, often using trees to keep a lookout for prey or hide from potential threats. Caracals are known for their speed and agility as well, with their long limbs designed to enable bursts of speed for short distances. They can run at speeds of up to 50 miles (80 kilometers) per hour when chasing prey. Their strong hind legs help provide the power needed for quick acceleration and rapid direction changes. The caracal's unique appearance and skills have enamored humans for centuries, resulting in it being domesticated or employed in hunting activities in certain regions. In ancient Persia, caracals were often used alongside cheetahs in hunting expeditions, and they were even tamed in Ancient Egypt. Some indigenous communities in Africa still employ caracals for hunting purposes today. The caracal mates year-round, with a gestation period averaging around 78 days, culminating in the birth of one to six kittens. Kittens are born with their eyes closed until they open at around ten days old and rely on their mother for nourishment and protection. They begin to accompany their mother while hunting at around three months old and become independent after a year or so. Though the caracal is not currently considered an endangered species, it does face threats from habitat destruction and human expansion. In some regions, caracals are also viewed as a threat to livestock, making them a target for persecution by farmers. Conservation efforts are vital in preserving caracal populations and their habitats to maintain a balanced ecosystem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

It is the largest native language in Europe and has around 258 million speakers worldwide. Russian uses the Cyrillic script, which consists of 33 letters, and it has five vowels and 28 consonants. The Russian language consists of a complex grammar system and structure, with noun cases, verb conjugations, and gender agreement. In Russian, there are six cases: nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, instrumental, and prepositional, and three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter. In this particular sentence, you can observe a few features of Russian grammar: 1. Word order: Russian has a relatively flexible word order, but the most common order is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). In the given sentence, \\"она\\" (она - she) is the subject, \\"сможет\\" (смочь - to be able to) is the verb, and \\"поймать\\" (поймать - to catch) + \\"эльфа\\" (эльф - elf) form the object. The word order follows the SVO structure. However, as mentioned earlier, the word order can change for emphasis or style in Russian. 2. The use of a question word \\"ли\\": This word is often used in Russian questions to make them more formal or to emphasize the uncertainty. \\"Сможет ли\\" can be translated to \\"But can she\\" or \\"Is it possible for her to\\" in English, where the central focus is on her capability to accomplish the task.

Following their close win against the Giants, the Redskins played an inter-conference duel with the nearby Baltimore Ravens, looking to extend their winning streak to four games, while simultaneously snapping a six-game losing streak to AFC opponents. The Redskins possessed the ball first, and struck first, as quarterback Robert Griffin III found wide receiver Josh Morgan in the end zone or a 7-0 lead. Less than 3 minutes later, however, Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco connected with receiver Anquan Boldin to even the score at 7-all. Washington would quickly respond again, this time by way of an Alfred Morris 1-yard touchdown run. In the second, Flacco again found Boldin, this time from 31 yards away, to even the scoring again at 14-all. On Washington's ensuing possession, Alfred Morris fumbled, Baltimore recovered, and Flacco found tight end Dennis Pitta from 19 yards out for his 3rd TD pass of the half, and the Ravens went into the halftime locker room with a 21-14 edge as Washington could not answer in the quarter. In the third, Baltimore was able to sustain a drive, but turned the ball over in the red zone, which Washington converted into a Kai Forbath 48-yard field goal to cut the score to 21-17. Baltimore would again turn the ball over, and Washington would again convert the Ravens miscue into a Forbath field goal, this one from 49 yards away. In the fourth, Baltimore was able to again sustain a drive, but this time did not turn the ball over, instead Ravens star running back Ray Rice found the endzone, and Baltimore took a 28-20 advantage with just over four minutes remaining. On the ensuing kickoff, new Redskins kick returner Niles Paul, filling in for a deactivated Brandon Banks, fumbled at his own 15, and the ball appeared to be recovered by Baltimore, but upon replay review, was ruled to have recovered out-of-bounds, thus possession remained with Washington. On a 2nd down play, Griffin III scrambled, but was hit by Ravens defensive lineman Haloti Ngata, and his leg snapped awkwardly. He was helped off the field, and fellow backup rookie Kirk Cousins stepped in. Cousins threw an incomplete pass intended for Pierre Gar&#231;on, but pass interference was called on Baltimore, granting Washington a first down. Griffin III then returned to the game, and got Washington into Baltimore's red zone, but had to depart again after being called for intentional grounding with under a minute remaining. Cousins stepped back in, however, and connected with Garcon for a 6-yard score with 29 seconds remaining, cutting Baltimore's advantage to 28-26. Needing a two-point conversion, Washington ran a quarterback draw, Cousins reached the end zone, and the game was even at 28-all with 29 seconds remaining. Baltimore opted to settle for overtime, and knelt down to end regulation. In overtime, Baltimore got the ball first, and went three-and-out, punter Sam Koch then punted to Redskins punt returner Richard Crawford, who, like Paul, was filling in for a deactivated Banks. Crawford found a hole and returned the ball 64 yards. Washington then sealed the deal when Kai Forbath connected on his third field goal of the day, this time from 34 yards away, to seal the comeback victory 31-28. With the win, the Redskins improved to 7-6, and 1-0 in overtime, as well as snapping a six-game losing streak to AFC teams. Washington's win also matched their longest win streak since 2008.

With a large enough space and enough hiding spots, you could play with well over 20 players.  Get together a group of kids from your neighborhood, from school, or from after school clubs to play this game with you. Invite kids your age you see playing alone to come play Kick the Can. Say something like, \\"Hey, we're going to play a group game called Kick the Can. Would you like to play?\\" Bottles and cans are the typical choice for this game, but you can use anything that could be safely kicked some distance. Other options include balls, small trash cans, small boxes, plastic cones, a plastic bucket, and so on.  Give your item a few trial kicks. You don't want it to go too far or too short. Choose an object that can be kicked a medium distance. You may want to put some rocks into your item. Doing this to items like cans, bottles, and boxes can help you adjust the distance an object is kicked. The best play ares will be large, with plenty of hiding places. Playgrounds and parks work great, as do cul-de-sac streets (which are closed off at one end). Clearly agree on the boundaries of your play area with all players.  Natural features, like tree-lines, large rocks, and paths are a great way of clearly outlining the boundaries of your play area. If one of your boundaries is unclear, use other items, like branches, rocks, hats, cones, and so on to mark it. The jail is where players go when they're caught by the seeker. Your jail, much like your playing area, should have clearly defined boundaries. Some common places used for the jail include decks, patios, benches, porches, and so on.  If you don't have a clearly defined jail in your play area, make one by arranging branches, stones, cones, and more to form its boundaries. The jail should be large enough to fit as many players are playing, but not much larger than that. Use rock, paper, scissors to select the seeker or use whatever method you prefer. No matter how many players there are, there is only one seeker per game. After that, agree with other players on the time the seeker will count before searching for hiders.  The more time you have to hide, the more likely it is hiders will have a better hiding place. Use longer count times for the seeker for longer, more challenging games. Short count times can add an fast paced aspect to this game. If you and your friends like quick games, choose short count times. Alternatively, set up the item you're using in place of the can. Arrange this item in a central location in your playing area. This location should be wide open and difficult to sneak up on. You may want to locate your can close to your jail. This way, if the can is kicked, the seeker will have to run towards the jail while jailed players are running away. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"The article discusses how to play the group game Kick the Can, suitable for at least three players and potentially involving over 20 players.

The World Cup's focus on attacking football has won global praise but a cloud scurried across the tournament Tuesday as match fixing claims surrounding Cameroon's participation in the event emerged. The Cameroon Football Association (Fecafoot) has confirmed it's investigating allegations made in the German media that seven of its players were involved in match fixing during the group stages of the World Cup finals in Brazil. While previous investigations centered on trying to fix international friendlies or low-profile qualifiers, this is the first time since 1982 that World Cup group stage games have come under scrutiny. The \\"Indomitable Lions\\" were drawn in the same pool as Croatia, Mexico and host nation Brazil, losing all three games. A convicted match fixer spoke to German magazine Der Spiegel correctly predicting one of the results of the African nation. \\"We wish to inform the general public that, though not yet contacted by FIFA in regards to this affair, our administration has already instructed its Ethics Committee, to further investigate these accusations,\\" said a Fecafoot statement. Wilson Raj Perumal, who was detained by police in Finland earlier this year on an international arrest warrant, told Der Spiegel that Cameroon would lose to Croatia while also having a player sent off. CNN has not been able to independently verify the Der Spiegel report. Midfielder Alex Song was red carded during the game for lashing out at Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic, while goals from Ivica Olic, Ivan Perisic and a brace from Mandzukic without reply secured a 4-0 victory. The match also saw Cameroon players Benoit Assou-Ekotto and Benjamin Moukandjo aggressively confront each other, with television pictures appearing to show Assou-Ekotto attempting to head-butt Moukandjo. CNN contacted Song's agent although he was not immediately available for comment. The Fecafoot statement continued: \\"Recent allegations of fraud around Cameroon 2014 FIFA World Cup three preliminary games, especially Cameroon vs. Croatia, as well of the 'existence of seven bad apples (in our national team)' do not reflect the values and principles promoted by our administration, in line with FIFA Code of Conduct and the ethics of our nation.\\" In the Der Spiegel interview, Perumal, who CNN is trying to contact, used the expression \\"seven bad apples.\\" A FIFA spokesperson told reporters Tuesday that they could not comment on whether an investigation was underway on the manipulation of games. Fecafoot meanwhile added in its statement that \\"in 55 years of existence, it has never been sanctioned for, involved in, or even linked to match fixing or any fraud of any kind.\\" The investigation marks an uncomfortable end to Cameroon's disastrous World Cup campaign. Players initially refused to board the plane to Brazil until a dispute with Fecafoot over bonus payments was resolved. Although an agreement was eventually reached, the team's departure was delayed by a day. An opening game 1-0 loss to Mexico was followed up by the 4-0 thrashing by Croatia. Hosts Brazil then completed the misery by defeating the four-time African Cup of Nations champion 4-1. In the aftermath of the Croatia defeat, coach Volker Finke described the behavior of some of his players as \\"unacceptable.\\" \\"Some players behaved very badly, and that's why we have conceded four goals,\\" Finke said to L'Equipe. \\"I know that it is difficult to play with 10 men, but that is not a reason to lose it to this point. \\"The game was balanced until the red card. The Croatians were more clinical in front of goal, but Cameroon also had chances to score. \\"The behavior of some of the players is really not satisfactory. Even when we were 11-a-side, it was not acceptable.\\" In 1982, Algeria, despite having beaten then West Germany, went out after a seemingly contrived 1-0 win over Austria.

As noted above, the 9/11 plotters spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as 10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received 5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money. The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements. By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive.

During the Blitz, Charlie, Carrie, and Paul are evacuated from London to Pepperinge Eye, where they are placed in the reluctant care of Miss Eglantine Price, who agrees to the arrangement temporarily. The three children attempt to run back to London, but after observing Miss Price attempting to fly on a broomstick, they change their minds. Miss Price reveals she is learning witchcraft through a correspondence school with hopes of using her spells in the British war effort, and offers the children a transportation spell in exchange for their silence. She casts the spell on a bedknob, and adds only Paul can work the spell, since he's the one who handed it to her.  Later, Miss Price receives a letter from her school announcing its closure, thus preventing her from learning the final spell. She convinces Paul to use the enchanted bed to return the group to London, and locate Professor Emelius Browne. They discover Browne is actually a charismatic showman who created the course from an old book, and is surprised to learn the spells actually work for Miss Price. He gives the book to Miss Price, who is distraught to discover the final spell, \\"Substitutiary Locomotion,\\" is missing. The group travels to Portobello Road to locate the rest of the book.

Answer: In Egypt , wine became a part of recorded history, playing an important role in ancient ceremonial life . Question: what country did wine originate in","output":"No, the correct answer to the question \\"What country did wine originate in?\\" is not Egypt but Georgia.  Wine is believed to have originated in the region of present-day Georgia, which boasts a history of wine production that dates back at least 8,000 years. Archaeological evidence discovered in the South Caucasus area suggests that this region is the birthplace of wine culture, with remnants of grape pips, ancient wine-making equipment, and pottery vessels found at several sites across the country. However, it is worth mentioning that Egypt also has a significant history of winemaking, dating back more than 5,000 years. Wine production and consumption played a vital role in the religious and social life of ancient Egyptians. Egyptian viticulture was renowned throughout the ancient Mediterranean world, and wine was often transported in significant quantities during trade and diplomatic exchanges. Wine consumption in ancient Egyptian society was typically associated with religious rites, ceremonies, and grave goods, making it an essential element of funeral and burial rituals. Although wine held an essential position in Egyptian culture, it is still inaccurate to assert that Egypt was the origin of wine itself. To answer the question accurately, one would need to discuss the archaeological evidence and historical context supporting the region of present-day Georgia as the primary source of the world's first wine production."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Given the below context:  Pulakeshin II conquered the eastern Deccan, corresponding to the coastal districts of modern Andhra Pradesh in 616, defeating the remnants of the Vishnukundina kingdom. He appointed his brother Kubja Vishnuvardhana as Viceroy in 621. Thus the Eastern Chalukyas were originally of Kannada stock. After the death of Pulakeshin II, the Vengi Viceroyalty developed into an independent kingdom and included the region between Nellore and Visakhapatnam.After the decline of the Badami Chalukya empire in the mid-8th century, territorial disputes flared up between the Rashtrakutas, the new rulers of the western deccan, and the Eastern Chalukyas. For much of the next two centuries, the Eastern Chalukyas had to accept subordination towards the Rashtrakutas. Apart from a rare military success, such as the one by Vijayaditya II(c.808–847), it was only during the rule of Bhima I (c.892–921) that these Chalukyas were able to celebrate a measure of independence. After the death of Bhima I, the Andhra region once again saw succession disputes and interference in Vengi affairs by the Rashtrakutas.The fortunes of the Eastern Chalukyas took a turn around 1000. Danarnava, their king, was killed in battle in 973 by the Telugu Choda King Bhima who then imposed his rule over the region for twenty-seven years. During this time, Danarnava's two sons took refuge in the Chola kingdom. Choda Bhima's invasion of Tondaimandalam, a Chola territory, and his subsequent death on the battlefield opened up a new era in Chola–Chalukya relations. Saktivarman I, the elder son of Danarnava was crowned as the ruler of Vengi in 1000, though under the control of king Rajaraja Chola I. This new relationship between the Cholas and the coastal Andhra kingdom was unacceptable to the Western Chalukyas, who had by then replaced the Rashtrakutas as the main power in the western Deccan.

Forty-eight) are a Japanese idol girl group named after the Akihabara (Akiba for short) area in Tokyo, where the group's theater is located. The group has expanded since then to include over 130 members as of December 2015, aged from their early teens to their mid-20s. AKB48's producer, Yasushi Akimoto, wanted to form a girl group with its own theater (unlike pop groups performing occasional concerts and seen on television) and performing daily so fans could always see them live. This \\"idols you can meet\\" concept includes teams which can rotate performances and perform simultaneously at several events and \\"handshake\\" events, where fans can meet group members. AKB48 was founded as \\"idols you can meet\\". The group's chief producer, Yasushi Akimoto, said that his goal was to create a unique idol group which, unlike other idol groups which perform occasional concerts and appear primarily on television, would perform regularly in its own theater. The AKB48 Theater is in the Don Quijote store in Akihabara, Tokyo.  The group is split into several teams, reducing its members' workload (since the theater's near-daily performance is by only one team) and enabling AKB48 to perform simultaneously in several places. According to former member Misaki Iwasa, each team has its own theme. Team A represents freedom; Team B is idol-like, with cute costumes, and Team K has a strong, powerful image. According to an early press release the group was intended to have 16 members on each of three teams, for a total membership of 48; but its membership has varied over time, and has exceeded 120 people. New members are called trainees (Yan Jiu Sheng , kenkyusei) who are understudies for the group, performing occasionally in the theater as a team. In addition to their performances with the group, members are promoted by the Japanese mass media. AKB48 regularly hosts events, where fans can interact with the members, such as taking pictures or shaking hands with the members.  The group members' ages range from their early teens to over 20, and they are selected from regular auditions. Members are not allowed to date, and must be well-behaved; any violation of these restrictions is to be punished, possibly by expulsion from the group. AKB48 has a system that allows members to \\"graduate\\" from the group when they are older and are replaced by trainees who are promoted. Monica Hesse of The Washington Post described the AKB48 audition process as \\"rolling American Idol-esque\\".

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Sheila split open and the air was filled with gumballs. Yellow gumballs. This was awful for Stan, just awful. He had loved Sheila for a long time, fought for her heart, believed in their love until finally she had come around. They were about to kiss for the first time and then this: yellow gumballs. Stan went to a group to try to accept that Sheila was gone. It was a group for people whose unrequited love had ended in some kind of surrealist moment. There is a group for everything in California. After several months of hard work on himself with the group, Stan was ready to open a shop and sell the thousands of yellow gumballs. He did this because he believed in capitalism, he loved capitalism. He loved the dynamic surge and crash of Amazon's stock price, he loved the great concrete malls spreading across America like blood staining through a handkerchief, he loved how everything could be tracked and mirrored in numbers. When he closed the store each night he would count the gumballs sold, and he would determine his gross revenue, his operating expenses, his operating margin; he would adjust his balance sheet and learn his debt to equity ratio; and after this exercise each night, Stan felt he understood himself and was at peace, and he could go home to his apartment and drink tea and sleep, without shooting himself or thinking about Sheila. On the night before the IPO of gumballs.com, Sheila came to Stan in a dream. She was standing in a kiddie pool; Stan and his brothers and sisters were running around splashing and screaming; she had managed to insert herself into a Super-8 home movie of Stan's family, shot in the late 70's. She looked terribly sad. \\"Sheila, where are you?\\" Stan said. \\"Why did you leave me, why did you become gumballs?\\" \\"The Ant King has me,\\" Sheila said. \\"You must rescue me.\\" Question: After the story, Stan most likely: Answer: Answer:","output":"Stan, based on the story, most likely roams in a delicate balance between pragmatic realism and whimsical metaphor. His practicality is evident in his acceptance of Sheila's transformation, seeking help through a group therapy, and his decision to monetize the yellow gumballs. Thereafter, he manages his business meticulously, calculating financial metrics each night, and gains a sense of satisfaction and self-understanding from these activities. His capitalism-centric view of the world appears to provide him solace from his heartbreak. However, the appearance of Sheila in Stan's dream, and her plea for rescue, disrupts this rhythm. She isn't just a memory or a sad event, but an active presence in his dreams, requesting him to perform an almost heroic task - to rescue her from the 'Ant King'. This indicates that while Stan may continue maintaining his shop, balancing his accounts, he might also be questioning or exploring ways to rescue Sheila, opening the path to a venture beyond the realm of capitalism to that of fantastical heroism. Thus, Stan's journey oscillates between the rational and the surreal, the mundane routine of running his shop and the strange adventure his dream presents. This kind of postmodern juxtaposition might lead him to a deeper self-understanding, or to an attempt to reconcile the two aspects of his life – the passion of his unfulfilled romantic relationship, and the discipline of his capitalist conviction. His actions post the story, however, would be determined by the choices he makes between his love for Sheila, and his peace found in the mechanism of capitalism."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The revolt was sparked by the 1541 decree of Chatellerault, which extended a salt tax to Angoumois and Saintonge . It was made compulsory to purchase salt from the salt loft . \\"Gabelle\\" officers took charge of punishing the unlawful trading of salt. But these were salt pan areas where the salt was freely traded. Salt smuggling spread rapidly, especially after the Marennes and La Rochelle revolts in 1542, and the repression by the salt riders is out of the population acceptance. In 1548, riots break out in Angoumois and Saintonge demanding the release of the smugglers . The de Pitauds revolt grew to 20,000 members, led by a lord and joined by priests. Castles were plundered and salt-tax collectors killed. The revolt spread to Bordeaux where 20 salt tax collectors were killed, including the lieutenant governor, on August 21, 1548. King Henry II blockaded Bordeaux and launched his repression. Bordeaux lost its privileges. It was disarmed, paid a fine, saw its parliament suspended, and 1,401 people were sentenced to death. The repression spread to the countryside where the leaders were hanged: neither priests nor gentlemen were spared. The salt-tax was finally abolished in these provinces in June 1549, the provinces became redeemed countries, and the King issued a general amnesty.

Winker Watson is a character in which comic?","output":"Winker Watson is a character in the British comic magazine \\"The Dandy.\\" The Dandy was first published on December 4, 1937, by D.C. Thomson & Co. Ltd., a Scottish publishing company based in Dundee. The comic's primary target audience was children, and it featured a wide variety of characters and stories, with Winker Watson being one of its several popular characters. The comic's original name was \\"The Dandy Comic,\\" but in 1950, it was renamed \\"The Dandy.\\" Winker Watson made his debut on January 27, 1962, in the 1079th issue of The Dandy. The character is known for his cleverness, cunning, and ability to manipulate situations to his advantage. Winker is a schoolboy attending Greytowers Boarding School, where his exploits often revolve around his skillful evasion of authority figures such as the school's teachers and headmaster. Winker Watson was created by Eric Roberts, a British comic artist who worked closely with The Dandy for several years and was responsible for designing some of its most famous characters. Winker Watson's stories typically involve him devising ingenious plans to avoid schoolwork, get out of chores, or escape punishment, all while turning the tables on his adversaries. Many of his exploits are centered around his quest for a more carefree and enjoyable life, much to the chagrin of authority figures at Greytowers. These authority figures include the headmaster Dr. Septimus Cholmondley Smythe and other characters such as Mr. Frankie “Whiz-Bang” Tubbs, the school's no-nonsense sports coach. Despite being cast as a troublemaker, Winker Watson has been a beloved character since his creation in the early 1960s. Throughout the numerous changes and evolutions of The Dandy, Winker Watson continued to be an iconic figure in the British comic book landscape. The comic publication itself underwent several changes in format, transitioning from a weekly print publication to a bi-monthly digital comic in 2012. Unfortunately, The Dandy ceased publication in December 2012, with a final digital issue marking 75 years of the comic's existence. Many of The Dandy's characters, including Winker Watson, are now considered nostalgic remnants of Britain's rich comic history. Nonetheless, these characters and their creators played a significant role in shaping and inspiring the imaginations of generations of readers, leaving behind a lasting legacy for fans of British comic books."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

OPT: + yes; + no;","output":"No, the given answer does not directly address the original question about the MLB All-Star winning team and what they gain in the World Series. Instead, it focuses on exhibition games between inter-city teams and how they were played for bragging rights before blending into interleague play. A more appropriate answer for the original question would be: The MLB All-Star Game is an annual event played mid-season, featuring players from both the American League (AL) and the National League (NL) who are selected by fan voting, players, and coaches. From 2003 to 2016, the winning team in the All-Star Game determined which league's representative would have home-field advantage in the World Series. However, in 2017, Major League Baseball changed the rules. Home-field advantage in the World Series is now granted to the team with the better regular season record. Consequently, the All-Star Game results no longer impact the World Series. The game is now played purely for entertainment and the pride of winning, without any implications for the postseason. This change allows players and coaches to enjoy the All-Star Game as an exhibition without the pressure of determining home-field advantage for their league in the World Series."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Another tale of woe from me… When I met my ex, I was in foster care. I was a very confused 17 year old, and she took an interest in me, and we would talk about all my problems with my own family, and everything that was going wrong with me. I even ‘came out’ to her at one point. We spent a lot of time together and gradually, I thought I might not be gay after all, as I had feelings of love for her. Eventually, we started dating and I tried to suppress my gay feelings. Eventually, I proposed. We were engaged for just over a year and I got married at the age of 19. I have to admit, when the wedding plans got firmed up and much closer to the date, I started to feel that I was in fact still gay but so much money had already been spent, and plans made that I was too afraid to pull out. Don’t get me wrong, I still love my ex wife a heck of a lot, but as my very best friend. I hate to use the phrase, but with everything that has gone on with me the last few years, she has been ‘my rock’. We separated after about 8 years, when our daughter was 7 years old, and I told her why. I just couldn’t go on living the lie. I hate myself for doing it to her. Selfishly, I wouldn’t change things though, as I have my daughter and I love her, and I love being a parent.

The effort was funded by ARPA (now DARPA), and the computer network that resulted was called the ARPANET. The technologies that made the Arpanet possible spread and evolved.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The acronym \\"ARPA\\" refers to the Advanced Research Projects Agency. This agency, now known as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency or DARPA, played a crucial role in the development of the internet as we know it today. The context provided outlines the historical background of ARPA and its significance in the creation of the ARPANET. In the 1970s, computer engineers from various research institutions across the United States began connecting their computers using telecommunications technology. This crucial step towards a broader network was possible due to the funding provided by ARPA. The ARPANET, developed in the late 1960s, was a precursor to the modern internet and allowed data sharing amongst multiple computer systems. Established in 1958, ARPA was created as a response to the Soviet Union's launch of the Sputnik satellite, which sparked concern about the United States' technical capabilities. The agency was tasked with promoting and conducting advanced research and development projects to ensure national security and maintain a competitive edge in science and technology. ARPA's research and funding led to groundbreaking innovations in computer networking, such as the development of the packet-switching technology. Packet-switching enables the transmission of data in a more flexible and reliable manner, as data is divided into smaller packets and is sent across the network independently, to be reassembled at its destination. This technology is the backbone of the modern internet. Under the guidance of ARPA, researchers also developed the TCP/IP protocol suite, which makes it possible for different computer networks to communicate with one another. TCP/IP, which stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, became the standard networking protocol and is still used across the internet today. In 1972, ARPA officially became DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) and continued to focus on research and development in cutting-edge technologies. DARPA has been instrumental in various technology advancements, not just limited to the internet, but also including artificial intelligence, robotics, and stealth technology. In summary, the acronym \\"ARPA\\" refers to the Advanced Research Projects Agency, which played a crucial role in the development of the ARPANET and the internet as we know it today. The agency, now called DARPA, was responsible for funding and promoting advanced research that led to the creation of crucial technologies such as packet-switching and the TCP/IP protocol suite that serves as the backbone of the modern internet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After some prompting from Johnny and Ozzy, he reveals that he was the lucky one, as his friend Timmy (I think that was his name, he never shows up in the film) was not as lucky and Jesse feels some guilt for this. On the way, the three pass a park and Jesse tells them to stop. The park was their childhood playground and the three take a little time off to play a game of softball and reminisce.

What might be the first step of the process? A:","output":"A: The first step of the process is the detection of high blood sugar levels in the body. After consuming food, the carbohydrates in the food are broken down into glucose, which is a simple sugar that serves as the primary source of energy for cells. This glucose is then released into the bloodstream, resulting in an increase in blood sugar levels.  The body has a sophisticated system to maintain optimal blood sugar levels, and the pancreas plays a crucial role in this process. When blood sugar levels rise, this triggers specialized cells in the pancreas, called beta cells, to release insulin. Insulin is a hormone that allows cells throughout the body to absorb glucose from the bloodstream, utilizing it for energy or storing it for future use. As cells uptake glucose, blood sugar levels start to decrease and return to normal. On the other hand, when blood sugar levels become too low, another hormone called glucagon is released by the alpha cells in the pancreas. Glucagon signals the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose, which is then released back into the bloodstream. This process ensures that the body maintains stable blood sugar levels, providing a constant source of energy to cells. In summary, the first step of the process is detecting high blood sugar levels, which leads to the activation of the pancreas to release insulin and initiate the sequence of events necessary to bring blood sugar levels back to normal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

To protect its seagoing interests and trade routes, Portugal established strategic garrisons in Goa (India), Malacca (East Indies), and Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. Portuguese explorers then embarked upon Macau (now Macao), the Congo, and various other parts of Africa, including the Sudan. The Portuguese policy was to avoid armed strife and to develop a trade empire, rather than to conquer nations. To this end it succeeded with relatively few blood-soaked episodes in its colonial history. Adventures abroad, however, proved disastrous during the second half of the 16th century. In 1557 the 14-year-old boy-king Sebastião ascended the throne, the beginning of a calamitous reign that was to end at the battle of Alcacer-Quiber (Morocco) in pursuit of a vain crusade. Sebastião's untimely demise, alongside some 18,000 ill-prepared, badly led followers, set the stage for a crisis of succession. For many years afterwards, legends and rumors bizarrely insisted that the king was still alive, and imposters turned up from time to time claiming the throne; those who were plausible enough to be deemed a threat were summarily executed. In fact, the only rightful claimant to the crown was the elderly Prince Henry. But after two years of alternating between the throne and his sickbed, he died, heirless. Surveying the situation and smelling an opportunity, Spain occupied the power vacuum, and Portugal's neighbor and long-time antagonist became its master. Spanish rule dictated Portugal's inadvertent involvement in Spain's ongoing wars. In 1587 a squadron of British ships commanded by Francis Drake attacked the Algarve (now a \\"legitimate target\\" as Spanish territory) and sacked Sagres, thus depriving the world of the relics of Henry the Navigator. Nine years later Faro was torched. The 1386 Treaty of Windsor, by which Britain and Portugal had pledged eternal friendship, seemed a distant memory. Portugal's empire was gradually eroded, and many of its trading posts (with the notable exception of Brazil) were picked off by the British and Dutch. Finally, after 60 years of Spanish rule, Portuguese noblemen (aided by the French, then at war with Spain) organized a palace coup and restored independence. The Great Disaster Portugal's greatest misfortune struck on All Saint's Day, 1 November 1755.

Done.","output":"In order to achieve a perfect fold, it is important to use the ruler as a tool to assist you in maintaining accuracy and precision throughout the process. The ruler serves as a stable, straight edge that guides you in making clean, even folds, ensuring a perfectly aligned and professional-looking final product. When using the ruler, you should start by placing the material you wish to fold onto a flat, smooth surface, such as a table or a cutting mat. Be sure to lay the material out without any wrinkles, creases, or overlaying edges to ensure a seamless folding process. Next, place the ruler along the desired folding line, making sure it is parallel to the fold you want to create. The ruler's straight edge will serve as a guide for your fingers or any folding tool to follow, allowing you to maintain control and consistency in the fold's positioning and width. Before folding, you can use a light pencil or fabric pen to mark the folding line if needed. This can also be helpful in ensuring precise alignment and measurement. As you fold the material, apply gentle, even pressure along the ruler's edge, running your fingers or folding tool along its length. This will help crease the material along the guide, creating a sharp, defined fold. Depending on the material's thickness and the desired sharpness of the fold, you may need to run your fingers or tool across the edge of the ruler several times to reinforce the crease. After creating the fold, you should make sure it is neat and consistent by either pressing firmly along the entire edge or running a bone folder or other suitable tool across it. Be sure not to apply too much pressure, as this may cause damage to the material or the ruler itself. In summary, the ruler acts as an invaluable aid in achieving perfect folds by providing both a clear guide and straight edge for accuracy and precision during the folding process. By using the ruler effectively, you can ensure professional quality folds and an overall better presentation of your final product."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write highlights for this article: Detectives working to find missing Madeleine McCann have given their counterparts in Portugal a new list of potential suspects and have urged them to investigate them. More than 20 new  suspects in the Madeleine McCann investigation have been identified  by British police. A Scotland Yard review of the bungled Portuguese inquiry into the three-year-old’s  disappearance in 2007 has uncovered dozens of fresh leads, it emerged yesterday. They include ‘forensic opportunities’ and several ‘people of interest’, including Britons, who have not been eliminated from the case. Madeleine’s parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, are said to be ‘greatly encouraged’ by the developments. But the Mail has learned that behind the scenes, a major diplomatic row is brewing because the Portuguese authorities are adamant they will not reopen the inquiry. Officials in Lisbon have told their British counterparts that under Portuguese laws, they can reopen the case only if there is new evidence. But Yard chiefs – who want the Portuguese to agree to a joint investigation – say their new leads could, if properly explored, result in new evidence and possibly the Maddie mystery being solved. One well-placed source described the deadlock as ‘a Mexican stand-off’. ‘It’s a chicken-and-egg situation. Significant new evidence can be found if the leads uncovered by the Yard are investigated. There are two major obstacles to a joint investigation: the money to fund it in Portugal and the loss of face they would suffer from having to agree to such an inquiry.’ It is understood high-level discussions have taken place in the UK about the possibility of Scotland Yard launching its own investigation. British police do not have jurisdiction in Portugal, but they have the right to investigate and prosecute any British suspects linked to Madeleine’s disappearance. Still hopeful: Mrs McCann returned to Portugal this month with her mother, Susan Healy, six years on. This picture shows Kate and Gerry McCann marking the fifth anniversary of their daughter's disappearance with an 'aged' photo of how she might look - on the sixth anniversary this year they said they'd not given up. Should the Met decide to launch its own investigation, it is likely to send a formal letter of request to the Portuguese authorities – seeking its assistance in its inquiries. Last night a Yard spokesman confirmed a high-level delegation of officers travelled to Portugal in March, but he refused to comment on what discussions took place. The senior detective who has overseen the Met’s two-year review of the case yesterday confirmed his officers had drawn up a list of people who they say are ‘of interest’. Detective Chief Superintendent Hamish Campbell, the head of Scotland Yard’s Homicide and Serious Crime Command, said there were a ‘good number’ of individuals who should be questioned. He would not disclose the precise number but sources told the Mail that at least 20 potential suspects – including a number of Britons who were in the Algarve at the time of Madeleine’s disappearance six years ago – had not been properly eliminated. Mr Campbell urged the Portuguese authorities to investigate the new leads. He said: ‘There are a lot of people of interest. There are people who could be properly explored further, if only to be eliminated.’ Madeleine went missing from her family’s holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in Portugal in 2007 as her parents dined with friends nearby. The shambolic Portuguese inquiry was shelved in 2008 but Scotland Yard launched a Home Office-funded review of the case in 2011 following the intervention of David Cameron. Last year the officer in day-to-day charge of the review, Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, said his team had identified 195 potential leads after examining a huge bundle of material. Mr Campbell said it was ‘perfectly probable’ that information which could identify the suspect responsible for Madeleine’s disappearance was already in the Portuguese files. He reiterated a claim that Madeleine could still be alive. He said: ‘You only have to look at the case in Cleveland, Ohio, and the European cases. Of course there is a possibility she is alive. ‘But the key is to investigate the case and, alive or dead, we should be able to try and discern what happened.’ The McCanns, of Rothley, Leicestershire, have been kept closely informed of Scotland Yard’s review – codenamed Operation Grange – over the past two years. A spokesman for the couple said: ‘They have been encouraged from the moment the review started and are now greatly encouraged that police have drawn up a short list of people who they believe are of interest to the inquiry.’ A source close to the couple said: ‘While they don’t want to raise their hopes too much, they are buoyed up by these revelations.’ A Home Office source said: ‘Clearly not all the 20 potential suspects identified by the Met could be responsible for Madeleine’s disappearance. But the Yard are adamant that if they were running the inquiry here, these people would have been properly eliminated.’ The Ocean Club resort in Praia da Luz in the Algarve from where Madeleine McCann was abducted in May 2007.

Remy states that he has enhanced senses of both taste and smell, which makes him very particular about what he eats. Remy's brother Emile (Peter Sohn) is impressed by this talent, but their father Django (Brian Dennehy) who leads the rats' colony, could care less - until Remy reveals that he can recognize the scent of rat poison in or near food. Django puts Remy to work sniffing and testing food for the rest of the clan.

Process:  - Oxygen enters the body through the mouth or nose - The oxygen travels into the lungs - The oxygen binds to hemoglobin proteins within erythrocytes (red blood cells) - The erythrocytes are pumped through the body by the heart - All cells receive the oxygen.  suppose a person is at high altitude happens, how will it affect \\"LESS oxygen being brought to the bodys cells\\".  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"At high altitudes, the primary perturbation leading to less oxygen being brought to the body's cells is indirectly impacting a step of the process. The main factor in this scenario is the decrease in atmospheric pressure, which reduces the availability of oxygen in the air. In high-altitude locations, air pressure is lower, resulting in reduced partial pressure of oxygen. Partial pressure refers to the pressure exerted by an individual gas in a mixture of gases, in this case, the atmospheric pressure. As the altitude increases, the oxygen concentration in the atmosphere remains the same at approximately 21%; however, the partial pressure of oxygen decreases. This results in decreased availability of oxygen for the body to intake during the process of respiration. The decrease in partial pressure of oxygen at high altitudes indirectly impacts the second step of the process mentioned earlier: \\"The oxygen travels into the lungs.\\" When a person breathes in, the oxygen gas needs to diffuse across the respiratory membrane in the lungs into the bloodstream. The ability of oxygen to diffuse across this membrane depends on the difference in partial pressure between the air in the alveoli (small air sacs in the lungs) and the blood in the surrounding pulmonary capillaries.  At high altitudes, the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli is lower. This means the oxygen concentration gradient between the alveoli and the blood is reduced, resulting in a decrease in the rate of oxygen diffusion into the bloodstream. Consequently, the amount of oxygen that binds to hemoglobin proteins in erythrocytes (red blood cells) is also reduced. This ultimately leads to less oxygen being delivered to cells throughout the body. In summary, the reduced availability of oxygen at high altitudes indirectly impacts the process of oxygen entering the body and being delivered to cells. The decrease in partial pressure of oxygen in the air affects the efficiency of the oxygen diffusion step in the lungs and results in less oxygen binding to hemoglobin. As a result, less oxygen reaches the body's cells, which can cause a variety of symptoms associated with altitude sickness and impaired cellular functions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Populated by despicable characters whose depravity knows no bounds, Before The Devil is a mesmerizing, jaw-dropping excursion into perversion which would be laughable (and sometimes is, even with - or perhaps because of - the sickeningly tragic undercurrent of human dysfunction throughout) if it weren't carried out with such magnificent, overwhelming conviction by its stars. The excellent script by Kelly Masterson and superb direction by none other than Sidney Lumet doesn't hurt either. The main dysfunction here is of a family nature, with the two majorly screwed up brothers (brilliant portrayals from Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke) deciding to rob their own parents' jewelry store, an attempt that goes pathetically awry. The story is told with time-shifts (which are noted on screen, such as: \\"Charlie: Two Days Before The Robbery\\", so no one should be confused); some people have said they didn't like this device but I thought it worked perfectly, adding to the skeweredness of the whole affair, considering that the two brothers in question are hardly playing with full decks - between them you couldn't make a decent poker hand to save your life. Throw in these cheesy extra tidbits: one of the brothers is a drug addict, married to Gina (Marisa Tomei, also excellent), who is having an affair with the other brother, toss in some monumental sibling rivalry, along with the fact that said drug addict brother hates his father (a wrenching performance from Albert Finney), who has apparently caused him serious past pain, and you've got a Shakespearean/Greek tragedy on your hands.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Gifford Pinchot (August 11, 1865 - October 4, 1946) was an American forester and politician. Pinchot served as the first Chief of the United States Forest Service from 1905 until his firing in 1910, and was the 28th Governor of Pennsylvania, serving from 1923 to 1927, and again from 1931 to 1935. He was a member of the Republican Party for most of his life, though he also joined the Progressive Party for a brief period. Pinchot is known for reforming the management and development of forests in the United States and for advocating the conservation of the nation's reserves by planned use and renewal. Gifford Pinchot was born August 11, 1865, to Episcopalian parents in Simsbury, Connecticut, the son of James W. Pinchot, a successful New York City wallpaper merchant, and Mary Eno, daughter of one of New York City's wealthiest real estate developers, Amos Eno. He graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy and in 1889, Yale University, where he was a member of Skull and Bones. He had a brother Amos Pinchot and a sister Antoinette (who married the diplomat Alan Johnstone).  The Pinchots made a great fortune by importing French wallpaper  to furnish stately American homes during the late Victorian era. Pinchot's father  James made conservation a family affair and suggested that Gifford should become a forester, asking him just before he left for college in 1885, \\"How would you like to become a forester?\\". Gifford studied as a postgraduate at the French National School of Forestry, in Nancy, for a year. He returned home and plunged into the nascent forestry movement, intent on shaping a national forest policy. At Gifford's urging, together James and Gifford endowed the Yale School of Forestry in 1900, and James turned Grey Towers, the family estate at Milford, Pennsylvania, into a \\"nursery\\" for the American forestry movement. Family financial affairs were managed by brother Amos Pinchot, thus freeing Gifford to do the more important work of developing forest management concepts. Unlike some others in the forestry movement, Gifford's wealth allowed him to singly pursue this goal without worry of income.  Pinchot's approach set him apart from the other leading forestry experts, especially Bernhard E. Fernow and Carl A. Schenck. Fernow had been Pinchot's predecessor in the United States Department of Agriculture's Division of Forestry before leaving in 1898 to become the first Dean of the New York State College of Forestry at Cornell. Schenck was Pinchot's successor at the Biltmore Estate (widely recognized as the \\"cradle of American forestry\\") and founder of the Biltmore Forest School on Biltmore Estate. Their schools largely reflected their approaches to introducing forestry in the United States: Fernow advocated a regional approach and Schenck a private enterprise effort in contrast to Pinchot's national vision.  Perhaps, the men who had the most influence on his development as a forester were Sir Dietrich Brandis, who had brought forestry to the British Empire, and Sir Wilhelm Schlich, Brandis' successor. Pinchot relied heavily upon Brandis' advice for introducing professional forest management in the U.S. and on how to structure the Forest Service when Pinchot established it in 1905.

Article: Millions of families around the world have been given a helping hand out of poverty   by micro-credits. These very small loans  , usually less than US200, have enabled the very poorest people to set up or expand businesses and become self-sufficient. The micro-credit movement started with Professor Muhammad Yunus, who founded the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. Professor Yunus, who won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize, used his own money to set up a bank to benefit the poorest people in Bangladesh--families living on less than US1 a day. There are now hundreds of organizations around the world following his blueprint to help people escape from poverty. So how does the system work? Local microfinance institutions (MFIs) make contact with families and offer loans, usually to women, to enable them to start or expand a business. These are very poor people who would not normally be able to get credit, but as no collateral   is required they can get micro-credits. They pay back the loan on a weekly basis, over six months to a year. A very important aspect to the success of the micro-credit system is that receivers get local support. The MFIs educate local communities about ways to improve their lives, and offer practical support as well as collecting weekly loans payments. They encourage people to help each other, so that the whole community can pull itself out of poverty. MFIs may also help with literacy and health problems. Micro-credits are mainly given to women. Experience has shown that women are more motivated to improve their children's lives and will spend the money they make on better nutrition and schooling for their children. This may be the first chance they've had to contribute financially to the family, and their status in the home and the local community is raised. The micro-credit system is not charity.

Q:Article: I was waiting in line to register a letter in the post office at Thirty-third Street and Eighth Avenue in New York. I noticed that the clerk appeared to be bored with the job--weighing envelopes, handing out stamps, and issuing receipts--the same dull work year after year. So I said to myself, \\"I am going to try to make that clerk like me. Obviously, to make him like me, I must say something nice, not about myself, but about him.\\" So I asked myself, \\"What is there about him that I can honestly admire?\\" That is sometimes a hard question to answer, especially with strangers. However, in this case, it happened to be easy. I instantly saw something I admired very much. So while he was weighing my envelope, I remarked with enthusiasm, \\"I certainly wish I had your hair.\\" He looked up and his face was full of smiles. \\"Well, it isn't as good as it used to be,\\" he said modestly. We carried on a pleasant conversation and the last thing he said to me was, \\"Many people have admired my hair.\\" I'll bet that person went out to lunch that day walking on air. I'll bet he went home that night and told his wife about it. I'll bet he looked in the mirror and said, \\"It is a beautiful head of hair.\\" There is one all--important law of human conduct. If we obey that law, we shall almost never get into trouble. In fact, that law, if obeyed, will bring us countless friends and constant happiness. But the very instant we break the law, we shall get into endless trouble. The law is this: Always make the other person feel important. Question: The author commented on the clerk's hair to_. Yes or no, is the answer \\"win his kindness\\"? A:","output":"Yes, the answer is \\"win his kindness.\\" The author aimed to make the clerk like him by saying something nice about the clerk, in this case, complimenting his hair. This action follows the all-important law of human conduct mentioned in the article, which states that making the other person feel important would bring positive outcomes, such as kindness in this situation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The bully noticed it too, and came near to inquire about this hand stuff. I described the trick and he was impressed. And then, I saw our teacher walking up the corridor, just a couple paces behind the class door. So, I asked him (the bully) if he wanted to see another trick and to that he nodded a big yes.

For example, in the United States, colonial and early federal history were periods of numerous interracial relationships, both outside and inside slavery. This has resulted in a majority of people who identify as African American having some European ancestors. Similarly, many people who identify as white have some African ancestors.

A lot of people have a very mixed ancestry, which means they have many different colors of crayons in them.

Where can I get affordable shopping experience for floor tiles?","output":"While these two questions might seem similar on the surface because they both ask about getting affordable floor tiles, they are not exactly the same and require two subtly different answers. The first question, \\"Where can I get an affordable package in Sydney for floor tiles?\\" is asking for places in Sydney where one can purchase a set or bundle of floor tiles at a reasonable price. This implies you're after a deal where tiles are bundled together, potentially with other services like delivery or installation included. The expectation in such a context is that buying in bulk or in a package would be more cost-effective than purchasing individual items. The answer to this question should hence focus on suppliers or retailers that offer good prices on package deals for floor tiles, like wholesalers, factories that supply directly to the public, or large home improvement stores that offer bundled options. The second question, \\"Where can I get an affordable shopping experience for floor tiles?\\" circles around the general shopping experience for floor tiles that is affordable. The question is not only interested in the price of the tiles but also in the overall cost-efficiency of the shopping experience. This could include factors like the price of the tiles, but also the range and selection available, the advice and service you get from staff, the convenience of the location, parking or delivery options, and even potential return policies. While price is a definable and immediate factor, 'experience' suggests a broader consideration that includes both tangible and intangible elements of the entire shopping journey. Therefore, the answer to this question should focus on identifying shops or suppliers that offer good service, have a wide range of options, and perhaps flexible shopping options like online orders, home delivery, or good opening hours, in addition to affordable prices.

Let me explain these questions to you in a simple way. First question: When you use private browsing, it's like going on an adventure while wearing a special cloak that helps hide the things you do on your journey. But, remember, our friend - the internet service provider, or ISP - can still see where you go, even if you have that special cloak on. It's like they have a magic map that shows where you've been. Second question: This one is asking if you can make the magic map go blank, so our friend the ISP can't see where you went on your adventure. Unfortunately, we can't make that map go totally blank, but there are some tricks like using a magical tunnel (called a VPN) that can help make it harder for them to see your journey.

Would \\"The song stayed in the U.S. charts for such a long time that it managed to make Billboards top 100 Pop Singles of 1983, at #88, a rare feat for a single with such a low peak position.\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","output":"Answer: The statement, \\"The song stayed in the U.S. charts for such a long time that it managed to make Billboards top 100 Pop Singles of 1983, at #88, a rare feat for a single with such a low peak position.\\" could indeed serve as a reasonable answer to the question, \\"What about me moving pictures?\\" However, it is important to provide additional context and information to further enhance the response. To clarify, \\"What About Me\\" is a song by the Australian rock band Moving Pictures. It was released as part of their debut album, \\"Days of Innocence,\\" in 1982. The song quickly gained popularity in Australia and eventually climbed to the #1 spot on the Australian Kent Music Report chart. Its popularity led to its release in the United States, where it reached the top 30 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1983. Concerning the statement, it highlights the notable achievement of the song in the U.S. market. \\"The song stayed in the U.S. charts for such a long time that it managed to make Billboard's top 100 Pop Singles of 1983, at #88, a rare feat for a single with such a low peak position.\\" This underscores the fact that reaching such a position on the annual top 100 chart is unusual for a song that did not enjoy a higher peak position on the weekly charts. This suggests the song's ongoing success and sustained appeal among U.S. listeners over an extended period. Moreover, it is important to provide more details on what made the song so enduring. \\"What About Me\\" had a catchy melody and memorable lyrics that resonated with a wide audience. The song's theme of feeling overlooked and wanting recognition struck a chord with many listeners, and it became an anthem for those who felt left behind or unappreciated. In the context of Moving Pictures as a band, \\"What About Me\\" was their most successful single, and it helped establish them in the global music scene. Although they later released more albums, they never managed to replicate the phenomenal success of \\"What About Me.\\" The song remains an enduring classic and a testament to the band's talent and the power of music that resonates with people's emotions and experiences. Hence, in light of this added context and information, the initial statement serves as a reasonable answer to the question, \\"What about me moving pictures?\\" as it emphasizes the song's incredible achievement in the U.S. charts and its sustained appeal, while the further explanation provides greater insights into the song and its significance in Moving Pictures' career."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The chill of the January afternoon pierced her through, but it was fear, more than the cold, that made her limbs shake. Having just crossed over to the Left Bank, she glanced back over her shoulder and saw the towers and spires of the royal palace across the Seine. She felt as if hidden eyes there were watching her. Could anyone on the palace wall have seen her walk over the Petit-Pont? Not Amalric. He was still in the south, the King having just appointed him seneschal for Beziers and the surrounding country. But he had so many agents in Paris and allies at court. Except for Agnes, all the servants in the Gobignon town house were loyal to him. His aunt, Queen Blanche, was forever praising him to all who would listen. If Nicolette were involved in scandal, the White Queen would be furious, and would see to it that word reached Amalric. And if indeed he found out about her meeting the troubadour? Just a message, a song, let alone a meeting like this one, could mean death for her and Orlando. I should turn around right now, cross this bridge, and run back to the palace. The streets of the Latin Quarter were crawling with ruffians and criminals - it was insane for her to be walking here alone after sunset. The sight of the small knife she carried under her cloak might deter an attacker, but then she would be discovered. If I screamed for help, the whole palace would find out. Blanche would demand to know why I was here. No, she thought, her blood turning to ice, she would know why. But those eyes of his? to look into them again, was that not worth any risk? She stood, vacillating, in the shadows by a wooden house that overhung the Rue Saint-Jacques. I must see Orlando, she thought. Over a year now, and I have not been able to forget him.

A. tennis racket  B. skill  C. competition  D. tennis court  E. legs  The best answer is Answer:","output":"All the options provided: A. tennis racket, B. skill, C. competition, D. tennis court, E. legs, contribute to being good at playing tennis.  A. Tennis Racket: This is one of the basic requirements to play tennis. The choice of a racket is very important. Rackets come in a variety of weights, sizes, and compositions. A tennis player must find the right balance that suits their playing style. Certain characteristics such as weight, size and tension of the string can directly affect the force of the swing, the trajectory of the ball and even the risk of injury. Therefore, understanding and choosing the right tennis racket is a key step toward excelling in the game. B. Skill: This is a critical component in tennis, a sport where technique matters as much, if not more, than physical condition. To develop skill, a player must undertake regular practice to improve every aspect of the game. This includes serve, groundstrokes like forehand and backhand, volleys, lobs, and footwork. Tactical skills also play a role such as understanding when to play a certain shot, reading the game well, and managing different game situations. C. Competition: Playing competitively allows a player to analyze their level of performance, and understand what skills need to be worked on. Competition also instills mental resilience and helps players learn to handle pressure. Higher the competition, greater is the opportunity for improvement. Facing different styles of game play in high-pressure situations can teach valuable lessons about adaptability and perseverance. D. Tennis Court: Understanding the court is crucial to graszing the essence of the game. Each court surface can impact the pace and bounce of the ball: grass courts are fast but have a low bounce, clay courts provide high bounce and are slow, and hard courts are generally fast with a high bounce. Knowing these differences and practicing regularly on various types of courts can help you adapt quickly during matches and enhance your overall performance as a tennis player. E. Legs: Tennis requires a considerable amount of movement: running towards the ball, setting your feet right to strike it, moving backwards for a lob, moving forward for a volley, and side-to-side for groundstrokes. So, having strong and agile legs is important. In fact, certain players have been able to overcome limitations in other areas with exceptional footwork and leg strength. Regular fitness training, including strength exercises for the legs, is a must to keep up with the physical demands of the game. So to be good at playing tennis, one requires a combination of all these elements: the right equipment (tennis racket), technical and tactical skills, experience gained through competition, a deep understanding of playing surfaces (tennis court), and physical fitness (especially leg strength and agility)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Though hooded and cloaked, Nicolette trembled. The chill of the January afternoon pierced her through, but it was fear, more than the cold, that made her limbs shake. Having just crossed over to the Left Bank, she glanced back over her shoulder and saw the towers and spires of the royal palace across the Seine. She felt as if hidden eyes there were watching her. Could anyone on the palace wall have seen her walk over the Petit-Pont? Not Amalric. He was still in the south, the King having just appointed him seneschal for Beziers and the surrounding country. But he had so many agents in Paris and allies at court. Except for Agnes, all the servants in the Gobignon town house were loyal to him. His aunt, Queen Blanche, was forever praising him to all who would listen. If Nicolette were involved in scandal, the White Queen would be furious, and would see to it that word reached Amalric. And if indeed he found out about her meeting the troubadour? Just a message, a song, let alone a meeting like this one, could mean death for her and Orlando. I should turn around right now, cross this bridge, and run back to the palace. The streets of the Latin Quarter were crawling with ruffians and criminals - it was insane for her to be walking here alone after sunset. The sight of the small knife she carried under her cloak might deter an attacker, but then she would be discovered. If I screamed for help, the whole palace would find out. Blanche would demand to know why I was here. No, she thought, her blood turning to ice, she would know why. But those eyes of his? to look into them again, was that not worth any risk? She stood, vacillating, in the shadows by a wooden house that overhung the Rue Saint-Jacques. I must see Orlando, she thought. Over a year now, and I have not been able to forget him. She longed just to be alone with him and have him take her in his arms. Question: What did Nicolette look back at after crossing the bridge?

Use a heavy-bottom saucepan, which will help distribute the heat evenly and prevent burning. Stir constantly until the water boils and the sugar begins to dissolve.","output":"After the sugar has started to dissolve in the boiling water, you will notice that the mixture will gradually begin to change in color and texture as it turns into caramel syrup. The process will continue as follows: 1. As the sugar dissolves, the mixture will transform from a slightly thick, clear liquid into an amber hue. It's essential to control the heat during this stage, as caramel can burn quickly. If necessary, reduce the heat to medium or medium-low to achieve a steady simmer without scorching. 2. Once the caramel reaches the desired amber color, keep an eye on the consistency. It should be thick and glossy but still pourable. Be patient during this process, for it may take a few minutes. Again, practice caution not to overcook the caramel, as it can turn bitter. 3. When the caramel reaches the desired color and consistency, remove the saucepan from the heat. Immediately and carefully pour the caramel into a flan mold or baking dish. Swirl or tilt the mold to evenly distribute the caramel along the bottom and sides, ensuring that it forms a complete layer. Be mindful that caramel is extremely hot at this stage, and it’s important to avoid contact with your skin. 4. Allow the caramel layer to cool and set in the flan mold. This may take around 10-15 minutes. While this is happening, preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C). 5. Now, it's time to prepare the custard mixture. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together 1 can of evaporated milk, 1 can of sweetened condensed milk, 5 large eggs, 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract, a pinch of salt, and 8 ounces of cream cheese until smooth. 6. Once the caramel has set, gently pour the custard mixture over the caramel layer in the flan mold. 7. To bake the cheese flan using the water bath (bain-marie) method, place the filled flan mold into a larger, deep baking pan. Pour hot water into the larger pan until it reaches halfway up the sides of the flan mold. This will help the custard cook evenly and maintain a smooth texture. 8. Carefully place the pan with the flan mold and water bath into the preheated oven. Bake the cheese flan for approximately 60-75 minutes or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. 9. After baking, remove the flan mold from the water bath and allow it to cool on a wire rack for about 30 minutes. Then, cover the mold with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or preferably overnight. 10. When ready to serve, run a sharp knife around the edges of the flan to loosen it from the mold. Invert the mold onto a serving plate, allowing the custard to release and the caramel to flow over the top and sides of the cheese flan. 11. Slice the cheese flan and serve it chilled, garnished with fresh berries or a dollop of whipped cream, if desired. Enjoy this delicious and creamy dessert!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is \\"Mali lies in the torrid zone and is among the hottest countries in the world.\\" a good answer to the question \\"Mali is located in what Zone?\\"","output":"While the statement \\"Mali lies in the torrid zone and is among the hottest countries in the world\\" is not incorrect and provides some relevant information about the country's climate, it does not precisely answer the question \\"Mali is located in what zone?\\" A more detailed and long answer would be as follows: Mali, a landlocked country in West Africa, is situated in the sub-Saharan region and occupies the Torrid Zone or The Tropics, which is a geographical region largely defined by its characteristic hot temperatures that can be found between the Tropic of Cancer (23.5° N latitude) and the Tropic of Capricorn (23.5° S latitude). The Torrid Zone receives direct sunlight throughout the year, resulting in consistently high temperatures. Due to its position within the tropics, Mali's climate consists predominantly of arid and semi-arid zones, characterized by high temperatures and minimal precipitation. The country has distinct climatic zones, which can be broadly categorized into three regions: the Saharan Zone in the north, characterized by extreme heat and low rainfall; the Sahel Zone in the central region, where annual precipitation ranges between 200 and 600 millimeters and annual temperatures can reach over 40°C (104°F); and the Sudanian or Sudano-Guinean Zone in the southern part of the country, which has slightly higher rainfall (600 to 1,200 mm annually). It is also essential to note that throughout these climatic zones, Mali experiences vast temperature variations between its day and night temperatures. Despite the overwhelming heat during the daytime, nighttime temperatures can drop drastically, creating a contrasting temperature range. Apart from being located in the Torrid Zone, Mali's position in the world's hottest countries list is also influenced by the intensifying effects of climate change, land degradation, and desertification, which have exacerbated an already challenging situation for the nation's weather-related concerns.  In summary, Mali is located in the Torrid Zone or the Tropics region, where it experiences significant heat and minimal rainfall. The country's climate can be divided into three significant climatic zones – the Saharan Zone, the Sahel Zone, and the Sudanian or Sudano-Guinean Zone – which further illustrate the prevailing arid and semi-arid conditions throughout the nation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"To prevent the end of a rope from fraying when making a hangman's noose for securing a backpack, you can follow several effective methods. This will ensure that your noose remains strong and durable for backpack support. Here are three recommended techniques for accomplishing this goal: 1. Whipping: Whipping is a widely used method to keep rope ends from fraying. It involves wrapping a smaller cord or thread tightly around the end of the rope and then securing it with a knot. Follow these steps: a. Cut a thin piece of twine or string that is about 12 inches long. b. Lay one end of the rope horizontally and form a loop with the string, placing it on top of the rope end with the loop facing away from the end. c. Wind the string tightly around the end of the rope, starting around 1/4 inch from the rope end. Keep winding until you reach the end of the string, leaving the loop exposed. d. Pass the free end of the string through the exposed loop. e. Pull the other end of the string that's wound around the rope to tighten the loop around the string end. f. Trim the excess string for a neat appearance. 2. Fusing/Soldering: Fusing the rope end is another effective method to prevent fraying, especially for synthetic ropes. This involves melting the rope fibers to create a solid end. Use these steps: a. Using a lighter or a small torch, carefully heat the end of the rope until the fibers start to melt. Be cautious not to burn too much or set the rope on fire. b. As the fibers melt, use a pair of pliers or a flat metal object to press the melted fibers together to create a compact, fused end. Ensure the rope end maintains a rounded appearance. c. Allow the rope to cool and harden before handling it. 3. Knotting: Knotting the end of the rope is a quick and simple method to prevent fraying. One suitable knot for this purpose is the simple overhand knot. Follow these steps: a. Hold the end of the rope, leaving about 3-4 inches as a tail. b. Form a loop with the tail by bringing the end over the standing part of the rope. c. Pass the end through the loop. d. Pull the knot tight, ensuring the tail remains within the knot and is not exposed. Each of these methods is useful to prevent rope ends from fraying, and the choice depends on your personal preference, available tools, and the type of rope you are using. Whipping provides a neat and tight finish, while fusing or soldering is more suited for synthetic ropes. Knotting is the simplest method and does not require any additional tools or materials, but may not be as polished as the other techniques."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I read this background article the other day: Wildfire intensity increases during daytime hours. For example, burn rates of smoldering logs are up to five times greater during the day because of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground during the day and causes air currents to travel uphill, and downhill during the night as the land cools. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys.

Marlin rode low in the saddle, his shoulders curled against the hungry wind. His hat was pulled down tight and his eyes didn't move as he passed the crude shacks at the edge of town. He tied his horse in front of the saloon, unwinding his long body as if a sudden movement might snap it. He turned down the collar of his greatcoat and checked to make sure his big Army Colt was loose in its holster. The saloon door was a single chunk of white pine, still oozing sap, and he had to put his shoulder to it to force it open. The long room inside was quiet, and not much warmer than the street. Clusters of people sat nursing coffee and drinks, talking quietly if they talked at all. Marlin spotted a few farmers the railroad had brought in from Europe: rounded hats, nervous eyes, skin as red as blood. At the far end of the room a half-dozen cowboys turned over cards with patient boredom. Marlin walked up to the bar. \\"Whiskey,\\" he said, and when the drink came he tossed it straight down and felt it pull his lips into a grimace. He nodded for a refill. When he turned to face the room they were all watching him. \\"I'm looking for a man named Kraamer,\\" Marlin said. \\"Anybody here know of him?\\" One of the cowboys turned casually and rang the spittoon with a stream of tobacco juice. Marlin knew the long, thin face from somewhere, the blond hair that fell limply to his shoulders. He smiled at Marlin and showed his brown-stained teeth. Marlin felt the lines in his own face, the gray in his hair, the chill in his bones. He was too old for this.

Context: SEOUL — Arms control experts estimate that the dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program could take a decade to complete, and cost 20 billion, if a nuclear agreement is reached between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un when they meet in Singapore on June 12. “The hard work has not yet begun, and it is gong to take sustained energy on the part of the United States, South Korea, Japan, China and North Korea. It’s going to be a multiyear long process,” said Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington. President Trump has said he expects a \\"very positive result\\" from the North Korea nuclear summit, but he also said it will likely be the beginning of a process to resolve differences over the extent of the North’s denuclearization, and the specifics regarding what sanctions relief, economic aid and security guarantees would be offered in return. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday that North Korea would only receive sanctions relief after it takes \\"verifiable and irreversible steps to denuclearization.\\" This position aligns closer to the Kim government’s stance that denuclearization measures and concessions be matched action for action. And it backs away from demands made by some in the president’s national security team that Pyongyang quickly and unilaterally dismantle all its weapons of mass destruction before any concessions would be offered. North Korea is estimated to have 20 to 80 nuclear warheads, both known and covert nuclear research and processing sites, and thousands of ballistic missiles that can be launched from mobile vehicles, and submarine based launchers have been tested in recent years. With such an extensive nuclear arsenal it could cost 20 billion to achieve the U.S. goal of complete, irreversible, and verifiable nuclear dismantlement (CVID), according to a recent study conducted by Kwon Hyuk-chul, a Kookmin University professor of security strategy.

She is taking a road trip to meet small groups of voters in Iowa, having announced her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination on Sunday. She had been expected to declare her candidacy for months. Mrs Clinton ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008 but lost to Barack Obama. A few hours into her journey from New York to Iowa, Mrs Clinton tweeted: \\"Road trip! Loaded the van & set off for IA. Met a great family when we stopped this afternoon. Many more to come. -H.\\" Mrs Clinton's team said she would spend the next few weeks building up grassroots support in the early Democratic primary states. Her first rally, to officially kick off her campaign, is not expected until mid-May. But her trip to Iowa is to be a \\"listening tour\\" where Mrs Clinton will meet voters at low-key events. Later this week, she is expected to meet groups of students, teachers and small business owners. On Sunday, Mrs Clinton launched her campaign website and declared in a video that she was running for president. \\"Americans have fought their way back from tough economic times,\\" she said, \\"but the deck is still stacked in favour of those at the top. She added that she wanted to be a champion for \\"everyday Americans\\". The video features a number of Americans talking about their hopes and aspirations. The launch of Hillary Clinton's campaign for the presidency was meant to be low-key. It was meant to reflect the idea that it was all about ordinary Americans and the everyday concerns of the middle class. But whether she likes it or not, Mrs Clinton is a huge name in politics and reinventing herself as the embodiment of change won't be easy. True, she is unlikely to face any stiff competition from her own side for the nomination, but Republicans have been unrelenting in their attacks on her and that will only increase. She will also have to find a convincing vision for America that will capture the imagination of the voters. Elections are usually about the future and Mrs Clinton has to prove that she's not all about the past. How Twitter reacted Is this Hillary Clinton's time? Mrs Clinton has already had the backing of Mr Obama, who said on Saturday that she would make an \\"excellent president\\". But the attacks from Republicans have already started. Jeb Bush, former Florida Governor and brother of George W Bush who expected to stand as a Republican candidate, tweeted: \\"We must do better than Hillary.\\" In his own online video on Sunday, he focused on foreign policy, saying: \\"We must do better than the Obama-Clinton foreign policy that has damaged relationships with our allies and emboldened our enemies.\\" Another Republican presidential contender. Rand Paul, also criticised Mrs Clinton for her handling of a September 2012 attack on a US diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, in which the US ambassador was among those killed. He also said questions remained about funds received by a charity set up by Mr and Mrs Clinton. Republican Senator Marco Rubio is expected to announce his candidacy for his party's nomination at an event in Miami later on Monday.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Stockholm (or ) is the capital of Sweden and the most populous city in the Nordic countries; 932,917 people live in the municipality, approximately 1.5 million in the urban area, and 2.3 million in the metropolitan area. The city is spread across 14 islands on the coast in the southeast of Sweden at the mouth of Lake Mälaren, by the Stockholm archipelago and the Baltic Sea. The area has been settled since the Stone Age, in the 6th millennium BC, and was founded as a city in 1252 by a Swedish statesman Birger Jarl. It is also the capital of Stockholm County.  - Jämtland (Norwegian: \\"Jemtland\\"; Latin: \\"Iemptia\\") or Jamtland is a historical province (\\"landskap\\") in the center of Sweden in northern Europe. It borders to Härjedalen and Medelpad in the south, Ångermanland in the east, Lapland in the north and Trøndelag and Norway in the west. Jämtland covers an area of 34,009 square kilometres, 8.3% of Sweden's total area and is the second largest province in Sweden. It has a population of 112,717, the majority of whom live in \\"Storsjöbygden\\", the area surrounding lake Storsjön. Östersund is Jämtland's only city and is the 24th most populous city in Sweden.  - Jan Mayen is a volcanic island in the Arctic Ocean and a part of Norway. It is long (southwest-northeast) and in area, partly covered by glaciers (an area of around the Beerenberg volcano). It has two parts: larger northeast Nord-Jan and smaller Sør-Jan, linked by a wide isthmus. It lies northeast of Iceland (495 km (305 mi) NE of Kolbeinsey), east of central Greenland and west of the North Cape, Norway. The island is mountainous, the highest summit being the Beerenberg volcano in the north. The isthmus is the location of the two largest lakes of the island, Sørlaguna (South Lagoon), and Nordlaguna (North Lagoon). A third lake is called Ullerenglaguna (Ullereng Lagoon). Jan Mayen was formed by the Jan Mayen hotspot.  - Orkney, also known as the Orkney Islands, is an archipelago in the Northern Isles of Scotland, situated off the north coast of Great Britain. Orkney is 16 kilometres (10 mi) north of the coast of Caithness and comprises approximately 70 islands, of which 20 are inhabited. The largest island Mainland is often referred to as \\"the Mainland\\". It has an area of , making it the sixth-largest Scottish island and the tenth-largest island in the British Isles. The largest settlement and administrative centre is Kirkwall.  - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.  - A monarchy is a form of government in which a group, usually a family called the dynasty, embodies the country's national identity and one of its members, called the monarch, exercises a role of sovereignty. The actual power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic (crowned republic), to partial and restricted (\\"constitutional\\" monarchy), to completely autocratic (\\"absolute\\" monarchy). Traditionally and in most cases, the monarch's post is inherited and lasts until death or abdication, but there are also elective monarchies where the monarch is elected. Each of these has variations: in some elected monarchies only those of certain pedigrees are, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, and other factors. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose legitimacy is subject to effective election. Finally, there have been cases where the term of a monarch's reign is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance. Thus there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy. Monarchy was the most common form of government until the 19th century, but it is no longer prevalent. Where it exists, it is now usually a constitutional monarchy, in which the monarch retains a unique legal and ceremonial role, but exercises limited or no official political power: under the written or unwritten constitution, others have governing authority. Currently, 47 sovereign nations in the world have monarchs acting as heads of state, 19 of which are Commonwealth realms that recognise Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state. All European monarchies are constitutional ones, with the exception of the Vatican City which is an elective monarchy, but sovereigns in the smaller states exercise greater political influence than in the larger. The monarchs of Cambodia, Japan, and Malaysia \\"reign, but do not rule\\" although there is considerable variation in the degree of...  - Peter I Island is an uninhabited volcanic island in the Bellingshausen Sea, from Antarctica. It is claimed as a dependency of Norway, and along with Queen Maud Land and Bouvet Island comprises one of the three Norwegian dependent territories in the Antarctic and Subantarctic. Peter I Island is long and , slightly larger than Staten Island. The tallest peak is the ultra and tall Lars Christensen Peak. Nearly all of the island is covered by a glacier and it is surrounded most of the year by pack ice, making it inaccessible almost all year round. There is little life on the island apart from seabirds and seals.  - Shetland , also called the Shetland Islands, is a subarctic archipelago that lies northeast of the island of Great Britain and forms part of Scotland, United Kingdom.  - Fennoscandia , Fenno-Scandinavia, or the Fennoscandian Peninsula, is the geographical peninsula of the Nordic region comprising the Scandinavian Peninsula, Finland, Karelia, and the Kola Peninsula. It encompasses Finland, Norway and Sweden, as well as Murmansk Oblast, much of the Republic of Karelia and parts of northern Leningrad Oblast in Russia. Its name comes from the Latin words \\"Fennia\\" (Finland) and \\"Scandia\\" (Scandinavian). The term was first used by the Finnish geologist Wilhelm Ramsay in 1898. Geologically, the area is distinct because its bedrock is Archaean granite and gneiss with very little limestone, in contrast to neighboring areas in Europe.  - The Gulf of Finland  is the easternmost arm of the Baltic Sea. It extends between Finland (to the north) and Estonia (to the south) all the way to Saint Petersburg in Russia, where the river Neva drains into it. Other major cities around the gulf include Helsinki and Tallinn. The eastern parts of the Gulf of Finland belong to Russia, and some of Russia's most important oil harbours are located farthest in, near Saint Petersburg (including Primorsk). As the seaway to Saint Petersburg, the Gulf of Finland has been and continues to be of considerable strategic importance to Russia. Some of the environmental problems affecting the Baltic Sea are at their most pronounced in the shallow gulf.  - Since the United States was recognized as an independent country in 1783, it first established diplomatic relations with Norway in 1818 when Jonathan Russell was accepted as the Minister Plenipotentiary to Sweden and Norway. From 1814 to 1905, Sweden and Norway were in a personal union. Although each country was fully sovereign, they had a common foreign policy and diplomatic service. The United States Ambassador to Sweden thus was the US representative to Norway as well as Sweden. In 1905 Sweden and Norway peacefully separated and Norway continued to be an independent constitutional monarchy. On November 14, 1905, the US State Department instructed Ambassador Charles H. Graves to handle affairs for Sweden and Norway separately and the Ambassador was thus commissioned to Norway equally with Sweden, though he remained in Stockholm.  - Charles Hinman \\"C. H.\\" Graves (August 14, 1839  October 7, 1928) was an American army officer, politician, and diplomat.  - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines.  - Nynorsk, literally New Norwegian or New Norse, is one of the two written standards of the Norwegian language, the other being Bokmål. From 1885, when the parliament declared them official and equal, until new voting in 1929, their names were Landsmål and Riksmål. The Landsmål language standard was constructed by the Norwegian linguist Ivar Aasen during the mid-19th century, to provide a Norwegian-based alternative to Danish, which was commonly written, and to some extent spoken, in Norway at the time. The official standard of Nynorsk has since been significantly altered. A minor purist fraction of the Nynorsk populace has stayed firm with the Aasen norm, which is known as Høgnorsk (analogous to High German).  - The Gulf of Bothnia is the northernmost arm of the Baltic Sea. It is situated between Finland's west coast and Sweden's east coast. In the south of the gulf lie the Åland Islands, between the Sea of Åland and the Archipelago Sea.  - Bohuslän is a Swedish province in Götaland, on the northernmost part of the country's west coast. It is bordered by Dalsland to the northeast, Västergötland to the southeast, the Skagerrak arm of the North Sea to the west, and the county of Østfold, in Norway, to the north.  - The Scandinavian Peninsula (;  \\"Skandinavsky poluostrov\\") is a peninsula in Northern Europe, which generally comprises the mainland of Sweden, the mainland of Norway (with the exception of a small coastal area bordering Russia), the northwestern area of Finland, as well as a narrow area in the west of the Pechengsky District of Russia.  - Russia (from the  Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.  - Bouvet Island (Norwegian: Bouvetøya, previously spelled Bouvet-øya) is an uninhabited subantarctic high island and dependency of Norway located in the South Atlantic Ocean at . It lies at the southern end of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and is the most remote island in the world, approximately south-southwest of the coast of South Africa and approximately north of the Princess Astrid Coast of Queen Maud Land, Antarctica.  - Antarctica (US English , UK English or ) is Earth's southernmost continent. It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. At , it is the fifth-largest continent. For comparison, Antarctica is nearly twice the size of Australia. About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages in thickness, which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula.  - This is a list of Ambassadors of the United States to Finland.  - Finland , officially the Republic of Finland, is a sovereign state in Northern Europe. A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west, the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east. Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland. Finland is a Nordic country situated in the geographical region of Fennoscandia, which also includes Scandinavia. Finland's population is 5.5 million (2014), staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades. The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region. In terms of area, it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union.  - The Republic of Iceland, \\"Lýðveldið Ísland\\" in Icelandic, is a Nordic island country in the North Atlantic Ocean. It has a population of and an area of , making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe. The capital and largest city is Reykjavík. Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate.  - Svalbard (formerly known by its Dutch name Spitsbergen) is a Norwegian archipelago in the Arctic Ocean. Situated north of mainland Europe, it is about midway between continental Norway and the North Pole. The islands of the group range from 74° to 81° north latitude, and from 10° to 35° east longitude. The largest island is Spitsbergen, followed by Nordaustlandet and Edgeøya.  - The United States Ambassador to Sweden serves as the official diplomatic representative of the President and the Government of the United States of America to the King and the Government of the Kingdom of Sweden. Diplomatic relations between Sweden and the United States began with the signing of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce in 1783.   - Härjedalen is a historical province or \\"landskap\\" in the centre of Sweden. It borders the country of Norway as well as the provinces of Dalarna, Hälsingland, Medelpad, and Jämtland. The province originally belonged to Norway, but was ceded to Sweden in the Treaty of Brömsebro, 1645.  - Mark Evans Austad ( April 1 , 1917 -- October 20 , 1988 ) , was an American radio and television commentator in Washington D.C.

Bokmål is the preferred written standard of Norwegian for 85% to 90% of the population in Norway, and is most used by people who speak Standard Østnorsk.  - The Faroe Islands (Irish: \\"Na Scigirí\\") are an archipelago between the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic approximately halfway between Norway and Iceland, north-northwest of mainland Scotland. The area is approximately with a 2016 population of 49,188. The islands are an autonomous country within the Kingdom of Denmark.  - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas.  - Northern Europe is the northern part or region of Europe. Although no definitive borders or definition exists for the term, geographically, Northern Europe may be considered to consist approximately of all of Europe above the 52nd parallel north; which includes (from west to east) most or all of: Iceland, the Republic of Ireland, the Isle of Man, the United Kingdom, the Faroe Islands, the Netherlands, northern Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, northern Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and northwest Russia. However, narrower definitions may also be used based on other geographical factors, such as climate and ecology. Greenland, geographically a part of North America, is politically a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and may be included depending on the definition.  - Queen Maud Land is a c. 2.7 million-square-kilometre (1 million sq mi) region of Antarctica claimed as a dependent territory by Norway. The territory lies between 20° west and 45° east, between the British Antarctic Territory to the west and the Australian Antarctic Territory to the east. On most maps there had been an unclaimed area between Queen Maud Land's borders of 1939 and the South Pole until June 12, 2015 when Norway formally annexed that area. Positioned in East Antarctica, the territory comprises about one-fifth of the total area of Antarctica. The claim is named after the Norwegian queen Maud of Wales (18691938).  - Greenland  is an autonomous constituent country within the Danish Realm between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island.  - A constitutional monarchy (also known as a parliamentary monarchy) is a form of monarchy in which the sovereign exercises their authorities in accordance with a written or unwritten constitution. Constitutional monarchy differs from absolute monarchy (in which a monarch holds absolute power), in that constitutional monarchs are bound to exercise their powers and authorities within the limits prescribed within an established legal framework. Constitutional monarchies range from countries such as Morocco, where the constitution grants substantial discretionary powers to the sovereign, to countries such as Sweden or Denmark where the monarch retains very few formal authorities.

She ordered ginger ale to drink instead of lemonade because the","output":"effervescence and spiciness of the ginger ale felt more invigorating and soothing for her taste buds. The tingling sensation that the tiny carbonation bubbles provided as they met her tongue was a delight that she craved, especially after a long day at work. In addition, she had read that ginger had numerous health benefits, which was a definite bonus in her quest for a healthier lifestyle.  Ginger ale, a concoction of ginger root, sugar, and carbonated water, had always reminded her of special moments and the times her mother would make a batch from scratch when she was feeling under the weather. It evoked a sense of comfort and nostalgia. Her mother's use of fresh ginger not only added an extra kick to the drink but also was known for its potential medicinal properties, such as soothing an upset stomach, reducing inflammation, and even mitigating symptoms of the common cold. The zesty, sweet taste of the ginger ale provided a perfect balance for her; it was neither too sweet nor too acidic. Drinking lemonade, on the other hand, always left her with an unpleasant sensation on her teeth and tongue, likely due to the high levels of citric acid found in the citrus fruit. Although she appreciated the tartness that lemonade had, she couldn't overlook the lingering sour aftertaste it would leave behind. Opting for ginger ale also allowed her to step away from the crowd and choose a drink that set her apart from the throngs of people who religiously ordered the ever-so-popular lemonade. In fact, she found satisfaction in going against the norm, knowing her unique choice of drink represented her strong and independent personality. Every sip of the ginger ale was like a reaffirmation of her identity and a reminder to embrace her individuality. Moreover, ginger ale had often been her go-to drink while traveling, as it helped alleviate her motion sickness. When she sipped on a chilled glass of ginger ale, the memories of her many adventures filled her with warmth and happiness. As a fan of mixology, she also recognized that ginger ale was quite versatile and could be used as a mixer in various cocktails, thereby offering her an extensive range of unique and enjoyable beverages. The drink possessed a certain sophistication that she loved incorporating into her social engagements and gatherings. Overall, the choice of ginger ale over lemonade represented much more to her than just a simple preference for a beverage. It was a direct symbol of her personal connection to the past, her identity, her focus on health, and her appreciation for the unique and unconventional elements in life. Each time she ordered her beloved ginger ale, she was indulging in more than just a drink; she was reliving cherished memories and celebrating the essence of who she truly was."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Despite always being fans of the most popular genre of fiction in the world, Melanie Milburne and Ally Blake fell into their sexy writing style and have now penned almost 100 romantic pieces between them. Hopeless romantics at heart, the women love their fun jobs and say their husbands try to cheekily take credit as their ongoing inspiration for the kinky bedroom chapters. Ally Blake drops her three children at school then goes to cafe and writes her raunchy novels. Hopeless romantics - Ally and Mark got married in Las Vegas in 2000 and honeymooned throughout the U.S. Mark claims that he is Ally's ongoing inspiration for her risque Mills & Boon novels. Melanie, who lives in Hobart, has always wanted to be a writer but with a husband doing crazy hours as a surgeon she needed to hold down the fort at home and care for their two sons. It wasn't until her boys were in their teens that she found the time to give writing a go and has now written 64 Mills & Boon books in the past 12 years. 'I couldn't stop writing and the rest is history,' she said. 'I had all of these ideas backed up inside my head because I had wanted to write my whole life.' Her sons were 'quietly embarrassed' about their mother's new raunchy writing career but now adults themselves - they have an appreciation Melanie's books. 'My husband is also very proud of my career and is always offering himself up for \\"research\\", she said.

'His idea is to add an alien ship which is not terribly helpful in the genre.' Ally also sold the first book that she submitted to Mills & Boon 12 years - and 30 books - ago. The 40-year-old now drops off her two girls, 7 and 5, and her son, 4, to school before getting stuck into her script.

'I could work at a Bon Jovi concert, I can work with that much cafe noise around me - I'm very lucky that my job is portable and flexible.' Ally says she is not a 'plotter' and describes the novels that don't come naturally to her as 'giving birth to a pineapple.' 'I take a deep breath and say \\"ready, set, go\\" so when the readers are surprised about how a book turns out sometimes I'm surprised as well,' she says. However, Melanie says she never has a shortage of ideas for risque story lines. 'I read trashy mags and listen to the news - it  can be a combination of ideas that I just start playing with,' she explains. 'I always go through the bedroom doors but it's not erotic or illicit.' As with all great romance novels - every story always has a happy ending. 'People think it's all bout sex but that's not a huge part - it's all about the growth of the characters,' she said. A hopeless romantic, Melanie knew she was going to marry her husband of 32 years after their second date and he proposed six weeks later.

Melanie, who has Billionaire's Ultimate Acquisition coming out in April, says she is never short of story ideas and has not changed her writing style over the years. 'As to readers expectations due to 50 Shades, I haven't changed the level of sensuality,' she said. 'I've always written on the passionate side - it's not erotica, however.' While Ally, who has a new book Billionaire on her Doorstep set to be released in March, describes her style as 'fun, fresh and flirty'. Despite Mills & Boon books being perceived by some as corny and cliche, the women usually only experience positive reactions when they reveal their occupation. 'It's such a unique and unusual kind of job that if you are at a party and people find out you're a romance author suddenly their eyes light up and they have a million questions, so it's quite a cool conversation starter,' Ally said.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. I can use this background: Of the 94 naturally occurring elements, those with atomic numbers 1 through 82 each have at least one stable isotope (except for technetium, element 43 and promethium, element 61, which have no stable isotopes). Isotopes considered stable are those for which no radioactive decay has yet been observed. Elements with atomic numbers 83 through 94 are unstable to the point that radioactive decay of all isotopes can be detected. Some of these elements, notably bismuth (atomic number 83), thorium (atomic number 90), and uranium (atomic number 92), have one or more isotopes with half-lives long enough to survive as remnants of the explosive stellar nucleosynthesis that produced the heavy metals before the formation of our Solar System. At over 1.9×1019 years, over a billion times longer than the current estimated age of the universe, bismuth-209 (atomic number 83) has the longest known alpha decay half-life of any naturally occurring element, and is almost always considered on par with the 80 stable elements. The very heaviest elements (those beyond plutonium, element 94) undergo radioactive decay with half-lives so short that they are not found in nature and must be synthesized.  Now, I have a new situation: David was studying for his chemistry exam. To understand the elements of the periodic table better he categorized them into three groups, cat A, cat B, and cat C. In cat A he placed all the elements with atomic numbers lower than 83. In cat B he put the elements with atomic numbers from 83 to 94. Finally, in cat C he placed the elements with atomic numbers over 94. He found it easier to see their differences after he categorized them.  Answer this question please: Would cat B more likely or less likely show radioactive decay than cat A? The answer to this question is:","output":"Cat B would be more likely to show radioactive decay than cat A.  The reason for this is that cat A consists of elements with atomic numbers 1 through 82, which mainly have stable isotopes, with the exception of technetium (element 43) and promethium (element 61). Stable isotopes are those for which no radioactive decay has been observed.  On the other hand, cat B contains elements with atomic numbers 83 through 94, which are known to be unstable. These elements exhibit radioactive decay in all of their isotopes. Although some elements in this category, such as bismuth (atomic number 83), thorium (atomic number 90), and uranium (atomic number 92), have isotopes with long half-lives, they are still considered unstable isotopes due to their radioactive decay."},{"instruction":"Archilema -  Archilema is a genus of moths in the Arctiidae family.

Options：  A. michigan  B. united states  C. sky  D. china  E. apiary","output":"Considering the details given in the question, the most suitable choice for the bee's original location would be A. Michigan.  Michigan is a state located in the northern part of the Midwestern United States. The winters in this region can be extremely cold and harsh, often full of heavy snowfall and freezing temperatures which can be detrimental to many forms of life including bees. Bees, especially species such as honeybees, are vulnerable to cold weather. They need a warm and stable environment to survive and to produce honey. That’s why bees are often relocated or their colonies are protected to mitigate the negative effects of cold winters.  Shipping the bee down south, as mentioned in the question, would make sense if the bee was originally from a cold north region. Southern regions are often milder and warmer during the winter, making them more suitable environments for bees during these months. Option B, The United States, is too broad and doesn't specifically address where in the country the bee would be avoiding cold weather. Option C, sky, is incorrect because bees don't originate from the sky. They might fly in the sky, but their home or origin is on earth, inside hives. Option D, China, does not resonate with the concept of 'down south'. While China has cold winters in many parts of the country, the term 'down south' is predominantly used in the United States to refer to its southern states. Option E, Apiary, refers to a place where bees are kept, often called a bee yard. But without additional geographical information, it would not be a suitable answer for this question. Therefore, of all the options given, Michigan—a northern state in the U.S.—fits best as the bee's original location to be shipped down south to avoid the cold winter."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Bowe Bergdahl was freed by the Taliban, a CBS News Poll shows 45 percent of Americans disapprove of the deal that saw him released in exchange for five Taliban militants, while 37 percent approve of it. About one in five do not have an opinion.      Views differ by political party: most Republicans disapprove of the deal, while just over half of Democrats approve. Among those who have served in the military, 55 percent disapprove of the prisoner swap.      Most Americans -- 56 percent -- say the U.S. paid too high a price to secure Bergdahl's release. Among veterans, that figure rises to 65 percent.      Republicans and independents say the deal cost the U.S. too much, while Democrats are more divided: 42 percent think the terms of the agreement were reasonable, but almost as many -- 39 percent -- say the U.S. paid too high a price.      The president has been criticized by some members of Congress for not informing them of the prisoner exchange at least 30 days before it was carried out, as required by U.S. law.      The administration has defended the decision to move hastily with the swap, arguing there was an urgent risk to Bergdahl's health, and that any leak of the plans could have presented an additional threat to his safety.      Americans give the president low marks for his handling of the release of Sgt. Bergdahl - just 35 percent approve, while 49 percent disapprove. He gets support from Democrats -- 61 percent approve of his handling of the matter, but most Republicans disapprove.      The poll finds a clear majority -- 72 percent -- think President Obama should have notified Congress in advance, and that includes 55 percent of people identifying themselves as Democrats.      Historically, CBS News Polls have often shown that Americans prefer a president seek the approval of Congress on military matters.      There are reports that Bergdahl left his military base in Afghanistan before his capture, but many Americans (40 percent) have yet to form an opinion on whether he deliberately abandoned his post. Among those with an opinion, 35 percent think Bergdahl deliberately left (including 43% of military veterans), while 25 percent say he did not.      Most Americans - 56 percent - think the U.S. paid too high a price in the agreement to get Bergdahl released. Among veterans, that figure rises to 65 percent.      Republicans and independents think the deal cost the U.S. too much, while Democrats are more divided: 42 percent think the terms of the agreement were reasonable, but almost as many - 39 percent -say the U.S. paid too high a price.      Some Americans express concern about terrorism amid the release of the Taliban prisoners. The poll shows 49 percent think the prisoner exchange will increase the threat of terrorism against the U.S., while 40 percent say it will have no effect. Only 3 percent say the exchange will result in a reduced threat of terrorism against the U.S.      This poll was conducted by telephone June 8-9, 2014 among 1,013 adults nationwide. Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News by SSRS of Media, PA. Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cell phones. The error due to sampling for results based on the entire sample could be plus or minus three percentage points. The error for subgroups may be higher Results based on the sample of veterans is plus or minus eight points. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish. This poll release conforms to the Standards of Disclosure of the National Council on Public Polls             ||||| Senate Democrats are mounting their strongest defense yet of President Barack Obama’s decision to free Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl in exchange for five Taliban detainees from Guantánamo Bay.      They are ridiculing the notion that Obama should have given Congress a 30-day heads up — as required by law — on the impending transfer. And Democrats are expressing growing confidence that public support for the deal will grow as more details emerge.      Text Size -      +      reset      The debate over Bergdahl’s release is unfolding as administration officials took to Capitol Hill for the fourth time in a week on Tuesday to defend the deal — this time in a classified meeting of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said providing lawmakers advance notice was an “impossible” task that would have endangered Bergdahl’s life, given the chance of leaks.      (Also on POLITICO: John Boehner: \\"Americans less safe\\" after Bergdahl prisoner swap)      “I can’t believe anyone’s arguing that as soon as we knew there was a transfer we had to wait for Congress to think it over for 30 days,” Durbin told reporters. “I will just tell you this: They knew a day ahead of time that the transfer was going to take place, they knew an hour ahead of time where it was going to take place.”      Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin (D-Mich.) said Congress should not have been surprised that Obama evaded the 30-day law — citing warnings Obama had in mind when signing the law that he might not be able to comply with the requirement if “there were circumstances which didn’t give him enough time.”      “That’s exactly what happened here,” Levin said.      Meanwhile, Democrats are pressing the administration to be more forthcoming under the belief that disclosure will put to bed Republicans’ attacks on the transfer that often take the form of unanswered questions.      “We believe that as people understand the circumstances of his imprisonment, it will help explain why the president considered this such a priority,” Durbin said.      (Also on POLITICO: Steny Hoyer: \\"Wise\\" to inform Hill about prisoner swap)      Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) said as she left the briefing that open discussions in Congress would help clear up Republicans’ and Democrats’ different interpretations of the prisoner exchange.      “It’s always helpful to be as transparent as possible. And I think this is a case where there’s information that has been mischaracterized or not fully released that would be helpful to the public,” she said.      Democrats have reason to be worried over the political implications of the deal. A poll released Monday by the Pew Research Center and USA Today found 43 percent believed it was wrong for the administration to exchange the five Taliban detainees for Bergdahl. Nearly two-thirds of respondents in the poll said Obama should have notified Congress about these types of decisions.      And Republicans continue to hammer the White House on the deal. Speaker John Boehner said Tuesday that people could die because of it.      “We’ve made Americans less safe here and all around the world,” Boehner told reporters. “And we’re going to pay for this. There is not any doubt in my mind there are going to be costs.”      As is becoming typical of these closed briefings, Senate Republicans left the Tuesday briefing insisting they have more questions than answers and that little was revealed that is not already public.      Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel will appear before the House Armed Services Committee on Wednesday and will most likely face a litany of criticism from the Republican-led House. Senate Republicans are pushing Democrats to do the same after a series of closed briefings.      “If they could release the five [classified] files of the Taliban dream team, then we can have a full open hearing, just on the national security implications of the transfer,” said Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), who attended Tuesday’s briefing. “That’s important for the people of this country to understand.” ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"A CBS News Poll reveals that, following the release of U.S. Army Sgt.

Several of those speaking condemned the media for ignoring the stories of the victims and praised Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for their attention to border security. Crime assertion Trump, in his remarks, also suggested those illegally in the United States commit more crimes on a statistical basis than citizens or resident aliens. However, studies have shown that undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit a crime in the U.S. than native-born citizens, including one published by the libertarian CATO Institute this year.

Here is an article: Election marshals led voters to polling stations and bands of government supporters harassed people in the streets Friday as Zimbabwe held an internationally discredited, one-candidate presidential run-off election. Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, who withdrew from the run-off against longtime President Robert Mugabe citing a campaign of state-sponsored violence, said it was \\"not an election. It is an exercise in mass intimidation.\\" He spoke to journalists during a brief outing from the Dutch Embassy in Harare, where he took refuge earlier this week. Tsvangiraiâs Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) won parliamentary elections in late March, and claimed a clear victory over Mugabe in the presidential portion of that vote. But Mugabeâs ZANU-PF party said the result was too close to call and Fridayâs run-off election was called to determine a clear winner. Tsvangirai told journalists that Mugabeâs government was forcing people to vote. Paramilitary police in riot gear deployed in a central Harare park Friday, then began patrolling the city. Militant Mugabe supporters roamed the streets, singing revolutionary songs, heckling people and asking why they were not voting. Bands of young men in ruling party T-shirts demanded to see peoplesâ fingers to check for the indelible ink mark that is put on at polling stations. \\"I've got no option but to go and vote so that I can be safe,\\" a young woman selling tomatoes told the Associated Press. A Movement for Democratic Change spokesman in Britain told CBC News that the run-off had been \\"a joke.\\" \\"It confirms that we are not only dealing with a ruthless dictator, but one who is not in full control of his senses,\\" Hebson Makuvese said in an interview from London, England. Independent election observers said Zimbabweans were forced to the polls and were too frightened to talk. \\"Some of them are saying, 'We were told to come here,\\"' Pan African Parliament spokesman Khalid A. Dahab said. \\"It's just not normal. There's a lot of tension.\\" Rindai Chipfunde-Vava of the Zimbabwe Electoral Support Network said she was hearing persistent reports of forced voting, people's names and ballot serial numbers being written at polling stations and illiterate people assisted to vote by government supporters. \\"This run-off is marred by a low turnout and a heavy police presence,\\" Chipfunde-Vava told CBC News. \\"The pre-election violence and the withdrawal of Morgan Tsvangirai [will] affect the legitimacy and the credibility of this result.\\" World leaders roundly condemned the vote. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, speaking at a meeting in Japan, called the vote a \\"sham,\\" and said the United States would use its position as president of the UN Security Council until July 1 to lead international condemnation of Mugabe's regime. \\"Those operating in Zimbabwe should know that there are those ... who believe that the Security Council should consider sanctions,\\" Rice said. \\"We intend to bring up the issue of Zimbabwe in the council. We will see what the council decides to do.\\" In another development, the 15-member council unanimously \\"agreed that the conditions for free and fair elections did not exist and it was a matter of deep regret that elections went ahead in these circumstances,\\" U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad said on behalf of the council, after three hours of private talks among its members. Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Canada believed Mugabe had stolen the vote, and this country would be part of international efforts to push for democratic change in Zimbabwe. Harper called the election an \\"ugly perversion of democracy.\\" A meeting of African foreign ministers in Egypt is considering what steps the continent's nations can take to press for change in Zimbabwe. \\"I don't think we are going to accept the result but we are still discussing,\\" a minister told Reuters, asking not to be identified. African leaders will meet at the Red Sea resort of Sharm-el-Sheikh Sunday, with Zimbabwe at the top of the summit agenda. Mugabe is expected to attend and observers say his presence will be a real test of the African Union's ability to deal with a political crisis in its own backyard. The presidents of Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda, in a rare comment about the affairs of another African country, said Zimbabwe's one-candidate runoff, \\"cannot be a solution,\\" to the country's political crisis. The presidents, at a regular summit of the East African Community held in Kigali, Rwanda, urged Mugabe's and Tsvangirai's parties \\"to come together and work out an amicable solution through dialogue in the interest of all Zimbabweans.\\" Jacob Zuma, the head of South Africa's African National Congress, said the situation in Zimbabwe was \\"extremely difficult and distressing.\\" \\"We reiterate that the situation is now out of control,\\" he said in one of the few openly critical comments about the Zimbabwean situation a senior South African politician has made. \\"Nothing short of a negotiated political arrangement will get Zimbabwe out of the conflict it has been plunged into.\\" On Thursday, Mugabe said he was \\"open to discussion\\" with the opposition but only after the vote. Mugabe had shown little interest in talks and his government had scoffed at Tsvangirai's call Wednesday to work together to form a transitional authority. The MDC leader has said his offer to hold talks with Mugabe would lapse if the run-off election went ahead. Mugabe's government is generally blamed for the dire economic situation in Zimbabwe.

In a 40 million federal lawsuit, five people arrested recently in Ferguson, Missouri, accuse police of using \\"wanton and excessive force\\" and treating U.S. citizens \\"as if they were war combatants.\\" A complaint filed Thursday alleges that police officers from Ferguson and St. Louis County used unnecessary force and made unjustified arrests as they cracked down on protests after the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown earlier this month. The lawsuit lists Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar, Ferguson officer Justin Cosma, several unnamed officers and the city and county governments as defendants. A St. Louis County police spokesman declined to comment Friday, referring inquiries to the county prosecuting attorney's office. The St. Louis County prosecuting attorney's office told CNN it has no comment on the lawsuit. The suit -- which includes accusations of intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent supervision, and assault and battery -- details circumstances allegedly surrounding several arrests between August 11-13:. -- Tracey White was about to buy an ice cream sundae at McDonald's when officers \\"in what appeared to be army uniforms, carrying rifles and sticks and wearing helmets\\" entered and ordered her to leave, according to the lawsuit. She was told to shut up, thrown to the ground and handcuffed after criticizing officers for the way they were treating her son, the lawsuit claims. -- Dewayne Matthews was walking to his mother's house when a group of officers in military uniforms shot rubber bullets at him, the lawsuit alleges. He fell into a creek or sewer, the suit says, where officers \\"pounced on him, slammed his face into the concrete, and pushed his head into the water to the point that he felt he was going to be drowned.\\" -- Kerry White was shooting footage and holding his camera out his car window when an officer snatched his camera, \\"took out his memory card and threw it to the ground,\\" the lawsuit says. -- Damon Coleman and Theophilus Green were peacefully protesting, the lawsuit says, when police in riot gear fired tear gas and what appeared to be stun grenades in their direction, then \\"hurled racial epithets at them, while punching and kicking them the entire time.\\" CNN has not independently confirmed details of the arrests. Police tactics to calm the crowds drew sharp criticism, including a rebuke from U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. \\"At a time when we must seek to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community, I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message,\\" Holder said as the protests unfolded.

Belmar, the St. Louis County Police Chief, told reporters on Wednesday that he doesn't regret his agency's decisions to fire tear gas at protesters. That approach, he said, was much better than using nightsticks or dogs. Even though President Barack Obama has called for a review of military equipment sales to local police departments in light of the clashes between police and protesters in Ferguson, Belmar said that such equipment is often necessary. \\"I never envisioned a day that we would ever see that kind of equipment used against protesters,\\" he said. \\"But I also never imagined a day in 28 years when we would see that kind of criminal activity spin out of peaceful demonstrations.\\" Complete coverage.

Question: \\"No Man of Her Own\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to? Answer:","output":"\\"No Man of Her Own\\" falls under the category of film and written work. This title is associated with a novel as well as a couple of film adaptations. The novel, written by British author, James M. Cain, was originally published in 1932 under the title \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\\". The story revolves around a passionate affair between a drifter and the wife of a roadside diner owner, ultimately culminating in murder and betrayal. The first film adaptation titled \\"No Man of Her Own\\" was released in 1932, directed by Wesley Ruggles. This adaptation was a pre-Code drama film starring Clark Gable and Carole Lombard. However, it is worth mentioning that this version of \\"No Man of Her Own\\" was not based on Cain's novel but rather an original story. The title and casting of Gable and Lombard in this adaptation led to some confusion in later years due to the 1946 film adaptation of Cain's novel \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\\". A 1950 Italian version titled \\"Obsessione\\" directed by Luchino Visconti and based on James M. Cain's novel \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\\" is considered the earliest film adaptation of the written work. In 1946, another film adaptation titled \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\\" was released, directed by Tay Garnett and starring Lana Turner and John Garfield. This adaptation closely followed Cain's novel and became a classic film noir. Later on, the novel was adapted again in 1981 in a film of the same title, directed by Bob Rafelson and starring Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange. This 1981 version was a neo-noir adaptation with a darker and more graphic depiction of the gripping story. To sum up, the title \\"No Man of Her Own\\" belongs to the film category, specifically to the 1932 film by Wesley Ruggles, as well as the written work category referring to James M. Cain's novel \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\\" and its various film adaptations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This article: Further recognition came with the hanging of one of Fuller's paintings, Summer Breezes, at the Royal Academy in 1904. Other Australian artists whose works were hung at the same time included Rupert Bunny, E. Phillips Fox, Albert Fullwood, George Lambert, and Arthur Streeton. Fuller was the only woman painter to be represented. A critic writing in The West Australian observed:The work ... is essentially Australian in almost every detail. Standing in a sunlit Australian paddock, a lithesome Australian blonde holds her summer hat on against the rude caresses of an Australian breeze—a subject simple but grand in its simplicity ... Next to its suggestion of breezy sunshine and the incidental portrayal of willowy grace the picture is to be admired for its colour scheme ... The details of the picture disclose untiring care. By the time Summer Breezes was on display, Fuller had returned to Australia, not to her previous home in Melbourne but to Perth in Western Australia, where she joined her sister, Amy Fuller, who was a singer. Although only in her mid-thirties, Fuller's background made her \\"one of the most experienced artists in Western Australia at this time\\". For the next four years, she painted portraits, including one of Western Australian politician James George Lee Steere, undertaken posthumously from photographs and recollections of those who had known him. It was acquired by the gallery whose board he chaired. She also took on students, including French-Australian artist Kathleen O'Connor. Fuller's paintings from this period included A Golden Hour, described by the National Gallery of Australia as \\"a masterpiece ... giving us a gentle insight into the people, places and times that make up our history\\". The painting, an oil on canvas 109 cm (43 in) high and 135 cm (53 in) wide, portrays a woman and a man standing together in a rural setting in late afternoon, surrounded by grass, scattered gum trees, and Xanthorrhoea. When the painting was put up for sale in 2012, the auction house catalogue stated that it... contains an answer for the question: What was the last name of the person who painted a Western Australian politician?, what is it ?

A party centered on a game called Pilot and Passengers is broken up by Georg and Anna, when they return home while the party is in progress. The host of the party, Eva, is their daughter who lives in another part of town and who has, it turns out in questioning of Benny after the incident, taken advantage of the planned absence of Georg and Anna to host the impromptu party in their home. While watching a newscast, Georg and Anna discuss the money Eva won in the pyramid scheme she was promoting at the party. In a locker room at school, Benny encourages his friends to take positions in his own Pilot and Passengers game.

Could you please translate this to English?","output":"The English translation of \\"Les participants se mettent d'accord sur le fait que la question doit demeurer telle quelle et faire partie de la série minimale\\" is \\"The participants agree that the question should remain as it is and be part of the minimal series.\\" This sentence suggests that in a discussion or a meeting, the people involved have reached consensus. They've decided that whatever question they're referring to needs to stay unchanged. Moreover, they wish to include this particular question in a so-called 'minimal series.' This context usually occurs in conversations or discussions where matters are being simplified or broken down into smaller, manageable parts. The term 'minimal series' is not universally understood without a specific context as it might mean different things in different situations. However, within most contexts, a series is viewed as a group or a set of similar objects/events arranged or happening in a particular order. When the term 'minimal' is added to 'series,' it could be interpreted as the smallest or least comprehensive/complex set within a cluster of series.  So, when the participants say that the question should 'be part of the minimal series,' it's likely that they want to categorize this question within the simplest or least complex set of questions, tasks, or issues they are dealing with. In a broader sense, it's possible that they are working on some testing or surveying process, and they want to include this question as part of a simplified or reduced set of questions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Problem:Context: Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus., Gekkonidae is the largest family of geckos, containing over 950 described species in 51 genera. Many \\"typical\\" geckos are members of Gekkonidae, including house geckos (\\"Hemidactylus\\"), tokay geckos (\\"Gekko gecko\\"), and day geckos (\\"Phelsuma\\"). Gekkonid geckos occur globally and are particularly species-rich in tropical areas., Carinatogecko is a genus of Gekkonidae ( gecko ) family . It contains three species . Iranian Gecko , Carinatogecko aspratilis Iraqi Gecko , Carinatogecko heteropholis Carinatogecko stevenandersoni, In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs., Gekko is a genus of colorful and diverse Southeast Asian geckos commonly known as true geckos or calling geckos. Although species such as \\"Gekko gecko\\" (the tokay gecko) are very widespread and common, some species in the same genus have a very small range and are considered rare or endangered., Geckos are lizards belonging to the infraorder Gekkota, found in warm climates throughout the world. They range from 1.6 to 60 cm (0.64 to 24 inches). Most geckos cannot blink, but they often lick their eyes to keep them clean and moist. They have a fixed lens within each iris that enlarges in darkness to let in more light., The tokay gecko (\\"Gekko gecko\\") is a nocturnal arboreal gecko in the genus \\"Gekko\\", the true geckos. It is native to Asia and some Pacific Islands., A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus., Hemidactylus (the house geckos) is a genus of the family of common geckos, Gekkonidae. It has about 90 described species, newfound ones being described every few years. These geckos are found in all the tropical regions of the world, extending into the subtropical parts of Africa and Europe. They excel in colonizing oceanic islands by rafting on flotsam, and are for example found across most of Polynesia. In some archipelagoes, cryptic species complexes are found. Geckos like to live in and out of houses. They are introduced to Australia., Phelsuma is a large genus of mostly small lizards in the family Gekkonidae. Species in the genus \\"Phelsuma\\" are commonly referred to as day geckos., Subject: carinatogecko, Relation: parent_taxon, Options: (A) animal (B) geckos (C) gekko (D) hemidactylus (E) homo (F) lens (G) phelsuma (H) plant Solution:","output":"Part 1: Understand the provided context. Usage: The context talks about binomial nomenclature, the naming system for species, and some information about the Gekkonidae family of geckos.

Given the question: Question: \\"Which of the following expressions does not indicate possible events: I would, I can, or I wish?\\"  Context: \\"The infinitive form ends in t (archaically, ti). It is the form found in dictionaries and the form that follows auxiliary verbs (for example, můžu tě slyšet—\\"I can hear you\\"). Czech verbs have three grammatical moods: indicative, imperative and conditional. The imperative mood adds specific endings for each of three person (or number) categories: -Ø/-i/-ej for second-person singular, -te/-ete/-ejte for second-person plural and -me/-eme/-ejme for first-person plural. The conditional mood is formed with a particle after the past-tense verb. This mood indicates possible events, expressed in English as \\"I would\\" or \\"I wish\\".\\"  Answer: The answer is:","output":"\\"I can\\" Step 1: Identify the key information from the context From the given context, we can identify that the conditional mood in Czech indicates possible events, expressed in English as \\"I would\\" or \\"I wish.\\" Step 2: Analyze the options We have three options: \\"I would,\\" \\"I can,\\" and \\"I wish.\\" Step 3: Compare the options with the key information Compare each option to the information about the conditional mood: - \\"I would\\" matches the description of a possible event indicated by the conditional mood. - \\"I can\\" does not match the description of possible events represented by the conditional mood. Instead, it represents the capability of the subject. - \\"I wish\\" matches the description of a possible event indicated by the conditional mood. Step 4: Identify the option that does not indicate possible events Since \\"I can\\" does not match the description of possible events indicated by the conditional mood, it is the expression that does not indicate possible events in this context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Jimothy and Dwight are two brothers living in the same house. Jimothy is a freshman in high school and Dwight is a junior in high school. Their mother takes them to see a doctor and to have their testosterone tested. The tests reveal that Dwight has significantly more testosterone than Jimothy, but that is to be expected given their age difference.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Will Jimothy finish his growth spurt before or after Dwight? Answer:","output":"To answer the question, let's analyze the given information step-by-step: 1. Jimothy is a freshman in high school (younger brother) and Dwight is a junior in high school (older brother). 2. Their testosterone levels have been tested, with Dwight having a significantly higher level than Jimothy. 3. The higher testosterone in Dwight is expected due to their age difference. Testosterone plays a role in growth and development during puberty, with growth spurts typically occurring between ages 12-15 for boys. Since Dwight is older and already a junior in high school, it is likely that he has already experienced or is currently experiencing his growth spurt. Jimothy, being a freshman, may still be waiting for his growth spurt to start, or could be in the earlier stages of his growth spurt. Based on the information given, it can be inferred that Jimothy will finish his growth spurt after Dwight, as Dwight is further along in puberty due to their age difference. However, it's essential to note that predicting the exact timeline of a person's growth spurt based solely on age and testosterone levels isn't foolproof, as individual experiences may vary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Taken in by Mushnick as a young orphan, Seymour lives in a tiny room below the flower shop and is treated fairly poorly by his employer. The light of his life is his co-worker, Audrey (Ellen Greene), a fragile, battered woman stuck in an abusive relationship. The flower shop is making virtually no money, and Mr. Mushnick is on the verge of closing it for good when Audrey mentions the strange and interesting new plant Seymour has been developing, and suggests that if it is properly advertised, it might attract more business. Seymour presents the plant, a large bud surrounded by layers of leaves. Mushnick is pleasantly surprised when customers begin flocking in after seeing the little plant in the window.

Based on the premise \\"You could even argue that American society in the 1990s is an engine that maximizes consumption yet minimizes satisfaction.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Consumption was maximized and satisfaction was maximized in the 1990s by American society.  \\" is true?","output":"Based on the premise \\"You could even argue that American society in the 1990s is an engine that maximizes consumption yet minimizes satisfaction,\\" we cannot directly conclude that the hypothesis \\"Consumption was maximized and satisfaction was maximized in the 1990s by American society\\" is true, as the premise states a contradictory model, where consumption is maximized, but satisfaction is minimized. To explore this further, let's analyze various aspects such as the economic system, technological advancements, consumer culture, and the factors affecting satisfaction during the 1990s in the United States. The 1990s in America were marked by significant economic growth and technological advancements, largely driven by information technology, telecommunications, and the stock market boom. There was rapid expansion of credit, low unemployment rates, and increasing wealth in the country. This created an environment where people had access to more disposable income, and society saw a rise in consumerism. The marketing industry also expanded exponentially during the 1990s. The rise of television channels, malls (which became a popular social destination), and the general adoption of lifestyle segmentation methods to target specific groups, led to an increase in advertising and consumerist messaging. Thus, consumption was indeed maximized during this time in American society due to the combination of increased purchasing power and the promotion of consumer culture. However, the premise states that satisfaction was minimized, which seemingly contradicts the hypothesis that satisfaction was maximized. To evaluate this, let's discuss the factors that could contribute to minimized satisfaction during this period. 1. Materialism: With the rise of consumerism, people were exposed to advertising messages that encouraged them to acquire possessions as a measure of success and happiness. This focus on material possessions could lead to a decreased sense of satisfaction, as individuals often feel the need to constantly purchase newer and better items to keep up with societal standards. 2. Environmental and social concerns: The emphasis on consumption and the exploitation of natural resources led to increased awareness of environmental concerns such as climate change, pollution, and deforestation. This, in turn, could have led to individuals feeling a lack of satisfaction with their consumption habits, knowing the negative impacts they may have had on the environment and society in the long run. 3. Economic inequality: Although the 1990s saw overall economic growth, the distribution of wealth was not equal. Income inequality increased, and many people were still struggling to make ends meet, making it hard for them to find satisfaction in their consumption patterns as they were unable to participate fully in the consumer lifestyle. 4. Impact of technology: While technological advancements in the 1990s brought about significant improvements in efficiency and communication, they also led to information overload and a relentless pace of life. People had to cope with the stress of always being ‘connected’ and keeping up to date with the latest trends and news, which may have contributed to dissatisfaction in other areas of life such as personal relationships and overall well-being. Taking all these factors into account, it becomes evident that although consumption was maximized during the 1990s in American society, satisfaction was not necessarily maximized. The consumption-driven culture and associated issues resulted in a general minimization of satisfaction, as the synthesis between material possessions, environmental concerns, economic inequality, and the rapidly changing pace of life due to technology advancements challenged American society's overall contentment during this period."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While the paragraph mentions that \\"A Merry Friggin' Christmas\\" is a movie released by Phase 4 Films in 2014, this alone is not enough to establish the company's reputation or prominence in the industry. To determine whether Phase 4 Films is well known, it would be helpful to consider additional factors, such as the number of films it has produced, its overall box office revenue, critical reception of its movies, and the extent to which its films are distributed, among others. Moreover, while the film does feature an ensemble cast, including reputable actors like Robin Williams, Lauren Graham, and Candice Bergen, this information does not necessarily reflect on Phase 4 Films itself. Instead, it speaks more to the talent attached to this particular film. In conclusion, to accurately assess the prominence of Phase 4 Films in the movie industry, further information beyond the 2014 film \\"A Merry Friggin' Christmas\\" would be necessary. It is essential to look at the company's track record, additional productions, and general impact on the industry before drawing any conclusions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible answers: a good person, a bad person, happy A:","output":"In the given context, Bailey can be described as a bad person. This assessment is based on the information provided, which indicates that Bailey took advantage of Jesse's vulnerability or gullibility to scam her out of 100 dollars by telling her fortune. Such an act demonstrates a lack of concern for the well-being of others and a willingness to engage in dishonest practices to benefit oneself at the expense of someone else. Bailey's actions exhibit qualities commonly associated with negative character traits, such as deceitfulness, manipulativeness, and selfishness. It is essential to consider that individuals often exhibit a mix of positive and negative qualities, and this specific context does not necessarily reflect Bailey's overall character. However, based on the information provided, describing Bailey as a bad person in this situation appears to be the most accurate assessment. It is also worth noting that the provided answer options do not necessarily mutually exclude one another. For example, Bailey might simultaneously be a bad person and experience happiness, especially if he derives pleasure from his fraudulent actions.

Now we move on to college life once you are admitted to a school. The first thing you need to value is a place to live. Housing policies differ from school to school. Students might have to live in a dormitory, at least for the first year there. Dorms come in all sizes. Some have suites. Six or more students may line in one suite. Other dorms have many rooms along a common hallway, usually with two students in each room . Many students say dormitories provide the best chance to get to know other students. Also, dorms generally cost less than apartments or other housing not owned by the school. Most colleges and universities offer singe-sex dorms, but usually males and females live in the same building. They might live on the same floors and share the same common bathrooms. They may live in the same room only if they are married. Edward Spencer is the associate vice president for student affairs at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. He says it is important to understand the rules of the building in which you will live. He advises students to ask questions before they decide about their housing. For example, if a student requires a special diet, will the school provide it ?How much privacy can a student expect ? Will the school provide a single room if a student requests one ? And what about any other special needs that a student might have? Virginia Tech, for example, had a ban against candles in dorms . But it changed that policy to let students light up candles for religious purposes. The university also has several dorms open all year so foreign students have a place to stay during vacation time. Why do some students in the U.S. choose to live in dorms, according to the passage ? A) Dorms allow students in the U.S. choose to live in dorms B) Dorms are safer for students to live in most cases. C) Dorms offer the chance to meet other people and are cheap as well. D) In most schools students are required to live in the dorms. A:","output":"C) Dorms offer the chance to meet other people and are cheap as well. According to the passage, many students in the U.S. choose to live in dorms for two main reasons. Firstly, they provide an excellent opportunity for students to get to know their peers. Dormitories typically house multiple students, either in shared rooms, suites, or along common hallways. This close living situation allows students to interact with one another on a daily basis, fostering friendships and a sense of community. Secondly, dormitories are usually more affordable than other housing options, such as apartments or other privately-owned accommodations. Since dorms are owned by the school, their costs are generally lower than other types of housing. In addition to these reasons, the passage also mentions that most colleges and universities offer single-sex dorms, but often males and females live in the same building, sometimes even on the same floors. This creates a diverse living environment for students to interact with others from different backgrounds and genders. Furthermore, the passage suggests that it's essential for students to understand the rules of their chosen housing and to ask questions before making a decision. Schools may have various policies regarding dormitories, and understanding these policies can help students find the living situation that best suits their needs, preferences, and any special requirements they may have."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question:   Dan is on a ship, and sees that the waves are getting small! Dan can deduce that it means that the wind is blowing harder or softer?    Paragraph :  The faster, longer, and farther the wind blows, the bigger the waves are. Answer:","output":"From the provided paragraph, we can gather that the relationship between wind and waves is such that the speed, duration, and distance the wind blows directly impact the size of the waves. In particular, the paragraph mentions that the \\"faster, longer, and farther the wind blows, the bigger the waves are.\\" Given this context, when Dan observes that the waves are getting smaller, he can deduce that the wind is blowing softer (i.e., at a lower speed) and/or for a shorter duration or over a shorter distance. The decrease in the wind's force, duration, or overall impact reduces the energy transferred to the waves, which in turn results in smaller waves. It's important to note that changes in wave size can be influenced by variations in any of these wind factors. In summary, based on the information from the paragraph, if Dan notices that the waves are becoming smaller, he can infer that the wind is blowing softer or for a shorter duration and distance."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The game last year took place during a time when the weather was highly unpredictable with frequent downpours, strong gusts of wind, and poor visibility, making both playing and watching the event difficult and less enjoyable for everyone involved.  Additionally, the less-than-favorable weather conditions led to a myriad of issues during last year's game. The slippery field created challenges for the players, impacting their ability to make swift and accurate movements, while their wet uniforms and equipment weighed them down and made them shiver from the cold. Numerous timeouts were called during the game to address safety concerns, causing interruptions in the flow of play and leaving the participants feeling frustrated and listless. Moreover, the bad weather adversely impacted the overall sportsmanship and camaraderie of the teams. The players, coaches, and even spectators were all affected by the unpleasant conditions, leading to tense interactions and a general lack of the typical joy and excitement that usually accompany such events. In contrast, the match this year was played in perfect weather, with clear blue skies, pleasant temperatures, and just the right amount of breeze to keep everyone comfortable. As a result, the players were able to perform at their best without any weather-related hindrances, leading to a more thrilling and memorable game. The teams displayed exceptional athleticism and teamwork, making for a much more enjoyable experience both on and off the field. Furthermore, the beautiful weather contributed to a more festive atmosphere during the match, with friends, families, and fans coming together to celebrate and support their teams with enthusiasm and energy. Smiles and laughter were abundant, and the spirit of good sportsmanship and friendly rivalry prevailed throughout the day. Overall, the game last year pales in comparison to the match this year, primarily due to the unfavorable weather conditions that made it difficult for players to perform at their best and dampened the spirits of everyone involved. This year's impeccable weather has allowed the participants to fully unleash their potential, showcase their skills, and enjoy a day filled with the type of competitive excitement and camaraderie that makes such events truly special for both players and spectators alike."},{"instruction":"It was a dream, then a place, then a memory.

The exact years of her birth and death are unclear; a traditional year quoted for her death is 26 October 1252; it is also considered, though, that this was the date of her burial, and that she had actually died in 1251.  - Laurentius Petri Nericius (1499  27 October 1573) was a Swedish clergyman and the first Evangelical Lutheran Archbishop of Sweden. He and his brother Olaus Petri are, together with the King Gustav Vasa, regarded as the main Lutheran reformers of Sweden. They are commemorated by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America on April 19.  - Olof Persson, sometimes Petersson (January 6, 1493  April 19, 1552), better known under the Latin form of his name, Olaus Petri (or less commonly, Olavus Petri), was a clergyman, writer, judge and major contributor to the Protestant Reformation in Sweden. His brother, Laurentius Petri (Lars Persson), became the first Evangelical Lutheran Archbishop of Sweden.  - The Protestant Reformation, often referred to simply as the Reformation (from Latin \\"reformatio\\", \\"restoration, renewal\\"), was a schism from the Roman Catholic Church initiated by Martin Luther and continued by John Calvin, Huldrych Zwingli, and other early Protestant Reformers in 16th century Europe. Timing most commonly used for this period is from 1517 (the Ninety-five Theses are published by Martin Luther) to 1648 (Peace of Westphalia ends the Thirty Years' War).  - Linköping is a city in southern Sweden, with 104,232 inhabitants in 2010. It is the seat of Linköping Municipality and the capital of Östergötland County. Linköping is also the episcopal see of the Diocese of Linköping (Church of Sweden) and is well known for its cathedral.  Linköping is the center of an old cultural region and celebrated its 700th anniversary in 1987. Dominating the city's skyline from afar is the steeple of the cathedral.  - Vreta Abbey, Swedish Vreta Kloster, in operation from the beginning of the 12th century to 1582, was the first nunnery in Sweden, initially Benedictine and later Cistercian, and one of the oldest in Scandinavia. It was located in the present-day municipality of Linköping in Östergötland.  - Old Swedish (Modern Swedish: \\"fornsvenska\\") is the name for two separate versions of the Swedish language that were spoken in the Middle Ages: Early Old Swedish (\\"Klassisk fornsvenska\\"), spoken from around 1225 until 1375, and Late Old Swedish (\\"Yngre fornsvenska\\"), spoken from 1375 until 1526.  - Sune Sik , ( born c. 1154 ) , was allegedly a Swedish prince . According to Olaus Petri , he would have been a younger son of King Sverker I of Sweden and father of Ingrid Ylva . In surviving contemporary documents one Sune Sik can be found who lived much later . That Sune Sik made a donation to Vreta Abbey as late as in 1297 . He might have ordered a restoration of a chapel in which he eventually was interred , and later Cistercian tradition may then have turned him into a prince . This has caused some historians to view Olaus Petri 's account of him as unreliable . Sune Sik , as a son of King Sverker , is counted by other Swedish historians as a person of history and the man buried at Vreta ( see photo ) . According to 18th - century Swedish Master of Philosophy Magnus Boræn , Sune was also Duke of Östergötland ( at a time when the use of such a title is not known in Sweden ) .  - Biography. Early life. It is known that Birger grew up and spent his adolescence in Bjälbo, Östergötland but the exact date of his birth remains uncertain and available historical sources are contradictory. Examinations of his mortal remains indicate that he was probably about 50 upon his death in 1266 which would indicate a birth around 1216. However, his father Magnus Minnesköld is assumed to have died no later than 1210, which would lead to an assumed birth a few years earlier. Under any circumstance, he was the son of Ingrid Ylva, who according to Olaus Petri was a daughter of Sune Sik and granddaughter of King Sverker I of Sweden, which would make Birger a matrilineal member of the House of Sverker. His brothers or half-brothers  Eskil, Karl, and Bengt  were all born long before 1200, and it can therefore be assumed that they had another mother. He was also a nephew of the jarl Birger Brosa from the House of Bjelbo. The combination of this background proved to be of vital importance.  - Sverker I or Sverker the Elder (Old Swedish: \\"Swærkir konongær gambli\\"), murdered 25 December 1156, was King of Sweden from about 1130 till his death.  - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas.

Near San Cristobal, Cuba (CNN) -- Fifty years ago, 15-year-old Omar Lopez knew a secret that governments around the world would have killed to learn or safeguard: Soviet troops were building hidden military installations in Cuba. One of those installations was on the farm where his family raised chickens and pigs. In 1962, Fidel Castro's revolution was just beginning to reshape Cuba. Thousands of Cubans had fled the country, and the year before, Castro's troops had routed a U.S.-backed invasion at the Bay of Pigs. Read more: Should the U.S. fight or befriend Cuba? But little of the drama of those times reached the remote Lopez farm in western Cuba, where palm trees vastly outnumber human residents. \\"That's when you saw a lot of movement among the","output":"My task seems to automate the continuation of the narrative based on the information given so far. In order to achieve that, I'd need to extend the story faithfully by incorporating the historical elements mentioned, along with adding possible dramatic aspects about Omar Lopez’s character and situation.  Step 1: Understanding the given content:  The text is set in the context of 1960's Cuba, specifically San Cristobal. It centers around three critical historical elements: (i) Soviet troops constructing undisclosed military installations in Cuba, (ii) Fidel Castro's revolution that was just starting to reform Cuba, and (iii) Castro's troops prevailing over a U.S.-backed invasion at the Bay of Pigs in 1961. The protagonist of the narrative, 15-year-old Omar Lopez, was aware of the surreptitious activity happening. Step 2: Structuring narrative extension: The narrative extension would dwell on the Soviet troops' secret activities and the reactions within the Lopez family and surrounding community. It would take into account the heightened tension, prevailing political backdrop, Omar's fears, and suspicions. Step 3: Implementing narrative extension: \\"Russian soldiers,\\" Omar's father, Enrique Lopez, would say. The soldiers had arrived in the region without much fuss, their purpose unknown to most locals. Every day vehicles with strange number plates streamed past their farm and stirred up clouds of dust on the usually silent, deserted road. Omar would spend countless hours watching them from behind the thick leaves of palm trees, his suspicion growing with every passing convoy.   He noticed peculiarities that a less insightful person might miss. Soldiers carrying large, bulky objects wrapped in tarpaulin into the quiet forest, movement during the odd hours of the night, strange humming sounds that did not belong to Cuba. Everywhere he went, he saw fear and curiosity in the eyes of his neighbors, even as they put on brave faces in front of the foreign troops.  As Cuba plunged into an era of uncertainty and revolution under Fidel Castro's rule, the Lopez family found themselves lodged between an unwanted foreign presence and a rapidly evolving homeland. Despite being distant from the capital city's heart where politics played out in dramatic fashion, its faint tremors were beginning to reach the peaceful rhythms of the far-flung rural hamlets. This was a shift, an alarming change from a life they knew and loved, and it had knocked on their door too soon for comfort. Yet, they persisted, clinging to their chickens and pigs with a desperate grip of survival, for they were the essence of their livelihood, the very heartbeat of the Lopez farm.\\" Step 4: Reviewing the narrative extension: The extension follows the given information by keeping cultural and historical artifacts in mind, thereby encapsulating the tension of the situation accurately. It also maintains the story's thematic base - the tension between secret Soviet activities and the fear they induced in the local Cuban population during the beginning of Castro's revolution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the first name of the person who convinced Compton to move forward with nuclear weapons?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The MAUD Committee reports urged the co-operation with the United States should be continued in the research of nuclear fission. Charles C. Lauritsen, a Caltech physicist working at the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), was in London during this time and was invited to sit in on a MAUD meeting. The committee pushed for rapid development of nuclear weapons using gaseous-diffusion as their isotope separation device. Once he returned to the United States, he was able to brief Vannevar Bush, the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), concerning the details discussed during the meeting.In August 1941, Mark Oliphant, the director of the physics department at the University of Birmingham and an original member of the MAUD Committee, was sent to the US to assist the NDRC on radar. During his visit he met with William D. Coolidge. Coolidge was shocked when Oliphant informed him that the British had predicted that only ten kilograms of uranium-235 would be sufficient to supply a chain reaction effected by fast moving neutrons. While in America, Oliphant discovered that the chairman of the OSRD S-1 Section, Lyman Briggs, had locked away the MAUD reports transferred from Britain entailing the initial discoveries and had not informed the S-1 Committee members of all its findings.Oliphant took the initiative himself to enlighten the scientific community in the U.S. of the recent ground breaking discoveries the MAUD Committee had just exposed. Oliphant also travelled to Berkley to meet with Ernest Lawrence, inventor of the cyclotron. After Oliphant informed Lawrence of his report on uranium, Lawrence met with NDRC chairman James Bryant Conant, George B. Pegram, and Arthur Compton to relay the details which Oliphant had directed to Lawrence. Oliphant was not only able to get in touch with Lawrence, but he met with Conant and Bush to inform them of the significant data the MAUD had discovered.

Memories In September, 1940, my mother, sister and I went to Swansea, where my father's ship was getting ready to sail. We brought him a family photograph to be kept with him at all times and keep him safe. Then I remember my mother lying face down, sobbing. She had heard from a friend that the ship had been sunk by a torpedo  . I can remember the arrival of the telegram  , which in those days always brought had news. My grandmother opened it. It read, \\"Safe, Love Ted.\\" My most vivid memory is being woken and brought down to sit on my father's knee, his arm in a bandage. He was judged unfit to return to sea and took a shore job in Glasgow for the rest of the war. For as long as I can remember, he had a weak heart. Mother said _ was caused by the torpedoes. He said it was because of the cigarettes. Whichever, he died suddenly in his early 50s. Ten years later I read Night of the U-boats and was able to complete the story. Torpedo One torpedo struck the ship. Father was in the engine room, where the third engineer was killed. He shut down the engines to slow the ship making it easier for it to be abandoned. By the time he got on deck   he was alone. Every lifeboat was gone except one which had stuck fast. When he tried to cut it free, it swung against the ship, injuring his hand and arm. He had no choice but to jump -- still with the photograph in his pocket. Three days later, he and other survivors were safe in Glasgow. All 23 with him signed the back of the photograph.

Knowing this was the only way out, I obeyed and diligently signed all the papers. I hated my parents but still felt the inescapable drive to prove to them that I was worth something. I had to show them I wasn't crazy. As the hours passed, I was shown to a blank room with plastic sheets and plastic pillows, which caused me to wonder what kind of distant confused souls had been imprisoned in this sterile place. There were bars on the windows and the only door out of the unit was locked 24/7. I knew my only refuge for the time being would be through the hour a day art therapy class and the smoke breaks I could take at will. They had given me a legal pad after my parents had told them of my affinity for writing.

There I was free and could experience a life unhindered by limitations of ethics or gravity. When I'd awake I'd write what I could remember of my escapes on the obtrusive legal pad.

They'd been trying so hard for a child, suffered more mid-term miscarriages than the ewes they shuttled off to market most Thursdays. They dressed him in a one-year babygro and took him home to their hill farm. They fought to get up nights and give him his milk. His teeth made breast-feeding impossible. They sat hours gazing down in his cot. They dressed him fine and took him to their church and gave their thanks. Showed him off like the proud parents they were. Others cooed and smiled. But they never asked to hold. They gave thanks the Blakeys were happy, and that the monkey-baby had not been born to them. Jimbob's folks never gave a second thought that their boy might be different. The first Spring he walked, he stomped the moors in his welly-boots helping herd the pregnant ewes down in-by. He copied his father, kicking and cuffing at the stragglers, when the flock was returned to the hills in May. As Jimbob grew, his hair became thicker, his arms longer.

He could perhaps be good if he learned to think along with his pummeling. Despite all of this, Hector is a hard worker on a Texas farm who does what he can to provide for his ailing mother which includes pulling in a few side dollars from small-time, illegal gambling fights. Tito, a \\"coyote\\" (a person who helps smuggle people across the border) spends his days as a snake catcher but at night, helps smuggle immigrants across the border. After winning a fight in a local mechanic's garage, Hector tries to get another fight but the entertainment is interrupted by Tito who scolds both Hector and the owner due to the fact that Tito could  get into more trouble for illegal gambling fights as if smuggling illegals across the border isn't enough. Corralled, Hector goes to change but is followed in by another illegal; Maria.

Question: Information:  - Hambleton is a local government district of North Yorkshire, England. The main town and administrative centre is Northallerton, and includes the market towns and major villages of Bedale, Thirsk, Great Ayton, Stokesley and Easingwold.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - Yorkshire (or ; abbreviated Yorks), formally known as the County of York, is a historic county of Northern England and the largest in the United Kingdom. Due to its great size in comparison to other English counties, functions have been undertaken over time by its subdivisions, which have also been subject to periodic reform. Throughout these changes, Yorkshire has continued to be recognised as a geographical territory and cultural region. The name is familiar and well understood across the United Kingdom and is in common use in the media and the military, and also features in the titles of current areas of civil administration such as North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and East Riding of Yorkshire.  - In England, a civil parish is a territorial designation which is the lowest tier of local government below districts and counties, or their combined form, the unitary authority. It is an administrative parish, in contrast to an ecclesiastical parish.  - Newburgh Priory is a large house near Coxwold , North Yorkshire , England . Standing on the site of an Augustinian priory , founded in 1145 , it is a stately home in a rural setting with views to the Kilburn White Horse in the distance . The grounds contain a water garden , walled garden , topiary yews and woodland walks . It was an Augustinian Priory from 1145 providing priests for the surrounding churches in return for gifts of land and money from the rich landowners . It is reputed to be the burial place of Oliver Cromwell whose remains were said to have been taken to Newburgh Priory by his daughter Mary when she married the 2nd Viscount . The house was the country seat for the Bellasis family in the 16th and 17th century . Newburgh used to belong to the Earls of Fauconberg is now the home of Sir George and Lady Wombwell who open the Priory to visitors for guided tours from April to June . It is home to the Magic Loungeabout music festival .  - Yorkshire and the Humber is one of nine official regions of England at the first level of NUTS for statistical purposes. It comprises most of Yorkshire (South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, the East Riding of Yorkshire including Hull, the shire county of North Yorkshire and the City of York), North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire. It does not include Middlesbrough or Redcar and Cleveland (which are in the ceremonial county of North Yorkshire but not in the shire county). The population in 2011 was 5,284,000.  - North East England is one of the nine regions of England that are classified at the first level of NUTS for statistical purposes. It covers Northumberland, County Durham, Tyne and Wear, and the Tees Valley. The region is home to three large conurbations: Teesside, Wearside, and Tyneside, the latter of which is the largest of the three and the eighth most populous conurbation in the United Kingdom. There are only three cities in the region; Newcastle upon Tyne is the largest city in the region with a population of just under 280,000, followed by Sunderland, both of which are located in the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear. The city of Durham is the county town of County Durham. Other large settlements in the region include Darlington; Gateshead; Hartlepool; Middlesbrough; South Shields; Stockton-on-Tees; Alnwick and Washington.  - The Kilburn White Horse, , is a hill figure cut into the hillside in the North York Moors National Park near Kilburn in North Yorkshire, England. The figure is long by high and covers about and said to be the largest and most northerly hill figure in England.  - North Yorkshire is a non-metropolitan county (or shire county) and larger ceremonial county in England. It is located primarily in the region of Yorkshire and the Humber but partly in the region of North East England.  - Coxwold is a village and civil parish in the Hambleton district of North Yorkshire, England and located within the North York Moors National Park. It is situated 18 miles north of York and is where the Rev. Laurence Sterne wrote \\"A Sentimental Journey\\".  - York is a historic walled city at the confluence of the rivers Ouse and Foss in North Yorkshire, England. The municipality is the traditional county town of Yorkshire to which it gives its name. The city has a rich heritage and has provided the backdrop to major political events in England throughout much of its two millennia of existence. The city offers a wealth of historic attractions, of which York Minster is the most prominent, and a variety of cultural and sporting activities making it a popular tourist destination for millions.  - A non-metropolitan county, or colloquially, shire county, is a county-level entity in England that is not a metropolitan county. The counties typically have populations of 300,000 to 1.4 million. The term \\"shire county\\" is, however, an unofficial usage. Many of the non-metropolitan counties bear historic names and most end in the suffix \\"-shire\\" such as Wiltshire or Staffordshire. Of the remainder, some counties had the -shire ending and have lost it over time; such as Devon and Somerset. \\"Shire county\\" is, strictly, a dual-language tautology since the French-derived \\"county\\" means the same as the older Anglo-Saxon word \\"shire\\".  - Laurence Sterne (24 November 1713  18 March 1768) was an Irish novelist and an Anglican clergyman. He wrote the novels \\"The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman\\" and \\"A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy\\", and also published many sermons, wrote memoirs, and was involved in local politics. Sterne died in London after years of fighting consumption.    What is the relationship between 'newburgh priory' and 'hambleton'?

I have a new situation: After decades of debate, Brunei decided to adopt electrical vehicles and use them extensively, ultimately phasing out gasoline powered vehicles. Their neighbor Nepal decided to continue using gasoline-powered vehicles extensively.  But I can use this background: Gasoline-powered vehicles emit a lot of harmful materials. Nitrogen oxides are formed when atmospheric nitrogen reacts with oxygen at the high temperatures found in a car engine. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Evaporated and unused fuel releases volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere to help form smog. The presence of a catalytic converter in the exhaust system of the car causes these materials to react and be changed into less harmful products.  What is an answer for this question: Which country had their vehicles emitting more harmful materials? A:","output":"In this scenario, Nepal is the country with vehicles that emit more harmful materials. This conclusion is based on the fact that Nepal has decided to continue using gasoline-powered vehicles extensively, while Brunei has chosen to adopt electric vehicles and phase out gasoline-powered vehicles. Gasoline-powered vehicles are known to emit harmful materials, such as nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and volatile hydrocarbons, which contribute to air pollution, smog formation, and various health concerns. Even though catalytic converters work to reduce these emissions by converting them into less harmful products, some emissions still exist. On the other hand, electric vehicles do not emit any harmful tailpipe emissions since they do not have internal combustion engines. The generation of electricity to charge electric vehicles does have some environmental impact, depending on the source of electricity. However, overall, electric vehicles are considered to be significantly cleaner and better for the environment compared to their gasoline counterparts, especially when the power supply is derived from renewable energy sources. Consequently, Brunei's decision to adopt electric vehicles and phase out gasoline-powered ones highlights their commitment to reduce harmful emissions from the transportation sector, improve air quality, and minimize the environmental impact. In contrast, Nepal's continued use of gasoline-powered vehicles implies that its vehicles will continue to emit more harmful materials, contributing to their air pollution, health concerns and environmental issues."},{"instruction":"Given the question: FINAL EXAM  Question 1.

The binomial coefficient is defined as:    [    binom{m+n}{m} = frac{(m+n)!}{m!n!}    ] 7. This formula arises due to the counting principle where we are being asked to find the number of ways to order (m) upward movements (U's) among the (m+n) positions, and the remaining positions will naturally be our (n) rightward movements (R's). 8. Hence, the number of allowable formations of mobots on an (m times n) grid with the specified movement constraints is exactly (frac{(m+n)!}{m!n!}). # Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{(m+n)!}{m!n!}} ]"},{"instruction":"Define a function f(x) on mathbb{R} that satisfies f(x+6)=f(x).

Then ( p ) must divide both ( a ) and ( b ) because if ( p ) divides ( ab ), it must divide at least one of ( a ) or ( b ). Assume ( p ) divides both ( a ) and ( b ). 2. **Valuation Analysis**:    Consider the ( p )-adic valuation ( v_p ). We have:    [ v_p((ab)^{2015}) = v_p((a^2 + b^2)^m). ]    This implies:    [ 2015 cdot v_p(ab) = m cdot v_p(a^2 + b^2). ] 3. **Prime Divisors of ( a ) and ( b )**:    Since ( a ) and ( b ) share the same set of prime divisors, we can write:    [ a = p^k alpha quad text{and} quad b = p^y beta, ]    where ( alpha ) and ( beta ) are coprime to ( p ). 4. **Valuation of ( a^2 + b^2 )**:    We need to consider the valuation of ( a^2 + b^2 ):    [ a^2 + b^2 = p^{2k} alpha^2 + p^{2y} beta^2. ]    The valuation ( v_p(a^2 + b^2) ) will be ( 2 min(k, y) ) if ( k neq y ). If ( k = y ), then:    [ v_p(a^2 + b^2) = 2k + v_p(alpha^2 + beta^2). ] 5. **Equating Valuations**:    From the equation:    [ 2015 cdot v_p(ab) = m cdot v_p(a^2 + b^2), ]    we get:    [ 2015 cdot (k + y) = m cdot 2 min(k, y). ]    This implies:    [ m = frac{2015 cdot (k + y)}{2 min(k, y)}. ] 6. **Divisibility Condition**:    For ( m ) to be an integer, ( 2 min(k, y) ) must divide ( 2015 cdot (k + y) ). Since ( 2015 ) is odd, ( 2 min(k, y) ) must be a divisor of ( k + y ). 7. **AM-GM Inequality**:    By the AM-GM inequality:    [ a^2 + b^2 geq 2ab. ]    Since ( a^2 + b^2 geq 2ab ), we have:    [ (a^2 + b^2)^m geq (2ab)^m. ]    For the equation to hold, ( m ) must be such that:    [ (ab)^{2015} leq (2ab)^m. ]    This implies:    [ 2015 leq m log_2(ab). ] 8. **Conclusion**:    Since ( m ) must be a divisor of ( 2015 ) and ( m neq 2015 ) (as shown by the AM-GM inequality), we conclude that there is no positive integer ( m ) that satisfies the given equation.

To demonstrate that the equation ( x!y! = z! ) has an infinite number of solutions in natural numbers greater than 1, we need to find a pattern or a general formula that will produce valid solutions for natural numbers ( x, y, ) and ( z ). 2. Consider setting ( y = m ), where ( m ) is any natural number greater than 1. This choice is arbitrary and ( m ) can be any natural number. 3. Next, set ( x = m! - 1 ). The factorial of a number ( m ) (denoted ( m! )) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to ( m ). Hence, ( m! - 1 ) will be a natural number. 4. Finally, let ( z = m! ). Since ( z ) is the factorial of ( m ), ( z ) is indeed a natural number. 5. To verify our solution, let's substitute these expressions for ( x, y, ) and ( z ) into the original equation:    [    x! cdot y! = z!    ]        Substituting ( x = m! - 1 ), ( y = m ), and ( z = m! ):    [    (m! - 1)! cdot m! = (m!)!    ] 6.

Verifying step-by-step multiplication is complex due to the factorials, but since ( m ) is an arbitrary natural number, ((m!)!) will always be the product of all integers from 1 to ( m! ).  8. This setup guarantees infinite solutions:     - For ( m = 2 ): ( x = 2! - 1 = 1 ), and ( z = 2! = 2 ):       [       (1!) cdot (2!) = 2!       ]       which simplifies to ( 1 cdot 2 = 2 ).     - For larger ( m ), the equation ( x! cdot m! = (m!)! ) follows the same pattern and ensures that there are an infinite number of solutions because we can always choose ( m ) to be any natural number. # Conclusion: The equation ( x! y! = z! ) has an infinite number of solutions in natural numbers greater than 1.

We need to show that for any such triangle, it is possible to inscribe a circle whose area is greater than 0.5. 2. Let us consider a right triangle ABC with legs AD=|CD|=1, angle hat{A}=alpha, and |ON| = r where ON is the radius of the inscribed circle. 3. First, we need to express various sides of triangle ABC in terms of alpha:     - Using trigonometric identities, we have:       [       |AD| = cot alpha, quad |DB| = tan alpha, quad |AC| = frac{1}{sin alpha}, quad |BC| = frac{1}{cos alpha}       ] 4. Therefore, the hypotenuse length |AB| is given by:     [     |AB| = tan alpha + cot alpha = frac{1}{sin alpha cos alpha}     ] 5. The perimeter of the triangle can be found by summing up the lengths of the sides:     [     |AB| = |AP| + |PB| = |AN| + |BM| = left( |AC| - r right) + left( |BC| - r right) = frac{1}{sin alpha} + frac{1}{cos alpha} - 2r     ] 6. Equate the two expressions for |AB|:     [     frac{1}{sin alpha cos alpha} = frac{1}{sin alpha} + frac{1}{cos alpha} - 2r     ] 7. To solve for r, rearrange the equation:     [     2r = frac{1}{sin alpha} + frac{1}{cos alpha} - frac{1}{sin alpha cos alpha}     ] 8. Simplify the equation:     [     r = frac{1}{2} left( frac{1}{sin alpha} + frac{1}{cos alpha} - frac{1}{sin alpha cos alpha} right) = frac{1}{2} left( frac{sin alpha - (1 - cos alpha)}{sin alpha cos alpha} right)     ] 9. Further simplification:     [     r = frac{1}{2} left( frac{2sin frac{alpha}{2} cos frac{alpha}{2} - 2sin^2 frac{alpha}{2}}{2sin frac{alpha}{2} cos frac{alpha}{2} left(cos^2 frac{alpha}{2} - sin^2 frac{alpha}{2} right)} right)     ] 10. Finally, we simplify to:     [     r = frac{1}{1 + sin alpha + cos alpha} = frac{1}{1 + sqrt{2} cos left(alpha - frac{pi}{4}right)}     ] 11. Note that the radius and hence the area of the inscribed circle will be minimized when alpha = frac{pi}{4}, because at this value cosleft(alpha - frac{pi}{4}right) achieves its maximum value. 12.

Consider a triangle ( Delta ABC ) with an inscribed circle. Denote the points of tangency of the incircle with sides ( AC ), ( BC ), and ( AB ) as ( T ), ( Q ), and ( P ) respectively. 2. Let ( M ) be the midpoint of the line segment connecting points ( P ) and ( Q ). 3. Draw a perpendicular to the opposite side ( BC ) from ( M ), which we will denote as ( l_a ). 4. By symmetry, similarly consider midpoints ( N ) and ( O ) of the line segments ( P )-( T ) and ( Q )-( T ) respectively, and also draw perpendiculars ( l_b ) and ( l_c ) to ( AC ) and ( AB ) from points ( N ) and ( O ) respectively. 5. We aim to demonstrate that the perpendiculars ( l_a ), ( l_b ), and ( l_c ) intersect at one single point. To proceed: 6. Note that since triangle ( Delta ABC ) is tangential to the circle at points ( P ), ( Q ), and ( T ), the problem can be reinterpreted using properties from the Euler line and the Nine-Point circle in geometry. 7. Consider triangle ( Delta ABC ) with ( O ) as the circumcenter, (G) as the centroid, and ( H ) as the orthocenter. 8. We know (H) lies on the Euler line and properties of the triangle dictate that if you connect the circumcenter and the orthocenter, they would be collinear and form the famous Euler line. 9. Using Nine-Point circle properties: The Nine-Point circle passes through the midpoints of the sides of ( Delta ABC ), the feet of the altitudes and the midpoints of the line segments joining each vertex with the orthocenter.  10. Given ( A ), ( B ), ( C ) vertices, the Nine-Point circle centered at (N) (the nine-point center) includes points ( M ), ( N ), and ( P ). 11. As ( l_a ) is perpendicular to the sides (BC) from the midpoint segment joining tangent points of the incircle it's directed towards (N), the center of Nine-Point Circle. 12. From properties of the Nine-Point circle, the Nine-Point circle shares its center with the Orthocenter and thus the (M), (N), and (P) points are uniquely related to the orthocenter (H). 13. Each perpendicular from the midpoints to opposite sides intersects uniquely at point (N) since it's the Nine-Point center and maintains concurrency given the symmetry of the Nine-Point circle, thus implying these perpendiculars ( l_a ), ( l_b ), ( l_c ) intersect uniquely at this specific point (N). # Conclusion: Thus, the perpendiculars ( l_a ), ( l_b ), and ( l_c ) drawn from the midpoints of the line segments connecting points of tangency to the opposite sides intersect at a single point.

Total hours for both trees = 3 hours (since we are considering the same time frame for both trees) Average number of leaves per hour = Total leaves / Total hours Average number of leaves per hour = 42 leaves / 3 hours = 14 leaves per hour So, the average number of leaves which fell per hour across both trees is boxed{14}  leaves per hour."},{"instruction":"Let ( a ) and ( b ) be positive real numbers with ( a ge b ).

In summary, when aleqslant 0, the monotonic increasing interval of g(x) is (-infty,+infty); when a > 0, the monotonic increasing interval of g(x) is (ln a,+infty), and the monotonic decreasing interval is (-infty,ln a).

Since q'(x)=e^{x-1}- frac{1}{x} and q''(x)=e^{x-1}+ frac{1}{x^2} > 0, q'(x) is an increasing function on xin[1,+infty). Also, q'(1)=0, so q(x) is an increasing function on xin[1,+infty), and q(x)geqslant q(1)=a+1 > 0. - When 1leqslant xleqslant e, |p(x)|-|q(x)|=p(x)-q(x)= frac{e}{x}-e^{x-1}-a. Let m(x)= frac{e}{x}-e^{x-1}-a, then m'(x)=- frac{e}{x^2}-e^{x-1} < 0, so m(x) is a decreasing function on xin[1,+infty), and m(x)leqslant m(1)=e-1-a. Since ageqslant 2, m(x) < 0, so |p(x)| < |q(x)|, meaning frac{e}{x} is closer to ln x than e^{x-1}+a. - When x > e, |p(x)|-|q(x)|=-p(x)-q(x)=- frac{e}{x}+2ln x-e^{x-1}-a < 2ln x-e^{x-1}-a. Let n(x)=2ln x-e^{x-1}-a, then n'(x)= frac{2}{x}-e^{x-1} and n''(x)=- frac{2}{x^2}-e^{x-1} < 0, so n'(x) is a decreasing function when x > e, and n(x) < n(e)=2-a-e^{e-1} < 0. Therefore, |p(x)| < |q(x)|, meaning frac{e}{x} is closer to ln x than e^{x-1}+a. In conclusion, when ageqslant 2 and xgeqslant 1, frac{e}{x} is closer to ln x than e^{x-1}+a.

Let's analyze the responses: - **Case 1: ( B_1 = B_2 )**:     - If the baron's responses for both sets are identical, then the additional coin must be a real coin. If it were counterfeit, the baron would have increased the false coin count by his fixed amount.     - Therefore, the additional coin is real. - **Case 2: ( B_1 neq B_2 )**:     - If the responses differ, it indicates the baron reported additional counterfeits. Since the only difference between the two sets is the inclusion of the additional coin, the difference ( B_2 - B_1 ) indicates how many more counterfeits the baron reports due to the extra coin.     - Hence, if ( B_2 > B_1 ), the additional coin is counterfeit. By repeating the above process, Georg can check for the authenticity of any coin. By systematically including each coin one-by-one with the same 10 coins initially shown, Georg can identify all counterfeit coins in the collection within several queries. # Conclusion: Georg can indeed guarantee to identify the counterfeit coins by using the method outlined: presenting random 10 coins first, then the same 10 coins with one extra, and comparing the results.

We need to prove that if the points A, B, O, and M are concyclic, then the point K is also on the same circle.  Step-by-Step Proof: 1. **Angle at Point O:**    - The point O is the incenter of triangle ABC.     - The angle angle AOB formed by the incenter can be calculated:    [    angle AOB = 180^circ - left( frac{alpha}{2} + frac{beta}{2} right) = 90^circ + frac{gamma}{2}    ] 2. **Angle at Point K:**    - The point K is the circumcenter of triangle ABC.    - The angle angle AKB at the center subtended by the arc AB is twice the angle subtended by the same arc at the circle:    [    angle AKB = 2gamma    ] 3. **Angle at Point M (Orthocenter):**    - We analyze the angle angle AMB for three different cases:        **Case 1: When alpha < 90^circ and beta < 90^circ:**    [    angle AMB = 180^circ - left( left( 90^circ - alpha right) + left( 90^circ - beta right) right) = 180^circ - gamma    ]        **Case 2: When alpha = 90^circ or beta = 90^circ:**    [    text{This is a special case where the triangle is right-angled, and } M text{ coincides with either } A text{ or } B.    ]    **Case 3: When either alpha or beta is obtuse:**    [    angle AMB = 180^circ - left( left( 90^circ - gamma right) + 90^circ right) = gamma    ] 4. **Proving the Concurrency for Different Cases:**    - In **Case 1**:      - The points O and M are on the same side of the line AB (containing vertex C), hence we get:      [      90^circ + frac{gamma}{2} = angle AOB = angle AMB = 180^circ - gamma      ]      This implies gamma = 60^circ. So,      [      angle AKB = 120^circ      ]      Since angle AKB = angle AOB, K lies on the same circle as A, B, O, and M.        - In **Case 2**:      - The points A, B, O, and M always lie on a circle. For K to be on the same circle:      [      90^circ + frac{gamma}{2} = angle AOB = angle AKB = 2gamma      ]      This also implies gamma = 60^circ. Therefore, the triangle angles must be 90^circ, 60^circ, 30^circ and K will lie on the same circle.        - In **Case 3**:      - The points O and M are on different sides of the line AB, hence we get:      [      angle AOB + angle AMB = 90^circ + frac{gamma}{2} +gamma = 180^circ      ]      This implies gamma = 60^circ. Thus,      [      angle AKB = 120^circ = angle AOB Rightarrow K       ]      lies on the circle containing A, B, O, M. In all cases, our claim holds true. Thus, K indeed lies on the circle that contains A, B, O, M when the points A, B, O, M are concyclic.

Therefore, the distance in the y-direction from the vertex to the center will be the same as the distance in the x-direction, which is 9. The y-coordinate of the vertex is -4, so to find the y-coordinate of the center, we either add or subtract 9 from -4. Since the x-coordinate of the center is greater than the x-coordinate of the vertex, and the square is positioned symmetrically around the center, the y-coordinate of the center will be -4 + 9 = 5.

It is only necessary to find the value of its slope. Therefore, we first use the derivative to find the value of the derivative function at x=0, and then combine the geometric meaning of the derivative to find the slope of the tangent line.

Therefore, for the function f(x) = x^3 - x + 1, the equation of the tangent line at point (0,1) is y - 1 = -x, which simplifies to x + y - 1 = 0. Let x=0, we get y=1. Let y=0, we get x=1.

Isolate y: begin{align*} sqrt{3}x - y & = -2  -y & = - sqrt{3}x - 2  y & = sqrt{3}x + 2 end{align*} Now we can see that the slope, m, is sqrt{3}. **Step 3: Calculate the angle of inclination** The angle of inclination, theta, is related to the slope by the equation tan{theta} = m. Therefore, begin{align*} tan{theta} &= sqrt{3}  theta & = arctan{sqrt{3}}  theta & = frac{pi}{3} end{align*} So, the angle of inclination is boxed{frac{pi}{3}}."},{"instruction":"Find the number of permutations ((a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7)) of ((1,2,3,4,5,6,7)) that satisfy [frac{a_1 + 1}{2} cdot frac{a_2 + 2}{2} cdot frac{a_3 + 3}{2} cdot frac{a_4 + 4}{2} cdot frac{a_5 + 5}{2} cdot frac{a_6 + 6}{2} cdot frac{a_7 + 7}{2} = 7!] and (a_7 > a_1).","output":"By AM-GM, for each (k) with (1 le k le 7), [frac{a_k + k}{2} ge sqrt{k a_k}.] Then, [frac{a_1 + 1}{2} cdot frac{a_2 + 2}{2} cdot frac{a_3 + 3}{2} cdot frac{a_4 + 4}{2} cdot frac{a_5 + 5}{2} cdot frac{a_6 + 6}{2} cdot frac{a_7 + 7}{2} ge sqrt{7! cdot a_1 a_2 a_3 a_4 a_5 a_6 a_7} = 7!.] Equality occurs if and only if (a_k = k) for all (1 le k le 7).

Assume all a_i are equal, let [a = a_1 = a_2 = dots = a_{13}.] Then S = 13a, and substituting into the equation x^2 - 2x - 2S = 0 gives  [a^2 - 2a - 26a = 0] or [a^2 - 28a = 0,] hence [a(a - 28) = 0,] so a = 0 or a = 28. If there are two distinct values, say a and b, suppose n of the a_i are a and 13 - n are b. Thus, [S = na + (13 - n) b.] Since a and b are roots of x^2 - 2x - 2S = 0, by Vieta's formulas, a + b = 2 and ab = -2S. Hence, [na + (13 - n)b = -2ab.] From a + b = 2, b = 2 - a.

Due to reducing the number of planes, some routes must be canceled. We need to prove that it is possible to reduce the routes such that there are at least 30 airports each with exactly one route. 2. **Initial Setup:** Consider the airport network as a graph G = (V, E) where V represents the airports (nodes) and E represents the routes (edges). Each node has at least one connecting edge. 3. **Reduction Procedure:** We will sequentially cancel routes that connect two airports if and only if both airports have more than one connecting route remaining. This means each airport will be left with exactly one route connecting it to another airport.  4. **Count Constraints:** Let ( x ) be the number of airports each with exactly one route after the reduction step. Then, the number of airports with more than one route is ( 50 - x ). 5. **Minimum Degree Constraint:** For each node in ( 50 - x ), there must be at least 2 edges connecting to other nodes. These edges must connect to nodes in ( x ) as each node in ( x ) has precisely one route. 6. **Formulate Inequality:**    - Each of the ( 50 - x ) airports must have at least 2 routes.    - Hence, the total number of edges for airports in ( 50 - x ) is at least ( 2(50 - x) ).    - Each edge must lead to a unique airport in the set ( x ), thus ( 2(50 - x) leq x ).

Let's denote (m) and (n) as positive integers with (m < n).  Step 1: Binomial Expansion Consider the binomial expansion of ((m + (n - m))^n): [ (m + (n - m))^n = n^n ] Expanding the left side using the binomial theorem, we get: [ (m + (n - m))^n = sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} m^k (n - m)^{n-k} ] Each term in this expansion is of the form: [ binom{n}{k} m^k (n - m)^{n - k} ]  Step 2: Consider the Specific Term We are particularly interested in the term where (k = m): [ binom{n}{m} m^m (n - m)^{n - m} ] This term is part of the sum and thus we have: [ binom{n}{m} m^m (n - m)^{n - m} leq n^n ] Which simplifies to: [ frac{n^n}{m^m (n - m)^{n - m}} geq frac{n!}{m! (n - m)!} ]  Step 3: Largest Term in the Binomial Expansion To show that (binom{n}{m} m^m (n - m)^{n-m}) is the largest term in the binomial expansion, we compare consecutive terms: [ text{Consider} quad T_r = binom{n}{r} m^r (n - m)^{n - r} ] and [ T_{r+1} = binom{n}{r+1} m^{r+1} (n - m)^{n - r - 1} ] The ratio of the (r+1)-th term to the (r)-th term is: [ frac{T_{r+1}}{T_r} = frac{binom{n}{r+1} m^{r+1} (n - m)^{n - r - 1}}{binom{n}{r} m^r (n - m)^{n - r}} = frac{binom{n}{r+1}}{binom{n}{r}} cdot m cdot frac{1}{n - m} ] Simplifying, since (frac{binom{n}{r+1}}{binom{n}{r}} = frac{n - r}{r + 1}), we get: [ frac{T_{r+1}}{T_r} = frac{n - r}{r + 1} cdot frac{m}{n - m} ]  Step 4: Analyze the Ratio For (r = m): [ frac{T_{m+1}}{T_m} = frac{n - m}{m + 1} cdot frac{m}{n - m} = frac{m}{m + 1} ] Since (frac{m}{m + 1} < 1), the term (T_m) is larger than the succeeding term (T_{m+1}). For the terms before (m) (i.e., (k < m)), a similar analysis shows that (T_m) is larger than (T_{m-1}) and so on, making (T_m) the largest term in the expansion. Therefore:  [ binom{n}{m} m^m (n - m)^{n - m} < (n + 1) binom{n}{m} m^m (n - m)^{n - m}  ]  Step 5: Conclusion Combining these results, we have: [ frac{n^n}{m^m (n-m)^{n-m}} > frac{n!}{m!

Point (M) is the midpoint of side (AB). We need to find the angle (AMH). Let's solve this step-by-step: 1. Notice that (angle B = 111^circ) implies (angle D = angle B = 111^circ) due to the properties of parallelograms. 2. Recognize that (BC = BD) indicates triangle (BDC) is isosceles, with (BD) and (BC) as its equal sides. 3. Given (angle BHD = 90^circ) and knowing that in any isosceles triangle, the median to the base is also the altitude, (DM) is both the median and the altitude in triangle (BDA). 4. Hence, (DM perp AB), implying (angle DMB = 90^circ). 5. As (angle DMB = angle BHD = 90^circ), points (M), (B), (H), and (D) lie on the same circle with diameter (MD). This is because any quadrilateral inscribed in a circle where opposite angles sum to (180^circ) is a cyclic quadrilateral. 6.

Step 2: Determine the range of x Since x is a three-digit number, 100 leq x leq 999. Adding 10 to x, we get 110 leq x+10 leq 1009. However, since x+10 is a four-digit palindrome, we focus on the range 1000 leq x+10 leq 1009.  Step 3: Identify the four-digit palindrome within the range The only four-digit palindrome within the range 1000 to 1009 is 1001. Therefore, we set x+10 = 1001.  Step 4: Solve for x [ x + 10 = 1001 ] [ x = 1001 - 10 ] [ x = 991 ]  Step 5: Calculate the sum of the digits of x The digits of x = 991 are 9, 9, and 1.
