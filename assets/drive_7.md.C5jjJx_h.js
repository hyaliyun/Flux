Does it follow that \\"Why hadn't he mentioned he was still on the case. \\"?","output":"There could be various reasons why he had not let them know that he was still working on the case. Let's explore some of the possible motives and scenarios, considering both perspectives - his own and the people involved who expected updates on the case progress. 1. Confidentiality and safety concerns: In some cases, revealing the ongoing investigation status to individuals or groups may cause panic, arouse suspicion or result in alerting the subjects under investigation. These could negatively impact the progress of the case and even put the investigator or others at risk. 2. Fear of interference: The individual working on the case might be concerned about external pressures or influences exerted on the investigation if they shared their ongoing work. In some instances, they might prefer to withhold information until they reach a significant breakthrough that would be more conclusive and leave less room for outside tampering or interference. 3. Desire for independent work: It's possible that the investigator values their autonomy and prefers working independently on cases without constantly updating concerned parties. This might stem from their personality, work style, or previous experiences where collaboration may have led to complications in case resolution. 4. Need for time and space: The investigator might have realized that the case is more complicated than initially assumed and requires a deeper analysis. By not disclosing the ongoing work, the investigator can buy time and space to explore the case without external pressure or the burden of expectations from others. 5. Lack of significant progress: Sometimes, investigators might not have concrete updates to share due to the nature of the case or challenges they encountered. In such scenarios, they might choose to withhold information until they have significant findings or breakthroughs that would be worthwhile to share. As for the second question, \\"Why hadn't he mentioned he was still on the case?\\" - Yes, it essentially follows the same meaning, but it is phrased slightly differently. Both questions convey the same idea of enquiring as to why the individual did not inform others that they were still working on the case. The difference lies in the use of \\"hadn't\\" and \\"mentioned\\" in the second question, which implies a slightly more informal and conversational tone. However, both questions are asking for the same insight into the investigator's reasons for keeping the case's ongoing status undisclosed."},{"instruction":"In this task, you're given the middle and ending of a three-part story.

He was born around 1092 or 1096 in Blois, France, and was the third son of Stephen, Count of Blois, and Adela, who was the daughter of William the Conqueror. As a result, he was a member of the House of Blois, a noble family originating from the French region of the same name. King Stephen ruled from 1135 to 1154, occupying the English throne during a period known as \\"The Anarchy.\\" This era was marked by a struggle for power between the monarchy, the nobility, and the church. It began after the death of King Henry I, who had appointed his daughter, Empress Matilda, as his successor. However, Matilda's right to the throne was challenged by Stephen, her cousin, who claimed that Henry had nominated him on his deathbed. Quick to act, Stephen sailed to England and secured support from key nobles and the Church. On December 22, 1135, he was anointed king by the Archbishop of Canterbury, thus beginning his reign. However, his ascendance to the throne was not universally recognized, and a civil war erupted between his supporters and those that remained loyal to Empress Matilda. Stephen's reign was marked by conflict and political instability. His right to the throne was continuously challenged, and the monarchy's authority was weakened, allowing for the rise of powerful barons. During his rule, administrative structures fell into disarray, contributing to the decline of the royal government's effectiveness. Despite multiple setbacks, Stephen held onto the throne for nearly two decades. In 1153, Stephen and Matilda's son, the future King Henry II, reached an agreement known as the Treaty of Wallingford. This pact stipulated that Stephen would retain the crown for the remainder of his life, but that upon his death, the Angevin line of succession would be restored, and the English throne would pass to Henry. Consequently, when Stephen died on October 25, 1154, Henry ascended to the throne, marking the end of The Anarchy. In conclusion, Stephen of Blois was the English monarch who held the title \\"Count de Blois.\\" His rule was characterized by a tumultuous rivalry for the throne, which severely weakened the monarchy and ultimately led to a period of chaos. However, through a negotiated agreement, Stephen managed to maintain his position until his death, after which the Angevin line was restored with Henry II's reign."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them. Separate tails are formed of dust and gases, becoming visible through different phenomena; the dust reflects sunlight directly and the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be visible without the aid of a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye. Year 2022 would be an interesting year when three comets would get scientists' attention - Comet A, Comet B, and Comet C. Comet A and C are very faint, but Comet B is very bright. Comet A would enter the inner solar system on February 10, 2022 and leave the inner solar system on February 20, 2022. Comet B would enter the inner solar system on February 18, 2022 and leave the inner solar system on February 26, 2022. Comet C would never enter the inner solar system. Wich comet would not be visible to naked eyes on February 19, 2022, Comet A or Comet B? The answer to this question is:","output":"Comet A would not be visible to the naked eye on February 19, 2022. Let's analyze the situation for each comet: 1. Comet A: This comet is described as being very faint, which means it might not be visible to the naked eye even when it is in the inner Solar System. It will enter the inner Solar System on February 10, 2022, and leave on February 20, 2022. Given that it is still in the inner Solar System on February 19, 2022, it still has a chance to be visible, but its faintness makes it unlikely that it will be visible to the naked eye. 2. Comet B: This comet is described as being very bright, which implies that it should be easily visible to the naked eye when it's in the inner Solar System. It will enter the inner Solar System on February 18, 2022, and leave on February 26, 2022. Since it is both bright and in the inner Solar System on February 19, 2022, it should be visible to the naked eye. 3. Comet C: Though not asked in the question, it is worth noting that Comet C would also not be visible to the naked eye on February 19, 2022, as it never enters the inner Solar System. In conclusion, Comet A would not be visible to the naked eye on February 19, 2022, as it is very faint. Comet B, on the other hand, would be visible due to its brightness and presence in the inner Solar System during that time."},{"instruction":"Question: what is adem disease?

Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power.

Jeff takes a sip of his beer and says that he just discovered that his soil is hypoxic. Brandon is trying to get the attention of the bartender so he can order another martini. Upon hearing Jeff's remark about his soil, Brandon states that the soil on his own farm is not hypoxic. Brandon is relieved when he notices the bartender is finally walking over to them. Does Jeff's soil have more or less toxic compounds than Brandon's? Hint: When soil is flooded, hypoxia develops, as soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma. A:","output":"Jeff's soil has more toxic compounds than Brandon's because hypoxic soil has inhibited nitrification and the formation of toxic compounds due to low oxygen levels and the activity of anaerobic bacteria."},{"instruction":"Which entity is this text about? Ford was born at the Swedish Covenant Hospital in Chicago, Illinois to Christopher Ford (born John William Ford), an advertising executive and former actor, and Dorothy (nee Nidelman), a former radio actress. His father is Irish and his mother is Jewish. A younger brother, Terence, was born in 1945. Ford's paternal grandparents, John Fitzgerald Ford and Florence Veronica Niehaus, were of Irish Catholic and German descent, respectively. In 1964, after a season of summer stock with the Belfry Players in Wisconsin, Ford traveled to Los Angeles to apply for a job in radio voice-overs. He did not get it, but stayed in California and eventually signed a 150-a-week contract with Columbia Pictures' New Talent program, playing bit roles in films. His first known role was an uncredited one as a bellhop in Dead Heat on a Merry-Go-Round (1966). There is little record of his non-speaking roles (or \\"extra\\" work) in film. Ford was at the bottom of the hiring list, having offended producer Jerry Tokovsky after he played a bellboy in the feature. He was told by Tokovsky that when actor Tony Curtis delivered a bag of groceries, he did it like a movie star; Ford felt his job was to act like a bellboy. Ford managed to secure other roles in movies, such as A Time for Killing (The Long Ride Home), starring Glenn Ford; George Hamilton; and Inger Stevens. His speaking roles continued next with Luv (1967), though he was still uncredited. He was finally credited as \\"Harrison J. Ford\\" in the 1967 Western film A Time for Killing, but the \\"J\\" did not stand for anything, since he has no middle name. It was added to avoid confusion with a silent film actor named Harrison Ford, who appeared in more than 80 films between 1915 and 1932 and died in 1957. Ford later said that he was unaware of the existence of the earlier actor until he came upon a star with his own name on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Ford soon dropped the \\"J\\" and worked for Universal Studios, playing minor roles in many television series throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, including Gunsmoke, Ironside, The Virginian, The F.B.I., Love, American Style, and Kung Fu. He appeared in the western Journey to Shiloh (1968) and had an uncredited, non-speaking role in Michelangelo Antonioni's 1970 film Zabriskie Point as an arrested student protester. Not happy with the roles being offered to him, Ford became a self-taught professional carpenter to support his then-wife and two young sons. Casting director and fledgling producer Fred Roos championed the young Ford and secured him an audition with George Lucas for the role of Bob Falfa, which Ford went on to play in American Graffiti (1973). Ford's relationship with Lucas would profoundly affect his career later on. After director Francis Ford Coppola's film The Godfather was a success, he hired Ford to expand his office and gave him small roles in his next two films, The Conversation (1974) and Apocalypse Now (1979); in the latter film he played an army officer named \\"G. Lucas\\". Entity:","output":"This text is about the American actor Harrison Ford."},{"instruction":"The next band was Matt and Kim and they were a nice guy named Matt and a cute punk girl named Kim .

Much is inferential and speculative, though numerous clues have emerged from his works and the writings of contemporary composers, theorists, and writers of the next several generations. Josquin was born in the area controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy, and was possibly born either in Hainaut (modern-day Belgium), or immediately across the border in modern-day France, since several times in his life he was classified legally as a Frenchman (for instance, when he made his will). Josquin was long mistaken for a man with a similar name, Josquin de Kessalia, born around the year 1440, who sang in Milan from 1459 to 1474, dying in 1498. More recent scholarship has shown that Josquin des Prez was born around 1450 or a few years later, and did not go to Italy until the early 1480s.Around 1466, perhaps on the death of his father, Josquin was named by his uncle and aunt, Gille Lebloitte dit Desprez and Jacque Banestonne, as their heir. Their will gives Josquin's actual surname as Lebloitte. According to Matthews and Merkley, \\"des Prez\\" was an alternative name.According to an account by Claude Hémeré, a friend and librarian of Cardinal Richelieu whose evidence dates as late as 1633, and who used the records of the collegiate church of Saint-Quentin, Josquin became a choirboy with his friend and colleague the Franco Flemish composer Jean Mouton at Saint-Quentin's royal church, probably around 1460. Doubt has been cast on the accuracy of Hémeré's account, however. Josquin may have studied counterpoint under Ockeghem, whom he greatly admired throughout his life: this is suggested both by the testimony of Gioseffo Zarlino and Lodovico Zacconi, writing later in the 16th century, and by Josquin's eloquent lament on the death of Ockeghem in 1497, Nymphes des bois/Requiem aeternam, based on the poem by Jean Molinet.

Although initially confusing the relic for a simple stick, she quickly realized the significance of her find, exclaiming to her father, \\"Daddy, I've found a sword!\\" As she raised it triumphantly, little did she know she was the first person to touch the weapon in approximately 1,500 years. While Saga wanted to keep her stunning find and brag about it around the world, she was required to keep the discovery a secret. This was to enable local officials to investigate the area further, searching for additional relics without the interference of treasure hunters.

Undeterred, young Saga is raising money in hopes of having a replica of the sword created. The BBC reports that the water level in Lake Vidostern was unusually low due to a drought, which likely contributed to the ease with which Saga discovered the ancient sword.

In his Presley obituary, Lester Bangs credited him as \\"the man who brought overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to the popular arts in America\\". Ed Sullivan's declaration that he perceived a soda bottle in Presley's trousers was echoed by rumors involving a similarly positioned toilet roll tube or lead bar.While Presley was marketed as an icon of heterosexuality, some cultural critics have argued that his image was ambiguous.

Question: suppose less conservation occurs happens, how will it affect more altering of surrounding environment occurs. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"If less conservation occurs, there will be a more significant altering of the surrounding environment due to the increased production of acid rain. The lack of conservation measures means that the natural ecosystem will be exposed to a higher concentration of harmful chemicals that are responsible for the formation of acid rain. This will result in several negative consequences and exacerbate the second mentioned effect, which is the destruction of vegetation. Firstly, the increase in acid rain production will lead to higher levels of acidity in the soil, making it virtually impossible for many plant species to survive. The increased soil acidity will cause nutrient deficiencies and toxicities, making it difficult for plants to extract essential nutrients from the soil, resulting in stunted growth or death. This will consequently affect the entire ecosystem as various organisms that rely on vegetation for food and shelter will be impacted, leading to declines in biodiversity. Secondly, with less conservation, air and water pollution will become more prevalent due to the increased release of harmful chemicals into the atmosphere. These chemicals not only contribute to the formation of acid rain but also have direct detrimental effects on plant health, further contributing to the destruction of vegetation. Polluted air can cause foliar damage, weaken plant immune systems, and contribute to disease, while pollution in freshwater systems can also harm aquatic vegetation. Additionally, the lack of conservation efforts could result in increased deforestation which would further alter the surrounding environment. Deforestation is another factor that contributes to the exacerbation of acid rain, as trees play a crucial role in absorbing carbon dioxide and other pollutants from the atmosphere. With fewer trees present in the ecosystem, there will be an increase in carbon dioxide levels and other pollutants, further affecting the acidity of the rain, soil, and water of the environment. In summary, if less conservation occurs, there will be a more significant effect on the surrounding environment due to the increased production of and exposure to acid rain. The increased levels of acidity will result in the destruction of vegetation, making it difficult for plant species to survive. This will adversely impact the entire ecosystem, as various organisms rely on plants for food and shelter, leading to a decline in overall biodiversity. It is essential that conservation efforts are prioritized to mitigate the detrimental effects of acid rain on the environment and maintain a healthy and balanced ecosystem."},{"instruction":"Q: This task is to translate a news commentary given in Italian language into Zhuang language.

Options: - hangover - getting drunk - swallow - euphoria - loss of control Reasoning process:","output":"1. First, let's understand the question: The user is asking about the bodily experiences one might have when drinking with the intention of getting drunk. 2. Now, let's examine the options: - Hangover: A hangover is an experience of discomfort and various unpleasant physiological effects that occur after consuming alcohol. While a hangover is related to alcohol consumption, it occurs after the drinking session, not during it, and is not the direct outcome of drinking to get drunk. - Getting drunk: This option is the most straightforward. Drinking with the intention of getting drunk will likely result in getting drunk, which means feeling various effects caused by alcohol such as slurred speech, slow reaction times, and unsteady gait. - Swallow: While swallowing is the act of consuming a liquid, which happens when you drink alcohol, it is not a bodily experience that occurs as a direct result of drinking to get drunk. - Euphoria: Euphoria refers to a state of intense happiness and excitement. Drinking alcohol can produce feelings of euphoria temporarily, as it affects the release of serotonin and dopamine in the brain. Euphoria is one of the possible experiences one may have while drinking with the intention of getting drunk. - Loss of control: Loss of control can refer to the inability to control one's actions, thoughts, or emotions, and it can be a consequence of getting drunk. Drinking alcohol can impair motor skills, cognitive function, and decision-making, which can lead to a loss of control. Reasoning process: Since the question is about the experiences one might have during drinking with the intention of getting drunk, we can rule out hangover and swallow, as they are not the direct outcomes of the act of drinking to get drunk. Getting drunk is the most obvious outcome of drinking with the intention of getting drunk. Euphoria and loss of control are also possible experiences during the process.

Though a number of lineup changes followed, the three original members remained together along with James LaBrie and Jordan Rudess until September 8, 2010, when Portnoy left the band. In October 2010, the band held auditions for a drummer to replace Portnoy.

Some religious groups teach that he originated as an angel, or something of the like, who used to possess great piety and beauty, but fell because of hubris, seducing humanity into the ways of falsehood and sin, and has power in the fallen world. In the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament, Satan is primarily an accuser and adversary, a decidedly malevolent entity, also called the devil, who possesses abhorrent qualities. Although Satan is generally viewed as having negative characteristics, some groups have very different beliefs. In Theistic Satanism, Satan is considered a deity who is either worshipped or revered. In LaVeyan Satanism, \\"Satan\\" is a symbol of virtuous characteristics and liberty. - Reign in Blood is the third studio album and the major-label debut by American thrash metal band Slayer. It was released on October 7, 1986, by Def Jam Recordings. The album was the band's first collaboration with record producer Rick Rubin, whose input helped the band's sound evolve. \\"Reign in Blood\\" was well received by both critics and fans, and was responsible for bringing Slayer to the attention of a mainstream metal audience. \\"Kerrang!\\" magazine described the record as \\"the heaviest album of all\\".

Avoid answers that provide incomplete justification for the question. Q: name something a grown woman might lie about but a young girl wouldnt A:","output":"Task: Write a correct answer for the given question, providing a reasoning based on prototypical situations, and ensuring the answer includes a complete justification. The question is: \\"Name something a grown woman might lie about but a young girl wouldn't.\\" Answer: A grown woman might lie about her age, but a young girl usually wouldn't. Reasoning: In many societies, there is a perceived pressure on women to look and feel younger, as youthfulness is often associated with beauty and vitality. As a result, a grown woman may feel the need to lie about her age to conform to society's expectations or her own personal desires. On the other hand, young girls typically do not experience this pressure yet, as they are often eager to grow up and feel more mature. Hence, they are less likely to lie about their age. This difference in perspective between grown women and young girls justifies the answer that a grown woman might lie about her age, while a young girl wouldn't."},{"instruction":"Write a short summary for this text: bp plc is taking a multimillion dollar broom to sweep away a slew of federal charges linked to energy price fixing , a deadly refinery blast and pipeline leaks and focus on its energy business .","output":"BP plc, a multinational oil and gas company, is investing millions of dollars in an effort to resolve various federal charges related to energy price-fixing, a fatal refinery explosion, and pipeline leaks.

(1). to prove it doesn't matter when food is eaten, but it matters what type of foods are eaten; (2). to change unhealthy dietary habits; (3). To encourage men to get off the couch; (4). not enough information; Given those answer options, answer the question: Eating less food at night time is sensible advice for someone trying to lose weight. The reason often given is that if eat you too much food at night, the body will store all those excess kilojoules as fat because we’re inactive until the next day. The reason sounds plausible, but if it was one hundred percent true then world hunger could be solved by just feeding people one meal at night time. What really matters is how much is eaten over days and weeks for weight gain or weight loss, not so much when it is eaten. There is merit though in advice to eat less at night time as it can help a person to cut back on the total quantity of food eaten. Eating lots of food in the evening can also be a marker for unhealthy dietary habits, especially if much of that extra food is going to fuel couch surfing exploits. So even though advice to eat less at night time seems logical, it hasn’t actually been well tested by science to see how effective it can be for losing weight. Filling this gap, a short-term study involving 29 healthy men looked at how 2 weeks of restricted night time eating fared against 2 weeks of ‘normal’ evening eating. Advice on restricting night eating was very clear: avoid any food or drink containing kilojoules between the hours of 7 pm and 6 am the next morning. No other changes to the participants’ diet or lifestyle was required so each person was free to eat whatever they wished during the day time hours until early evening. Twenty seven of the twenty nine people complied with following this advice for 2 weeks as well as the 2 week control period. Eating at night a waistline hazard So did people eat less when restricting night time eating? Yes, equal to 1000 kilojoules (about 250 Calories) per day less than during their normal eating pattern. This small energy difference was enough to see the men lose 0.4 kg over the 2 week restriction period, and gain 0.6 kg over the 2 week control period.

Article: The World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA) is an international organization that brings together zoos and aquariums to cooperate in efforts to advance the respectful, humane treatment of animals in our care, and to support the conservation of animals across the globe. WAZA was shocked and disappointed to learn of the inappropriate and damaging content in the new TV show Wonderful Friends, jointly produced by China's biggest zoo & circus company (Chimelong) and one of China's top TV companies (Hunan TV). The show dresses up chimpanzees in human clothes and markets them as \\"cute pets\\". The animals are placed in many stressful and harmful situations, in order to create \\"entertaining\\" story lines. It is disappointing to note that Chinese pop singer and actress Li Yuchun took part in this show, helping to popularize these misleading and inhumane practices. In one example, a young chimp bit an actress in the face right next to a zoo visitor, and then bit another actor leaving a wound on his hand. WAZA is strongly against practices and shows of this nature. Animals presented in such cruel and unnatural surroundings cannot contribute to serious conservation efforts. Presenting chimpanzees in unnatural and anthropomorphic settings suggests to viewers that they are not endangered and make great pets. Such shows are not only disrespectful to animals, they also lack any sort of conservation purpose. According to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, chimpanzees are now considered endangered, and wild populations are declining rapidly. WAZA recognizes that the growing popularity of television programmes such as Wonderful Friends can only increase the already-huge existing demand for chimpanzees as pets. WAZA requests the following: (1) The immediate cancel of this programme and similar shows wherever they may take place; (2) That all animals held in captivity be provided with the highest level of care; (3) That under no circumstances should chimpanzees be imported from the wild just for entertainment purposes. Question: According to the passage, what is WAZA in favour of? Options: A: Stopping importing chimpanzees. B: Never dressing any animals in human clothes.

Traditionally, it is synonymous with both the biblical Land of Israel and historical Palestine. The term usually refers to a territory roughly corresponding to the modern State of Israel, the Palestinian territories, western Jordan, and parts of southern Lebanon and southwestern Syria. It is considered holy by Jews, Christians, and Muslims. - The Lordship of Glamorgan was one of the most powerful and wealthy of the Welsh Marcher Lordships. The seat was Cardiff Castle. It was established by the conquest of Glamorgan from its native Welsh ruler, by the Anglo-Norman nobleman Robert FitzHamon, feudal baron of Gloucester, and his legendary followers the Twelve Knights of Glamorgan. The Anglo-Norman Lord of Glamorgan, like all Marcher lords, ruled his lands directly by his own law: thus he could, amongst other things, declare war, raise taxes, establish courts and markets and build castles as he wished, without reference to the Crown. These privileges were only lost under the Laws in Wales Acts 15351542. Though possessing many castles, the main seat of the Lordship was Cardiff Castle. - Joan of Acre (April 1272 23 April 1307) was an English princess, a daughter of King Edward I of England and Queen Eleanor of Castile. The name \\"Acre\\" derives from her birthplace in the Holy Land while her parents were on a crusade. - American English (variously abbreviated AmE, AE, AmEng, USEng, en-US), also called United States English or U.S. English, is the set of varieties of the English language native to the United States. English is the most widely spoken language in the United States and is the common language used by the federal government, considered the \\"de facto\\" language of the country because of its widespread use. English has been given official status by 32 of the 50 state governments. As an example, while both Spanish and English have equivalent status in the local courts of Puerto Rico. Under federal law, English is the official language for any matters being referred to the United States district court for the territory. - South Glamorgan is a preserved county of Wales. It was originally formed in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, as a county council area. It consisted of the county borough of Cardiff along with the southern part of the administrative county of Glamorgan, and also the parish of St Mellons from Monmouthshire. - The title of Earl of Gloucester was created several times in the Peerage of England. A fictional earl is also a character in William Shakespeare's play \\"King Lear.\\" See also Duke of Gloucester. - Eleanor of Castile (1241 28 November 1290) was the first queen consort of Edward I of England, whom she married as part of a political deal to affirm English sovereignty over Gascony. - Glywysing was, from the sub-Roman period to the Early Middle Ages, a petty kingdom in south-east Wales. Its people were descended from the Iron Age tribe of the Silures. - Gloucester is a city and district in southwest England, the county city of Gloucestershire. Gloucester lies close to the Welsh border, on the River Severn, between the Cotswolds to the east and the Forest of Dean to the southwest. - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas. - Early modern Europe is the period of European history between the end of the Middle Ages and the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, roughly the late 15th century to the late 18th century. Historians variously mark the beginning of the early modern period with the invention of moveable type printing in the 1450s, the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, the end of the Wars of the Roses in 1487, the beginning of the High Renaissance in Italy in the 1490s, the end of the \\"Reconquista\\" and subsequent voyages of Christopher Columbus to the Americas in 1492, or the start of the Protestant Reformation in 1517. The precise dates of its end point also vary and are usually linked with either the start of the French Revolution in 1789 or with the more vaguely defined beginning of the Industrial Revolution in late 18th century Britain. - Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain. It is bordered by England to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of . Wales has over of coastline and is largely mountainous, with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon, its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate. - A shire is a traditional term for a division of land, found in the United Kingdom and Australia. It was first used in Wessex from the beginning of Anglo-Saxon settlement, and spread to most of the rest of England in the tenth century. - Edward I (17/18 June 1239 7 July 1307), also known as Edward Longshanks and the Hammer of the Scots, was King of England from 1272 to 1307. He spent much of his reign reforming royal administration and common law. Through an extensive legal inquiry, Edward investigated the tenure of various feudal liberties, while the law was reformed through a series of statutes regulating criminal and property law. Increasingly, however, Edward's attention was drawn towards military affairs. - The Vale of Glamorgan, often referred to as The Vale, is a county borough in Wales. With an economy based largely on agriculture and chemicals, it is the southernmost unitary authority in Wales. Attractions include Barry Island Pleasure Park (known for the BBC sitcom, \\"Gavin & Stacey\\"), the Barry Tourist Railway, Porthkerry Park, St Donat's Castle, Cosmeston Lakes Country Park and Cosmeston Medieval Village. It is also the location of Atlantic College, one of the United World Colleges. - The historic counties of Wales are sub-divisions of Wales. They were used for various functions for several hundred years, but have been largely superseded by contemporary sub-national divisions, some of which bear some limited similarity to the historic entities in name and extent. They are alternatively known as \\"ancient counties\\". - Gilbert de Clare , 8th Earl of Gloucester , 7th Earl of Hertford , 10th Lord of Clare , 5th Lord of Glamorgan ( c. 10 May 1291 -- 24 June 1314 ) was an English nobleman and a military commander in the Scottish Wars . In contrast to most English earls at the time , his main focus lay in the pursuit of war rather than in domestic political strife . He was the son of Gilbert de Clare , 7th Earl of Gloucester , and Joan of Acre , daughter of Edward I. The older Gilbert died when his son was only four years old , and the younger Gilbert was invested with his earldoms at the young age of sixteen . Almost immediately , he became involved in the defence of the northern border , but later he was drawn into the struggles between Edward II and some of his barons . He was one of the Lords Ordainers who ordered the expulsion of the king 's favourite Piers Gaveston in 1311 . When Gaveston was killed on his return in 1312 , Gloucester helped negotiate a settlement between the perpetrators and the king . Now one of Edward 's strongest supporters , he accompanied the king on a campaign to Scotland in 1314 , when several other nobles refused . He was killed at the Battle of Bannockburn on 24 June , under somewhat unclear circumstances . Gloucester was the most prominent of the casualties of the battle , which ended in a humiliating defeat for England . As he had no issue , his death marked the end of the prominent de Clare family . His estates were divided between his three sisters , one of whom was married to the king 's new favourite , Hugh Despenser the Younger . Despenser 's ruthless expansion of the de Clare lordship of Glamorgan in Wales led directly to the troubles of Edward II 's later reign , including a rebellion in the Welsh Marches , the defeat of the Earl of Lancaster at the Battle of Boroughbridge , and eventually the deposition of the king by Roger Mortimer and Queen Isabella in 1326 . - County borough is a term introduced in 1889 in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (excluding Scotland), to refer to a borough or a city independent of county council control. They were abolished by the Local Government Act 1972 in England and Wales, but continue in use for lieutenancy and shrievalty in Northern Ireland. In the Republic of Ireland they remain in existence but have been renamed \\"cities\\" under the provisions of the Local Government Act 2001. The Local Government (Wales) Act 1994 re-introduced the term for certain \\"principal areas\\" in Wales. Scotland did not have county boroughs but instead counties of cities. These were abolished on 16 May 1975. All four Scottish cities of the time Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, and Glasgow were included in this category. There was an additional category of large burgh in the Scottish system, which were responsible for all services apart from police, education and fire. - Gilbert de Clare, 6th Earl of Hertford, 7th Earl of Gloucester, 3rd Lord of Glamorgan, 9th Lord of Clare (2 September 1243 7 December 1295) was a powerful English noble. Also known as \\"Red\\" Gilbert de Clare or \\"The red earl\\", probably because of his hair colour or fiery temper in battle. He held the Lordship of Glamorgan which was one of the most powerful and wealthy of the Welsh Marcher Lordships as well as over 200 English manors (172 in the Honor of Clare). - Mid Glamorgan is a preserved county of Wales. From 1974 until 1996 it was also an administrative county with a county council. - A favourite or favorite (American English) was the intimate companion of a ruler or other important person. In medieval and Early Modern Europe, among other times and places, the term is used of individuals delegated significant political power by a ruler. It was especially a phenomenon of the 16th and 17th centuries, when government had become too complex for many hereditary rulers with no great interest in or talent for it, and political institutions were still evolving. From 1600 to 1660 there were particular successions of all-powerful minister-favourites in much of Europe, especially in Spain, England, France and Sweden. - Glamorgan or, sometimes, Glamorganshire (or ) is one of the thirteen historic counties of Wales and a former administrative county of Wales. It was originally an early medieval petty kingdom of varying boundaries known as Glywysing until taken over by the Normans as a lordship. Glamorgan is latterly represented by the three preserved counties of Mid Glamorgan, South Glamorgan and West Glamorgan. The name also survives in that of Vale of Glamorgan, a county borough. - A petty kingdom is a kingdom described as minor or \\"petty\\" by contrast to an empire or unified kingdom that either preceded or succeeded it (e.g. the numerous kingdoms of Anglo-Saxon England unified into the Kingdom of England in the 10th century, or the numerous Gaelic kingdoms of Ireland unified under the Kingdom of England as the Kingdom of Ireland in the 16th). Alternatively, a petty kingdom would be a minor kingdom in the immediate vicinity of larger kingdoms, such as the medieval Kingdom of Mann and the Isles relative to the kingdoms of Scotland or England or the Viking kingdoms of Scandinavia.

Tolkien's legendarium (see: \\"The History of Middle-earth\\"), Tol Eressëa was an island visited by the Anglo-Saxon traveller Ælfwine (in earlier versions, Eriol) which provided a framework for the tales that later became \\"The Silmarillion\\". The name is Quenya for \\"Lonely Island\\". In early versions, the Cottage of Lost Play is located in Kortirion, the island's main city, and it is here that Eriol the Mariner comes. There is an early poem by Tolkien, entitled \\"Kortirion\\", several versions of which can be found in \\"The Book of Lost Tales\\", Volume I. - Sindarin is a fictional language devised by J. R. R. Tolkien for use in his fantasy stories set in Arda (popularly called Middle-earth). Sindarin is one of the many languages spoken by the immortal Elves, called the \\"Eledhrim\\" or \\"Edhellim\\" in Sindarin. The word \\"Sindarin\\" is itself a Quenya form. The only known Sindarin word for this language is Eglathrin, a word probably only used in the First Age (see Eglath). - In the fictional universe, or legendarium, described in the works of J. R. R. Tolkien, the Vanyar are the fairest and most noble of the High Elves. They are the smallest of the three clans of the Eldar, and were the first to arrive in Aman. According to legend, the clan was founded by Imin, the first Elf to awake at Cuiviénen, with his wife Iminyë and their twelve companions. Ingwë was the Vanya Elf to travel with Oromë to Valinor, and became their king. The Vanyar speak a dialect of Quenya called Vanyarin. - Valinor (\\"Land of the Valar\\") is a fictional location in J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium, the realm of the Valar in Aman. It was also known as the Undying Lands, along with Tol Eressëa and the outliers of Aman. This latter name is somewhat misleading; the land itself, while blessed, did not cause mortals to live forever. However, only immortal beings were generally allowed to reside there. Exceptionally the surviving bearers of the One Ring were allowed to dwell there for a time Bilbo and Frodo Baggins and Sam Gamgee and perhaps Gimli son of Glóin who, it is said, accompanied his friend Legolas to Valinor. - In the works of J. R. R. Tolkien, the Teleri, \\"Those who come last\\" in Quenya (singular \\"Teler\\") were the third of the Elf clans who came to Aman. Those who came to Aman became known as the Falmari or \\"sea elves\\" and these are the Elves who are generally known as Teleri, though the term also includes their Middle-earth cousins the Sindar, Laiquendi, and Nandor of Middle-earth. - Middle-earth is the setting of much of J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium. The term is equivalent to the term \\"Midgard\\" of Norse mythology, describing the human-inhabited world, i.e. the central continent of the Earth in Tolkien's imagined mythological past. Tolkien's most widely read works, \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", take place entirely in Middle-earth, and \\"Middle-earth\\" has also become a short-hand to refer to the legendarium or its \\"fictional universe\\". - In the works of J. R. R. Tolkien, the Noldor (also spelled Ñoldor, meaning \\"those with knowledge\\" in Quenya) are High Elves of the Second Clan who migrated to Valinor and lived in Eldamar. The Noldor are called \\"Golodhrim\\" or \\"Gódhellim\\" in Sindarin, and \\"Goldui\\" by Teleri of Tol Eressëa. The singular form of the Quenya noun is \\"Noldo\\" and the adjective is \\"Noldorin\\". They were the Second Clan of the Elves in both order and size, the other clans being the Vanyar and the Teleri. Like the Teleri, they typically had grey eyes and dark hair (except for those who had Vanyarin blood, most prominently the members of the House of Finarfin). - Aman is a fictional place in J. R. R. Tolkien 's legendarium , also known as the Undying Lands or Blessed Realm , it is the home of the Valar , and three kindreds of Elves : the Vanyar , some of the Noldor , and some of the Teleri .

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"The ice cube tray in the given scenario does not seem to have any direct relation to the process of digestion. However, if we analyze the potential role of the larger ice cube tray as a supposed perturbation, we can explore how it might directly or indirectly impact the digestion process or even not at all. Directly impacting a step of the process: A larger ice cube tray, in theory, might not have any direct impact on the actual digestion process since the mentioned steps are biological and physiological mechanisms that occur in the human body. The ice cube tray, as an external object, does not participate or actively change these mechanisms. Indirectly impacting a step of the process: Though it may not seem significant initially, a larger ice cube tray might have an indirect impact on the process of digestion. One possibility is by allowing a larger amount of ice to be consumed, which might encourage individuals to consume more cold beverages during a meal. Drinking cold beverages during a meal could potentially slow down the digestion process, as the lower temperature of the liquid in the stomach may cause the stomach muscles to contract, taking longer to digest the food. Additionally, cold beverages might dilute gastric acid, making it less effective in breaking down food while also potentially reducing enzyme activity. In this situation, the presence of the larger ice cube tray indirectly affects digestion, but it should be noted that the impact would still be minimal and not significantly alter the overall effectiveness of the digestion process. Not impacting any step of the process: It is highly likely that the supposed perturbation of a larger ice cube tray has no impact on any step of the digestion process. The steps outlined for digestion are heavily reliant on the body's natural processes and interactions on a molecular level. An ice cube tray, as a distinct and separate object from the system, would not interfere or change the process of digestion directly or indirectly in any meaningful way unless its presence influenced other factors, as hypothesized in the indirect impact section. However, it is essential to understand that such cases are hypothetical and must be interpreted as possible impacts rather than definitive conclusions. In summary, the presence of a larger ice cube tray does not directly impact the steps involved in the digestion process. It could potentially have an indirect effect by influencing an individual's consumption of cold beverages, which might slightly influence gastric acid activity and enzyme function. However, in general, it is most likely that the ice cube tray does not impact any step of the digestion process and thus can be considered an irrelevant factor."},{"instruction":"Add punctuation to the following sentence: 38 Hear now Joshua the high priest you and your fellows who sit before you for they are men who are a sign for behold I will bring forth my servant the Branch","output":"\\"38 Hear now, Joshua the high priest, you and your fellows who sit before you, for they are men who are a sign; for behold, I will bring forth my servant, the Branch.\\""},{"instruction":"Stalin überraschte seine Genossen dadurch, dass er den älteren jüdischen Mann nicht nur empfing, sondern auch in aller Öffentlichkeit mit ihm plauderte.

There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

Part #7: Executing the next scope of the command Usage: run and jump Explanation: The word 'and' causes the agent to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope (e.g., 'run and jump' means the agent runs, then jumps). Part #8: Executing the previous scope of the command Usage: jump after run Explanation: The word 'after' signifies that the agent will execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope (e.g., 'jump after run' means the agent runs, then jumps). Part #9: Triggering repetition of a command Usage: walk twice, jump thrice Explanation: The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger the repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively (e.g., 'walk twice' means the agent walks two times, 'jump thrice' means the agent jumps three times)."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"Man in a blue shirt holding a woman's legs on a train.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A man and his wife sitting on the couch.\\" Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

Sir Henry Joseph Wood (3 March 1869 – 19 August 1944) was an English conductor best known for his association with London's annual series of promenade concerts, known as the Proms. He conducted them for nearly half a century, introducing hundreds of new works to British audiences. After his death, the concerts were officially renamed in his honour as the \\"Henry Wood Promenade Concerts\\", although they continued to be generally referred to as \\"the Proms\\". Born in modest circumstances to parents who encouraged his musical talent, Wood started his career as an organist. During his studies at the Royal Academy of Music, he came under the influence of the voice teacher Manuel Garcia and became his accompanist. After similar work for Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera companies on the works of Arthur Sullivan and others, Wood became the conductor of a small operatic touring company. He was soon engaged by the larger Carl Rosa Opera Company. One notable event in his operatic career was conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin in 1892. From the mid-1890s until his death, Wood focused on concert conducting. He was engaged by the impresario Robert Newman to conduct a series of promenade concerts at the Queen's Hall, offering a mixture of classical and popular music at low prices. The series was successful, and Wood conducted annual promenade series until his death in 1944. By the 1920s, Wood had steered the repertoire entirely to classical music. When the Queen's Hall was destroyed by bombing in 1941, the Proms moved to the Royal Albert Hall. Wood declined the chief conductorships of the New York Philharmonic and Boston Symphony Orchestras, believing it his duty to serve music in the United Kingdom. In addition to the Proms, he conducted concerts and festivals throughout the country and also trained the student orchestra at the Royal Academy of Music. He had an enormous influence on the musical life of Britain over his long career: he and Newman greatly improved access to classical music, and Wood...

Last month, the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR) proposed the theory that she landed her plane safely on a remote island and died as a castaway. Now, scientists say a new discovery shows a striking similarity between the pilot and the partial skeleton of a castaway found on an island of Kiribati in 1940. A historical photo provided the vital clue. THE LEGENDARY PILOT In May 1932, Amelia Earhart became the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean, taking off in Canada and landing in Ireland. Three years later, she flew solo from Hawaii to California, winning a 10,000 prize. She was America’s darling, famous for being a daring, but modest, pilot. Together with co-pilot Frederick J. Noonan, she was attempting to circumnavigate the globe when the plane disappeared somewhere near Howland Island, in the middle of the Pacific. In August, TIGHAR’s Ric Gillespie said Earhart made more than 100 radio transmissions calling for help between July 2 and July 6 of 1937, ruling out the possibility of a crash landing. Her calls were picked up as far away as Texas, Florida, and even Melbourne. “She’s out there calling for help,” Mr Gillespie said, adding that she must have landed safely, because the radio wouldn’t have worked without the engine running. A STRANGE DETAIL The bones were uncovered on the island of Nikumaroro, also known as Gardner Island, which is about 640km south of Howland Island. They were analysed in 1940, but a doctor said they were male, ruling out the possibility they belonged to Earhart. However, when TIGHAR discovered the files in 1998, scientists said modern techniques proved the bones were “consistent with a female of Earhart’s height and ethnic origin”. More recently, anthropologist Richard Jantz was preparing an updated evaluation when he noticed a strange detail: the skeleton’s forearms were considerably larger than average. However, without knowing the dimensions of Earhart’s body, Dr Jantz had no way of comparing if her forearms were similarly longer than normal. THE FASCINATING SCIENCE TIGHAR turned to forensic imaging specialist Jeff Glickman for help. Using a historical photo where both of Earhart’s bare arms were visible, he calculated the ratio between the bones in her lower and upper arm. “Because there is tissue over the skeleton in living people ... the location of each bone end must be estimated,” he wrote in a report published last week. Her clothing also added a layer of difficulty, however, he used the point of her shoulder, the crease of her elbow, and the indent of her wrist as landmarks. “Given the evidence and my experience in the field of photogrammetry and photo interpretation, I estimate that the radius-to-humerus ratio of Amelia Earhart is 0.76,” he wrote. In other words, the difference between her lower and upper arm was virtually identical to the partial skeleton, unearthed in the South Pacific. The discovery doesn’t conclusively prove the castaway was Amelia Earhart, but it’s certainly another step in that direction. ||||| Comparing Earhart to the Bones on Nikumaroro There is a newly discovered similarity between Amelia Earhart and the castaway whose partial skeleton was found on Nikumaroro in 1940. The bones, suspected by their discoverer of being Earhart’s, were dismissed by British authorities after a doctor judged them to be male. The bones were subsequently lost and the entire incident forgotten until TIGHAR discovered the original British files in 1998, including the skeletal measurements the doctor made. An evaluation of those measurements by forensic anthropologists Karen Burns, Ph.D. and Richard Jantz, Ph.D. led to the conclusion that “the morphology of the recovered bones, insofar as we can tell by applying contemporary forensic methods to measurements taken at the time, appears consistent with a female of Earhart’s height and ethnic origin.” (See Bones & Shoes.) That was eighteen years ago. Recently, in preparing an updated evaluation of the bone measurements, Dr. Jantz noticed a peculiarity. Among the bones recovered was a humerus (upper arm bone) and a radius (lower arm bone). In the British doctor’s notes, the humerus was reported to be 32.4 centimeters long. The radius was 24.5 centimeters – a ratio of 0.756 to the length of the humerus. Statistically, women born in the late 19th century (Earhart was born in 1897) had an average radius to humerus ratio of 0.73. In other words, if the castaway was a middle-aged, ethnically European woman, she had forearms considerably longer than average. Dr. Jantz wondered if Amelia may have had similarly longer than average forearms. To answer that question we called on forensic imaging specialist Jeff Glickman. Selecting an historical photo of Amelia where her bare arms were clearly visible, and working with Dr. Jantz to identify the correct points on the shoulder, elbow and wrist for comparing bone length, Jeff found that Earhart’s humerus to radius ratio was 0.76 – virtually identical to the castaway’s. Click HERE for Jeff Glickman’s full forensic report. The match does not, of course, prove that the castaway was Amelia Earhart but it is a significant new data point that tips the scales further in that direction.

Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning? Available options: (A). Toss them in the freezer for ten minutes.. (B). Toss them in the oven for ten minutes..","output":"To evaluate the effectiveness of the two given solutions, let's examine the issue of stale tortilla chips and how each solution could potentially address it. Stale tortilla chips become soft and lose their crunch due to exposure to air, which allows moisture into the chips. To revive them, we should aim to remove that moisture and restore their original texture. Solution A: Toss them in the freezer for ten minutes. Placing the stale tortilla chips in the freezer for a short period will chill them, but it's not likely to remove any moisture from the chips, which is the root cause of the staleness. The freezer is used to preserve food items and maintain their freshness by preventing microbial growth, not by removing moisture. Therefore, this method may not achieve the desired outcome of reviving the stale tortilla chips. Solution B: Toss them in the oven for ten minutes. Putting the stale tortilla chips in a preheated oven at a low temperature (around 325°F or 163°C) for ten minutes would allow the chips to heat up, which would in turn cause the moisture within them to evaporate. As a result, the chips would regain some of their crunchiness that was lost due to the moisture. Therefore, using naive physics reasoning, Solution B (tossing the chips in the oven for ten minutes) is the more sound and effective method to revive stale tortilla chips. This approach directly addresses the problem of excess moisture in the chips, while Solution A (freezing the chips) does not."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Question: suppose more coal is removed happens, how will it affect MORE damage by acid rain. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"If more coal is removed and subsequently burned as fuel, it will lead to increased production of acid rain and cause more damage. So, the correct answer is A: more. The burning of coal releases various harmful chemicals into the atmosphere, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). These are the primary pollutants responsible for the formation of acid rain. When coal is burned, both SO2 and NOx are emitted into the atmosphere as by-products of the combustion process. As these substances rise into the high atmosphere, they react with water vapor, oxygen, and other chemical compounds in the air to form a more acidic substance, such as sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3). This process of transformation takes place in the presence of sunlight, leading to the formation of more acidic raindrops. When the acidic rain falls back to the earth's surface, it can have several damaging effects on the environment, including: 1. Acidification of water bodies: The acid rain can lower the pH of rivers, lakes, and streams, thereby harming aquatic life. Many aquatic species, such as fish, are sensitive to pH changes in their environment and may not be able to survive in more acidic waters. 2. Soil degradation: The acid in the rain can also leach essential nutrients, such as calcium and magnesium, from the soil. This can lead to reduced soil fertility and negatively affect plant growth, which in turn affects the entire ecosystem, including consumers that depend on these plants for food. 3. Damage to infrastructure: Acid rain can corrode and damage buildings, monuments, and other structures made of metal and stone, leading to a shorter lifespan for these materials and increased maintenance costs. 4. Harm to human health: While acid rain itself is not directly harmful to humans, the pollutants that cause acid rain, such as SO2 and NOx, can exacerbate respiratory problems and other health issues. In conclusion, if more coal is removed and burned as fuel, it would lead to increased emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere. This would intensify the process of acid rain formation and result in greater damage to the environment, aquatic ecosystems, soil, infrastructure, and human health."},{"instruction":"Given the question: I have a new situation: Two groups of people participated in a geriatrics study. Group D had people over 65 years old, while group Y had people in their 40's in its composition. But I can use this background: Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. Most people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common. What is an answer for this question: Which group had people with stronger immune systems? The answer is:","output":"Group Y had people with stronger immune systems. Step 1: Identify the relevant information from the background provided. From the background information, we can deduce that the immune system becomes less efficient as people age, particularly in people over 65 years old. Step 2: Compare the age groups. Group D consists of people over 65 years old, while Group Y comprises of people in their 40s. Since the immune system declines during old age (mid-60s onwards), we can anticipate that people in their 40s (Group Y) are likely to have stronger immune systems compared to those over 65 (Group D). Step 3: Answer the question based on the comparison. Based on the comparison above, we can conclude that people in Group Y, the group with people in their 40s, had stronger immune systems due to their younger age compared to individuals in Group D, who were over 65 years old and experiences a less efficient immune system due to their age."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"A man with a long beard is using a paintbrush and drawing on paper.\\" Based on this premise, can we conclude that the hypothesis \\"A man with a beard is painting for tourists to make a living.\\" is true?

It was recognised as the Royal County of Berkshire because of the presence of Windsor Castle by the Queen in 1957 and letters patent issued in 1974. Berkshire is a county of historic origin and is a home county, a ceremonial county and a non-metropolitan county without a county council. Berkshire County Council was the main county governance from 1889 to 1998 except for the separately administered County Borough of Reading. - Gentry (from Old French \\"genterie\\", from \\"gentil\\", \\"high-born, noble\\") are \\"well-born, genteel and well-bred people\\" of high social class, especially in the past. \\"Gentry\\", in its widest connotation, refers to people of good social position connected to landed estates (see manorialism), upper levels of the clergy, and \\"gentle\\" families of long descent who never obtained the official right to bear a coat of arms. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - The River Thames is a river that flows through southern England. At , it is the longest river entirely in England and the second longest in the United Kingdom, after the River Severn. It also flows through Oxford (where it is called Isis), Reading, Henley-on-Thames and Windsor. The lower reaches of the river are called the Tideway, derived from its long tidal reach up to Teddington Lock. It rises at Thames Head in Gloucestershire, and flows into the North Sea via the Thames Estuary. The Thames drains the whole of Greater London. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Maidenhead is a large town and unparished area in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, in Berkshire, England. It lies south of the River Thames, but at Maidenhead, the river runs north-south and so the town is in fact on its west bank. The town has a population in 2011 of 67,404. Its urban area (including the adjoining suburban villages of Bray, Holyport, Pinkneys Green, Taplow (Buckinghamshire) Cox Green, White Waltham and Woodlands Park) has a population of just under 90,000. The mainline railway station was set to be the terminus of the Crossrail line until the announcement was made that Reading was to be the new terminus. - A great hall is the main room of a royal palace, nobleman's castle or a large manor house or hall house in the Middle Ages, and continued to be built in the country houses of the 16th and early 17th centuries, although by then the family used the great chamber for eating and relaxing. At that time the word \\"great\\" simply meant big, and had not acquired its modern connotations of excellence. In the medieval period the room would simply have been referred to as the \\"hall\\", unless the building also had a secondary hall, but the term \\"great hall\\" has been predominant for surviving rooms of this type for several centuries, to distinguish them from the different type of hall found in post-medieval houses. Great halls were found especially in France, England and Scotland, but similar rooms were also found in some other European countries. - Letters patent (always in the plural) are a type of legal instrument in the form of a published written order issued by a monarch, president, or other head of state, generally granting an office, right, monopoly, title, or status to a person or corporation. Letters patent can be used for the creation of corporations or government offices, or for the granting of city status or a coat of arms. Letters patent are issued for the appointment of representatives of the Crown, such as governors and governors-general of Commonwealth realms, as well as appointing a Royal Commission. In the United Kingdom they are also issued for the creation of peers of the realm. A particular form of letters patent has evolved into the modern patent (referred to as a utility patent or design patent in United States patent law) granting exclusive rights in an invention (or a design in the case of a design patent). In this case it is essential that the written grant should be in the form of a public document so other inventors can consult it to avoid infringement and also to understand how to \\"practice\\" the invention, i.e., put it into practical use. - The manorial courts were the lowest courts of law in England during the feudal period. They had a civil jurisdiction limited both in subject matter and geography. They dealt with matters over which the lord of the manor had jurisdiction, primarily torts, local contracts and land tenure, and their powers only extended to those who lived within the lands of the manor: the demesne and such lands as the lord had enfeoffed to others, and to those who held land therein. Historians have divided manorial courts into those that were primarily seignorial based on feudal responsibilities and those based on separate delegation of authority from the monarch. There were three types of manorial court: the court of the honour; the court baron; and the court customary, also known as the halmote court. - In England, an unparished area is an area that is not covered by a civil parish (a small administrative division of local government, not to be confused with an ecclesiastical parish). Most urbanised districts of England are either entirely or partly unparished.

Answer:","output":"A suitable movie title for this intricate plot could be \\"Bloodline: The Alien Genesis\\". The title embodies the essence of this complex tale, where connections of blood and lineage play a crucial part in the manifestation of alien and human character traits. It also hints at the bizarre genesis or birth of Sam, who embodies both human and alien characteristics, setting the stage for the eerie and supernatural tone of his character arc. \\"Bloodline\\" references familial ties, alteration of lineage, and literal blood which lurk within the narrative, while \\"The Alien Genesis\\" alludes to the birth of Sam, the half-human half-alien creature at the core of the story. Moreover, this title also suggests a theological undertone, subtly hinting towards Genesis, the first book of the Bible, known for narratives of Creation and early human history. This reinforces the element of creation and the horrifying reproduction process that the alien creature executes, hence contributing to a sense of divine intervention gone horribly wrong, thus creating an unsettling tone for the movie. This title seems fitting as it does a remarkable job of compacting the various enigmatic themes of the plot in a mysterious yet intriguing manner."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What are the full names of the two people who fall to their death? from the following article ? Down-on-his-luck Los Angeles architect and builder Edward Shaw is approached by Doris Hillman with a business proposal: buying land together, on which he would build houses that she would then sell, using her experience as a former real estate broker. Her husband, Gus Hillman, a wealthy businessman, would be willing to contribute half a million dollars as capital for the venture. Doris quickly seems interested in more than a purely professional relationship. Shaw starts an affair with her and accepts the business offer. However, an accidental discovery leaves him convinced that the Hillmans' interest lies less in the long-term profits of the venture than in the 175,000 key man insurance policy he took on himself as a precondition for the deal, and that an attempt on his life is imminent. Madge, the younger sister of Doris, develops a romantic interest in Shaw as well. Without knowing what Doris has planned, she reveals to Shaw that her sister was married previously to a man who died in Wyoming when his car crashed over a bridge. Shaw ends up drugged by Gus Hillman and barely keeps his car from going off a cliff. The police are skeptical about his story and the insurance company refuses to cancel the policy, Hillman having portrayed Shaw as a man who is trying to steal his wife. Madge teams with Shaw to try to foil her sister's scheme, but Doris lures him to a mountain cabin and shoots him with a gun. A wounded Shaw sees both Hillmans struggle then fall to their deaths through a clifftop doorway, just minutes before Madge and the cops arrive.

It had spent 101 years lost in the ocean!The message was finally sent to the author's granddaughter. A German fisherman named Konrad Fischer found the brown bottle near Kiel,Germany. He said he nearly threw the bottle back into the water after pulling it out of a fishing net. Then he noticed something inside. The bottle in good condition contained a Danish postcard with two German stamps,dated May 17,1913. Although dampness had made most of the writing illegible ,the readable part of the message asked whoever found it to return it to an address in Berlin. It even contained two stamps to pay for postage. From the address,researchers found that the postcard was written by a man named Richard Platz,who was 20 years old when he wrote the message. While he was hiking on the Baltic coast with a nature appreciation group,he threw the bottle into the sea. Then the researchers began a search for any living relatives of his. Sure enough,they were able to find his 62-year-old granddaughter,Angela Erdmann,who still lives in Berlin. \\"It was almost unbelievable,\\"Erdmann said upon being presented with her grandfather's bottle and message.\\"That was a pretty moving moment.

A:","output":"A: The oldest signer of the Declaration of Independence was Benjamin Franklin. Born on January 17, 1706, in Boston, Massachusetts, he was 70 years old when the Declaration was adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776. Benjamin Franklin was a polymath, who contributed significantly to the fields of science, writing, and politics. Among his many accomplishments, he is best known for his experiments with electricity, his role in drafting the U.S. Constitution, and his influence as a founding father of the United States. His inventions, such as the lightning rod and the bifocals, greatly impacted society at that time and even today. In 1729, Franklin moved to Philadelphia, where he started a printing business and eventually published the well-known \\"Poor Richard's Almanack.\\" He also founded several civic organizations, such as the Library Company of Philadelphia (America's first lending library) and the American Philosophical Society. He dedicated much of his life to public service, holding multiple positions such as Postmaster General of the colonies and the President of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society. Franklin was an early and passionate advocate for colonial unity and independence. As a member of the Continental Congress, he was among the five individuals (including Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Roger Sherman, and Robert Livingston) appointed to the committee to draft the Declaration of Independence in 1776. From 1776 to 1785, Franklin served as the U.S. envoy to France, where he played a significant role in building French support for the American Revolution. He helped negotiate the Treaty of Alliance (1778) and the Treaty of Paris (1783) that ended the war. Upon returning to the U.S., Franklin was elected as a member of the Constitutional Convention in 1787 and played a crucial role in shaping the U.S. Constitution. He took initiative in advancing the procedures of the Great Compromise, which focused on balancing representation between large and small states. Although Benjamin Franklin did not hold formal political office by the end of his life, his influence and contributions as a statesman, scientist, and writer left a lasting impact on the development of the United States. His advanced age during the signing of the Declaration of Independence affirmed his long-standing commitment to the cause of freedom and the birth of a new nation."},{"instruction":"Where could there be a cloud? Options: - air - night or day - weather report - atmosphere - above rain Let's think step by step:","output":"Clouds can be found in different locations and under various circumstances. Here's a breakdown of the options you provided: 1. Air: Clouds primarily form in the air, as they are made up of tiny water droplets or ice crystals that have come together in the Earth's atmosphere. When the temperature cools and humidity reaches a certain level, water vapor in the air condenses into these tiny droplets, forming clouds. 2. Night or day: Clouds can form during both the day and night. Cloud formations depend on factors like temperature, air pressure, and humidity, which can change throughout the day or night. At night, clouds might not be as visible as during the day, but they are still present. 3. Weather report: A weather report is a way to get information about the presence and type of clouds in a specific location. Meteorologists study and analyze various factors, including cloud formations, to predict and communicate weather conditions to the public. By checking a weather report, you can find out if it's cloudy or clear on a particular day. 4. Atmosphere: Clouds exist in the Earth's atmosphere, specifically in the troposphere, which is the lowest layer of the atmosphere. Troposphere extends approximately 10-15 kilometers (6-9 miles) above the Earth's surface. Clouds can be present at various heights within the troposphere, from low-level clouds that are closer to the ground to high-level clouds that can be found as high as 12 kilometers (7 miles) above the Earth's surface. 5. Above rain: Clouds can be found above areas where rain is falling. Most clouds contain at least some small water droplets or ice crystals, and when these particles become too heavy to be held in the cloud, they fall to the ground as precipitation, which includes rain. So, clouds are often present above areas experiencing rain. In summary, clouds exist in the Earth's atmosphere, primarily in the troposphere, and can be found under various conditions, day or night. By checking a weather report, you can determine if there are clouds in your specific location, and you will often find clouds above areas where rain is occurring."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What was prior to the start of the 60s?\\" Context: \\"After the establishment of Hampshire County Council, following the act in 1888, Southampton became a county borough within the county of Hampshire, which meant that it had many features of a county, but governance was now shared between the Corporation in Southampton and the new county council.

Let your rationality guide you, but do not let it lead you astray. Following a religion does not make anyone superior, nor does your atheism make you superior to anyone. Atheism has no dogma. Don't be fanatical when discussing your beliefs with others, and try not to be pretentious. It's fine to be passionate about your beliefs, but there is no need to dismiss people for their methods of creating meaning. An atheist respecting the beliefs of religious people is no different than a Jewish person respecting a Catholic's views. Remember that their views cannot be proved or disproved. If someone attacks with their opinions, you have every right to defend your decision. Consider, however, whether it will help either of you to argue about your difference in belief. Consider whether either of you is actually going to change his or her stance on the subject. Atheism is not a religion, it's the absence of any religion. Trying to proselytize or get people to change their minds about their beliefs makes you just as evangelistic as a religious person. Do not force your beliefs onto anyone. Not only will people be less likely to listen to aggressive, dismissive rhetoric—but you will risk falling into the same pattern of dogmatically-skewed logic that many atheists claim to eschew. If someone is going to lose their religion, they will walk that path in their own time and through their own questioning. Ask yourself whether it is your place or prerogative to move the process along. Try to see the similarities, rather than the differences, between yourself and religious people. The world is filled with kind, brilliant theists as well as kind, brilliant atheists. We are all human, and we are all trying to make sense of our existence. Consider your own search for existential meaning—perhaps through your exploration of atheism, and perhaps through other channels—and try to imagine how a religious person may have found similar peace through their own unique search. Learn how to explain why you are atheist, in case people ask. Atheism is often misunderstood, and you may get questions from curious people. Be as polite and informative as possible, and answer their questions as well as you can. Explain that it is not a belief, but a conclusion that you have come to based on the available evidence in the world. If you are probed further about your atheism, it would be smart to bring up Bertrand Russell's Celestial Teapot idea, and explain that it does not make sense to you to believe in something simply because mankind lacks the evidence to disprove its existence. Open yourself up to a rational, two-way discussion. Treat other people—religious or otherwise—as intelligent human beings who are worthy of your respect. Summary:","output":"Respect others' beliefs whether religious or atheistic, avoid being fanatical or dismissive in discussions, and engage in polite, informative conversations about atheism as a conclusion based on available evidence, emphasizing the importance of mutual respect and understanding."},{"instruction":"What most naturally follows?

A horizontal force of 6 N is then applied to the block. (a) Determine the acceleration of the block. (b) Calculate the time it takes for the block to travel 8 meters. (c) Create a position-time graph for the block's motion. (d) Find the final velocity of the block at the end of the 8-meter distance. Solution: (a) To determine the acceleration of the block, we will use Newton's second law of motion which states that the force acting on an object is equal to the product of the object's mass and acceleration: F = m*a. Given, mass of block (m) = 1.5 kg and force (F) = 6 N. We need to find the acceleration (a). Rearranging the equation to solve for 'a', we get: a = F/m Now, substituting the values: a = (6 N) / (1.5 kg) = 4 m/s² So, the acceleration of the block is 4 m/s². (b) Next, we need to find the time it takes for the block to travel 8 meters. We can use the following kinematic equation to solve for time: s = ut + 0.5*a*t² Since the block is initially at rest, the initial velocity (u) is 0. The distance traveled (s) is 8 meters, and the acceleration (a) is 4 m/s². Substituting these values into the equation: 8 m = 0*t + 0.5*(4 m/s²)*t² Simplifying: 8 m = 2 m/s² * t² Dividing by 2 m/s² and taking the square root of both sides: t = √(8 m / 2 m/s²) = √4 s² = 2 s So, it will take 2 seconds for the block to travel 8 meters. (c) To create a position-time graph for the block's motion, we will use the equation: s = ut + 0.5*a*t² Since the initial velocity (u) is 0, the equation simplifies to s = 0.5*a*t². With an acceleration (a) of 4 m/s², we can write the position-time equation as s = 0.5*(4 m/s²)*t² which simplifies to: s = 2 m/s² * t² The graph will be a parabolic curve with the time (t) on the x-axis, position (s) on the y-axis, and will pass through the points (0, 0), (1, 2), (2, 8), etc. (d) To find the final velocity (v) of the block after traveling 8 meters, we can use the following kinematic equation: v² = u² + 2*a*s Since the block is initially at rest, the initial velocity (u) is 0. The distance traveled (s) is 8 meters, and the acceleration (a) is 4 m/s². Substituting these values into the equation: v² = 0² + 2*(4 m/s²)*(8 m) Simplifying: v² = 64 m²/s² Taking the square root of both sides: v = √(64 m²/s²) = 8 m/s So, the final velocity of the block at the end of the 8-meter distance is 8 m/s."},{"instruction":"Two brothers had very different diets.

A person who has completed a PhD has demonstrated significant independent research, advanced knowledge, and expertise in a specific area of study, making them eligible for the title. The title \\"Doctor\\" signifies the level of education and achievement acquired. However, it is important to note that in some casual or informal settings, people with PhDs may not be referred to as \\"Doctor.\\" Furthermore, the designation \\"Doctor\\" for medical practitioners, regardless of whether they hold a doctoral-level degree, is more commonly associated with their profession, due to the historical context of the title being used for medical doctors. It is also essential to be aware of any context-specific or cultural norms surrounding the use of academic titles. In some cultures or settings, reference to someone's academic title may not be as important or expected, whereas, in others, it might be a standard part of addressing an individual with such accomplishments. Regardless, earning a PhD generally entitles an individual to be called a Doctor within the context of their academic and professional endeavors."},{"instruction":"Uuuugh.

Why are some people so self-centered? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"Yes, these two questions are essentially paraphrases of each other, as they both aim to understand the reason behind people's self-centered nature. Self-centeredness, also referred to as egocentrism or narcissism, is the tendency to focus on oneself and one's interests, needs, and emotions. People display self-centeredness to varying degrees, and there are numerous factors that contribute to this behavior. Some primary reasons for self-centeredness include: 1. Psychological Factors: - Low self-esteem: Individuals with low self-esteem may become overly self-centered as a defense mechanism to protect themselves from feelings of inadequacy or insecurity. - Lack of empathy: People who lack empathy may have difficulties understanding and appreciating the perspective of others, which may contribute to a self-centered approach to life. - Narcissistic personality disorder: This is a mental health condition characterized by an excessive need for admiration, lack of empathy, and an inflated sense of self-importance. People with narcissistic personality disorder are typically highly self-centered. 2. Social Factors: - Parenting styles: Overindulgent or overly protective parents may inadvertently create self-centered children who grow up believing the world revolves around them. - Cultural norms: In some societies, individualism and personal achievement are highly valued, which can encourage self-centered tendencies. - Social media: The digital age has enabled personalized experiences, where social media platforms allow people to project an idealized version of themselves, sometimes fostering self-absorption. 3. Evolutionary Factors: - Self-preservation: From an evolutionary standpoint, it is advantageous for individuals to prioritize their own needs, ensuring survival and procreation. - Competition: In the context of scarce resources, being self-centered can be beneficial for achieving success, outdoing rivals, and maximizing individual gains. 4. Cognitive Factors: - Egocentrism: During some developmental stages, particularly in early childhood, people tend to believe that their perspective is the only one that matters. Although most people outgrow this phase, some may continue to feel and act as if the world revolves around them. - Confirmation bias: People tend to seek information that confirms their existing beliefs, which could reinforce their tendency to focus on themselves and their experiences. It is crucial to recognize that self-centeredness can exist on a spectrum, and individuals may exhibit these traits to varying extents. In some cases, moderate self-centeredness can be beneficial, enabling individuals to protect their own well-being, set boundaries, and pursue personal goals. However, excessive self-centeredness can damage relationships, hinder collaboration, and result in a lack of social support. Understanding the multifaceted nature of self-centeredness can foster awareness, empathy, and improved communication among individuals."},{"instruction":"Q:A federal judge on Thursday rejected efforts by Texas to stop the resettlement of Syrian refugees within its borders. The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others? Millions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations. In 1951 the United Nation's Refugee Convention defined a refugee as someone who \\"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\\" By the end of 2014, there were 19.5 million refugees worldwide, according to the United Nations, 14.4 million of whom were under the mandate of the United Nations Human Rights Council.

To find a vet that works with frogs, contact local veterinary schools or look online for lists of veterinarians that work with amphibians. For example, you can look at the website of the Association of Reptilian and Amphibian Veterinarians. If there are several vets in your area who work with amphibians, make sure the vet you choose is the one that has the most experience with tree frogs. It's a good idea to find a vet before your frog is actually sick. Having an established relationship with a veterinarian that treats tree frogs will make it easier to get your pet quick care when it needs it. It is best to have your frog checked out by a veterinarian if you see a symptom of illness. While you may end up bringing your pet in for a problem that is non-existent, it is better to be safe than sorry. Some diseases require quick treatment in order to be eliminated. If you suspect that your tree frog is sick but you are unsure about bringing it in to be seen by a vet, at least call the veterinary office and talk to them. Tell them about your pet's symptoms and ask them if they think your frog needs treatment. If your tree frog is indeed ill, your veterinarian will begin its treatment and will give you instructions on how to continue treatment at home. Follow these directions and be sure to continue treatment for as long as your veterinarian suggests, even if your tree frog seems completely healed. If treatment is not minimizing your frog's symptoms or they are getting worse, contact your vet once again. It may be that your frog needs a different type or amount of treatment.

Pedestrians struck and killed by cars often are extremely drunk. In fact, they are intoxicated more frequently and with higher blood alcohol levels than drunken drivers who are killed in accidents, various studies have shown. Forty percent of adult pedestrians involved in fatal crashes have a blood alcohol level of at least 0.10 which by law in most states signifies intoxication compared to only 25 percent of drivers in deadly accidents, according to recent federal data. Some types of pedestrain accidents have been declining nationally, especially those involving children, but the number of adult pedestrians who are drunk when killed in traffic has remained ly steady at 2500 a year. The total number of pedestrians killed annually in U.S. traffic accidents is at least 7000, or one of every seven highway accidents resulting in death. \\"We're dealing here, we think, with a very severe drinking problem that leads to a severe highway safety problem,\\" said Richard Blomberg, president of Dunlap and Associates Inc, in Norwalk, Coon. w.w.^w.k.&s.5*u.c.#om....

(2). put some rice into a sack and microwave it. Answer:","output":"The best way to create an easy heating pad for your period is Option 2: put some rice into a sack and microwave it. Step 1: Select a clean, microwave-safe fabric sack or a small cloth bag that will comfortably fit the desired amount of rice. This bag will be used as the heating pad, so it should be soft and comfortable when placed against the skin. Step 2: Fill the sack with uncooked rice, leaving enough space for the rice to move around and distribute evenly within the bag. You can also add a few drops of essential oils like lavender for added relaxation, if desired. Step 3: Seal the sack properly, ensuring that no rice can spill out. This is important for microwave safety and cleanliness. Step 4: Microwave the rice-filled sack on a microwave-safe plate. Start with a low power setting and warm the bag for about one minute. Check the temperature of the bag carefully to avoid burns and overheating. If it is not warm enough, continue microwaving in 15-30 second increments, checking the temperature after each interval until it reaches the desired warmth. Step 5: Place the warm rice heating pad on the affected area to alleviate period pain and discomfort. Option 2 is better than Option 1 because microwaving rice in a bowl can lead to uneven heating, spillage, and difficulty in applying the rice directly to the affected area. Using a sack provides a more convenient and safer way to create a heating pad.

Desperate to secure her late husband's hidden fortune, Diana reaches out to Freeman for help. The objective is seemingly simple: find and fly a specific Beechcraft Model 18 safely to an undisclosed location in Alaska. What begins as a straightforward mission for the skilled pilot quickly turns into a thrilling and perilous adventure as dark secrets begin to unfold. Act 1: Freeman Walker, working as a flight instructor for a small aviation company in California, receives a cryptic email from Diana Hill.

Context: I was fencing wire at Flat Broke Acres and trying to tighten up the wire a bit. I lost the grip of the fencing wire and the pliers smacked me in the mouth. This is what I hit myself in the mouth with. The curved end glance off my left front central incisor. It hurt some, my lips were lacerated, I scared my wife when I came in to take a look at it in the mirror but the pain to come was far worse. Tooth was intact thank goodness and was a bit wobbly and I said to myself yup, this could be a problem. A month or two later I hit it again when I was putting a portable step fence panel in the bed of the truck and it bounced and split the bridge of my nose and hit the tooth again. did not break or get displaced. Thank goodness I have a particularly thick head. Tooth trauma is a strange thing. It can blow up anywhere up to a year later. So almost 6 months later I was flying to a meeting in Orlando and of course the tooth decided to react to changes in atmospheric pressure just so I could experience the exquisite pain of barodontalgia. Kind of pain that makes you want to pry the top of your head off with a pitchfork because it would take your mind off the pain. Problem was it did not resolve after landing or anytime during the 4 days I was at the meeting. A combo regimen of acetaminophen and ibuprofen manage the pain well enough until I could get home and have it seen to. Pain did not end but the Xray showed no fracture or endodontic lesion. Strange. Then as suddenly as it occurred, the pain ceased. Strange x 2. Snapped another film and there was no pathology. Tooth was vital on pulp testing. So I did nothing more. I chalked it up to it being a karmic reminder about patients and dental pain as I’ve never had a cavity let alone a dental abscess. It let me feel your pain.

Hafey played for Richmond between 1953 and 1958, and coached four clubs--Richmond, Collingwood, Geelong and Sydney--between 1966 and 1988, leading Richmond to a total of four premierships: 1967, 1969, 1973 and 1974. Hafey was an inaugural inductee into the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996, named coach of Richmond's team of the century in 1998, and given the AFL Coaches Association \\"Coaching Legend Award\\" in 2011. He was renowned for his fitness and toughness even in his elderly years when he would still run rings around his juniors. Context: Hafey's initial thought was to seek a job in Western Australia. However, a chance meeting with the new Collingwood president, John Hickey, took Hafey a different direction. The Magpies had just endured their worst ever season, finishing last. Hickey defied the club's tradition against hiring an outsider as coach, appointing Hafey to coach the club for the 1977 season. Hafey was an instant success, taking the club from last to first in one year - the first time this had been achieved in the VFL. Collingwood had lost eleven of their last thirteen finals matches, many by slender margins, leading to the press to say the team was afflicted with a \\"disease\\" called \\"Colliwobbles\\". The disease appeared defeated when the team beat the favoured Hawthorn by two points in the semi-final. In the final, Collingwood led North Melbourne by 27 points at three quarter time. Trainers and committeemen began to celebrate early and North Melbourne fought back to a draw. In the replay the following week, Collingwood lost a high-scoring contest. Collingwood lost to North Melbourne in the 1978 Preliminary Final, leading to a number of personnel changes during the offseason. In 1979, the team returned to the Grand Final. After taking a second quarter led, Collingwood fell behind at the half. They ultimately lost by five points. In the 1980 Grand Final, Hafey took on his old team of Richmond. Kevin Bartlett won the Norm Smith medal as the Tigers won by a record margin. The Magpies again made the Grand Final in 1981. After holding a 21-point lead in the third, Collingwood gave up two late goals before the three quarter break. The resulting disharmony in the Magpie huddle allowed the Blues to dominate the fourth quarter and win the game. After years of disappointment players and fans began to criticise Hafey's methods. Several leading players said Hafey over-trained the team, particularly in the lead-up to finals matches. Others said Hafey was too slow to respond when the team was going under. During the 1982 season, a record losing streak of nine games sealed Hafey's fate and he was sacked mid-season. Question: what team did he coach?. Whats the answer?","output":"Thomas Hafey coached four different Australian rules football teams. These teams are Richmond, Collingwood, Geelong, and Sydney. He started coaching in 1966 and continued until 1988."},{"instruction":"Este clar pentru toată lumea că armonizarea drepturilor de autor în Uniunea Europeană a devenit o necesitate urgentă.

The family moved to Cairo, Egypt, a few months after his birth, and Copeland spent his formative years in the Middle East. In 1957, his family moved to Beirut, Lebanon, and Copeland attended the American Community School there. He started taking drum lessons at age 12 and was playing drums for school dances within a year. Context: In late 1976, Copeland founded the Police with lead singer-bass guitarist Sting and guitarist Henry Padovani (who was soon replaced by Andy Summers), and they became one of the top bands of the 1980s. The Police's early track list was mostly made of Copeland's compositions, including the band's first single \\"Fall Out\\" (Illegal Records, 1977) and the B side \\"Nothing Achieving\\". Though Copeland's songwriting contribution was reduced to a couple of songs per album as Sting started writing more material, he continued to co-arrange all the Police's songs with his two bandmates. Amongst Copeland's most notable songs are \\"On Any Other Day\\" (where he sang lead vocals too), \\"Does Everyone Stare\\" (later to be used as the title of his documentary on the band Everyone Stares: The Police Inside Out), \\"Contact\\", \\"Bombs Away\\", \\"Darkness\\" and \\"Miss Gradenko\\". Copeland also co-wrote a number of songs with Sting, including \\"Peanuts\\", \\"Landlord\\", \\"It's Alright for You\\" and \\"Re-Humanize Yourself\\". Copeland also recorded under the pseudonym Klark Kent, releasing several UK singles in 1978 with one (\\"Don't Care\\") entering the UK Singles Chart that year, along with an eponymously titled 10-inch album on green vinyl released in 1980. Recorded at Nigel Gray's Surrey Sound Studio, Copeland played all the instruments and sang the lead vocals himself. Kent's \\"Don't Care\\", which peaked at #48 UK in August 1978, actually predates the first chart single by the Police by several months (\\"Can't Stand Losing You\\", issued in October 1978) as \\"Don't Care\\" was released in early June 1978. In 1982 Copeland was involved in the production of a WOMAD benefit album called Music and Rhythm. Copeland's score for Rumble Fish secured him a Golden Globe nomination in 1983. The film, directed and produced by Francis Ford Coppola from the S. E. Hinton novel, also had a song released to radio on A&M Records \\"Don't Box Me In\\" (UK Singles Chart n. 91)--a collaboration between Copeland and singer/songwriter Stan Ridgway, leader of the band Wall of Voodoo--that received significant airplay upon release of the film that year. The Police stopped touring in 1984, and during this brief hiatus he released a solo album, The Rhythmatist. The record was the result of a pilgrimage to Africa and its people, and it features local drums and percussion, with more drums, percussion, other musical instruments and occasional lead vocals added by Copeland. The album was the official soundtrack to the movie of the same name, which was co-written by Stewart. He also starred in the film, which is \\"A musical odyssey through the heart of Africa in search of the roots of rock & roll.\\" (Copeland is seen playing the drums in a cage with lions surrounding him.) The band attempted a reunion in 1986, but the project fell apart. Question: Were the songs successfull?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, the songs by Stewart Copeland and his band, the Police, were very successful. They had many popular songs and became one of the top bands of the 1980s. Some of their successful songs include \\"Fall Out,\\" \\"Can't Stand Losing You,\\" and \\"Don't Care.\\" Their music was loved by many people and they achieved a lot of fame."},{"instruction":"Unterzeichnen Sie auf folgendem Link und leiten Sie diese E-Mail an interessierte Freunde weiter: http://www.avaaz.org/de/diamonds_for_love_not_hate/98.php?CLICK_TF_TRACK Alle Diamanten-Exporteure wissen, dass ihre Gewinne vom Ansehen der \\"Marke\\" abhängen.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Navy vs. the Night Monsters Context: A group of scientists with Operation Deep Freeze discover frozen prehistoric trees and other specimens in the Antarctic dating back to the first Ice Age. They collect samples of each for further study and load them aboard their C-47 military transport. The dull, workaday life at the Navy weather station base on Gow Island in the South Pacific is interrupted by that very same C-47 transport aircraft. On a routine approach for refueling, the transport experiences unusual trouble and suddenly crash lands on the island's single airstrip, destroying its control tower and the island's only two-way radio. The stricken aircraft also blocks the runway, preventing its further use. Lieutenant Charles Brown (Eisley) is in command of Gow's weather station. He, Navy nurse Nora Hall (Van Doren), and biologist Arthur Beecham (Walter Sande) reach the wreck only to find that seven scientists and crew aboard the cargo aircraft when it left Antarctica are now mysteriously missing. The only one found aboard is the transport's pilot, who is traumatized and in a state of shock, unable to speak. Unloading the prehistoric cargo from the crashed C-47, Dr. Beecham recommends planting the trees to ensure their survival in the island's tropical conditions. Somewhat later, Gow Island's bird population becomes disturbed by something unknown. At the same time, the weather station's scientists try to figure out a connection between this event and a corrosive residue that begins turning up at various island locations. It slowly becomes clear that the planted prehistoric trees have quickly grown into acid-secreting, carnivorous monsters that move about Gow Island at night, at will. They reproduce fast and eventually cut off the island with their growing numbers and nocturnal assaults on Gow's native islanders.

When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about.

While her grievances faced backlash, she found an unexpected ally in TV personality Katie Hopkins, who not only expressed her sympathy but also took action against those who targeted Christina with hate mail. Step 1: Introducing Christina Briggs' complaints Christina Briggs, a young woman in her 20s, has made headlines for expressing her concerns over the affordability of healthy food options. This has sparked conversations on the larger issue of the accessibility and affordability of nutritious food, an important factor in any society aiming to promote overall wellness and the prevention of diet-related health issues. Step 2: Detailing the backlash Christina Briggs faced However, Christina Briggs' complaints were met with skepticism and criticism by those who suggested that she should either find cheaper alternatives or reconsider her spending choices. This negativity was seen not only in social media comments or online forums but also in the form of hate mail targeting the young woman. Step 3: Introducing Katie Hopkins' sympathetic approach Regardless of the negativity, Christina found support from an unlikely source: controversial TV star Katie Hopkins. The 46-year-old presenter is known for her outspoken and opinionated personality, making her sympathizing response to Christina's complaints an unexpected twist in the story.

Question: suppose the person does not have a lung disease happens, how will it affect LESS oxygen being brought to the body. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"B: Less When a person does not have a lung disease, their respiratory system would function normally, enabling proper oxygen uptake and distribution throughout the body. However, if there is a situation that leads to less oxygen being brought into the body, several consequences may manifest, affecting various bodily functions and processes. Here is a detailed explanation of how lesser oxygen intake could affect an individual without lung disease: 1. Difficulty in physical activities: Reduced oxygen levels can lead to muscle fatigue, shortness of breath, and difficulty sustaining physical activity for extended periods. Since muscles require oxygen for efficient functioning, less oxygen supply might limit muscle power and endurance. 2. Impaired cognitive function: The brain is one of the most oxygen-demanding organs in the human body. An inadequate supply of oxygen could affect concentration, memory, decision-making abilities, and alertness, leading to poor cognitive performance. 3. Decreased heart function: In an attempt to compensate for a lack of oxygen, the heart might pump more blood, causing an increased heart rate and, in some cases, palpitations. Over time, this increased workload can lead to heart-related issues, including heart failure and arrhythmias. 4. Weakened immune system: A healthy immune system depends on consistent oxygen supply to function effectively. Reduced oxygen levels might weaken the immune system, making the body more susceptible to infections, illnesses, and delayed recovery from sickness. 5. Anaerobic respiration increase: When the body does not have enough oxygen, cells will undergo anaerobic respiration to produce energy. This process results in the production of lactic acid, which can cause muscle fatigue and cramping. 6. Slower healing process: Oxygen is essential for healing wounds, regenerating tissues, and for the overall recovery process. With less oxygen being brought into the body, the healing process slows down, leading to a higher risk of complications and infections. In conclusion, when there is less oxygen being brought to the body, it can result in multiple detrimental effects on an individual's health and well-being, even in cases without underlying lung diseases. These effects include, but are not limited to, difficulties in physical activities, impaired cognitive function, decreased heart function, a weakened immune system, increased anaerobic respiration, and slower healing processes."},{"instruction":"Pick something you think is a passion, and talk to a friend about it. When you’re done talking, ask them if you seemed intense or casual about it. If you talk for a long time and they say you were intense about it, that’s a sign it’s a passion. When you are talking about your passion, you will probably speak louder, faster, and more. You’ll get worked up talking about it. You’ll sound excited and won’t want to stop talking. If they say you didn’t seem to know very much, or you kept a pretty even tone, it’s a hobby. You’ll feel much more excitement talking about a passion than you will talking about a hobby. Choose something you do every week, or every few days, and stop doing it. If you think about it daily, miss it, and don’t feel like doing anything else, you’ve found something that’s a passion. If it doesn’t bother you to stop doing it, it’s likely to be a hobby. If you typically play ultimate frisbee every Wednesday, skip it this week. If you fill the time with something else and barely think about it, it’s a hobby. Take a break from editing the film footage you are always shooting. If after two days you can’t think straight because you want to be at the computer, you know it’s a passion. Get an opinion besides your own from a set of standardized questions. Be honest about your feelings on the activity. You’ll be able to learn how much it means to you from a set of questions and not just your own thoughts. A quiz like this can’t tell you without a doubt whether something is a passion or a hobby. However, it forces you to be more objective about the activity than you are on your own.

Question: A longer wire will have more or less resistance than a shorter one? Paragraph : Longer wires have more resistance than shorter wires. A:","output":"A longer wire will have more resistance than a shorter one. This conclusion is directly supported by the information given in the paragraph. To understand why this is the case, it's important to first have a basic understanding of the concept of electrical resistance. Resistance, measured in Ohms, quantifies the degree to which a material hinders the flow of electric current. The higher the resistance, the more the material suppresses current flow. In the case of a wire, its resistance will depend on several factors, including its length, cross-sectional area, temperature, and the specific resistive properties of the material from which it's made. According to the paragraph given, the length of the wire is the primary factor being considered here. When an electric current flows through a wire, it experiences resistance from the collisions between the electrons (which make up the current) and the atomic ions of the material that the wire is made of. The longer the wire path, the more of these collisions occur, and therefore the more resistance the current experiences. Hence, as the length of the wire increases, so does the resistance. Besides, a longer wire also equates to a longer path for the electrons to travel, and a higher probability of these collisions happening. This is the reason why, all other things being equal (the material of the wire, the temperature, the cross-sectional area), a longer wire will invariably offer more resistance than a shorter one. This principle has practical importance in a variety of real-life situations and applications, from designing electronic circuits to planning the electrical systems in buildings and infrastructures, where the length of the wires used and the resulting resistance must be carefully considered."},{"instruction":"Question: The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person who failed to be convinced that The Planets should be played in full? is inside the article: Holst was given a spectacular send-off.

Most of the slain Jesuits were born in Spain. One of the most notorious episodes of El Salvador's 12-year civil war. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: The Infamous Salvadoran Decimation: Killing of Jesuit Priests and Related War Crimes In what is known as one of the most notorious episodes of El Salvador's 12-year civil war, six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her daughter were brutally murdered – a heinous act calling on a retribution from global peace-keeping agencies and justice systems. Decades later, the case still resonates in international human rights discourse, with 14 former Salvadoran military officers accused of such war crimes. The incident occurred amid the civil unrest gripping El Salvador and took an unprecedented turn when six priests from the Society of Jesus were mercilessly killed. Most of the slain clergymen were born in Spain, making it an international issue that strained bilateral ties between El Salvador and Spain, triggering an international outcry and demands for justice. Along with the priests, their housekeeper and her daughter also became the victims of what appears to be an uncalled act of violent military aggression. The brutal nature of their deaths only elevated the global shock and condemnation that ensued. The memory of such ruthless violence has not faded away but transformed into a quest to seek justice. Accordingly, over a significant period since the incident, investigations and human rights advocacy led to the identification of 14 former Salvadoran military officers who are now accused of committing these barbaric war crimes. The accused officers allegedly functioning under a state-sanctioned military structure aggravated the complexity of this international human rights violation saga. It not only embroils El Salvador's human rights track record but also throws pressing questions over its confrontation with past military crimes. As trial processes unfold and testimonies resurface, the case brings forth the gruesome realities of the 12-year-long civil war El Salvador had witnessed. It not only creates ripples in El Salvador's narrative of the past but also adds a critical perspective to the global understanding of war crimes, military misconduct and the outstanding need for justice. In the quest for justice, and in remembering the ones lost, this chilling episode from El Salvador's past is not only a grim reminder of the atrocities war can bring but also highlights the indomitable spirit of justice that pursues such wrongdoings years after they have been committed. The victims of these brutal acts may have been silenced, but their stories continue to be heard loud and clear across the global stage, serving as a stern warning against the repetition of such abhorrent acts.

They just bought a house. We were considering buying a term life insurance policy for him to protect our own finances from having to help our daughter (and grandson) make house payments if needed. Should we do this or is there another way? — J. Ryan from California A: For your daughter and son-in-law, owning life insurance would indeed be a prudent move. But before you go out and buy a policy for them, speak with the pair about their insurance needs and current coverage. Your son-in-law may already have group life benefits through his employer, which would reduce the amount of term life insurance the couple needs. And if he were to die, your daughter and grandchild might be eligible for Social Security survivor benefits. Ideally, your son-in-law would be the one to purchase the life insurance policy, but if he is unwilling or unable to afford payments, then it can make sense for you to step in. Think carefully about your approach, however: Owning a policy where you’re the purchaser and the insured and beneficiary are two other individuals can create big tax headaches. “In life insurance, any time you have three different people involved, it is bad,” says Jim Swink, vice president of the Raymond James Insurance Group. Most life insurance proceeds are delivered tax free. But if you own the policy, name your son-in-law as the insured and list your daughter as the beneficiary, then the death benefit becomes a taxable gift to the beneficiary. Alternatively, you could own the policy on your son-in-law’s life and name yourself as the beneficiary. But then you would still have to gift the benefit money to your daughter, and doing so would likely create a taxable gift, says Chapel Hill, N.C., financial planner Ben Birken. The best and simplest route: Have your son-in-law or daughter own the policy and your daughter be the beneficiary, and then gift them the amount needed to cover the premiums. Or if you’re worried about any spendthrift behavior, pay the insurance company directly for the policy, says Swink. Either way, the money will still be seen as a gift by the IRS, but the cost of annual term life insurance premiums on a relatively young, healthy male should be well below the annual gift tax limit — 14,000 a year for an individual giver, or 28,000 for a married couple. That means neither you or your daughter w0uld owe any taxes on gifted insurance premium payments. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The most important parts of this news article address the question raised by J. Ryan from California about whether they should buy a term life insurance policy for their son-in-law to protect their finances and help their daughter in case of any unforeseen circumstances. The article suggests discussing insurance needs and current coverage with the daughter and son-in-law before making any decisions, as the son-in-law might already have group life benefits through his employer, and widow(er) benefits may be available through Social Security in case of his death. It also warns against buying a policy with three different parties involved (purchaser, insured, and beneficiary), as this creates tax complications. Instead, the best approach would be for the son-in-law or daughter to own the policy with the daughter as the beneficiary, and for the parents to gift the couple the premium amount or pay the insurance company directly to avoid triggering gift taxes. This solution ensures that the annual term life insurance premiums for a relatively young, healthy male should be below the annual gift tax limit (14,000 for an individual giver, 28,000 for a married couple), ensuring that no taxes are owed on gifted insurance premium payments."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Possible A: pain, dead, distress, die, kill Why is \\"die\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"\\"Die\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense in the context of a murder because it accurately describes the primary consequence suffered by the victim. When a person is murdered, their life is forcefully and intentionally taken away, leading to their death. In essence, \\"to die\\" signifies the end of an individual’s life, which is the most immediate and direct impact of a murder. This understanding is deeply ingrained in human societies, as the loss of life is a universally recognized and significant event with profound emotional, social, and legal implications. In addition to the direct cause and effect relationship between murder and death, the term \\"die\\" is also consistent with how people generally perceive the notion of a murder taking place. Since a murder is an act of extreme violence and aggression, it is often perceived as a significant harm or injury, which is irrevocable. Thus, it is natural that the outcome of such an act would be the end of the victim's life, as represented by the word \\"die.\\" Furthermore, when we consider the possible answers provided, two of them essentially imply the same outcome. \\"Dead\\" and \\"die\\" both signify the end of life, but the word \\"die\\" is a verb that captures the event that results from the act of murder, making it more appropriate in this context. The other options, such as \\"pain,\\" \\"distress,\\" and \\"kill,\\" are also likely consequences of being a murder victim; however, they either describe the emotional and physical suffering that might accompany the experience or reiterate the act of murder itself. In conclusion, \\"die\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense in this context because it directly reflects the primary result of a murder, the end of the victim's life, which is a deeply engrained and significant understanding across human societies. It is a concise way to convey the notion that someone has suffered the ultimate consequence of the violent and intentional act of another person."},{"instruction":"Question: Two groups of people were part of a science study. Group A ate lots of fats(lipids), while Group B had a more balanced diet with few fats. Group A gained a lot of weight over the course of the 6 month study. Which group had normal lipid levels in the blood? Answer:","output":"In order to accurately determine which group had normal lipid levels in the blood, it is essential to first understand the basic aspects of lipid metabolism, blood lipid levels, and the effects of dietary fat intake on these levels. Lipids are organic compounds that are insoluble in water, and they serve several vital functions in our body, including being a source of energy, a component of cell membranes, and playing a role in hormone synthesis. The primary types of lipids found in our bloodstream are triglycerides, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). A balanced diet typically comprises the appropriate proportion of the three macronutrients: carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. When consumed within the recommended daily intake levels, lipids (mainly in the form of dietary fats) contribute to maintaining normal blood lipid levels. In the given study, two groups of people were followed: 1. Group A consumed a diet high in fats. This group gained a significant amount of weight over the course of the six-month study. 2. Group B followed a balanced diet with low fat intake. For both groups, the consumption of energy, proteins, and the specific types of fats intake (saturated, unsaturated, and trans fats) would also have an impact on their blood lipid levels. However, without explicit information about their consumption and subsequent alterations in blood lipid levels, we must rely on general dietary impact knowledge to draw conclusions. Excessive intake of dietary fats, particularly unhealthy fats such as saturated and trans fats, is associated with increased levels of LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and subsequent weight gain. Elevated LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels are precursors to cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. Therefore, it can be reasonably assumed that Group A, which consumed a high-fat diet and experienced significant weight gain, would exhibit abnormal lipid levels in their blood. Conversely, Group B maintained a balanced diet with low fat intake, which suggests that they consumed fats within the recommended daily amounts. As a result, this group is more likely to exhibit healthier lipid profiles, including normal levels of LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides in their blood. In conclusion, based on the information provided and general knowledge of dietary impact on blood lipid levels, we can infer that Group B, which followed a balanced diet with low fat intake, is more likely to have had normal lipid levels in the blood. However, it is essential to note that the actual blood lipid levels of both groups could be determined only by analyzing blood samples collected during the study and comparing their lipid profiles to the reference range considered normal for their respective ages and genders."},{"instruction":"Choose from: A). negative B). positiveWould the following phrase be considered positive or negative? never overcomes its questionable satirical ambivalence","output":"A). negative The phrase \\"never overcomes its questionable satirical ambivalence\\" is considered negative.

Now, a team of scientists in Sweden has proved that these birds fly for tremendously long periods of time. They affixed data loggers onto a total of 19 of the master fliers in 2013 and 2014, and recaptured the birds months or years later. Researchers found that the birds can spend almost their entire 10-month nonbreeding period on the wing. The data loggers gathered information on acceleration and flight activity, and those installed in 2014 also included light trackers for geolocation. The results were astonishing. For example, according to research published in Current Biology, one of the birds stopped for just four nights in February in 2014 — and the next year it stopped for only two hours. Other birds stopped for longer periods of time. But \\"even when swifts settle to roost,\\" the researchers say, \\"the amount of time not flying is very small.\\" The birds are known to travel from Europe to sub-Saharan Africa — but they apparently don't touch down there, as National Geographic reports. Researchers say they have never found roosting sites in sub-Saharan Africa. The scientists say that the rarity of the stops during nonbreeding season suggests that the bird may only take a pause because of bad weather. The fact that some birds fly continuously during nonbreeding periods indicates that the species may not actually need to land for sleep. In fact, it's unclear \\"when and to what extent swifts need to sleep,\\" the paper states. \\"They feed in the air, they mate in the air, they get nest material in the air,\\" researcher Susanne Åkesson from Lund University in Sweden tells National Geographic. \\"They can land on nest boxes, branches, or houses, but they can't really land on the ground.\\" The birds' shape contributes to this finding; their \\"wings are too long and their legs are too short to take off from a flat surface,\\" the magazine reports. The researchers suggest that one driving force behind the bird's incredibly long flights could be its diet. \\"[S]pecializing in high-altitude aerial insects as a main food source requires the suite of adaptations for efficient flight shown by swifts, ... which compromises terrestrial locomotion and make swifts vulnerable to predators and parasites had they been landing more often,\\" the paper states. This may remind some eagle-eyed readers of another species with extraordinary flight habits: the frigatebird. As NPR's Christopher Joyce recently reported, those aquatic birds can \\"stay aloft for weeks at a time,\\" and fly to heights thousands of meters above the sea. And in a recent study, \\"one of the tagged birds soared 40 miles without a wing-flap.\\" ||||| Every July, young common swifts leave their European roosts and migrate to western and central Africa. They’ll only be back in the following June, and they’ll spend the intervening 10 months almost continuously in the air. They might travel to Africa, but their feet never meet African soil. “They feed in the air, they mate in the air, they get nest material in the air,” says Susanne Åkesson from Lund University in Sweden. “They can land on nest boxes, branches, or houses, but they can’t really land on the ground.” That's because their wings are too long and their legs are too short to take off from a flat surface. View Images Common swifts soar in Merseyside, England. Photograph by Alan Williams, Nature Picture Library As a result, common swifts are among nature’s greatest aeronauts, superbly adapted for a life spent largely in the skies. People have long suspected that swifts stay airborne for long stretches of time, but no one could confirm it. Åkesson and her husband, Anders Hedenström, both from Lund University, did so by fitting 19 of the birds with lightweight data loggers in 2013, and recapturing them one or two years later. The loggers had regularly recorded local light levels, which the duo could use to pinpoint the birds’ global position. And they had recorded the swifts’ acceleration, activity, and body positions, which revealed if they were flying or resting. The data revealed that some swifts were almost never inactive during their long migrations. For example, between September 2013 and April 2014, one of the birds rested for just four nights in February. The following year, it never rested for a full night; over the same period, it stopped for just two hours. View Images A common swift (Apus apus) at the Budapest Zoo Photograph by Joel Sartore, National Geographic Photo Ark A few other swifts did rest more often. Åkesson and Hedenström suspect that this was because they hadn’t finished replacing their wing and tail feathers during their annual molt. The old feathers might have compromised their ability to stay permanently aloft, or their inability to molt fully might reflect some underlying health problem that affected their flight. Either way, it’s not like they were actually grounded. If they rested, it was just for a few hours. At most, they spent just 0.64 percent of their migration on terra firma. Other scientists have found similar results. In 2013, Felix Liechti from the Swiss Ornithological Institute used similar data loggers to show that three alpine swifts probably flew nonstop for 200 days, on their long migration from Switzerland to Africa and back again. That was especially surprising because alpine swifts are twice the size of common swifts, with wingspans of up to 22 inches. Such long nonstop flights imply that swifts must be able to sleep while flying. This August, Niels Rattenborg of the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Germany proved that frigate birds—large seabirds with piratical tendencies—do the same. He fitted brainwave sensors to 15 frigatebirds and showed that they sleep mid-flight, for about 40 minutes a day and just a few seconds at a time. There’s no brain sensor small enough to record their mental activity of a flying swift, but they surely must be taking midair naps too. Maybe they do what dolphins do, sending one half of their brains to sleep at a time so they can stay continuously alert. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"A team of scientists from Sweden have proven that the common swift bird has the ability to remain in the air for strikingly long periods of time during their annual migration.

Even when they seem to be at rest, the time they spend not flying is minor. These birds travel from Europe to sub-Saharan Africa without touching the ground. The swifts' long wings and short legs, which hinder take-off from flat surfaces, explain their mostly airborne lifestyle. While it's still unclear to what extent swifts need to sleep, the research suggests that these birds are capable of taking midair naps. Their diet of high-altitude insects could also be driving the extended flight periods. Scientists suggest that their efficient flight prevents them from becoming prey to predators and parasites that would threaten them if they were on the ground more often.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: What does Arkin discover ? Movie plot title: The Collector Movie plot: A man named Larry and his wife return home to find the power is out. They discover a large box upstairs, and are horrified by its contents. They are then attacked by an unseen assailant. Arkin O'Brien is an ex-convict working as a handyman. His latest customers are the Chase family. He is generally well-liked by the Chases, particularly their younger daughter Hannah. While working at the Chase home, Arkin notices several strange insects around the house. After work, Arkin meets his wife, whose debt to several loan sharks is due by midnight. In order to protect her and their daughter, Arkin plans a heist at the Chase home, which houses a valuable ruby. He breaks in, but while attempting to crack the safe, a masked figure enters in the house and locks the door. Michael, the Chase father, appears injured, and attempts to attack Arkin with a golf club, thinking Arkin is the perpetrator. However, Michael is incapacitated by a trap rigged with the club, and the masked man drags Michael into the basement. Arkin attempts to call 911, but the phone is rigged with another trap, and the windows have been boarded up and lined with razors, making escape impossible. Arkin retreats to the basement; Michael informs him that his wife Victoria is trapped as well, his older daughter Jill is out, and Hannah is hiding somewhere, and that a gun is in the safe, giving him the combination. Arkin then finds a captive Victoria and has her distract the intruder while he goes upstairs to get to the safe. Upon opening the safe, Arkin gets the gun (which has no bullets) and pockets the ruby. While searching for Hannah, he finds the same box from the beginning of the film. Hearing noises coming from the box, he opens it to find a bloodied Larry, who explains that the masked man is a \\"collector\\" of people; he only collects one person in a household and kills everyone else like he did to his wife. For he people he does collect, he brutally tortures them until death. Horrified, Arkin unsuccessfully tries to escape, while the Collector locks... A:","output":"In the movie \\"The Collector,\\" Arkin O'Brien discovers several key pieces of information while trapped in the Chase family's home: 1. He discovers the masked man, who is a \\"collector\\" of people. The collector only collects one person from a household and kills everyone else. The victims he collects are brutally tortured until death. Arkin learns about the collector's motives from a bloodied Larry, whom he finds inside a large box. 2. While searching for Hannah, the youngest daughter of the Chase family, Arkin finds the same box from the beginning of the film, in which he finds Larry. This discovery reveals to Arkin the horrifying acts the collector commits, causing him to try and escape with little success. 3. He opens a safe, which contains a gun (but no bullets) and a ruby that Arkin had planned to steal in order to pay off his wife's debt with the loan sharks. The fact that the gun has no bullets indicates the collector's intention to keep the family members trapped and powerless. These discoveries add further despair to Arkin's situation, as not only is he trapped in a house rigged with deadly traps, but he is also pitted against a sadistic psychopath with an insatiable appetite for torturing and collecting victims. The knowledge Arkin gains throughout the film intensifies the urgency of his quest to save the Chase family and himself from the clutches of the collector."},{"instruction":"Title: Still Amazes me Product review: I loved this movie as a child, and I just recently bought it to watch it again and its still an awesome movie, all the specail effects and everything are just amazing special for the movie in that time.

Comprehensive schools are a type of educational institution that emerged as a response to the selective nature of traditional schools, especially in countries like the United Kingdom. Comprehensive schools aim to provide an inclusive and accessible education for all students, irrespective of their social background, abilities, or future aspirations. The primary features and goals of these schools can be understood in terms of the following aspects: 1. Inclusivity: One of the core principles of comprehensive schools is to be inclusive and break down barriers between students from different social, economic, and educational backgrounds. This commitment to inclusivity and social cohesion is evident in their diverse student populations, which contributes to a shared learning environment that promotes understanding and cooperation between students of all backgrounds. 2. Non-selective admission: Comprehensive schools follow a non-selective admission policy, meaning that they admit students based on their residential area rather than any particular academic or intellectual criteria. This is in contrast to selective educational institutions like grammar schools, which require passing entrance exams to be admitted. This ensures that every student has equal opportunity to access high-quality education, without being subject to entrance examinations or barriers. 3. Broad Curriculum: Comprehensive schools are designed to cater to a wide range of skills, interests, and abilities among their student body. To achieve this, the schools offer a broad curriculum that includes a range of academic, vocational, and extracurricular subjects. This allows students to explore their strengths and interests and ensures that they have the flexibility to develop various skills, which is essential for personal and professional development. 4. Mixed-ability teaching: A significant aspect of comprehensive schools is their approach to mixed-ability teaching. Students are not segregated based on their academic ability but are instead taught in the same classrooms. This helps prevent the development of a divide between high-achieving students and others and fosters an environment of support and collaboration. 5. Personalized learning: Recognizing that students may have different learning needs, comprehensive schools strive to provide personalized learning experiences for their students. This includes providing targeted support and resources for those who require them, as well as ensuring that teaching methods and resources accommodate various learning styles and preferences. 6. Career guidance and support: Comprehensive schools recognize the importance of preparing students for their future careers and provide a range of services to achieve this goal. This includes offering career guidance and counseling services, as well as connecting students with internship, volunteering, and job opportunities. Overall, comprehensive schools aim to equip their students with the knowledge, skills, and experience necessary to succeed in their chosen fields. 7. Community integration: Comprehensive schools often act as community hubs, fostering connections between the school, parents, and the wider community. By organizing and participating in various community events, projects, and initiatives, comprehensive schools aim to promote a sense of belonging and shared responsibility among all stakeholders. In conclusion, the primary features and goals of comprehensive schools center around promoting inclusivity, delivering a broad curriculum, fostering mixed-ability teaching, and providing personalized learning experiences, career guidance, and community integration. Through these features, comprehensive schools strive to offer a well-rounded and accessible education that caters to every student's unique needs and interests."},{"instruction":"Laws were instituted that required every able-bodied male Japanese citizen, regardless of class, to serve a mandatory term of three years with the first reserves and two additional years with the second reserves.

Author of Gitanjali and its \\"profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse\\", he became in 1913 the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. Tagore's poetic songs were viewed as spiritual and mercurial; however, his \\"elegant prose and magical poetry\\" remain largely unknown outside Bengal. Context: Dutta and Robinson describe this phase of Tagore's life as being one of a \\"peripatetic litterateur\\". It affirmed his opinion that human divisions were shallow. During a May 1932 visit to a Bedouin encampment in the Iraqi desert, the tribal chief told him that \\"Our prophet has said that a true Muslim is he by whose words and deeds not the least of his brother-men may ever come to any harm ...\\" Tagore confided in his diary: \\"I was startled into recognizing in his words the voice of essential humanity.\\" To the end Tagore scrutinised orthodoxy--and in 1934, he struck. That year, an earthquake hit Bihar and killed thousands. Gandhi hailed it as seismic karma, as divine retribution avenging the oppression of Dalits. Tagore rebuked him for his seemingly ignominious implications. He mourned the perennial poverty of Calcutta and the socioeconomic decline of Bengal, and detailed these newly plebeian aesthetics in an unrhymed hundred-line poem whose technique of searing double-vision foreshadowed Satyajit Ray's film Apur Sansar. Fifteen new volumes appeared, among them prose-poem works Punashcha (1932), Shes Saptak (1935), and Patraput (1936). Experimentation continued in his prose-songs and dance-dramas-- Chitra (1914), Shyama (1939), and Chandalika (1938)-- and in his novels-- Dui Bon (1933), Malancha (1934), and Char Adhyay (1934). Tagore's remit expanded to science in his last years, as hinted in Visva-Parichay, a 1937 collection of essays. His respect for scientific laws and his exploration of biology, physics, and astronomy informed his poetry, which exhibited extensive naturalism and verisimilitude. He wove the process of science, the narratives of scientists, into stories in Se (1937), Tin Sangi (1940), and Galpasalpa (1941). His last five years were marked by chronic pain and two long periods of illness. These began when Tagore lost consciousness in late 1937; he remained comatose and near death for a time. This was followed in late 1940 by a similar spell, from which he never recovered. Poetry from these valetudinary years is among his finest. A period of prolonged agony ended with Tagore's death on 7 August 1941, aged eighty; he was in an upstairs room of the Jorasanko mansion he was raised in. The date is still mourned. A. K. Sen, brother of the first chief election commissioner, received dictation from Tagore on 30 July 1941, a day prior to a scheduled operation: his last poem. I'm lost in the middle of my birthday. I want my friends, their touch, with the earth's last love. I will take life's final offering, I will take the human's last blessing. Today my sack is empty.

He now earns a modest living by singing and playing his guitar in small town bars across the South-Western United States. Having a history of failed marriages (four that he admits to, although a reference is made to a fifth he does not discuss) Blake is without a family. He has a son, aged 28, with whom he has not had contact in 24 years. He is mostly on the road performing, staying in cheap motels and travelling in his old '78 Suburban alone.

In doing so, he lets himself be pushed into renewing a professional relationship with Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell), a popular and successful country music star he once mentored, and plays as the opening act at one of Tommy's concerts, despite his initial balking and wounded pride at being the opening act to his former student. He asks Tommy to record an album with him, but Tommy says his record company insists on a couple more solo albums before a duet project can be recorded. He instead suggests that Blake concentrate on writing new songs that Tommy can record solo, telling him he writes better songs than anyone else. Blake's drinking soon gets out of control, and he ends up running off the road while driving drunk. In the hospital, the doctor informs him that although he only sustained a broken ankle from the crash, he is slowly killing himself, and must stop drinking and smoking and lose 25 pounds if he wants to live more than a few more years.

Answer:","output":"The first immigrants to America were the Paleo-Indians, who migrated from Siberia to Alaska across a land bridge known as Beringia around 13,000 BCE. Here's how I came to this conclusion: 1. To answer this question, I had to define the term 'immigrant'. In the broadest sense possible, an immigrant can be defined as any group or individual moving from one geographical location to another, whether across countries, continents, or even from one planet to another. 2. Once I had defined the term 'immigrant', I went back to earliest known history of America to identify the first groups of homo sapiens to have migrated to that region. 3. According to anthropological and archaeological sources, the first homo sapiens arrived in America from Asia. They are referred to as the Paleo-Indians. 4. They arrived in what is now Alaska via a land bridge, which existed between Siberia and Alaska. This land bridge, known as Beringia, was present between 30,000 BCE and 11,000 BCE, during the last ice age. 5. The Paleo-Indians are believed to have migrated in waves between 20,000 and 13,000 BCE. They eventually spread throughout North and South America, which became their new home. 6. Therefore, considering the definition of an 'immigrant', the first immigrants to America would have been the Paleo-Indians from Asia. The next known mass immigration to the Americas wasn't until the late 15th Century, when Europeans began to explore and eventually colonize the Americas. 7. It's important to note that the details of the migration of Paleo-Indians into America are still debated among scientists due to varying findings and interpretations of archaeological evidence. 8. It's also crucial to remember that when we talk about the 'first immigrants' to America, we are focusing on a period long before nation states, and certainly before the United States, existed. Immigrant can have different connotations in the present scenario, but for this answer, we are referring solely to the physical act of moving from one geographical location to another."},{"instruction":"this is a year for setting contrasting records at the oregon shakespeare festival .

Negative influence of celebrities and role models: The writer believes that the statement made by a celebrity or role model has had an adverse impact on the youth, leading them to indulge in promiscuous acts. By referring to this specific incident, the writer demonstrates their belief that celebrities and role models have the power to influence young people's decisions and actions in a detrimental manner. 2. Lack of positive values: By stating that role models and celebrities do not play any part in instilling values in people today, the writer implies that the media's focus is more on sensationalism and entertainment rather than fostering positive values and behavior. This lack of emphasis on teaching values can contribute to young people making wrong decisions, as they are not receiving positive guidance from the people they look up to. 3. Amplification of negative incidents: The writer believes that the media plays a considerable role in amplifying the negative incidents involving celebrities and role models. By providing extensive coverage of such incidents, the media inadvertently promotes and reinforces undesirable behavior, making it more likely for young people to follow them. 4. Absence of personal responsibility: The writer suggests that young people are using the media's portrayal of celebrities as an excuse for their actions, rather than taking personal responsibility for their behaviors and choices. This situation demonstrates that young people are heavily reliant on the media for guidance, further reinforcing the negative impact of the media on young people's lives. 5. The power of social reinforcement: The article implies that the media not only influences young people individually but also contributes to a collective mindset. This social reinforcement of negative behaviors makes it more challenging for young people to resist these influences, as they might feel pressured to conform to the behaviors widely accepted by their peers. In summary, the writer feels negatively about the effect of the media on young people because they believe that the media plays a significant role in promoting undesirable behaviors and attitudes among the youth. Instead of instilling positive values and providing constructive guidance, the media's portrayal of celebrities and role models contributes to a culture that amplifies negative incidents and fosters a climate of irresponsibility."},{"instruction":"Is this product review positive?

Around 95% of the country's 36 million citizens are Muslims, with Christianity, Yarsan, Yezidism, and Mandeanism also present. The official languages of Iraq are Arabic and Kurdish. - The Hattians were an ancient people who inhabited the land of Hatti in central Anatolia. The group was documented at least as early as the empire of Sargon of Akkad (2300 BC), until it was gradually absorbed 20001700 BC by the Indo-European Hittites, who were subsequently associated with the \\"land of Hatti\\". - Hattic ( Hattian ) was a non-Indo - European , agglutinative language spoken by the Hattians in Asia Minor between the 3rd and the 2nd millennia BC. Scholars call this language ' Hattic ' to distinguish it from the Hittite language , the Indo - European language of the Hittite Empire .

It is unknown what native speakers of \`\` hattili '' called their own language . The heartland of this oldest attested language of Anatolia , before the arrival of Hittite speakers , ranged from Hattusa ( then called \`\` Hattus '' ) northward to Nerik . Other cities mentioned in Hattic include Tuhumiyara and Tissaruliya . The Hittite speakers conquered Hattus from Kanesh to its south , in the 18th century BCE .

This empire reached its height during the mid-14th century BC under Suppiluliuma I, when it encompassed an area that included most of Anatolia as well as parts of the northern Levant and Upper Mesopotamia. Between the 15th and 13th centuries BC the Hittite Empire came into conflict with the Egyptian Empire, Middle Assyrian Empire and the empire of the Mitanni for control of the Near East. The Assyrians eventually emerged as the dominant power and annexed much of the Hittite empire, while the remainder was sacked by Phrygian newcomers to the region.

Seleucus received Babylonia and, from there, expanded his dominions to include much of Alexander's near eastern territories. At the height of its power, it included central Anatolia, Persia, the Levant, Mesopotamia, and what is now Kuwait, Afghanistan, and parts of Pakistan and Turkmenistan. - Mithridates or Mithradates I (Parthian: \\"Mihrdat\\", , \\"Mehrdd\\"), (ca. 195 BC 132 BC) was king of the Parthian Empire from 165 BC to 132 BC, succeeding his brother Phraates I.

The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt.

Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) was the first senator to publicly call on her colleague, Al Franken, to resign after numerous allegations of sexual misconduct. No one in Congress is more associated with the Me Too movement than Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.). Long before Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer became infamous creeps, Gillibrand was focusing her attention on sexual assault and harassment in the military, on college campuses and in the workplace. But the two-term senator cemented her prominence in the movement last year when she called out members of her own party. In November, she said that Bill Clinton should have resigned the presidency over his affair with Monica Lewinsky. And then the following month, she became the first Democratic senator to publicly call on then-Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) to go after multiple women accused him of engaging in sexual misconduct. Franken announced his resignation the following day. Speaking out has consequences. Women who come forward about the abuse they’ve faced are often barred from further job opportunities. And even someone in power like Gillibrand who tries to be an advocate for victims can find themselves facing a negative response from a previously friendly community. Eight women accused Franken of groping them. Yet he remains beloved by many Democrats, who say he was one of the party’s strongest champions on progressive issues. His questioning in Senate hearings landed both Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos in hot water, and if he were still around, he’d no doubt play a big role in taking on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. His defenders say he was pushed out too early for transgressions that, while unfortunate, didn’t rise to the level of what some members of the GOP have done and didn’t make him a threat who needed to leave immediately. Gillibrand wasn’t the only senator to publicly call on Franken to step down, but she was the first (but only by minutes) in a wave of female senators ― who were eventually joined by many of their male colleagues on the same day, Dec. 6 ― to do so. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), however, reportedly told Franken in private that he needed to go beforehand. But Gillibrand has received the brunt of the blame for what happened, with many of her detractors saying the reason she came out against Franken was that she’s an “opportunist” who was positioning herself for a presidential run in 2020. Some Democratic Party donors have been reconsidering whether they would support her in a primary. Most prominently, Gillibrand has attracted the ire of billionaire George Soros, who has long funded Democratic candidates and causes. Soros recently said he wasn’t sure whom he was supporting for 2020, but that it absolutely wouldn’t be Gillibrand. He accused her of going after Franken, “whom I admire,” to “improve her chances” for president. “If standing up for women who have been wronged makes George Soros mad, that’s on him,” Gillibrand said in a statement to HuffPost. “But I won’t hesitate to always do what I think is right. For nearly a year, we have seen countless acts of courage as women and men have spoken hard truths about sexual assault and sexual harassment and demanded accountability.” “I stand with them in this new watershed moment of important change in our society on what we deem as acceptable,” she added. “It is clear that we must put our morals and the valuing of women ahead of party loyalty. When someone does something wrong, you have to speak up and be counted, whether it’s President Trump, or a Democratic colleague.” ‘I Think It Was A Big Mistake’ HuffPost spoke to dozens of elite donors who contributed significant amounts of money to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Gillibrand, at one time, was part of the tight, loyal Clinton world. The Clintons were early supporters of hers and Hillary wrote the foreword to Gillibrand’s book. Many of these donors said that either they were unhappy with Gillibrand or knew plenty of people who were. The 2020 race is still years away, but as donors start to shop around, her comments on Clinton and Franken could be a factor. “I viewed it as self-serving, as opportunistic ― unforgivable in my view,” said Rosalind Fink, a New York donor. “Since then, I have not purposely attended any fundraiser where she was there. And there is absolutely no way I will support her.” Fink said she condemned Franken’s behavior, but she believed the Senate should have investigated the allegations thoroughly before forcing him out. “I think it was a big mistake,” said Irene Finel Honigman, another Clinton donor from New York, adding, “I was not that impressed with her to begin with. I think she certainly had potential, but as for many people, this kind of sealed the deal.” Another donor, who like many others asked to remain anonymous in order to speak candidly, called Gillibrand a “ruthless opportunist.” “That’s the knock on her, and that’s what this proved,” he said. “She saw an opportunity to be out front, and regardless of the ramifications, she took it.” Susie Tompkins Buell, a major Democratic Party donor who has championed female politicians, also said she was reconsidering her support for senators who called for Franken to resign. On social media, it’s easy to find anti-Gillibrand posts. No matter the issue, Gillibrand has detractors who circle back to what she did to Franken. Hope Kirsten Gillibrand is happy with her handiwork. https://t.co/vg6Dmpko9B — Bruce Bartlett (@BruceBartlett) July 31, 2018 Because of Al Franken, I will never in a million years vote for Kristen Gillibrand. — Burke Omalley (@burke_omalley) June 17, 2018 So maybe all the women Senators who were so fucking threatened by Al Franken in the Senate need to God Damn find out where the thousand girls are ... like now Looking at you Gillibrand https://t.co/PZyveKjept — NTXProgressive (@NTXProgressive) June 17, 2018 There’s also a theory, readily found on social media, that Franken was the target of a right-wing hit job centered around Leeann Tweeden, the first woman to accuse Franken of groping her without her consent, who appears to be conservative-leaning. But besides Tweeden, there were seven other women who said Franken harassed them, and four of them were on the record. Several of the incidents also occurred while he was either in office or running for office. Part of the reason Franken faced so much pressure to resign was that there was a heated campaign to win the U.S. Senate race in Alabama underway. Franken’s problems were a distraction at a time the party was hammering Republican Roy Moore, who was facing allegations of pursuing teenage girls while he was an adult. The senator resigning without a fight was no doubt, in part, an acknowledgment to the politics of the moment. Jill Farber Bramson, a Democratic donor and activist in Michigan, said she knew a number of women ― who tended to be older ― who were deeply disappointed when Gillibrand spoke out against Franken. “They had always really liked Kirsten Gillibrand very much,” she said. “They really respected her. ... They were just devastated that she pushed, they felt, all too hard and all too soon to have him resign.” ‘Why Are We Making This About Her?’ Gillibrand still has plenty of supporters ― including some former Clinton donors ― and many of them are standing by her even more fiercely since she faced the Franken attacks. They are deeply worried about the damage her principled stand may have done to her political future. “Why are we blaming Sen. Gillibrand for what Sen. Franken did?” asked Risa Levine, a New York donor who is friends with the senator. “Why are we making this about her? It’s not about her.” “She’s not the one who put her hand on all those women’s asses and boobs. She didn’t do that,” added another donor. “Why does she have to sacrifice her career, her brand, her authenticity, for the sake of Franken?” Gillibrand, after all, isn’t a newcomer on the issue of sexual misconduct. In addition to her work on women in the military and on college campuses, she has an organization devoted to promoting women running for office and introduced the Me Too Congress Act in the Senate, legislation devoted to combating sexual harassment in Congress. In fact, if she hadn’t spoken out, she likely would have lost credibility with her core group of supporters for deciding to suddenly be silent when it came to one of her colleagues. It seemed like no matter what she did, she couldn’t win. “She’s either a shrew with no power who’s just trying to make a name for herself, or she’s so all-powerful that her saying one thing made a man who has made decisions for himself for 60 years crumble like a cheap suit,” said a Democratic activist, summing up the way Gillibrand has been characterized. There’s a good chance Gillibrand would have been attacked if she had remained silent on Franken. In Minnesota, a GOP-aligned group sent out a mailer attacking state Rep. Melissa Hortman, the Democratic minority leader in the House, for signing a November statement expressing support for the senator after four women had come forward. Hortman, too, has been outspoken in her support for women’s rights. HuffPost A mailer by the GOP-aligned group Minnesota Jobs Coalition went after a Minnesota lawmaker for supporting Al Franken. Gillibrand isn’t the only woman to face a backlash for the Franken resignation. In November, Lindsey Port, then a Democratic candidate for the state legislature, accused state Sen. Dan Schoen (D) of sexual harassment. Schoen resigned, and Port initially received an outpouring of support. But after Franken announced he was leaving the Senate, the tide turned. Port lost financial support for her campaign and her nonprofit, with some people alleging that she “softened the ground” for Franken’s resignation by speaking out about the sexual harassment she faced at the hands of a totally different man. Others even wondered if she was secretly a conservative operative. Many Democrats say they see the split on Gillibrand and Franken as generational, with younger voters ― both men and women ― more likely to support Gillibrand, or at least be sympathetic to what she did. In June, Gillibrand spoke at the Washington, D.C., chapter of The Wing, an all-female social club that attracts a younger crowd, and she addressed the reason she spoke out on Franken. An attendee said the audience was supportive of her answer and applauded her. Gillibrand has also had other discussions in the wake of the matter, including calling some other prominent Democratic women in the San Francisco area who are friends with Tompkins Buell. According to someone with knowledge of the situation, the senator reached out to them to explain why she believed Franken needed to go, and she’s been willing to talk about her views with people who are skeptical and have questions. “Times change, and this is time changing for the better. This is about sexual harassment and sexual assault. Are we for that?” said a Democratic donor. “People just have to get over it. They should expect people to speak up and take a position on it.” “Did she do it because she wanted to position herself for president? Gee, I’m shocked. People do that all the time. Why is this issue a no-go? Is Bernie [Sanders] taking advantage of single-payer and putting people in an uncomfortable position by being so aggressive about that? We say it’s not the same, but it is the same. It’s getting a different frame because it’s squeezing the old-boy network.” ||||| Nearly a year after Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand led the charge in calling for former Sen. Al Franken's resignation, the anger is fresh on the minds of major donors. | Mark Wilson/Getty Images 2020 Election Franken scandal haunts Gillibrand’s 2020 chances ‘Let me tell you how strongly I felt about it — I didn’t even vote for her in the recent election. I left it blank,’ said one top donor. Just a month after Al Franken formally resigned from the Senate amid sexual misconduct allegations, the former senator met with an intimate group of Bay Area supporters at the home of major Democratic Party financiers Mary and Steve Swig. As Franken and his wife, Franni Bryson, made the rounds, thanking supporters in the philanthropists’ San Francisco home at the February 2018 event, the conversation broke off into another subject: Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. The New York Democrat had, in their opinion, pulled the rug out from under Franken, a Minnesota Democrat beloved by the group, forcing him out without any real vetting of the allegations facing him. Story Continued Below “It was said not in front of Al to impress him; it was said privately in a corner. A group of us were standing there talking about it. He was one of our best weapons against this administration, his presence on these committees. [Gillibrand] did the damage that Republicans could not do themselves,” one of the attendees told POLITICO. “There were other people at this event who were saying the same thing. They said, ‘Absolutely, I will never do anything for her.’” Today, nearly a year after Gillibrand led the charge in calling for Franken’s resignation, the anger is fresh on the minds of major donors across the country. More than a dozen prominent West Coast, New York and national donors and bundlers — many of them women — said they would never again donate to or fundraise for Gillibrand or would do so only if she ended up as the Democratic presidential nominee.

Gillibrand has defended her approach by insisting she placed deeply held personal values over party loyalty. But the still-burning resentment among the donor class now confronts Gillibrand as she explores a presidential bid, cutting her off from influential and deep-pocketed contributors and their networks at a time when an expansive 2020 field will compete for their dollars. Among those donors is Susie Tompkins Buell, a prominent Democratic fundraiser and co-founder of Esprit and the North Face clothing brands, who said the matter remains fresh in her mind and among those in her circles. The episode, she said, “stained [Gillibrand’s] reputation as a fair player.” “I do hear people refer to Kirsten Gillibrand as ‘opportunistic’ and shrewd at the expense of others to advance herself, and it seems to have been demonstrated in her rapid treatment of her colleague Al Franken,” she said. “I heard her referred to as ‘She would eat her own,’ and she seems to have demonstrated that. I know [Gillibrand] thought she was doing the right thing, but I think she will be remembered by this rush to judgment. I have heard [that] some of her women colleagues regret joining her.” The anger is at least in part a testament to donors’ fondness for Franken, a comedian who rose to fame as a “Saturday Night Live” cast member and remains in the eyes of his supporters one the Senate’s greatest champions for women — even after his resignation. Several of those who talked to POLITICO also spoke of an inner-party struggle to keep Franken from resigning, fearing he was swept up in a panic at the time. A Change.org petition opposing Franken’s resignation had 75,000 signatures. Some blamed the media for rushing to publish allegations without a full vetting. “I could stay on the phone all afternoon talking about this,” said a Manhattan-based member of the ‘Majority Trust’ of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, an elite group of top donors, who has donated to Gillibrand in the past. “Let me tell you how strongly I felt about it — I didn’t even vote for her in the recent election. I left it blank.” Another major Manhattan-based donor said the episode raised suspicions that it was a craven political move by Gillibrand. “I thought she was duplicitous,” the donor said. “Once the whole thing happened with Al Franken, it was confirmed 1 billion percent that she’s not to be trusted. I think that she hurt the Democratic Party. I think that she hurt the Senate. I think that what she did for women in politics was dreadful.” The Franken accusations came in the weeks after a parade of powerful men were toppled by the #MeToo movement; among them Harvey Weinstein, Matt Lauer, Louis C.K. and Garrison Keillor. The wounds over Franken’s ouster were reopened, some Democrats say, during confirmation hearings for Brett Kavanaugh, who faced sexual misconduct allegations but still was seated on the Supreme Court. One major national Democratic fundraiser told POLITICO the level of residual anger runs the gamut, but it’s still very much present. “I know Kirsten well, and I know Al well. ... It’s tragic what happened to Al, and a lot of my donors feel anywhere from strongly to adamantly about anger at Kirsten for what she did. Others see that it was a way to kind of grab the high ground with no ambiguity,” the fundraiser said. “Personally, I lean towards I think Kirsten overdid it. It’s such a shame that Al couldn’t just go through the process and be reprimanded, or censured. At the moment it happened, it was understandable.” Gillibrand has stood her ground, never publicly backing down from the criticism, even when it came from the Democratic Party’s most prolific donor, George Soros. In June, he told The Washington Post he blamed Gillibrand for cornering Franken into resigning, accusing her of doing so “in order to improve her chances” in 2020. In August, Gillibrand responded specifically to Soros, telling HuffPost in a statement : “If standing up for women who have been wronged makes George Soros mad, that’s on him.” Gillibrand’s campaign recently pushed back against the criticism, asserting that the senator did the right thing by speaking up. “Leadership means standing up for your values when it's hard. Kirsten has never been afraid to stand up for what she believes in and never will be. You can disagree with her views, but holding her accountable for someone else's behavior towards women is wrong, and her values aren't for sale,” Gillibrand spokesperson Glen Caplin said in a statement to POLITICO. “One year later, after the special election in Alabama, the Kavanaugh hearings and the historic number of women who took back the House in the midterms, there is just no case to be made the Democratic Party would have been better off with a different outcome. We have to put our morals and the valuing of women ahead of party loyalty.” On Monday, Gillibrand herself sounded off on Twitter. “Silencing women for the powerful, or for your friends, or for convenience, is neither acceptable, nor just,” she wrote above a link to this POLITICO story. NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue said “history will laud” Gillibrand for her actions. On its face, the revolt against Gillibrand seems counterintuitive. At a key moment in the “#MeToo” movement, Gillibrand stood up to a revered colleague in her own party. She led the call for Franken’s resignation after he was accused of groping or trying to forcibly kiss more than half a dozen women. A chorus of senators quickly followed her. It raised Gillibrand’s national profile, almost immediately branding her as a fierce female leader who told the establishment that when it comes to sexual harassment, “enough is enough.” It’s unclear whether or to what extent a donor backlash could debilitate Gillibrand’s possible 2020 campaign. In the era of small-donor, digital fundraising, major donors arguably don’t hold as much sway — but that’s typically true only for candidates who catch fire, like Sen. Bernie Sanders or Rep. Beto O’Rourke. From 2013 through this year, Gillibrand’s campaign committee raised nearly 18 million for her 2018 reelection bid. Almost 60 percent of that amount came from high-dollar donors, but Gillibrand also raised nearly 6.5 million, or about 30 percent of her total, from small-dollar donors who gave less than 200. Ana Maria Archila, co-executive director for the Center for Popular Democracy, called Gillibrand’s response “important and courageous.” “It probably made her more enemies than friends,” said Archila, who famously confronted Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) in a congressional elevator this summer during the Kavanaugh hearings. If Gillibrand is unpopular with a certain subset of the Democratic donor class, it didn’t hurt her in her most recent reelection bid in New York in November, when she won roughly two-thirds of the vote against her Republican opponent and garnered 3.73 million votes — the most for any candidate in New York in this election cycle. She earned almost 400,000 more votes than Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is sometimes mentioned as a possible 2020 Democratic contender himself. In 2012, when she was running for her first full Senate term, she garnered 350,000 more votes than President Barack Obama, who led the Democratic ticket, received in New York. Franken, who declined to comment for this story, posted on Facebook over the Thanksgiving holiday thanking supporters for well wishes over the past year — and offered a reflection. “I’ve also spent a lot of time over this past year thinking about the broader conversation we’ve been having about the experience of women in this country. I know that, for so many people, this issue raises a lot of powerful and painful feelings,” Franken wrote. “This conversation can also be incredibly complicated. I don’t think it’s my place to weigh in on all the debates — but I will continue to listen and learn.” Carla Marinucci contributed to this report. |||||","output":"Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), a major advocate for the Me Too movement, faces criticisms and potential loss of support from some Democratic Party donors after her calls for the resignation of then-Senator Al Franken (D-Minn) due to multiple sexual misconduct allegations against him.

When you add heat energy to water, it causes the water molecules to gain enough energy to change their state from liquid to gas, which is known as boiling. This heat can be provided in various sources, such as electric stove, gas stove, or an open flame (fire). In the context of Fact 2 which states that gas is the source of energy for heating water and for the stove, gas would be the specific source of heat for boiling water in that case.

Options: - injury - beauty - late - mistakes - annoyed Explain why a human would choose \\"late\\" to answer the question above:","output":"A human would choose \\"late\\" as the answer to the question above because it most accurately reflects the potential consequences of a grooming appointment taking longer than expected. The other options, while they may be relevant in some situations, do not directly address the impact on the next appointment. Let's analyze them one by one: 1. Injury: While it's possible that an injury could occur during a grooming session, it wouldn't be the natural consequence for the next appointment if the current grooming appointment runs late. The injury would primarily concern the individual involved and the groomer. 2. Beauty: Beauty could be a positive outcome of an excellent grooming session, but it doesn't address the effect on the next appointment when a grooming session takes longer than planned. 3. Late: When a grooming appointment runs longer than expected, it can cause a domino effect on the other scheduled appointments. As a result, the next appointment would likely be delayed, causing the clients to experience a late start to their sessions. Furthermore, this can lead to a backlog throughout the day with each subsequent appointment starting later than anticipated. 4. Mistakes: While mistakes can happen during a grooming session, they don't inherently cause the next appointment to be affected. If mistakes were made in the current appointment, the groomer would likely need to address and fix the issues on hand. However, mistakes don't necessarily lead to an extension in appointment duration, and even if they do, it doesn't directly connect to the effect on the next appointment. 5. Annoyed: Clients might become annoyed if their appointment is delayed or if they have to wait for an extended period. This emotional response might be a consequence of the next appointment being late, but it doesn't thoroughly explain the direct impact on the appointment scheduling. Therefore, a human would choose \\"late\\" as the most logical and fitting answer, as it directly correlates with the consequences of the next appointment when a grooming session takes longer than expected. A late appointment can lead to a variety of issues, such as dissatisfaction among clients, inefficiency in the grooming service, and potential loss of clientele due to chronic lateness."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"Tirana will deploy the funds, which come from privatisation of several state-run companies, in case of a financial crisis, Bode said.\\" to Turkish?","output":"\\"Tirana, Bode'nin söylediğine göre, mali bir kriz durumunda devlete ait birkaç şirketin özelleştirilmesinden elde edilen fonları kullanıma sunacak.\\""},{"instruction":"Given a sentence in Arabic, generate a new Arabic sentence by performing small changes on the sentence.

A:","output":"\\"Manhattan apartment\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because Manhattan is known for having relatively small living spaces, due to the high population density and expensive real estate.

Article: In our life, there are always some days that will never be forgotten. This was one of those days, a day when we were on a hike, I became my children's hero. This event happened the first summer after we moved to the mountains of Colorado. Wanting to enjoy the beauty of the mountains, my wife and I planned a day hike to the Brown's Creek waterfall. The kids were excited--a day hike, a chance to experience a waterfall, and a day spent with Dad and Mom. Our hike would take us up the Brown's Creek trail and after about 3 miles the waterfall would be on our left. After slowly climbing the first mile, the trail took us through a beautiful grassland and across the creek a couple of times. We decided to turn back before reaching the waterfall, mostly because we were tired and still didn't know how much farther _ was. While crossing the creek by walking on a downed tree trunk, our little Izzie fell into the creek and immediately started moving up and down in the current . Immediately, I jumped into the creek after her. I managed to grab her and push her to the bank. But now, I was the one in need of being rescued. I thought this might be the end and I wasn't sure if I could hold on. Then, I heard the voice of the love of my life, my wife's voice. She shouted loudly--Stand up! Stand up! With the last bit of strength I had, I stood, and walked out of the creek. The kids showed little concern for my health; they were looking after Izzie, now safe in their arms. But I did hear one of the kids say: Thanks Dad, for saving Izzie. You're our HERO! As we walked back down the trail, I enjoyed a rare, but one of those sweet moments in life, that I wouldn't trade for anything on earth. I didn't care about my wet clothes, the squish of water in my boots, or the embarrassment of nearly drowning in water; none of that mattered. I just walked along following my family, with my head held up, my shoulders back and my chest pushed out proudly enjoying the fact that, at that moment in time, on that particular day in life, I was...

D: Little Izzie was rescued by her father. A:","output":"D: Little Izzie was rescued by her father. From the passage, we can understand that the family did not reach the waterfall (since they decided to turn back before reaching it), so option A is incorrect. There is no mention of Little Izzie being badly hurt in the passage, thus, option B is also incorrect. While the mother did shout instructions to the author (the father) to help him out of the creek, she did not physically pull him out, so option C is incorrect.

One of the first links was to a journal article by Heidi Philipsen entitled ‘Constraints in Film Making Processes Offer an Exercise to the Imagination’. Interestingly enough the first sentence of her article states: “I would like filmmakers interested in thinking “outside the box” to recognize that they can benefit from being placed “inside a box.” I wonder if Paul had contemplated this whilst choosing the name for this studio. Throughout her article Philipsen challenges the notion that creativity is an intangible innate quality, existing within the mind of one source, but rather creativity arises from a multitude of sources. Alike all things shared she suggests that creativity is easier to enhance by changing environmental conditions, rather than encouraging people to ‘think more creatively’. Perceiving creativity in this way allows you to see it as an organisationally influenced phenomenon, rather than a psychological and individual phenomenon. Which enables you to have more control over creativity and to encourage creativity once being aware of how it can be environmentally enhanced. As Csikzentmihalyi (1996) states “a genuinely creative accomplishment is almost never the result of a sudden insight, a lightbulb flashing on in the dark, but comes after years of hard work”. Constraints, as Philipsen suggests is one such way to manipulate the environment to enhance creativity. Students who attended The Film School in Denmark, who were forced into working with constraints for their projects eventually considered constraints to be both useful and inspirational. Such constraints included: making a scene with a specific theme, within a specific deadline and with other specific conditions concerning the use of camera, sound, actors etc. Students stated that these constraints ultimately made them feel secure, inspired and focused and...

Which tennis player, Cyril Suk or Christo van Rensburg, won one Grand Slam men's doubles title and four Grand Slam mixed doubles titles during his career? A:","output":"Cyril Suk B: Christo van Rensburg Answer: A: Cyril Suk Cyril Suk, a professional tennis player from the Czech Republic, is the one who achieved the impressive feat of winning one Grand Slam men's doubles title and four Grand Slam mixed doubles titles during his career. Let's delve deeper into his achievements and career highlights. Cyril Suk was born on January 29, 1967, in Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic). He comes from a renowned tennis family, as his mother, Vera Sukova, was a top-ranked women's player in the 1960s, and his sister, Helena Sukova, is a former world No. 1 doubles player and a silver medalist at both the 1988 and 1996 Olympic Games. During his career, Suk managed to win a total of 32 doubles titles, including one Grand Slam men's doubles title and four Grand Slam mixed doubles titles. His Grand Slam men's doubles victory came in 1998 when he and his compatriot, Sandon Stolle, emerged as champions at the US Open. The duo defeated the Indian pair of Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes in an engaging final that ended in a scoreline of 6-3, 6-7, 6-2, 6-0. Apart from his men's doubles success, Suk had a remarkable record in mixed doubles, where he won four Grand Slam titles. He clinched two Wimbledon mixed doubles titles, the first with his sister Helena Sukova in 1991 and the second with Larisa Neiland in 1996. Furthermore, Cyril Suk etched his presence in the mixed doubles scene with two Australian Open titles alongside Gigi Fernandez, in 1992, and Larisa Neiland in 1997. On the other hand, Christo van Rensburg, born on 23 October 1962 in South Africa, was also a successful professional tennis player. Throughout his career, he won 20 doubles titles, including one Grand Slam men's doubles title at the Australian Open in 1985. He also achieved a career-high singles ranking of world No. 19 in 1988. In conclusion, while both Cyril Suk and Christo van Rensburg were formidable tennis players with impressive careers, it is Cyril Suk who won both one Grand Slam men's doubles title and four Grand Slam mixed doubles titles during his career."},{"instruction":"For this chain-of-thought reasoning and answer, what was the question?

Possible answers: 1). yes; 2). no;","output":"2). No. The statement provided is indeed incorrect. In 1997, Canada did not issue the special £1 banknote from the Royal Bank of Scotland to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the birth of Alexander Graham Bell. It was the Royal Bank of Scotland who released the £1 commemorative note in honor of Bell, a Scottish-born inventor and scientist. Now, let me provide you with the correct information related to Canadian currency in 1997. To celebrate Bell, Canada did not release a form of currency specifically in 1997. However, in 2002, the Bank of Canada honored the inventor by featuring Alexander Graham Bell on the back of the Canadian 100 banknote (issued as part of the Canadian Journey Series). The banknote depicted Bell with his numerous inventions, such as the telephone, photophone, HD-4 hydrofoil, and the Silver Dart airplane, commemorating his significant contributions to the development of communication and transportation technology. In conclusion, the correct information related to Bell and Canadian currency is that in 2002, the Bank of Canada released a 100 banknote featuring Alexander Graham Bell and his inventions. The 1997 Royal Bank of Scotland £1 commemorative note is not related to Canadian currency but instead was issued by Scotland to celebrate Bell's 150th birth anniversary."},{"instruction":"Les renseignements seront conservés et mis à jour jusqu’à ce que les avocats concernés quittent le Ministère.

Although he does not show any overt signs of mental illness, he hopes to avoid hard labor and serve the rest of his sentence in a more relaxed hospital environment. McMurphy's ward is run by steely, unyielding Nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher), a strict authoritarian woman who passive-aggressively employs subtle humiliation, unpleasant medical treatments and a mind-numbing daily routine to suppress the patients and keep them submissive. McMurphy finds that they are actually more fearful of Nurse Ratched and her methods than they are focused on their main goal of eventually becoming functional in the outside world. In order to help them achieve this (as he believes), McMurphy establishes himself immediately as the leader of his fellow patients. The ward's other patients include Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif), a nervous, anxiety-prone young man with a noticeable stutter; Charlie Cheswick (Sydney Lassick), a man disposed to childish fits of temper; Martini (Danny DeVito), who is delusional; Dale Harding (William Redfield), a high-strung, well-educated paranoid; Max Taber (Christopher Lloyd), who is chronically belligerent and profane; Jim Sefelt (William Duell), an epileptic man; and \\"Chief\\" Bromden (Will Sampson), a silent Native American-descended man of very imposing stature who is believed to be both deaf and mute.

This directly implies that the hypothesis stating the Hubble Space Telescope's success was indeed praised in a recent Newsweek cover story. To further analyze and break down the connection between the premise and the hypothesis, let's look at the key aspects of both statements: 1. The central subject of both the premise and the hypothesis is the Hubble Space Telescope. This telescope is a major scientific instrument that has significantly contributed to our understanding of the universe by capturing high-resolution images of celestial objects and allowing researchers to peer deep into space and time. The fact that both statements are centered on this subject helps establish a clear connection between them. 2. The premise highlights that Newsweek, a well-known publication with a wide readership, has chosen to feature the Hubble Space Telescope on its cover. This choice reflects the significance and impact of the telescope's success in the world of science and astronomy. The hypothesis also specifically mentions Newsweek, further reinforcing the connection with the premise. 3. Both the premise and the hypothesis mention that the Hubble Space Telescope's success is the focal point of the cover story. This shared focus clearly links the two statements, as they both emphasize the remarkable achievements of the telescope. 4. Lastly, the premise explicitly states that the cover story \\"hails the success\\" of the Hubble Space Telescope. This celebratory tone can be seen as an endorsement or praise for the telescope and its accomplishments. This concept of praise aligns with the hypothesis, which mentions \\"praised recently\\" to describe the content of the cover story. In conclusion, the premise – asserting that Newsweek's cover story hails the success of the Hubble Space Telescope – entails the hypothesis which claims that the telescope's success was praised in a recent Newsweek cover story. Both statements are centered around the Hubble Space Telescope and its success, and they both highlight the recognition and praise given by Newsweek through its cover story."},{"instruction":"Everyone uses the internet nowadays, don't they? Well, no. Not everyone. Earlier this year the Office for National Statistics reported that almost nine out of 10 adults in the UK (44.7 million people) have used the internet in the last three months. That's a lot. But it means there are still 5.9 million people (11% of the UK's adult population) who never go online. So, who are these people? Why are they not using the internet? And are they really any worse off? Unsurprisingly, most of those who spend their entire lives offline are older. Almost everyone aged between 18 and 54 are recent users of the internet, the ONS report found. But that figure falls away dramatically in the older generation, and amongst the over 75s just a third could be described as \\"silver surfers\\". The geographical spread of internet users is also hardly surprising: in London and the south-east of England almost 90% of the population are connected to the world wide web. In Scotland, 85.4% of people are online; in Wales, 82.5% and in Northern Ireland fewer than eight in 10 (79.6%) people have used the internet in the last three months. Less reliable figures from the ONS suggest that one in five people in Dumfries and Galloway are not connected. A poor broadband service in parts of the region is partly to blame for the situation but work is ongoing to bring so-called \\"superfast broadband\\" to region. James Pocock is responsible for improving digital connectivity in Dumfries and Galloway. As the council's Next Generation Broadband manager, he is the local link with Digital Scotland, a partnership of public, private and voluntary groups which promotes the digital technology. He is aiming to meet an ambitious Scotland-wide target to have 95% of homes and businesses connected to superfast broadband by the end of 2017, but he admitted that the south of Scotland has suffered from poor infrastructure in the past and there are challenges ahead. \\"What has been completed to date could be regarded as the easier infrastructure to deliver and we are now looking at how we can push that infrastructure out to harder to reach areas,\\" he said. \\"That will be more challenging and more time consuming.\\" But it is a vital resource for the area, he said. \\"So much of what we do everyday is either done or supported by online activity. Whether that is learning, purchasing services, it's just part of everyday life in a modern economy that we live in nowadays.\\" Janice Rutherford, a grandmother from Cumnock, has no interest in using the internet. Her grown up children have tried to convince her that she could save money by shopping and paying her bills online, but she is not so sure. \\"I know all these things happen but that's for other people. It's not for me,\\" she said. Even if she was given a free computer and unlimited, free internet access, she said she still could not be persuaded. Would anything persuade her to get online, to get her own Facebook page? \\"No, especially not a Facebook page,\\" she said. \\"There's too much going on on Facebook that I don't like, especially when other people put me on it.\\" People on low incomes, those with disabilities and older people are among those who are least likely to use the internet, according to Sue Irving, chief executive of the Dumfries and Galloway Citizens Advice Service. And it can be a huge stumbling block for jobseekers and those applying for Universal Credit, which can only be applied for online. Ms Irvine said: \\"There's a push to move benefit applications online so if you are not computer literate, you don't have access to a computer, you don't have broadband, then it's really difficult for people.\\" Without the purchasing power internet shopping offers, it can also hit the poor and vulnerable in the pocket, she said. \\"We produced a report about the cost of living in the region and what we were seeing was... that if people aren't able to have the purchasing power that you have on line, then there's a disadvantage to that as well. \\"If your local shops have high prices and you don't have transport, you have a disability or a young family, then you are not able to be savvy in how you shop because you're not able to use the online facilities,\\" she added. Many libraries in Scotland offer basic computer literacy courses, and they are listed on the Let's Get On website. However until 100% of the population are digitally literate, Ms Irvine called for \\"flexibility\\" and \\"understanding\\" from the government. \\"It might sound efficient to say put everything online, and for some people that would probably work very well, but for a lot of people it doesn't,\\" she said. \\"It's about understanding at government level and at local government level that not everybody is computer literate, not everybody has access.\\" She added: \\"We would like there to be a flexible approach to that so for those who want to stick with paper systems, they should be able to do that.\\" This article was about:","output":"This article discusses the digital divide in the United Kingdom, focusing on the reasons why some individuals do not use the internet.

You turned around and, sure enough, someone was looking right at you! Parapsychologists say that humans have a natural ability to sense when someone is looking at them. To research whether such a \\"sixth sense\\" really exists, Robert Baker, a psychologist at the University of Kentucky, performed two experiments. In the first one, Baker sat behind unknowing people in public places and stared at the backs of their heads for 5 to 15 minutes. The subjects were eating, drinking, reading, studying, watching TV, or working at a computer. Baker made sure that the people could not tell that he was sitting behind them during those periods. Later, when he questioned the subjects, almost all of them said they had no sense that someone was staring at them. For the second experiment, Baker told the subjects that they would be stared at from time to time from behind a two way mirror in a laboratory setting. The people had to write down when they felt they were being stared at and when they weren't. Baker found that the subjects were no better at telling when they were stared at and when they weren't. and they were no better at telling when they were stared at than if they had just guessed. Baker concludes that people do not have the ability to sense when they're being stared at. If people doubt the outcome of his two experiments, said baker, \\"I suggest they repeat the experiments and see for themselves.\\" Question: In the first experiment, the subjects _ .

However, here is a brief explanation to help you understand why this claim is not entirely correct. Audrey Hepburn, a renowned British actress, was indeed one of the most celebrated and honored actresses of her time, but she did not receive the first awards ever given to a female actress. The history of cinema and awards predates Hepburn's career, with actors and actresses receiving recognition and accolades long before Hepburn's era. For instance, Janet Gaynor earned the first-ever Academy Award for Best Actress in 1929 for her roles in three films, and other actresses have been recognized with other awards since then. Hepburn earned numerous awards throughout her career, including an Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in \\"Roman Holiday\\" (1953), but she was not the first female actress to earn such awards."},{"instruction":"Jaws is a theme park attraction at Universal Studios Japan.

Founded in 2000 by vocalist Tim Lambesis, the establishment of the band's first full lineup, which included drummer Jordan Mancino, occurred in 2001. As I Lay Dying has released six albums, one split album, and two compilation albums. As I Lay Dying's fourth studio album An Ocean Although As I Lay Dying has stated on numerous occasions that all of the members of the group are practicing Christians, the band is usually described by media as being in the metalcore genre, not Christian metal. The band's lyrics do not focus on Christian themes the way many praise music bands do, nor do they treat their music as a direct extension of their private Christian worship or proselytizing efforts. For example, not once do the names God or Jesus appear in any As I Lay Dying song, nor do any of their songs explicitly invoke Christian doctrine or quote the Bible. Most songs tend to address broader spiritual concepts like existential angst or the struggle between reason and spirituality. Lyricist and lead singer Tim Lambesis has given mixed commentary on the subject: asked in 2008 if the members were \\"a Christian band\\" or \\"Christians in a band\\", Lambesis stated on the band's FAQ, \\"I'm not sure what the difference is between five Christians playing in a band and a Christian band, If you truly believe something, then it should affect every area of your life. All five of us are Christians. I believe that change should start with me first, and as a result, our lyrics do not come across very 'preachy.' Many of our songs are about life, struggles, mistakes, relationships and other issues that don't fit entirely in the spiritual category. However, all of these topics are written about through my perspective as a Christian.\\" Furthermore, during an August 2010 radio interview on the Christian metal radio show The Full Armor of God Broadcast, Lambesis stated \\"I can only really write about what I'm passionate about in life, so naturally my faith, my belief in the teachings of Jesus and His resurrection come across in our lyrics.\\" However, in later years, Lambesis showed an increasing philosophical skepticism towards Christianity and religion in general: Court documents stated Lambesis emailed his wife Meggan in August 2012, while on tour with As I Lay Dying, asking for a divorce and stating he \\"no longer believed in God\\". In explaining some of the lyrics from Awakened, Lambesis stated that his studies of theology had led him to the conclusion that \\"tradition and truth are often at odds with each other\\", and while he \\"didn't hate all religious belief\\", he was finding it \\"very difficult for to outline exactly who it is that's worth siding with.\\" He also quoted the book Pagan Christianity by George Barna and Frank Viola, claiming that both \\"Protestant and Catholic denominations have poisonous roots\\". While on house arrest in July 2013, after being charged with soliciting his wife's murder, Lambesis published a blog post in which he obliquely confirmed his previous loss of faith in Christianity. However, since his arrest it has been reported that Lambesis \\"has spent much of the last year reevaluating what originally convinced him to abandon belief in God. After much brokenness and repentance he sees things differently, considers himself a follower of Jesus, someone submitted to the will of God.\\" In 2014 Lambesis said that although they were marketed as a Christian band, the members privately considered themselves atheists.

Hint: As for the public health or food safety concern, organic foods are intended to be healthy, free of contaminations and free from agents that could cause human diseases. Organic milk is meant to have no chemical residues to consumers, and the restrictions on the use of antibiotics and chemicals in organic food production has the purpose to accomplish this goal. Although dairy cows in both organic and conventional farming practices can be exposed to pathogens, it has been shown that, because antibiotics are not permitted as a preventative measure in organic practices, there are far fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens on organic farms. This dramatically increases the efficacy of antibiotics when/if they are necessary. A:","output":"Based on the hint provided, Vole farm, which grows organic produce and produces organic milk, would be the farm that produces less milk with no antibiotics. Since organic farming practices restrict the use of antibiotics and chemicals, Vole farm's organic production method ensures that their milk has no chemical residues, and the likelihood of antibiotic-resistant pathogens being present is lower. While both dairy cows in organic and conventional farming practices may be exposed to pathogens, the limitations on antibiotics use in organic practices reduce the chances of developing antibiotic resistance, thus making antibiotics more effective when necessary.

Calculate the difference between the number of cards Ann and Anton have. Step 1: Determine the number of cards Heike has. Since Ann has six times as many cards as Heike, and Ann has 60 cards, we can represent this with the equation: Ann = 6 * Heike 60 = 6 * Heike To solve for Heike's cards, we can divide both sides of the equation by 6: Heike = 60 / 6 Heike = 10 So, Heike has 10 cards. Step 2: Determine the number of cards Anton has. Anton has three times as many cards as Heike, which we can represent with the equation: Anton = 3 * Heike Substitute the value of Heike's cards (10) into the equation: Anton = 3 * 10 Anton = 30 So, Anton has 30 cards. Step 3: Calculate the difference between the number of cards Ann and Anton have. The difference between the number of cards Ann and Anton have can be calculated with the equation: Difference = Ann - Anton Substitute the values of Ann's (60) and Anton's (30) cards into the equation: Difference = 60 - 30 Difference = 30 Ann has 30 more cards than Anton."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Question: Who escorts Tom, Mary and the children part of the way on their journey?

UPDATED:. 21:02 EST, 12 June 2012. The world's youngest gastric sleeve patient claims having risky weightloss surgery at 12 years old transformed her life. Betsy Sanchez, from Coahuila in Mexico, is delighted to have slimmed down from 15 to ten stone since having 70 per cent of her stomach removed. Having now taken up exercise for the first time, 14-year-old Betsy is no longer a target for cruel bullies who teased her about her size. Radical change: Betsy Sanchez before the weightloss surgery, left, and after shedding five stone, right. Active lifestyle: Betsy, who was morbidly obese at 15st, is now 10st and enjoys horse-riding and spending time with friends. The change took place thanks to the her uncle, Dr Guillermo Alvarez, a bariatric surgeon who carries out the controversial permanent weightloss operations on adolescents. Betsy's mother Ana, the doctor's second cousin, says that taking the drastic step was the only way to stop her daughter following the. same heartbreaking path as Georgia Davis, the 19-year-old British girl whose food. addiction caused her to balloon to 63st. 'Diet and exercise didn't work for Betsy - she was addicted to food, only surgery would work,' said 39-year-old Mrs Sanchez. 'If Georgia had an operation at 12, she'd be happy and healthy now. She's lost years of her life. She might be too big now to safely have the operation - which proves it's sometimes better to have it young.' Food obsessed: Betsy, pictured with her mother Ana, struggled with her weight from the age of four. Controversial procedure: Betsy's surgery was carried out by her uncle Dr Guillermo Alvarez, left. Dr Alzarez says having surgery is. helpful for children who are struggling to lose weight because having a. much smaller stomach restricts their food intake. He. claims the surgery not only benefits a child's health - helping prevent. medical issues such as diabetes and liver disease - but improves their. confidence and allows for a more active childhood and happier school. life. Dr Alvarez, who. receives patients from across the USA, Britain and Europe, has since. operated on other children, but sets a lower age limit of 12. Betsy said: 'When my uncle said he could make me thinner I was so excited. I can still eat whatever I want but smaller portions. 'I can have McDonald's, but much smaller portions, only two chicken nuggets and chips. 'Out of control': Betsy at five and seven. The little girl weighed four stone by three years old and was 'always hungry', according to her family. 'I'm much happier. I now go horse-riding and I have lots of friends.' Betsy's weight problems began at the age of three when she started asking for extra portions and demanding snacks between meals, causing her weight to soar to four stone. A gastric sleeve is one of the newer types of weightloss operations. The stomach is permanently reduced to about 25 per cent of its original size, by surgical removal of a large portion of the stomach. The open edges are then attached together (often with surgical staples) to form a sleeve or tube with a banana shape. It may be appropriate for people who can't return as often for the follow-up visits required by gastric band procedures. A gastric band is a silicone band with an inflatable inner collar that is fitted around the upper stomach to restrict food intake, creating a small pouch and a narrow passage to the lower stomach. This passage delays the emptying of food from the pouch and causes a feeling of fullness. The band can be tightened or loosened over time. Mrs Sanchez admitted she and her furniture dealer husband Guillermo, 44, kept treats in the house for their two other children, aged 13 and nine. She said: 'Betsy would have four cookies and four crackers between meals. If I tried to stop her, she'd have a tantrum. She was always hungry. 'I tried serving healthy food and cutting portions, but Betsy was out of control.' Betsy's parents took her to see a paediatrician and she was tested for an underactive thyroid, but no medical reason was found for her weight issues. Nutritionists and psychologists also failed to find a solution. The 14-year-old said: 'When I asked mum for seconds she gave in. I used to comfort eat because I was bullied.' By the age of seven, Betsy was eating. up to 3,000 calories a day - double the recommended intake for her age -. and by the time she was nine she was a size 20 and weighed 13st. She. added: 'My parents took me to see lots of doctors and nutritionists but. nothing helped me lose weight. I was worried I was going to get so fat. I'd end up bedridden.' At. 12, Betsy weighed 15st and had a BMI of 41, making her morbidly obese. Her parents took her to see Dr Alvarez, Mrs Sanchez's second cousin,. anxious that Betsy might be suffering from depression and could develop. medical issues such as diabetes and high cholesterol. Dr. Alvarez explained all young patients undergo a psychological evaluation. to ensure they understand the implications of weightloss surgery. They. are put on a nutrition and exercise program which continues after the. operation. Demanding child: Betsy, pictured aged seven and eight, would have tantrums if she was not allowed second helpings and snacks. Happy teenager: Betsy admits she used to comfort eat because she felt miserable about her weight. Confident: Betsy has gone from 15st to 10st and enjoys activities such as horse-riding for the first time. He eventually operated on Betsy in 2008, after studies showed the benefit of surgery on young people. Betsy is believed to be the youngest patient ever to undergo the gastric sleeve. 'It is very controversial to operate on children,' said Dr Alvarez. 'But I see the benefits of helping children in cases where parents have tried everything but nothing else seems to control their eating problem. 'It has changed Betsy's life. She now goes to a new school where no-one even knows she used to be overweight.' Mrs Sanchez added: 'Betsy is like a different girl. She is still shy, but she is blossoming into a beautiful young woman, making friends, and enjoying her teenage years. 'I think surgery is definitely worth considering in some cases for children like her.'","output":"1.

Despite consulting pediatricians, nutritionists, and psychologists, no medical reason or solution was found for her weight issues. 5. Dr. Alvarez believes the surgery can help children struggling with weight by restricting food intake, improving their health and preventing issues such as diabetes and liver disease. 6. Since the surgery, Betsy is now able to enjoy an active lifestyle, including horse-riding and spending time with friends, and is no longer a target for bullies. 7.

In this sentence, the sentiment-bearing words/phrases are: a. \\"may cause parents\\" b. \\"a few sleepless hours\\" c. \\"a sign\\" d. \\"its effectiveness\\" Step 2: Determine the sentiment polarity of the words/phrases. a. \\"may cause parents\\": neutral sentiment, as it does not indicate anything positive or negative by itself. b. \\"a few sleepless hours\\": negative sentiment, as it implies discomfort or disturbance. c. \\"a sign\\": neutral sentiment, as it merely indicates a correlation without indicating a positive or negative outlook d. \\"its effectiveness\\": positive sentiment, as effectiveness is typically a desirable quality for movies. Step 3: Evaluate the sentiment of the entire sentence. Although the part about \\"a few sleepless hours\\" carries a negative sentiment, the sentence refers to it as an indicator of the movie's effectiveness, which adds a positive connotation. The disagreeableness is framed as a positive aspect, since it demonstrates the movie's impact on the audience.

Living brain tissue is pinkish on the outside and mostly white on the inside, with subtle variations in color. Vertebrate brains are surrounded by a system of connective tissue membranes called meninges that separate the skull from the brain. Blood vessels enter the central nervous system through holes in the meningeal layers. The cells in the blood vessel walls are joined tightly to one another, forming the blood–brain barrier, which blocks the passage of many toxins and pathogens (though at the same time blocking antibodies and some drugs, thereby presenting special challenges in treatment of diseases of the brain).

The cathedral—dedicated to the Holy Trinity—was established in 1224 on land granted by King Alexander II outside the burgh of Elgin and close to the River Lossie. It replaced the cathedral at Spynie, 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) to the north, that was served by a small chapter of eight clerics. The new and bigger cathedral was staffed with 18 canons in 1226 and then increased to 23 by 1242. After a damaging fire in 1270, a rebuilding programme greatly enlarged the building. It was unaffected by the Wars of Scottish Independence but again suffered extensive fire damage in 1390 following an attack by Robert III's brother Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan, also known as the Wolf of Badenoch. In 1402 the cathedral precinct again suffered an incendiary attack by the followers of the Lord of the Isles. The number of clerics required to staff the cathedral continued to grow, as did the number of craftsmen needed to maintain the buildings and surrounds. The cathedral went through periods of enlargement and renovation following the fires of 1270 and 1390 that included the doubling in length of the choir, the provision of outer aisles to the northern and southern walls of both the nave and choir. Today, these walls are at full height in places and at foundation level in others yet the overall cruciform shape is still discernible. A mostly intact octagonal chapter house dates from the major enlargement after the fire of 1270. The gable wall above the double door entrance that links the west towers is nearly complete and was rebuilt following the fire of 1390. It accommodates a large window opening that now only contains stub tracery work and fragments of a large rose window. Recessed and chest tombs in both transepts and in the south aisle of the choir contain effigies of bishops and knights, and large flat slabs in the now grass-covered floor of the cathedral mark the positions of early graves. The homes of the dignitaries and canons, or manses, stood in..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The article does not explicitly mention which two staff positions at the Elgin Cathedral continued to grow. However, it does state that \\"the number of clerics required to staff the cathedral continued to grow, as did the number of craftsmen needed to maintain the buildings and surrounds.\\" From this information, we can infer that the two staff positions that continued to grow were clerics and craftsmen."},{"instruction":"Continue the following story. Patricia was always busy doing something, Kayla was more of a relaxed type.","output":"While Patricia was always seen hopping around, ticking items off her endless to-do list, Kayla was more likely seen lounging in the backyard, absorbed in the captivating world of her mystery novel. Despite their contrasting personalities, they were inseparable sisters. Patricia, with her fiery red hair, was as vibrant and fast-paced as the city life, while Kayla, with her soft blonde curls, exuded the tranquillity of the country side. Step 1: Identifying the Characters: The story revolves around Patricia and Kayla, two sisters with distinctly different personalities. Patricia is a busy bee while Kayla is more laid back and relaxed. Step 2: Analyzing Character Personalities: Patricia is vibrant, energetic, and perhaps a bit of a workaholic. The fiery red hair depicts her as a dynamic and vigorous character. Kayla, on the other hand, seems peaceful, calm, and possibly introspective, as hinted by her hobby of reading mystery novels. Having been gifted with the welcoming warmth of the spring season, the sisters decided to dedicate the weekend to a small picnic. Patricia took charge, planning the destination, food, and outdoor games while Kayla happily offered her agreement, in between her pages. The day before the picnic, Patricia was bustling around, packing for the trip. Kayla, on the other hand, comfortably perched near the window, flipping through the pages of her the novel, occasionally offering glances to her hyperactive sister. Step 3: Progressing the Story: To demonstrate their personalities further and move the storyline along, I've introduced a spring picnic scenario. Given their personalities, it's logical that Patricia will take charge of planning for the picnic while Kayla will agree to her plans but continue focusing on her reading. Step 4: Detailing the Actions: Patricia's bustling activity of packing for the picnic is juxtaposed with Kayla's relaxed actions. This further emphasizes their contrasting personalities. On the day of the picnic, Patricia, ever punctual, was rattling pots and pans in the kitchen by dawn, preparing the picnic meals. Meanwhile, Kayla was curled up in bed, wrapped in dreams until a sunlight beam gently awakened her. Yet, through all these differences, what tied them together was their unconditional love and understanding for each other as they perfectly complimented each other's personalities. Step 5: Finalizing the Scenario: The day of the picnic has arrived, and both are continuing their typical behaviors. Patricia is busy preparing meals, whereas Kayla is enjoying her sleep. Through all these, the sisters' bonding remains intact. The story is left open-ended, allowing for further progress in subsequent installments."},{"instruction":"What is the answer to this question? when did canada become independent from the british empire?","output":"Step 1: Understand the question The user is asking for the year Canada became independent from the British Empire.

Which Premier League football team has a colliery wheel on its badge?","output":"The Premier League football team that features a colliery wheel on its badge is West Bromwich Albion Football Club. West Bromwich Albion, commonly referred to as West Brom or WBA, is a professional football club based in West Bromwich, West Midlands, England. The club was founded in 1878 and currently competes in the English Premier League. The colliery wheel on West Bromwich Albion's badge represents the club's historical connection to the coal mining industry in the West Midlands and their working-class roots. The West Bromwich area was once a thriving hub for coal mining during the industrial revolution, and this is reflected in the club's emblem as a tribute to its origins. West Brom's current club badge has been in use since 2006 and is an updated version of their previous shield-shaped emblem. The primary elements of the badge, including the colliery wheel and the throstle bird, have been utilized in different configurations throughout the club's history. The throstle bird, a variety of song thrush, signifies the Hawthorns, the club's stadium, which was named after the hawthorn bushes that once occupied the site. The club's colors, navy blue and white, are also prominently displayed on the badge, with the navy blue background signifying the blue skies that the miners hoped for when the colliery wheel was still in use. The white stripes represent the five founding members of the club who were all workers in the industrial sector. Throughout its history, West Bromwich Albion has enjoyed varying degrees of success and has a loyal and passionate fan base. Some of their notable accomplishments include winning the Football League First Division (now known as the Premier League) in 1919-20, five FA Cup titles, and one Football League Cup. Their most recent success came in the form of promotion to the Premier League after finishing second in the EFL Championship during the 2019-20 season. In conclusion, the Premier League football team with a colliery wheel on its badge is West Bromwich Albion. This emblem symbolizes the club's historical ties to the coal mining industry in the West Midlands and serves as a tribute to its working-class foundations."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

(Associated Press) California has sold 83 million worth of Powerball tickets since April, when it joined 42 other states that offer the game. Since then, the most populous state has accounted for 11 percent of the game's sales, fueling such fast-growing mega-jackpots like the latest one that has the potential to be a record-breaker. The state expects to generate well above the originally estimated 50 million for public education, California lottery director Robert O'Neill told The Associated Press. \\"One thing California has brought Powerball is sunshine and good fortune,\\" he said. \\"It has surprised us. We're very happy.\\" Californians have Nevadans to thank for some of that good fortune. California's biggest ticket-seller is the Primm Valley Lotto Store, which straddles the state line in tiny Nipton, a 19th century mining and ranching town on the edge of the Mojave desert whose booming lottery sales have put it on the map in modern times. Roxie Handley figured all 80 of its residents would have a ticket in hand by Saturday. That's if they can find the time. \\"Here in Nipton, it's crazy,\\" said Handley, 59, who manages the Nipton Trading Post, which also sells Powerball tickets. \\"We're stocking up on everything. Last night, I heard some people had to wait nine hours in line.\\" The town is about 35 miles from Las Vegas on the main interstate from the Los Angeles area. Residents of the nation's No. 1 gambling state do not have access to the lottery. The Nevada state constitution contains a prohibition on lotteries, which are seen as competition to the casino industry. Norma Wagoner was among the Nevadans trying their luck. She and a group of friends pooled their money to buy 20 tickets and sent one over the state border to endure the long lines. \\"Everybody has dreams,\\" she said. \\"All it takes is one ticket.\\" Officials expect the jackpot to keep growing before Saturday's drawing that could break Powerball's November 2012 record of 587.5 million. The latest kitty leapt nearly 200 million since Wednesday's drawing, which was an estimated 360 million. The 550 million jackpot is the second largest in Powerball history and third biggest overall. Lottery officials expect jackpots to continue growing faster and bigger, thanks in part to a game redesign in January 2012 that increased the odds of winning some kind of prize of a lesser amount. On Wednesday, 1 million prizes were won in 16 states, and 2 million prizes were won in two states. California had six tickets among the winning ones Wednesday, including one sold in Nipton. More than half of the all-time jackpot records have been reached in the last three years. The top two all-time jackpots _ 656 million from a Mega Millions jackpot and 587.5 million from a Powerball jackpot _ were achieved in 2012. Some states, like California, now sell tickets for both games. The last major jackpot win came when a New Jersey man won a 338.3 million jackpot March 23. It is now considered the fourth largest Powerball jackpot in history. For Nipton, folks feel they've already won thanks to the boom in business. \\"It kind of disrupts our peace and quiet,\\" said Handley, although she admits she too plans to snap up a ticket. Most of the talk she hears around town these days, she says, is of people daydreaming about quitting their jobs and traveling with their millions: \\"Everybody wants a piece of the pie.\\" But she said she would likely give most of it away. \\"Having a lot of money I think would be a lot of headache,\\" she said. \\"Nipton has a lot of history. It's the place to come if you want to get away. We have a five-room bed and breakfast with no phones, no TVs, where you can sit and watch the trains go by. It's our little piece of heaven.

And finds one of them is worth millions. It gets better for Ricardo Cerezo of Geneva. He says his family was facing eviction, and he'll use part of the winnings — 4.85 million — to pay off the home. \\"It couldn't have happened at a better time,\\" said Cerezo, a management consultant. \\"I just thought, this is how God works.\\" Cerezo said his wife was cleaning out the kitchen and mentioned the lottery tickets that had accumulated over the past month in a glass cookie jar. \\"It was either take them, get them checked, or she was going to trash them that night,\\" he said. Cerezo said he took the tickets to a 7-Eleven in Aurora and scanned them. The first eight or nine tickets weren't winners, he said. \\"The following one was 3, so I was excited. I get to pay for my Pepsi. And then the last one said file a claim,\\" he said, which meant it was worth at least 600. Cerezo went online and found that the numbers matched the Feb. 2 Lotto drawing. \\"As each number kept matching, the smile kept going higher and higher. And when I realized we had all six numbers, it was that shocking moment of , 'Whoa, can this really be?'\\" he said at a news conference Wednesday. \\"Fast forward to the next day, Monday: Called in sick from work, went down into Chicago. It's one of those feelings where it's OK if they fire me.\\" After he waited about half an hour, Cerezo said, lottery officials brought him into a room and said his ticket was worth 4.85 million. Just three months earlier, Cerezo appeared at a foreclosure hearing where a judge gave him a few more months to find a new home before they would be evicted. \\"That was on Feb. 12, so we were sitting on 4 million at that time in this jar,\\" he said. \\"We will have our home paid off.\\" Cerezo said February holds special significance for him and his family because his daughter Savannah was born in that month.

Let's cover each of these options: 1. Punk rock band: In a punk rock band, players primarily use electric guitars, bass guitars, and drums. However, a brass instrument could be incorporated for a unique sound or fusion of genres. If playing in a punk rock band, the musician would carry their brass instrument on stage during live performances. 2. Marching band: In a marching band, musicians perform while walking or marching in formation, often during parades, halftime shows, or other events. Brass instruments like trumpets, trombones, and tubas are common in these ensembles. While playing in a marching band, the musician would carry their brass instrument as they march in formation. 3. Brass band: Brass bands are groups consisting exclusively of brass instruments, sometimes with percussion as well. Players carry their instruments during performances, which may occur on stage or in designated performance spaces. 4. Annoy mom: This response likely suggests playing a brass instrument to bother someone, in this case, the musician's mom. The musician would be carrying their instrument in any location in or around their home, likely as an attempt to get a reaction from their mother. 5. Jazz band: In a jazz band, brass instruments such as trumpets and trombones are often key components. Performances can occur in various venues such as jazz clubs, concert halls, or festivals. When playing in a jazz band, musicians typically carry their brass instruments on stage or in a designated performance area. In summary, musicians carry their brass instruments during performances, rehearsals, or practice sessions, and the specific manner in which they carry them might vary depending on factors like genre, setting, and ensemble type."},{"instruction":"I heard that Riley was trying to hide a bone from her dog.

Complete your Medical Doctorate.\\" Article:","output":"Title: A Comprehensive Guide to Pursuing a Career in Obstetrics and Gynecology (OB/GYN) Introduction Obstetrics and Gynecology (OB/GYN) is a rewarding and fulfilling career path within the medical field that focuses on the health and well-being of women. From pregnancy and childbirth to reproductive health and beyond, this specialty area allows physicians to play a critical role in the lives of their patients. To ensure the highest level of patient care and competent practice, it is essential for aspiring OB/GYN doctors to pursue a top-notch education, obtain the necessary medical training, and stay abreast of advancements in their field. This article will delve into the crucial steps involved in pursuing a career in Obstetrics and Gynecology, including taking the MCAT, attending a reputable medical school, and completing a Medical Doctorate program. 1. Pre-Med Education and Preparation: Laying the Groundwork Before launching their medical careers, aspiring OB/GYN practitioners must first lay a solid foundation by acquiring a strong pre-medical education. This typically involves obtaining a bachelor's degree in a relevant subject such as biology, chemistry, or physics. During their undergraduate studies, students should also strive to maintain excellent academic records and seek out opportunities to gain healthcare experience through volunteering, internships, or shadowing physicians in their desired specialty. 2. Taking the MCAT: The Gateway to Medical School The Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) is a standardized, multiple-choice exam required for admission to nearly all US and Canadian medical schools. It assesses a candidate's knowledge of natural, behavioral, and social sciences, as well as critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. To succeed in the MCAT, students must dedicate ample time to preparing for the exam, usually through a combination of self-study, test prep courses, and practice exams. A competitive MCAT score is a crucial component of a medical school application and will weigh significantly in the selection process. 3. Researching and Selecting Medical Schools with a Strong OB/GYN Focus Not all medical schools are created equal when it comes to the quality and depth of their OB/GYN programs. Aspiring physicians should research various schools extensively before applying, focusing on factors such as faculty reputation, residency placement rates, program curriculum, clinical and research opportunities, and available resources. Connecting with current students or alumni working in the OB/GYN field can provide valuable insights and firsthand knowledge of the best medical schools with outstanding programs in this specialty. 4. Completing the Medical Doctorate Program Once enrolled in a reputable medical school, students must maintain solid educational foundations, obtain hands-on clinical experience, and develop essential skills for their future careers. Medical school typically lasts four years, with the first two consisting of coursework in foundational sciences and the last two focused on clinical rotations in various specialties, including OB/GYN. This exposure to a broad range of specialties allows students to discover their passions and preferences and gain practical experience in their chosen field. 5. Pursuing Residency Training in OB/GYN Upon graduating with a medical doctorate, aspiring OB/GYN physicians must then secure a residency position in their chosen specialty. Residency programs in Obstetrics and Gynecology generally last four years and provide rigorous hands-on training under the supervision of experienced attending physicians. During residency, doctors develop specialized skills and knowledge necessary for the independent practice of OB/GYN, while also participating in research and furthering their understanding of current best practices in the field. 6. Board Certification and Licensure Following the completion of residency, OB/GYN physicians must obtain board certification through the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ABOG) by passing both written and oral examinations. Additionally, they must apply for medical licensure in the state or province where they intend to practice. These credentials serve as testimony to a physician's expertise, commitment to exceptional patient care, and adherence to ethical medical practice. Conclusion Becoming an outstanding OB/GYN physician involves several essential steps, including obtaining a quality pre-med education, succeeding on the MCAT, graduating from a reputable medical school with a strong OB/GYN program, and completing a rigorous residency training period. By taking these crucial steps and maintaining a lifelong dedication to education and professional growth, aspiring Obstetricians and Gynecologists can embark on a rewarding and impactful career, providing care and support to women throughout their lives."},{"instruction":"You are given a sentence in Japanese.

Which language is this?","output":"The language you've asked about is Turkish. Turkish is a member of the Oghuz group of languages, a subgroup of the Turkic language family. It is the most widely spoken of the Turkic languages, with around 70-80 million native speakers, the vast majority of whom live in Turkey. Turkish is part of the larger Altaic linguistic group, alongside languages like Mongolian, Korean, and Tungusic (it's should be noted, however, that the classification of Turkish as Altaic is somewhat controversial in academic circles). Turkish evolved from a language known as Proto-Turkic, which was spoken in northeast Mongolia around the first millennium B.C. The Turkish language underwent several significant reforms in the 20th century that drastically transformed its lexicon, syntax, and morphology. Most famous among these reforms was a 1928 decree which switched the writing system from the Perso-Arabic script to the Latin script. The language has uniform pronunciation, with vowels and consonants pronounced with no alterations throughout the sentence. Turkish is agglutinative, meaning that it frequently uses suffixes, and it follows a subject-object-verb (SOV) sentence structure. The excerpt you've provided \\"Mesele, anayasa ve Ohrid Anlaşması'nda bu şekilde yer aliyor ve bu anlaşma, ülkedeki siyasi partiler ve uluslararası toplumun temsilcileri tarafından da imzalanmıştır\\" when translated into English says: \\"The matter is stated in this way in the constitution and the Ohrid Agreement, and this agreement has also been signed by the political parties in the country and representatives of the international community.\\" Turkish is also known for its honorific system, which distinguishes between formal and informal ways of addressing people and often shows respect to age, social status, and professional rank.

Giraffes are terrestrial animals native to Earth, specifically to the African continent. They require specific habitats, like savannas and woodlands, for their survival. 2. The moon is a completely different environment compared to Earth, with no atmosphere, extreme temperatures, and no food or water resources for a living being like a giraffe. 3. Giraffes, like other living beings, need oxygen to survive. The moon has no atmosphere to provide oxygen or other necessary gases for survival. 4.

The answer is:","output":"The Jeanson network, also known as the \\"French support network for the Algerian National Liberation Front\\" (FLN), was led by a French philosopher, intellectual, and political activist named Francis Jeanson. He played a critical role in the Algerian War, which ultimately led to Algeria gaining its independence from France in 1962. Francis Jeanson was born on July 18, 1923, in Bordeaux, France. He studied philosophy at the prestigious École Normale Supérieure and was deeply influenced by the works of Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus. Jeanson was deeply committed to anti-colonialism and believed in the right of peoples to self-determination. When the Algerian War for independence broke out in 1954, he decided to actively support the Algerian cause. In 1956, Jeanson established the Jeanson network, which intended to provide financial, logistical, and moral support to the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN). Although he had no direct connections with the FLN leadership, his dedication to their cause was unwavering. The network mainly comprised of French intellectuals, writers, and activists who were sympathetic to the Algerian struggle for independence. The Jeanson network assisted the FLN in several ways. They helped transfer money from France to the FLN fighters, which was used to purchase weapons, food, and other essential supplies. The network also provided safe houses for FLN members hiding in France and facilitated the transportation of militants to and from Algeria. Additionally, the network helped share information and disseminated propaganda to raise awareness and build support for the Algerian cause within France and beyond. The French authorities sought to crack down on Jeanson's activities, as his network defied the French government's policies and was considered a threat to state security. In 1960, Jeanson was arrested and tried in a high-profile case known as the \\"Jeanson Trial.\\" He was charged with treason and conspiracy against the state for his role in aiding the Algerian rebellion. However, the trial brought a significant level of attention to the Algerian cause, as it exposed France's brutal suppression of the Algerian people and their struggle for independence. Jeanson was eventually sentenced to 10 years in prison, but he was released in 1962 after Algeria gained its independence. After Algeria's independence, Francis Jeanson continued his activism and engaged in various social and political causes, particularly related to human rights, anti-imperialism, and anti-racism. He remained a controversial figure in French society for his unwavering commitment to his principles. In conclusion, Francis Jeanson led the Jeanson network during the Algerian War, which was a crucial support system for the Algerian National Liberation Front in their struggle for independence from France. Jeanson's commitment to anti-colonialism and the right to self-determination played a significant role in Algeria's eventual independence in 1962."},{"instruction":"Para estar en la carrera, las empresas deben publicar en el sitio de Staples Facebook un video de 15 segundos sobre su compañía.

Article: Many hospitals have blood banks. In these banks, blood of all types is stored. When blood is needed, it is taken from the bank. Healthy people then give blood to the bank to replace the blood that is used. Blood can be kept in the fridge for about three weeks with a kind of chemical. When people lose much of their blood because of operations or accidents, they may need transfusions . Some people may need transfusions because of illness. Sometimes only a part of the blood is used for transfusions. Plasma , the liquid part of the blood , may be given alone. Transfusions of plasma are often given when people have been badly burned. When a person gets a transfusion, he gets blood of the same type as his. Or there may be a bad reaction . To make it safer, before a transfusion is given, the blood to be used must be tested with the blood of the person who is to receive it. This testing is called cross matching of the blood. Oswald Robertson, an American doctor, was the first one to give transfusions. He used blood that had been stored for some time to help wounded soldiers in 1918 in World War One.

They were all happy at first but type B ovens started to short circuit. But I can use this background: For example, if a circuit has a potential difference of 100 volts and it is intended for the circuit to contain a 100 ohm resistance, then the wires carrying the current for this circuit will be designed for 1.0 amp. If that 100 ohm resistance is suddenly cut out of the circuit and only 0.10 ohm resistance remains, then the voltage will push 1000 amps of current through the circuit. This current overheats the wires and may damage the circuits or start a fire in the walls or the appliance. There are many possible causes of a short circuit, one possible cause could be something overheating, melting wires, and thereby fusing the circuit closed, bypassing the resistance. Another cause might be something damaging the insulation of a wire, allowing the incoming and grounds wires to touch. In any case, once the resistance is lost, the voltage pushes a huge amount of charge through the wires causing them to overheat. What is an answer for this question: Which type of oven had fewer instances of voltage pushing a huge amount of charge through the wires?

A:","output":"To answer this question accurately, let me first gather the necessary information about the light independent reaction and its energy sources. Step 1: Understanding the light independent reaction The light independent reaction, also known as the Calvin cycle or the dark reaction, is the second phase of photosynthesis. It occurs in the stroma of chloroplasts in plants and some algae. The primary purpose of the light independent reaction is to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) into glucose using the energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) generated by the light dependent reaction. Step 2: Identifying the source of energy for the light independent reaction In the light dependent reaction, which occurs in the thylakoid membrane, light energy is captured by chlorophyll molecules and converted into chemical energy in the form of ATP and NADPH through a series of electron transport chains. Step 3: Connecting the energy sources to the light independent reaction The ATP and NADPH generated in the light dependent reaction are then utilized in the light independent reaction, providing the necessary energy for the conversion of CO2 into glucose. The ATP provides the phosphate groups needed for phosphorylation, while NADPH donates electrons necessary for the reduction of CO2. Step 4: Concluding the answer Therefore, the light independent reaction gets its energy from the ATP and NADPH molecules generated by the light dependent reaction that occurs prior to the Calvin cycle."},{"instruction":"Given the following passage \\"The leading naturalist in Britain was the anatomist Richard Owen, an idealist who had shifted to the view in the 1850s that the history of life was the gradual unfolding of a divine plan.

Kim studied a 15000 year-old settlement, before humans invented agriculture, while Harry studied a 5000 year-old village. Which student studied about a village that had a lower birth rate? A:","output":"A: Harry, who studied the 5000-year-old village, likely encountered a settlement with a lower birth rate compared to Kim's 15,000-year-old pre-agricultural settlement. To provide a comprehensive answer, we must first understand the context of these two time periods and how they relate to birth rates. Kim studied an ancient settlement dating back to 15,000 years ago, which places it within the Upper Paleolithic period. In this era, human societies were primarily hunter-gatherers, relying on foraging and hunting for their sustenance. In contrast, Harry studied a village that existed 5,000 years ago, situated in the Neolithic period, where the Agricultural Revolution had already taken place. Societies during this time harnessed the practice of crop cultivation and animal domestication, leading to the formation of permanent settlements. While both periods have their differences, one crucial factor that may have impacted birth rates in these communities is the lifestyle and resources available to the inhabitants. The hunter-gatherers of the Upper Paleolithic era were constantly on the move, following the food supply and adapting to seasonal changes. This nomadic lifestyle made having numerous children a challenge, as the community had to carry and care for their young while traversing great distances. As a result, the birth rate was generally lower in these groups. However, in the Neolithic period, permanent settlements allowed for larger communities and the possibility of more extensive social networks. With the advent of agriculture, societies could produce surplus food, which in turn supported larger populations. Consequently, with more resources and labor available, families in permanent settlements were able to raise more children, leading to higher overall birth rates. Therefore, despite the seemingly counterintuitive result, Harry (who studied the 5,000-year-old village) likely observed a lower birth rate than Kim’s 15,000-year-old settlement. This may be due to the higher death rates in agricultural societies due to disease, malnutrition, and other factors stemming from the close living quarters and intensive farming practices. For example, the increase in population density and closer interactions with animals raised the risk of zoonotic diseases. In summary, while both students studied ancient human settlements, they analyzed societies that differed significantly in their subsistence strategies, lifestyles, and social structures. Harry, whose research focused on a village from the Neolithic period, likely encountered a society with a lower birth rate compared to Kim's study of a Pre-agricultural settlement from the Upper Paleolithic era. Factors such as increased death rates from diseases and malnutrition in agricultural societies may have played a key role in this difference."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Rain, the young man is thinking.

What about going for a swim on Thanksgiving? Without Leap Day ,which takes place every four years, that could happen. Our calendar is normally 365 days long. It was created to match the cycles of the seasons. But Roman ruler Julius Caesar noticed a problem: The earth doesn't circle the sun in exactly 365 days. It actually cakes 365 and one-quarter days. He figured out that the extra part of a day would cause the calendar to grow apart from the seasons over time. Over 100 years, the seasons would shift about 24 days. Spring would start on April 13 instead of March 20. Caesar used math to figure out a way to stop the calendar from shifting. He decided to add an extra day to the month of February every four years. His idea helped keep the seasons and calendar matched up. Even so, it still wasn't perfect--his calendar was adding too many days. In 1582, Pope Gregory XIII worked on Caesar's idea. His calendar, called the Gregorian calendar, declares that every year that is equally divided by 400 is a leap year. Turn-of-the-century years, or years ending in \\"00\\", would not be leap years unless they could be divided equally by 400.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the pancreas releases insulin randomly happens, how will it affect LESS regulation of blood sugar level being needed. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if the pancreas releases insulin randomly, it would affect the regulation of blood sugar levels in the body. To analyze the possible effects, let's consider the given blood sugar regulation process step-by-step and compare it with the perturbation hypothesis. Normal Blood Sugar Regulation Process: 1. Blood sugar levels increase after a meal. 2. Cells in the pancreas release insulin. 3. Insulin causes the body to absorb glucose from the blood. 4. Blood sugar levels go back to normal. 5. If blood sugar levels are too low, the amount of insulin decreases. 6. Cells in the pancreas release glucagon. 7. The liver turns stored glycogen into glucose. 8. The liver releases the glucose into the blood. 9. Blood sugar levels go back to normal. Perturbed Scenario (random insulin release): 1. Blood sugar levels may or may not increase after a meal. 2. Cells in the pancreas release insulin randomly. 3. Insulin may cause the body to absorb glucose from the blood without an increase in blood sugar levels. 4. Blood sugar levels could decrease or remain normal after glucose absorption. Now, let's examine the potential effects of random insulin release on blood sugar regulation: - In the perturbed scenario, there may be instances where insulin is released even when blood sugar levels are normal or low. This could cause a decrease in blood sugar levels, potentially leading to hypoglycemia (abnormally low blood sugar). - In cases where blood sugar levels are high after a meal and insulin is released randomly, there's a reduced likelihood of adequate insulin release to help maintain a normal blood sugar level. This could ultimately lead to hyperglycemia (abnormally high blood sugar). - The perturbed insulin release may also affect the balance between insulin and glucagon, which are critical for maintaining blood sugar levels within a normal range. In particular, random insulin release might lead to less glucagon being released, as it might mask low blood sugar events that would normally trigger glucagon release. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis of random insulin release would have both direct and indirect effects on the regulation of blood sugar levels. This could potentially lead to consequences such as hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, making blood sugar regulation less precise and ultimately less effective."},{"instruction":"On his oak mantelpiece are a drinking bowl from Lake Turkana and an East African gourd, both of which he bought in Nairobi where he went in the fall of 1993 to visit Kitum Cave, the suspected host site for the Marburg virus, which is closely related to Ebola.

So what can you do to ensure your fridge---and your food in it---is not a health threat? For starters, clean the fridge weekly---wipe it and repeat. Make sure your fridge is at the correct temperature for storing food, between 0 and 5 degrees centigrade. Your freezer should be below-18 degrees centigrade. You can use fridge and freezer thermeters to make sure this is the case. Some modern fridges have zones to store different types of food ,such as meat and vegetables. Make sure you don\`t store meat in the vegetable zone, as the temperature there might be higher. Make sure you don not leave the door open too long as the temperature in the fridge will quickly rise, creating a breeding ground for bacteria. Cover food that has not been finished, and eat it within a couple of days. Keep bottles and jars closed. Keep raw meat away from cooked meat. Both should be well covered to prevent pollution. Store raw meat at the bottom of the fridge to stop juices dripping onto other foods. Finally, use common sense, and throw away old food. Answer:","output":"Question: According to the article, which of the following actions can help maintain a clean and safe fridge environment? A) Cleaning the fridge weekly and setting the correct temperature B) Storing raw meat in the vegetable zone C) Leaving the fridge door open for extended periods D) Mixing raw and cooked meat in the same storage area Answer: A) Cleaning the fridge weekly and setting the correct temperature"},{"instruction":"Definition: In this task, you are given a sentence in the Spanish language.

One of the aliens raises its weapon and burns Brian's hand. They rush back to the house and try to convince their incredulous family to flee while there is still time. They see lights in the sky and a furtive figure outside a window, but the family refuses to believe the brothers' story until Tommy plays them the tape. Suddenly, a high-frequency screech incapacitates everyone but five-year-old Rose. When it stops, Kurt straps a flashlight to his shotgun and decides to get everyone in his truck and leave.

On the first day of his midlife crisis, he stood in front of the mirror examining his receding hairline and wrinkles on his face. In that very moment, while staring at his reflection he found in his eyes that mad look he had last seen thirty years ago in a photograph taken at a tethered flying model competition. The photo was taken by Henryk the servant, when his little charge decided he wanted a red biplane model Curtiss Consolidated Skyhawk Cruisader 3A \\"Bingo Star\\". This new look was also noticed by his co-workers, who for the most part, considered him to be an infantile spoiled brat. It fit with their idea of a boss. And Benedykt was indeed the boss, even though he himself couldn't quite believe it. He was the head of a foundation for the self-promotion of the Ossolinsky family, well-known descendants of Polish-American aristocrats, engaged in business ventures there, and charity work here. The position was highly honorable and very prestigious. Just as the employees didn't like Benedykt, in equal measure Benedykt didn't like his job. He considered it extremely stressful and felt it forced him to super-human sacrifices. Everything was arranged by the family as a penance for avoiding work. He had to go to the office at least three times a week for two full hours and entertain various smiling journalists, drink coffee with them and listen.

While the review is quite short and doesn't provide a comprehensive perspective, the use of the word \\"fresh\\" implies that the critic found the movie to be new, invigorating, and potentially different from other movies they have watched. The term \\"fresh\\" often carries positive connotations when used in a movie review, suggesting that the movie managed to deliver a sense of originality, creativity, or innovation in its story, characters, or overall execution. It may also hint at the film's ability to engage and entertain, or even surprise and challenge the audience in unexpected ways. However, without a longer and more detailed review, it's difficult to grasp the full extent of the critic's opinion about the movie. A comprehensive review would typically address specific elements like the plot, characters, dialogue, acting, cinematography, music, and the movie's overall impact on the viewer. By discussing these aspects in detail, a critic can provide a well-rounded perspective about the movie and enable potential viewers to make informed decisions about whether to watch it. Additionally, a longer review would also allow the critic to discuss any possible drawbacks, shortcomings, or areas that could have been improved. This sort of balanced evaluation is crucial for presenting an honest and objective analysis of a movie's overall quality. In conclusion, based on the short review provided, it seems that the critic is thinking positively of the movie, and that the movie was seen as a fresh and potentially original piece of cinema. In order to fully understand the critic's stance on the movie, a longer and more in-depth review would be necessary to explore the specific qualities that made it stand out, as well as any possible flaws or areas for improvement."},{"instruction":"Here is a premise: \\"One man, airborne, wearing an orange sweatshirt and blue jeans, does a skateboarding trick.\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"The man is riding a bike.\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?","output":"The premise provided is: \\"One man, airborne, wearing an orange sweatshirt and blue jeans, does a skateboarding trick.\\" It offers information about a man performing a skateboarding trick while wearing specific clothing.

Pruitt said the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission was initially notified Thursday of dead dogs on the property off of Arkansas Highway 254 in the Chimes/Trace Ridge area. That agency in turn notified his office. He said about 60 dogs were found either dead or so severely wounded they had to be euthanized due to their suffering. Three dogs were still alive and were taken in for treatment. He said they were fairly healthy and not necessarily aggressive, but not extremely friendly either. Pruitt said the dogs were apparently shot on scene in that isolated part of the county. People looking at the land as timber tracts found the first dogs, but others were found in the general area. \\"It appears they were killed there,\\" Pruitt said. Although some of the dogs did have ribs showing, they didn't appear to have been neglected or abused, the sheriff said. None of the dogs had collars or name tags, and they could have been on the property for two or three days, Pruitt said. A dog rescue operation had been shut down in Searcy County a few years ago, but there were no immediate clues where the dogs might have originated, Pruitt said. It was his understanding that the suspect in that case had moved on from Searcy County. \\"Right now, I'm going to say we don't have any leads that have checked out,\\" Pruitt said Friday evening. Pruitt said Arkansas State Police had also been notified of the incident. Anyone with information regarding the investigation is asked to call the Searcy County Sheriff's Office at (870) 448-2340. The investigation was still in its early stages Friday. ||||| CHIMES, Ark. - A gruesome discovery was made on Thursday afternoon in southern Searcy County, just off of Arkansas 254 in the Chimes-Trace Ridge Area south of Marshall. The Searcy County sheriff says two people from a lumber mill came into a remote forest area to look at the timber tracts. They were disturbed by what they found: dozens of dead dogs scattered throughout the woods. John Magruder still can't believe his eyes, two days later. He's shelter manager for the Searcy County Humane Society. It's difficult to look at the bullet riddled bodies and consider their innocent lives. Magruder wasn't there to gawk, however. He was looking for survivors. \\"I don't really have any words for what it makes me feel like. I've worked with dogs all my life and I love them a whole bunch and I just don't deal well with this, but I'm doing my best so I can save the ones I can,\\" said Magruder. The sheriff is also shocked. \\"This is my first in 25 years of law enforcement I've never seen anything like this,\\" said Sheriff Joey Pruitt. No one lives in the timber land where the massacre occurred. The sheriff thinks someone brought the dogs out here, fed them poison, and opened fire. \\"Systematically just start shooting and just leaving them lying and not even making sure that they're dead. I just can't imagine somebody doing that,\\" Pruitt said. The sheriff and state investigators recovered evidence, but they're still processing the massive crime scene. No suspects have been named, but the sheriff does want to reassure the public, \\"I don't think they're stealing people's pets.\\" So far 56 dogs have been found either poisoned and/or shot to death. Another dog that was shot and wounded had to be put down by a game warden, bringing the total to 57. Magruder says there was no hope of saving the dog that had to be euthanized because of its injuries. A few dogs survived. That's why Magruder was out in the forest for the third day in a row. He had a dog travel crate, and a bag of food. He's been feeding survivors and trying to lure and rescue them. One female was too skittish to approach the food. She lurked in the woods, but didn't stray from her murdered pack. Magruder already rescued four other dogs and took them back to the Searcy County Humane Society shelter. \\"We caught these two little female dogs. We brought them in this morning. This dog in here has been shot,\\" said Magruder. Only one of the male dogs is recovering from a bullet. It passed through the shoulder and is beginning to heal. Magruder checked on him, \\"You doing okay, Bubba?\\" \\"They could have found homes for these dogs. Why? Just why?\\" asked Jean Passmore, the Humane Society treasurer. Her emotions are raw and she broke into tears while discussing the crime. The people of this Humane Society are trying to channel their anger into nursing the survivors back to health. Magruder says three of the four rescued survivors were skittish and difficult to catch. One little dog came right to Magruder, though, eager for love. \\"He saw us, and that I had a bag of treats, and he took a treat and he was in the truck (immediately). He said, 'I've had enough of this,'\\" Magruder said. Soon, he'll be up for adoption. \\"Who could hurt him? Why would you hurt him?\\" The Searcy County Humane Society can be reached at 870-448-5579. It also has a list of pets ready for adoption on its Facebook page. Magruder and Passmore say they need donations to help cover medical costs and maintenance of the shelter. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"A deeply distressing incident occurred in Searcy County, Arkansas, where around 60 dogs were found shot to death in a remote forest area.

For much of his career, Ra led \\"The Arkestra\\", an ensemble with an ever-changing name and flexible line-up. Born and raised in Alabama, Blount eventually became involved in the Chicago jazz scene during the 1940s. He soon abandoned his birth name, taking the name Sun Ra (after Ra, the Egyptian God of the Sun) and developing a complex persona and mythology that would make him a pioneer of Afrofuturism: he claimed he was an alien from Saturn on a mission to preach peace, and throughout his life he consistently denied any ties to his prior identity. After the move to New York, Sun Ra and company plunged headlong into the experimentalism that they had only hinted at in Chicago. The music was often extremely loud and the Arkestra grew to include multiple drummers and percussionists. In recordings of this era, Ra began to use new technologies--such as extensive use of tape delay--to assemble spatial sound pieces that were far removed from earlier compositions such as Saturn. Recordings and live performances often featured passages for unusual instrumental combinations, and passages of collective playing that incorporated free improvisation. It is often difficult to tell where compositions end and improvisations begin. In this era, Sun Ra began conducting using hand and body gestures. This system inspired cornetist Butch Morris, who later developed his own more highly refined way to conduct improvisers. Though often associated with avant-garde jazz, Sun Ra did not believe his work could be classified as \\"free music\\": \\"I have to make sure that every note, every nuance, is correct... If you want to call it that, spell it p-h-r-e, because ph is a definite article and re is the name of the sun. So I play phre music - music of the sun.\\" Seeking to broaden his compositional possibilities, Sun Ra insisted all band members double on various percussion instruments - predating world music by drawing on various ethnic musical forms - and most saxophonists became multireedists, adding instruments such as flutes, oboes, or clarinets to their arsenals. In this era, Sun Ra was among the first of any musicians to make extensive and pioneering use of synthesizers and other various electronic keyboards; he was given a prototype Minimoog by its inventor, Robert Moog. According to the Bob Moog Foundation: \\"Sun Ra first met Robert Moog after Downbeat journalist and Sun Ra acquaintance Tam Fiofori arranged for a visit to Moog's factory in Trumansburg in the Fall of 1969....it was during this visit that Moog loaned Sun Ra a prototype Minimoog (Model B), several months before the commercial instrument (Model D) was introduced in March 1970. Ra immediately added the instrument to his repertoire of keyboards, later acquired a second, and featured the Minimoog prominently on many of his recordings of the early 1970s.\\" Notable titles from this period include The Magic City, Cosmic Tones for Mental Therapy, When Sun Comes Out, The Heliocentric Worlds of Sun Ra, Volume One, Atlantis, Secrets of the Sun and Other Planes of There. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What are some other interesting aspects about this article?","output":"There are several interesting aspects of Sun Ra's life and career mentioned in the article. Here are a few highlights: 1. Influence of Afrofuturism: Sun Ra was a pioneer of Afrofuturism, a cultural movement that combines African Diaspora culture, science fiction, and technology. As a part of this, he developed a complex persona and mythology, claiming he was an alien from Saturn on a mission to preach peace. 2. Ever-changing Arkestra: Throughout his career, Sun Ra led an ensemble called \\"The Arkestra,\\" which constantly changed its name and lineup. This reflects his dedication to constant innovation and exploration. 3. Use of new technologies: Sun Ra was among the first musicians to make extensive use of synthesizers and other electronic keyboards. He was given a prototype Minimoog synthesizer by its inventor, Robert Moog, and featured it prominently in many of his early 1970s recordings. 4. Conducting through gestures: Sun Ra began conducting his ensemble using hand and body gestures, inspiring other musicians like cornetist Butch Morris to develop their own systems of conducting. 5. Pioneering different musical styles: Sun Ra's work experimented with different styles, including avant-garde jazz, world music, and free improvisation. He insisted that all band members double on various percussion instruments and become multireedists, broadening their musical capabilities. 6. Prolific output and theatrical performances: Along with his innovative approach to music, Sun Ra was known for his prolific output and engaging theatrical performances, which added another dimension to his unique persona and universal appeal."},{"instruction":"Available choices: -- are seen walking around and giving the dog a bath as well as the girl doing various tricks with the dog. -- are seen walking and playing with dogs followed by a man speaking to the camera and text across the screen. -- play near her while the dog plays with her. -- are seen throwing around baseball games with one another and others helping.Choose from options above and answer: What most naturally follows?

By 1810, the population had grown to 80,000 before declining dramatically between 1829 and 1842 during the reigns of Radama I and especially Ranavalona I. Because of a combination of war, forced labor, disease and harsh measures of justice, the population of Imerina fell from 750,000 to 130,000 during this period. In the final years of the Kingdom of Imerina, the population had recovered to between 50,000 and 75,000; most of the population were slaves who were largely captured in provincial military campaigns. In 1950, Antananarivos population was around 175,000. By the late 1990s the population of the metropolitan area had reached 1.4 million, and – while the city itself now has a population (2013) of about 1,300,000 – with suburbs lying outside the city limits it had grown to almost 2.1 million in 2013. The metropolitan area is thus home to 10 percent of the islands residents.

Neil didn't think that Derrick should pay for the damage to their car, because OPTIONS: -Neil was at fault.. -Derrick was at fault..","output":"Neil didn't think that Derrick should pay for the damage to their car, because Neil was at fault. That cloudy Saturday afternoon, Neil and Derrick had been returning from a local basketball match. As always, they were both fully absorbed in discussing the game's highlights, dissecting each play and celebrating their team's victory. Neil was the driver, and Derrick the designated copilot. Due to their intense conversation, Neil didn't notice the sharp turn until it was too late. In an attempt to prevent their car from dipping into the adjacent ditch, he instinctively jerked the steering wheel too hard, causing him to lose control of the vehicle. The car drifted off the road, scraping against the thick, unforgiving branches of the dense hedgerows that lined the route. They were both mostly unharmed but shaken by the incident. They had been fortunate that there was nobody else on the road at the time, but the impact of the car with the hedgerow had left significant damage, the scratches and dents on the car's bodywork attesting to the vehemence of the crash. After assessing the extent of the damage, Derrick had suggested that they split the cost of the repairs. But Neil couldn't bear the thought of burdening his friend with additional expenses, especially since it was he who'd been behind the wheel. He tried to argue his case, insisting on taking full responsibility for the accident and bearing the brunt of the costs. \\"I was the one driving, Derrick. Really, I should be the one to pay. If I had paid closer attention to the road, we wouldn't be caught in this situation,\\" Neil explained, feeling his cheeks burn with embarrassment. Derrick, however, refused to give in. \\"Man, come on! We were both at fault here,\\" he argued, clapping Neil on the back in a rare, vulnerable display of camaraderie. \\"You wouldn't be so distracted if I hadn't been yammering on about the game the whole way. It's only fair that I help out with the expenses.\\" The two friends stood by the side of the road for a good while, each stubborn in their stance and neither one willing to let the other shoulder the blame entirely. Their voices rose and fell, ricocheting between frustration and dogged determination, as their breaths formed misty clouds in the cold air around them. Realizing that standing by their mangled vehicle wouldn't resolve the matter, Neil suggested they call a tow truck and head back to their shared apartment. But the conversation would continue intermittently for the next couple of days, each time the subject of the damaged car came up. Determined to hold himself accountable, Neil took it upon himself to do the research, seeking out the best local workshop to have the car repaired, and spend time comparing quotes in order to settle on the most affordable and reputable option. One evening later that week, Derrick approached Neil after dinner, seeming more solemn than usual. \\"Look, bud,\\" he said softly, \\"I know you want to do right by me, but the car was ours to begin with. We're a team, Neil, and we share everything – good and bad. So, why don't we just flip a coin and let fate decide who pays for it? That way, it's out of our hands.\\" Neil looked at his friend, contemplating his words, then finally conceded with a nod. \\"Alright, Derrick. Let's do it your way. Heads, I pay; tails, you pay,\\" he said, drawing a deep breath. Derrick produced a worn, silver coin from his pocket and flipped it. As it spun through the air, Neil knew that whatever the result, their friendship would remain strong; after all, they were a team, and that meant sticking together through triumph and adversity alike."},{"instruction":"Write a dialog based on this summary: Kate can't open the link Andy has sent. .","output":"Step 1: Start the dialog with a message from Andy to Kate sending the link Andy: Hey Kate, check out this link I came across: www.examplelink.com.

His death opened the road to court for the young painter Diego Velázquez from Sevilla . - Jan van Eyck (before c. 1390 9 July 1441) was a Flemish/Netherlandish painter active in Bruges. He is often considered one of the founders of Early Netherlandish painting school and one of the most significant representatives of Northern Renaissance art. The few surviving records of his early life indicate that he was born c. 13801390, most likely in Maaseik. He took employment in the Hague as painter and \\"Valet de chambre\\" with John III the Pitiless, ruler of Holland and Hainaut in the Hague around 1422, when he was already a master painter with workshop assistants. After John's death in 1425 he was employed in Lille as court painter to Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, until 1429 before moving to Bruges, where he lived until his death. He was highly regarded by Philip, and undertook a number of diplomatic visits abroad, including to Lisbon in 1428 to explore the possibility of a marriage contract between the duke and Isabella of Portugal. - The House of Habsburg, also called House of Hapsburg, or House of Austria, was one of the most influential royal houses of Europe. The throne of the Holy Roman Empire was continuously occupied by the Habsburgs between 1438 and 1740. The house also produced emperors and kings of the Kingdom of Bohemia, Kingdom of England (\\"Jure uxoris\\" King), Kingdom of France (Queen consort), Kingdom of Germany, Kingdom of Hungary, Kingdom of Croatia, Second Mexican Empire, Kingdom of Ireland (\\"Jure uxoris\\" King), Kingdom of Portugal, and Habsburg Spain, as well as rulers of several Dutch and Italian principalities. From the sixteenth century, following the reign of Charles V, the dynasty was split between its Austrian and Spanish branches. Although they ruled distinct territories, they nevertheless maintained close relations and frequently intermarried. - A portrait is a painting, photograph, sculpture, or other artistic representation of a person, in which the face and its expression is predominant. The intent is to display the likeness, personality, and even the mood of the person. For this reason, in photography a portrait is generally not a snapshot, but a composed image of a person in a still position. A portrait often shows a person looking directly at the painter or photographer, in order to most successfully engage the subject with the viewer. - Alonso Sánchez Coello (1531 8 August 1588) was a Spanish portrait painter of the Spanish Renaissance. He is mainly known for his portrait paintings executed in a style, which combines the objectivity of the Flemish tradition with the sensuality of Venetian painting. He was court painter to Philip II. - Diego Rodríguez de Silva y Velázquez (; baptized on June 6, 1599August 6, 1660) was a Spanish painter, the leading artist in the court of King Philip IV, and one of the most important painters of the Spanish Golden Age. He was an individualistic artist of the contemporary Baroque period, important as a portrait artist. In addition to numerous renditions of scenes of historical and cultural significance, he painted scores of portraits of the Spanish royal family, other notable European figures, and commoners, culminating in the production of his masterpiece \\"Las Meninas\\" (1656). - The Baroque (or ) is often thought of as a period of artistic style that used exaggerated motion and clear, easily interpreted detail to produce drama, tension, exuberance, and grandeur in sculpture, painting, architecture, literature, dance, theater, and music. The style began around 1600 in Rome and Italy, and spread to most of Europe. - Juan Pantoja de La Cruz (1553 26 October 1608) was a Spanish painter, one of the best representatives of the Spanish school of court painters. He worked for Philip II and Philip III. The Museo del Prado contains examples of his severe portraiture style. - Philip III of Spain (14 April 1578 31 March 1621) was King of Spain (as \\"Philip III\\" in Castile and \\"Philip II\\" in Aragon) and Portugal. A member of the House of Habsburg, Philip III was born in Madrid to King Philip II of Spain and his fourth wife and niece Anna, the daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II and Maria of Spain. Philip III later married his cousin Margaret of Austria, sister of Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor. - The Prado Museum is the main Spanish national art museum, located in central Madrid. It features one of the world's finest collections of European art, dating from the 12th century to the early 20th century, based on the former Spanish Royal Collection, and unquestionably the best single collection of Spanish art. Founded as a museum of paintings and sculpture in 1819, it also contains important collections of other types of works. El Prado is one of the most visited sites in the world, and is considered one of the greatest museums of art in the world. The numerous works by Francisco de Goya, the single most extensively represented artist, as well as by Diego Velázquez, El Greco, Titian, Peter Paul Rubens and Hieronymus Bosch are some of the highlights of the collection. - A court painter was an artist who painted for the members of a royal or noble family, sometimes on a fixed salary and on an exclusive basis where the artist was not supposed to undertake other work. Especially in the late Middle Ages, they were often given the office of valet de chambre. Usually they were given a salary and formal title, and often a pension for life, though arrangements were highly variable. For the artist, a court appointment had the advantage of freeing them from the restriction of local painters' guilds, although in the Middle Ages and Renaissance they also often had to spend large amounts of time doing decorative work about the palace, and creating temporary works for court entertainments and displays. In England the role of Serjeant Painter was set up for this, leaving the \\"King's painter\\" (and the queen's) free to paint mostly portraits. See category of \\"Italian art collectors\\" for lists that included non-aristocratic patrons. Some artists, like Jan van Eyck or Diego Velázquez, were used in other capacities at court, as diplomats, functionaries, or administrators. - Valet de chambre, or \\"varlet de chambre\\", was a court appointment introduced in the late Middle Ages, common from the 14th century onwards. Royal households had many persons appointed at any time. While some valets simply waited on the patron, or looked after his clothes and other personal needs, itself potentially a powerful and lucrative position, others had more specialized functions. At the most prestigious level it could be akin to a monarch or ruler's personal secretary, as was the case of Anne de Montmorency at the court of Francis I of France. For noblemen pursuing a career as courtiers, like Étienne de Vesc, it was a common early step on the ladder to higher offices. - The Spanish Golden Age (, \\"Golden Century\\") is a period of flourishing in arts and literature in Spain, coinciding with the political rise of the Spanish Habsburg dynasty. \\"El Siglo de Oro\\" does not imply precise dates and is usually considered to have lasted longer than an actual century. It begins no earlier than 1492, with the end of the \\"Reconquista\\" (Reconquest), the sea voyages of Christopher Columbus to the New World, and the publication of Antonio de Nebrija's \\"Gramática de la lengua castellana\\" (Grammar of the Castilian Language). Politically, it ends no later than 1659, with the Treaty of the Pyrenees, ratified between France and Habsburg Spain. The last great writer of the period, Pedro Calderón de la Barca, died in 1681, and his death usually is considered the end of \\"El Siglo de Oro\\" in the arts and literature. - In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages. - Las Meninas (Spanish for The Ladies-in-Waiting) is a 1656 painting in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, by Diego Velázquez, the leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age. Its complex and enigmatic composition raises questions about reality and illusion, and creates an uncertain relationship between the viewer and the figures depicted. Because of these complexities, \\"Las Meninas\\" has been one of the most widely analyzed works in Western painting. - Ferdinand II (9 July 1578 15 February 1637), a member of the House of Habsburg, was Holy Roman Emperor (16191637), King of Bohemia (16171619, 16201637), and King of Hungary (16181625). His acts started the Thirty Years' War. Ferdinand's aim, as a zealous Catholic, was to restore Catholicism as the only religion in the Empire and to suppress Protestantism. - The Spanish Renaissance refers to a movement in Spain, emerging from the Italian Renaissance in Italy during the 14th century, that spread to Spain during the 15th and 16th centuries. - Philip II of Spain (21 May 1527 13 September 1598), called \\"the Prudent\\" (el Prudente), was King of Spain (155698), King of Portugal (158198, as \\"Philip I\\", \\"Filipe I\\"), King of Naples and Sicily (both from 1554), and during his marriage to Queen Mary I (155458) \\"jure uxoris\\" King of England and Ireland.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Craft Context: Sarah Bailey (Robin Tunney), a troubled teenager, has just moved from San Francisco to Los Angeles with her father and stepmother. At her new school, she forms a friendship with a group of girls rumored to be witches, Bonnie (Neve Campbell), Nancy (Fairuza Balk) and Rochelle (Rachel True). At the same time, Sarah becomes attracted to the popular Chris (Skeet Ulrich). Bonnie, Nancy and Rochelle worship a powerful deity named \\"Manon\\". Sarah exhibits supernatural powers from the onset of the film (revealed to being a \\"natural witch,\\" i.e. born of a parent who practiced witchcraft) and her new friends believe that she will complete their coven, making them all-powerful. When Sarah is harassed by a vagrant with a snake (whom she had encountered before in her new house), he is immediately hit by a car and the girls believe that together they willed it to happen. After a date with Chris, Sarah is upset to learn that he has spread a false rumor that they had sex. When Sarah confronts him, he treats her disrespectfully in front of his friends. Sarah casts a love spell upon him; Rochelle casts a revenge spell on a hateful racist bully, Laura Lizzie (Christine Taylor); Bonnie casts a spell for beauty; and Nancy for liberation from working-class poverty.

He was among the first conductors born and educated in the US to receive worldwide acclaim. According to music critic Donal Henahan, he was \\"one of the most prodigiously talented and successful musicians in American history.\\" Context: While Bernstein was very well known for his music compositions and conducting, he was also known for his outspoken political views and his strong desire to further social change. His first aspirations for social change were made apparent in his producing (as a student) a recently banned opera, The Cradle Will Rock, by Marc Blitzstein, about the disparity between the working and upper class. His first opera, Trouble in Tahiti, was dedicated to Blitzstein and has a strong social theme, criticizing American civilization and suburban upper-class life in particular. As he went on in his career Bernstein would go on to fight for everything from the influences of \\"American Music\\" to the disarming of western nuclear weapons. Like many of his friends and colleagues, Bernstein had been involved in various left wing causes and organizations since the 1940s. He was blacklisted by the US State Department and CBS in the early 1950s, but unlike others his career was not greatly affected, and he was never required to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee. His political life received substantial press coverage though in 1970, due to a gathering hosted at his Manhattan apartment on January 14, 1970. Bernstein and his wife held the event seeking to raise awareness and money for the defense of several members of the Black Panther Party against a variety of charges. The New York Times initially covered the gathering as a lifestyle item, but later posted an editorial harshly unfavorable to Bernstein following generally negative reaction to the widely publicized story. This reaction culminated in June 1970 with the appearance of \\"Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny's\\", an essay by satirist Tom Wolfe featured on the cover of the magazine New York. The article contrasted the Bernsteins' comfortable lifestyle in one of the world's most expensive neighborhoods with the anti-establishment politics of the Black Panthers. It led to the popularization of \\"radical chic\\" as a critical term. Both Bernstein and his wife Felicia responded to the criticism, arguing that they were motivated not by a shallow desire to express fashionable sympathy but by their concern for civil liberties. Bernstein was named in the book Red Channels: The Report of Communist Influence in Radio and Television (1950) as a Communist along with Aaron Copland, Lena Horne, Pete Seeger, Artie Shaw and other prominent figures of the performing arts. Red Channels was issued by the right-wing journal Counterattack and was edited by Vincent Hartnett, who was later found to have libeled and defamed the noted radio personality John Henry Faulk. Question: What was Bernstein's involvement with social activism?. Whats the answer?","output":"Leonard Bernstein's involvement with social activism was an integral part of his life and career. As a musician who achieved significant international success, he also used his platform to advocate for social change, address disparities between different social groups, and support various left-wing causes. His journey as a social activist began with his early aspirations during his student days when he produced a recently banned opera, 'The Cradle Will Rock', by Marc Blitzstein. The opera dealt with the disparity between the working and upper class, reflecting Bernstein's commitment to addressing social issues through art. Bernstein's first opera, 'Trouble in Tahiti', was dedicated to Blitzstein and carried a strong social theme, criticizing American civilization and suburban upper-class life. Throughout his career, he continued to fight for various causes such as the influence of American music and the disarmament of western nuclear weapons. Bernstein's association with left-wing causes and organizations since the 1940s led to his blacklisting by the US State Department and CBS in the early 1950s. Despite this, his career remained largely unaffected, and he never had to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee. A significant event in his political life was hosting a gathering at his Manhattan apartment on January 14, 1970, along with his wife. The event aimed to raise awareness and funds for the defense of several members of the Black Panther Party who faced multiple charges. The New York Times covered the gathering, and the subsequent backlash led to the publication of Tom Wolfe's essay, \\"Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny's.\\" The piece juxtaposed the Bernsteins' luxurious lifestyle with the anti-establishment politics of the Black Panthers, leading to the popularization of \\"radical chic\\" as a critical term. Despite the criticism, Leonard Bernstein and his wife Felicia defended their actions, emphasizing their concern for civil liberties as the driving force behind their support for the Black Panther Party. Bernstein also found himself named alongside other prominent figures in the book 'Red Channels: The Report of Communist Influence in Radio and Television' (1950), published by the right-wing journal Counterattack and edited by Vincent Hartnett. The publication accused Bernstein and others of being involved in communism, further exemplifying his continuous commitment to social activism throughout his life and career."},{"instruction":"Please answer this question: who gave the address to the nation on the challenger disaster in january 1986?","output":"To answer this question, I will need to search for information regarding the Challenger Disaster in January 1986 and identify who delivered the address to the nation.

A trace of childish innocence in his face gives the lanky Bethlehem lawyer a Jimmy Stewart-like quality of quiet trust. In black jeans and button-down shirt, he's a kind of folk hero in the south Bethlehem melting pot where he's crafted a law practice catering to working-class families - mostly Latino - in the shadow of the hulkish remnants of Bethlehem Steel. A two-hour drive away, at City University of New York Law School in Queens, Rooney spends several days a week helping upstart lawyers develop storefront practices that, like his, provide legal representation to folks who can't afford a 250-an-hour legal counselor. Kristin Booth Glen, the law school's dean, took one look at Rooney and knew he was the right person to head the innovative Community Legal Resources Network. ''Fred's so low-key, he's Midwestern in effect,'' says Glen, a former New York Supreme Court judge. ''He captivates people, he inspires loyalty.'' For bringing legal representation to the poor and a host of other social causes, including finding medical care for seriously ill children in Latin America, the Moravian College Alumni Association has chosen Rooney for its prestigious Haupert Humanitarian Award. The award, given to only a select few alumni, will be presented at 7:30 tonight at a reception on Moravian's Priscilla Payne Hurd campus. Moravian, where he was an undergraduate in the early 1970s, inspired Rooney's deep sense of social justice. The son of a Bethlehem Steel executive in New York, he came to the Bethlehem campus from an affluent upbringing on Long Island. The young Rooney might have set his sights on Washington, D.C., like his uncle, former U.S. Rep. Fred Rooney of Bethlehem. After all, politics run in the Rooney family. His brother, state Rep. T.J. Rooney of Bethlehem, is a power in the state Legislature and the Democratic Party. But on a trip to Colombia when he was a junior at Moravian, the child of privilege saw human suffering, malnutrition and poverty the likes of which he had never imagined. ''I couldn't understand why we live this way and they live that way,'' Rooney recalled. ''It's been the guiding light of my life ever since.'' After graduating in CUNY Law School's first class in 1986, he took a job with Lehigh Valley Legal Services.

While placing a potato in other locations such as a pantry, vegetable soup, pot, or shopping bags might be harmless or even appropriate in the case of storage or cooking, putting a potato in the exhaust pipe of a vehicle has the potential to cause damage or an explosion. Here's why: An exhaust pipe serves a crucial function in a vehicle's operation; it is designed to expel noxious gases, such as carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides, produced by the combustion process inside the engine. By allowing these gases to escape, an exhaust pipe helps to decrease the engine's temperature and reduce pollution. Inserting a potato into an exhaust pipe blocks the gas flow and creates considerable back pressure, affecting the engine's performance. As the potato blocks the pipe, exhaust gases are forced back into the engine itself due to the increased pressure. This can lead to several issues, including: 1. Damage to the vehicle's engine: The increased back pressure can cause the engine's internal components, such as the pistons, cylinder walls, valves, gaskets, or catalytic converter, to suffer damage or become worn. 2. Loss of engine power: The impaired exhaust flow caused by the potato obstruction means that the engine will struggle to expel gases as it should. This results in reduced power output and the engine working harder to function properly. 3. Overheating of the engine: As the exhaust gases are not being expelled efficiently, the engine's temperature can rise rapidly, which may lead to overheating or ultimately a complete engine breakdown. 4. Potential explosion: Although it might not always result in an explosion, having a potato in the exhaust pipe dramatically increases the risk. If the pressure reaches a dangerous level and affects the engine's essential components, such as the fuel or electrical systems, it could result in a spontaneous combustion or explosion. In summary, placing a potato in an exhaust pipe can cause significant damage to a vehicle's engine, leading to engine failure, overheating, or even an explosion. Thus, it is strongly advised not to insert foreign objects into an exhaust pipe as it puts your safety and the vehicle's performance at risk."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: A text is given in Bengali.

It is known that Birger grew up and spent his adolescence in Bjälbo, Östergötland but the exact date of his birth remains uncertain and available historical sources are contradictory. Examinations of his mortal remains indicate that he was probably about 50 upon his death in 1266 which would indicate a birth around 1216. However, his father Magnus Minnesköld is assumed to have died no later than 1210, which would lead to an assumed birth a few years earlier. Under any circumstance, he was the son of Ingrid Ylva, who according to Olaus Petri was a daughter of Sune Sik and granddaughter of King Sverker I of Sweden, which would make Birger a matrilineal member of the House of Sverker. His brothers or half-brothers Eskil, Karl, and Bengt were all born long before 1200, and it can therefore be assumed that they had another mother. He was also a nephew of the jarl Birger Brosa from the House of Bjelbo.

People who have a homosexual sexual orientation that does not align with their sexual identity are sometimes referred to as 'closeted'. The term may, however, reflect a certain cultural context and particular stage of transition in societies which are gradually dealing with integrating sexual minorities. In studies related to sexual orientation, when dealing with the degree to which a person's sexual attractions, behaviors and identity match, scientists usually use the terms concordance or discordance. Thus, a woman who is attracted to other women, but calls herself heterosexual and only has sexual relations with men, can be said to experience discordance between her sexual orientation (homosexual or lesbian) and her sexual identity and behaviors (heterosexual).

Among these cells, one of the most noteworthy characteristics is the high density of chloroplasts found within them, enabling the cactus to efficiently carry out photosynthesis and convert sunlight into energy. Photosynthesis is a vital process for plants, as it allows them to convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen. Chloroplasts are the organelles responsible for this process, and therefore, they play a pivotal role in the plant's overall survival and growth. In the case of cacti, these plants have evolved to live in environments with limited water and extreme temperatures, so their cells must be highly specialized to maximize their energy production and storage, while minimizing water loss. The chloroplasts contained within the parenchyma cells of a cactus are a key adaptation that enables this plant to survive in such conditions. Here are some of the ways in which the chloroplasts contribute to the cactus' unique survival strategies: 1. Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) Photosynthesis: One significant adaptation found in cacti is their ability to undergo a specialized form of photosynthesis called CAM. This process allows the plants to open their stomata (pores on the leaf surface) at night to absorb carbon dioxide while keeping them closed during the day to minimize water loss through transpiration. The chloroplasts in the cactus' parenchyma cells play an essential role in this process by storing the carbon dioxide as malate, a four-carbon compound, which is later used for the production of glucose during the day. 2. High chloroplast density: The parenchyma cells in cacti contain a higher density of chloroplasts than many other plants. This allows them to carry out photosynthesis more efficiently and maximize the amount of energy harvested from sunlight. In addition, the arrangement of the chloroplasts within the cells optimizes their exposure to light by positioning them close to the cell walls. 3. Storage of water and nutrients: The parenchyma cells in cacti are particularly large and are capable of storing significant amounts of water and nutrients. This, along with their large central vacuole, enables the plant to survive long periods of drought and extreme temperatures. The chloroplasts within these cells contribute to the production of energy and the synthesis of essential nutrients, such as sugars, proteins, and other organic compounds necessary for the plant's survival. In conclusion, cacti house a great amount of specialized parenchyma cells containing a high density of chloroplasts. These chloroplasts play a central role in the plant's adaptations specific to arid and extreme environments. They facilitate the unique photosynthetic processes, including the highly efficient CAM photosynthesis, providing the cactus with the energy and nutrients necessary to thrive in its harsh surroundings."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: John ran very fast, his feet touched the ground in what way?

Design of the MILAN started in 1962, it was ready for trials in 1971, and was accepted for service in 1972. It is a wire guided SACLOS (semi-automatic command to line-of-sight) missile, which means the sight of the launch unit has to be aimed at the target to guide the missile. The MILAN can be equipped with a MIRA or MILIS thermal sight to give it night-firing ability. - Pope Pius XII, born Eugenio Maria Giuseppe Giovanni Pacelli (2 March 18769 October 1958), reigned as Pope from 2 March 1939 to his death in 1958. Before his election to the papacy, Pacelli served as secretary of the Department of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs, papal nuncio to Germany (19171929), and Cardinal Secretary of State, in which capacity he worked to conclude treaties with European and Latin American nations, most notably the \\"Reichskonkordat\\" with Nazi Germany, with which most historians believe the Vatican sought to protect the Church in Germany while Adolf Hitler sought the destruction of \\"political Catholicism\\". A pre-war critic of Nazism, Pius XII lobbied world leaders to avoid war and, as Pope at the outbreak of war, issued \\"Summi Pontificatus\\", expressing dismay at the invasion of Poland, reiterating Church teaching against racial persecution and calling for love, compassion and charity to prevail over war. - Pope Pius XI, born Ambrogio Damiano Achille Ratti (31 May 1857 10 February 1939), reigned as Pope from 6 February 1922 to his death in 1939. He was the first sovereign of Vatican City from its creation as an independent state on 11 February 1929. He took as his papal motto, \\"Pax Christi in Regno Christi,\\" translated \\"The Peace of Christ in the Kingdom of Christ.\\" - Francis Konrad Schuckardt ( July 10 , 1937 -- November 5 , 2006 ) was an American Traditionalist Catholic independent bishop and the first known bishop of the sedevacantist movement in the United States . Sedevacantism holds that Pope Paul VI -- sometimes going back to include John XXIII -- and his successors are not valid Popes . Schuckardt founded the Congregation of Mary Immaculate Queen ( CMRI ) and the Tridentine Latin Rite Catholic Church ( TLRCC ) . - The Congregation of Mary Immaculate Queen (CMRI) (Latin: \\"Congregatio Mariae Reginae Immaculatae\\") is a Sedevacantist Traditionalist Catholic religious congregation that rejects the authority of the recent Popes, including Benedict XVI and Francis, and is dedicated to promoting the message of Our Lady of Fátima and devotion to the Virgin Mary according to the teachings of St. Louis-Marie Grignion de Montfort (1673-1716), whom they regard as their spiritual founder. Over the years, the Congregation has also been known as the Fatima Crusaders and Oblates of Mary Immaculate Queen of the Universe. - Traditionalist Catholics are members of the Catholic Church who believe that there should be a restoration of many or all of the customs, traditions, liturgical forms, public and private devotions and presentations of the teaching of the Church before the Second Vatican Council (196265). They are commonly associated with an attachment to the Eucharistic liturgy often called the Tridentine, Traditional Latin or extraordinary form of the Mass. - Our Lady of Fátima (formally known as Our Lady of the Holy Rosary of Fátima \\"\\" ), is a Roman Catholic title of the Blessed Virgin Mary based on the famed Marian apparitions reported in 1917 by three shepherd children at the Cova da Iria, in Fátima, Portugal. The three little children were Lúcia Santos and her cousins Jacinta and Francisco Marto. - Pope Paul VI, born Giovanni Battista Enrico Antonio Maria Montini (26 September 1897 6 August 1978), reigned as Pope from 21 June 1963 to his death in 1978. Succeeding Pope John XXIII, he continued the Second Vatican Council which he closed in 1965, implementing its numerous reforms, and fostered improved ecumenical relations with Eastern Orthodox and Protestants, which resulted in many historic meetings and agreements. Montini served in the Vatican's Secretariat of State from 1922 to 1954. While in the Secretariat of State, Montini and Domenico Tardini were considered as the closest and most influential colleagues of Pope Pius XII, who in 1954 named him Archbishop of Milan, the largest Italian diocese. Montini later became the Secretary of the Italian Bishops Conference. John XXIII elevated him to the College of Cardinals in 1958, and after the death of John XXIII, Montini was considered one of his most likely successors. - In ecclesiastical heraldry, papal coats of arms (those of individual popes) and those of the Holy See and Vatican City State include an image of crossed keys to represent the metaphorical keys of the office of Saint Peter, the keys of heaven, or the keys of the kingdom of Heaven, that, according to Roman Catholic teaching, Jesus promised to Saint Peter, empowering him to take binding actions. In the Gospel of Matthew , Jesus says to Peter, \\"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven.\\" The keys of heaven or keys of Saint Peter are seen as a symbol of papal authority: \\"Behold he [Peter] received the keys of the kingdom of heaven, the power of binding and loosing is committed to him, the care of the whole Church and its government is given to him [cura ei totius Ecclesiae et principatus committitur (Epist., lib. V, ep. xx, in P.L., LXXVII, 745)]\\". - The Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with more than 1.27 billion members worldwide. As one of the oldest religious institutions in the world, it has played a prominent role in the history of Western civilisation. Headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the pope, its doctrines are summarised in the Nicene Creed. The Catholic Church is notable within Western Christianity for its sacred tradition and seven sacraments. - Jesus (; c. 4 BC c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church. - Pope Saint John XXIII (born Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli, ; 25 November 18813 June 1963) reigned as Pope from 28 October 1958 to his death in 1963 and was canonized on 27 April 2014. Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli was the fourth of fourteen children born to a family of sharecroppers who lived in a village in Lombardy. He was ordained to the priesthood on 10 August 1904 and served in a number of posts, including papal nuncio in France and a delegate to Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey. In a consistory on 12 January 1953 Pope Pius XII made Roncalli a cardinal as the Cardinal-Priest of Santa Prisca in addition to naming him as the Patriarch of Venice. - The College of Cardinals, formerly styled Sacred College of Cardinals, is the body of all cardinals of the Catholic Church. Functions. A function of the college is to advise the pope about church matters when he summons them to an ordinary consistory, a term derived from the Roman Emperor's crown council. It also attends various functions as a matter of protocol, for example, during the canonization process. It also convenes on the death or resignation of a pope as a papal conclave to elect a successor, but is then restricted to eligible Cardinals under the age limit, which was set for the first time in 1970 by Pope Paul VI at 80. - The Nicene Creed (Greek: or, , Latin: \\"\\") is a Symbol of faith widely used in Christian liturgy. - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. - Domenico Tardini (29 February 1888 30 July 1961) was a longtime aide to Pope Pius XII in the Secretariat of State.

In natural systems, gases are normally present as a mixture of different types of molecules. For example, the atmosphere consists of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and other gaseous molecules, and this gaseous mixture exerts a certain pressure referred to as atmospheric pressure (Table 22.2). Partial pressure (Px) is the pressure of a single type of gas in a mixture of gases. For example, in the atmosphere, oxygen exerts a partial pressure, and nitrogen exerts another partial pressure, independent of the partial pressure of oxygen (Figure 22.21). Total pressure is the sum of all the partial pressures of a gaseous mixture. Dalton’s law describes the behavior of nonreactive gases in a gaseous mixture and states that a specific gas type in a mixture exerts its own pressure; thus, the total pressure exerted by a mixture of gases is the sum of the partial pressures of the gases in the mixture.

The city has a population of 1.26 million, while 1.68 million people live in its metropolitan area. The city is located at the foot of Vitosha Mountain in the western part of the country, within less than drive from the Serbian border. Its location in the centre of the Balkan peninsula means that it is the midway between the Black Sea and the Adriatic Sea, whereas the Aegean Sea is the closest to it. - The Adriatic Sea is a body of water separating the Italian Peninsula from the Balkan peninsula and the Apennine Mountains from the Dinaric Alps and adjacent ranges. The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate. - Vitosha, the ancient \\"Scomius\\" or \\"Scombrus\\", is a mountain massif, on the outskirts of Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. Vitosha is one of the symbols of Sofia and the closest site for hiking, alpinism and skiing. Convenient bus lines and rope ways render the mountain easily accessible. Vitosha has the outlines of an enormous dome. The territory of the mountain includes Vitosha nature park that encompasses the best known and most frequently visited parts. The foothills of Vitosha shelter resort quarters of Sofia; Knyazhevo quarter has mineral springs. Vitosha is the oldest nature park in the Balkans. The mountain emerged as a result of volcanic activity and has been subsequently shaped by the slow folding of the granite rock layers and a series of gradual uplifts of the area. It appears dome shaped at first sight, but the mountain, 19 km long by 17 km wide, actually consists of concentric denudational plateaus rising in tiers one above the other. Vitosha is separated into four main parts whose main ridges gather at a crown known as \\"Cherni Vrah\\" (\\"\\"Black Peak\\"\\"). This is the highest point of the mountain at 2290 m and is one of 10 peaks of Vitosha over 2000 m in height. - Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage.

Answer:","output":"The entity 'Lyulin Mountain' has the relation 'instance of' with the entity 'Mountain Range'. This relation signifies that 'Lyulin Mountain' is an example or individual representation of the broader category or 'class' of 'Mountain Range'.

Hacked: Candia Fisher, 64, of Manhattan, New York, is part of the Fisher Brothers real estate family and most of her business is conducted online. The thief posed as Ms Fisher and reportedly ordered her secretary to wire huge amounts of cash overseas to Australian banks at least six times. A financial secretary at the firm eventually questioned Ms Fisher about the transfers on Monday - but the billionaire was unaware of any of them. A company security investigator then called police. A source said Ms Fisher is always relying on emails for her business communications.

However, alarmed by the mounting losses of their spies, he is visited by the heads of the British ('M' or McTarry; John Huston), French (LeGrand; Charles Boyer), American (Ransome; William Holden) and Russian (Smernov; Kurt Kasznar) Secret Services (collectively driven by M's chauffer John LeMesurier), who petition him to return. He refuses, considering himself to belong to a nobler tradition, and them all gadget-ridden \\"jokeshop\\" spies, and deploring the handing on of his legend, name and number to a \\"sexual acrobat\\". Even a letter from the Queen does not sway him, and as a final desperate trick M signals for Sir James' home to be blown up by the Army: the attack also kills M (but not, apparently, the others).Smersh Authority (the villains) learns that \\"Sir James Bond is back, with his morals, his vows and his celibate image.

Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis The hypothesis states that \\"Falwell would say yes to that question, no matter what the Bible says.\\" This implies that Falwell's opinion is independent of the Bible's teachings. Step 3: Infer the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis Since the premise highlights an opinion held by Falwell-style Christians about the Antichrist, we must determine if this opinion is derived from or independent of the Bible. Step 4: Research Falwell's beliefs Falwell, a fundamentalist Christian preacher, founded the Moral Majority movement and was known for his strict interpretation of the Bible. His belief system can be assumed to be heavily reliant on Biblical teachings. Step 5: Compare Falwell's beliefs with the hypothesis Given Falwell's strong adherence to Biblical teachings, it is unlikely that he would hold an opinion independent of the Bible.

Step 2: Finding appropriate translations: - \\"Speaking of\\" can be translated into Czech as \\"Když už jsme u toho\\". - \\"uh\\" can be translated into Czech as \\"ehm\\" or left untranslated since it doesn't carry any significant meaning. - \\"San Diego\\" remains the same, as it is a proper noun. Step 3: Reconstructing the sentence in Czech: Combining the translations and maintaining the order: \\"Když už jsme u toho, ehm... San Diego...\\" This translation conveys the same meaning as the original phrase: \\"Speaking of, uh... San Diego...\\""},{"instruction":"Select the correct answer: Which is an appropriate title for this article?

World (ii). Sports (iii). Business (iv). Science/Tech","output":"The appropriate title for this article falls into category (iii). Business. The reason for selecting this category as the appropriate title for this article is that the content and context of the news report revolves around two major pharmaceutical companies, Merck and Pfizer, and the stock market implications of their featured drugs. The use of stock market symbols (such as MRK:NYSE and PFE:NYSE) indicates that the central theme is related to the financial impact of the events. The article discusses how the shares of Merck fell after an FDA study revealed that its Vioxx arthritis drug increased the risk of heart attacks in users when compared to Pfizer's competing product. This type of news information is particularly important to investors and market analysts as it may impact their decision-making regarding stock purchases, sales, and their overall investment strategies. The other options provided do not correspond with the content of the article as closely as the Business category: (i). World - This category is usually focused on international news and global events, whereas this article predominantly concerns two pharmaceutical companies and their drugs' performances which are more business-oriented. (ii). Sports - The content of the article does not have any direct relation to sports or athletic endeavors, making this option irrelevant. (iv). Science/Tech - Although the article does discuss a scientific study, the primary emphasis is on the financial impact and the stock market consequences rather than the scientific details of the drugs themselves. Thus, the Business category is still more relevant. Therefore, the correct answer is (iii). Business, as the central theme of the article revolves around the stock market performance of two pharmaceutical companies and their respective medications."},{"instruction":"Q:You are given a new situation: Jacob and Thomas were conducting an experiment in a chemistry class. The goal of the experiment was to identify the strength of unknown acids by examining the products formed in a chemical reaction. After they completed the experiment, Jacob concluded that he was given a strong acid, while Thomas concluded that he was given a weak acid. and a hint : The stronger of two acids will have a higher Ka than the weaker acid; the ratio of hydrogen ions to acid will be higher for the stronger acid as the stronger acid has a greater tendency to lose its proton. Because the range of possible values for Ka spans many orders of magnitude, a more manageable constant, pKa is more frequently used, where pKa = −log10 Ka. Stronger acids have a smaller pKa than weaker acids. Experimentally determined pKa at 25 °C in aqueous solution are often quoted in textbooks and reference material. Please answer this question : Which person's acid, Jacob's or Thomas's, will have a lower ratio of hydrogen ions to acid? A:","output":"To answer the question, let's first go step by step through the given information: 1. Jacob concluded that he was given a strong acid. 2. Thomas concluded that he was given a weak acid. 3. Stronger acids have a higher Ka (acid dissociation constant) than weaker acids. 4. Stronger acids have a higher ratio of hydrogen ions to acid. 5. Stronger acids have a smaller pKa value than weaker acids. Now, we know from the information above that Jacob has a strong acid and Thomas has a weak acid. Since stronger acids have a higher ratio of hydrogen ions to acid, Jacob's acid will have a higher ratio of hydrogen ions to acid compared to Thomas's acid. Hence, Thomas's acid will have a lower ratio of hydrogen ions to acid."},{"instruction":"Given the question: What key details about charley fusari can be extracted from the following bio?

Rep. Connie Mack hearts his iPhone. He just wishes his staff would show the love, too. When the Florida Republican began urging his aides to dump their government-issued BlackBerrys for government-issued iPhones, they mostly ignored him. Only Mack's chief of staff heeded Apple's siren call, making him and his boss two of just 86 iPhone users at work in the House of Representatives. Other aides still cling to the familiar, part of a sea of 9,140 BlackBerry stalwarts in the House. This disparity also holds true based on retail sales or a stroll along most any downtown block at lunchtime -- evidence that Washington's attachment to the sturdy, e-mail-focused BlackBerry has been unshakable. No matter that the flashier, more Web-friendly iPhone has reshaped the smartphone landscape, letting users trade contact information by simply bumping phones or find the nearest Chinese restaurant by taking a picture of a street. Although no one keeps a tally of government-issued BlackBerrys, they number in the tens of thousands, as evidenced by hordes of federal employees tapping away at them on the Metro. Even outside the Beltway, BlackBerrys still far outnumber iPhones. But the Steve Jobs creation, with its thousands of downloadable applications, overwhelmingly dominates the country's mobile Web usage. Which is why Mack and others are waging a get-with-it campaign to square the federal government with how the rest of the country consumes mobile data and ignores spouses and children at dinner. \\"There are people in my office who are bucking change,\\" acknowledged Mack, whose wife, Rep. Mary Bono Mack (R-Calif.), is also an iPhone enthusiast. \\"I think I can be persuasive. I'll let them decide on their own -- or I will force them. We're slow about adopting a lot of things in this town. But I can feel the change coming.\\" Evolving from an e-mail-obsessed BlackBerry town to a whiz-bang app town would represent a significant shift in how the government does business. A program that turns a phone into a document scanner would let government officials manage their work lives on the go. Instead of e-mailing back and forth with several colleagues, a group could conduct a four-way instant message chat in real time. The shift from centralized to decentralized, from action to interaction would flow to the thousands of companies across the region that do business with the federal government. \\"The iPhone introduced a new paradigm, the apps paradigm, and that paradigm is everything that matters now,\\" said tech guru Tim O'Reilly, who has been introducing apps developers to the people who run federal agencies. \\"But a lot of people in D.C. really love their BlackBerrys, and they have a strong relationship with them.\\" \\"Love\\" may be too shallow a word to describe this region's fixation with the BlackBerry, an addictive e-mail powerhouse that so far lacks the technological innards for the rich, data-heavy apps that have become so popular on other smartphones. (No, not just games in which people throw sheep at each other via their Facebook apps.) Washington is the country's eighth-largest metro region but the fourth-biggest user of BlackBerrys according to Localytics, which tracks mobile app usage. Best Buy sells more BlackBerrys in the Washington region than it does elsewhere, said Scott Anderson, the retailer's senior director of mobile merchants. Introduced in 1999, the BlackBerry was the first mobile device that could send secure e-mail outside the office, and law firms (there are a few around here, always hunting for more billable hours) quickly adopted the technology. The government joined in, making the BlackBerry an essential tool for communication. Summary:","output":"In Washington, the traditional preference for BlackBerry devices among government officials is being challenged by the growing popularity of iPhones. Florida Republican Rep. Connie Mack is urging his aides to switch to iPhones, but the uptake has so far been slow, with only Mack's chief of staff making the change. Out of the 9,140 BlackBerry users in the House of Representatives, only 86 have adopted iPhones. Despite BlackBerry devices dominating the Washington landscape, iPhones account for a larger volume of mobile web usage in the country, due to their downloadable applications. Shifting from a focus on email to a more app-centric approach could signify a change in the way government conducts business, but the strong relationship between Washington and BlackBerry may be hard to break."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot. If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: Who is the Adler's employer? Movie plot title: Sherlock Holmes Movie plot: The film begins during the German air raids in London in 1940. An elderly Dr. John Watson tells his nurse the tale of an unrecorded case he shared with his friend Sherlock Holmes. In 1882, Holmes and Watson investigate the shipwreck of a royal treasury ship which was destroyed by a monstrous giant octopus on the coast of Newhaven. They do not believe the first-hand accounts of the sole survivor of the attack, but nonetheless investigate. Inspector Lestrade states that he has recently had contact with Holmes's estranged brother Thorpe, a former partner of Lestrade's who was paralyzed during a bank robbery seven years prior. In Whitechapel, a young man is killed by a dinosaur. Watson is skeptical until he and Holmes discover the creature on their morning constitution. Finding escape, several more clues lead Holmes to deduce that the monsters are artificial, built by a criminal genius to acquire resources. On the case, the dinosaur steals a water pump operating a fountain and rolls of copper wire, presumably so Spring-Heeled Jack can create another monster. The octopus that destroyed the ship earlier is linked to the dinosaur because they are both similarly \\"exceptionally improbable\\". Lestrade accompanies Holmes and Watson during their investigation. On one of their leads, Lestrade ends up missing. Holmes's reasoning leads himself and Watson to an old castle in Helmsmouth he and his brother visited as children. They come across another monster, a masked mechanical man: Spring-Heeled Jack. Spring-Heeled Jack is revealed to be Holmes' brother, Thorpe, who also assumed the identity of a patient of Watson's. Inesidora Ivory, his accomplice, is with him. Thorpe explains that he built a mechanical suit to cure his paralysis, and he deduced that the crippling bullet ricocheted off a doorframe, fired by Lestrade. He plans to destroy London, assassinate Queen Victoria and force Lestrade to claim responsibility. Ivory is revealed to be one of Thorpe's creations and his lover, and she carries that will detonate when she...

And Dropbox CEO Drew Houston is banking that its new home-built infrastructure will help it save money and be more flexible when building new features. In March, Dropbox disclosed that, over the past few years, it had moved about 90% of its IT infrastructure off of Amazon amzn Web Services and into its own data centers. That migration seemed counterintuitive in an era when many companies are shutting down data centers or foregoing new ones in favor of putting their work into Amazon’s public cloud. “We’re planning for the long term, this was a foundational thing,” Houston said at Fortune’s Brainstorm Tech conference on Monday in Aspen, Co. He also stressed that, given the amount of data Dropbox handles it is somewhat unique in its IT needs. It also continues to use AWS for some tasks and for global reach. “It’s a big bet we placed,” Houston added speaking of the migration. “We went from zero to standing up one of the largest cloud infrastructures in the world.” That required moving several hundred petabytes of data from AWS to internal servers without users noticing. Houston and Dropbox chief operating officer Dennis Woodside said upcoming Dropbox features are tied to its data center migration. They include “Project Infinite,” which will let users view all their files from a device without actually downloading them. Cloud computing had a wild and wooly week. Dropbox will enable that via smart caching, Dropbox’s newfound ability to modify the data center hardware it uses is very different from what is allowed in the public cloud scenario, Woodside told Fortune before the talk on stage. Dropbox, of course, has lots of users who do not pay. Neither Houston nor Woodside would comment on what percentage of that 500 million number are active users. Paying customers, on the other hand, pay for either Dropbox Pro or Dropbox Business for cloud storage and file synchronization. Dropbox competes with Box, as well as products from software giantsMicrosoft, Google in this tightly contested market. The 200,000 number surfaced during a panel discussion on Monday. Dropbox Strengthens Mobile Support, Gets Closer to IBM “We are on track to pass the 200,000 teams mark for Dropbox Business, which was launched less than five years ago,” Woodside said before the event. “It took eight or nine years for Salesforce crm to get to 100,000 teams.” Dropbox, like many software companies of its era, got its start offering free or near-free software but is now is eager to show it can woo paying customers as well as it pushes towards profitability. The company claims big accounts including Hewlett-Packard Enterprise hpe , News Corp., and Expedia expe , which it says has 4,000 users on Dropbox. Woodside seems particularly proud of that account given that Expedia is a spin out of Microsoft msft . And more recently, the Washington Post has a few thousand users on Dropbox, he said. “What we see is significant growth especially in enterprise class companies. Our enterprise business selling into companies with over 1,000 employees has grown triple digits in past year,” Woodside said in an interview before the event. No specific numbers were forthcoming. Woodside also said that 52% of the Fortune 500 has paid Dropbox for a deployment of some kind, although would not comment on whether any of those deals were company wide. Dropbox claims its advantage is that it “plays well with all ecosystems.” That means Dropbox works well for users in the Apple aapl or Microsoft msft or Google goog worlds to create and refine their documents. The company, which has raised over 600 million in funding, is threading the needle here. It says its cloud storage and file-sharing software works better across various software platforms (Microsoft and Google, for example) than either of those two companies do because they want customers to stay on their own software all the time. None of those tech giants, the pitch goes, is particularly anxious to make its own software work well with products from its mega-rivals, which means it probably makes more sense to use Microsoft OneDrive for Microsoft msft Office files and Google Drive for Google goog Apps. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s daily newsletter on the business of technology. That’s basically the same argument Box box , the other major independent player in this market, makes.

But Dropbox also argues that all those consumer users are its best sales people. “They bring us to work,” Woodside said.

Why am I blocked from asking questions under anonymous basis on Quora? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Choose your answer from: * no; * yes;","output":"Yes, both questions are essentially paraphrases of each other, as they convey the same general inquiry regarding the inability to ask anonymous questions on Quora. To provide a detailed explanation of this policy, here is an overview of how Quora's platform functions concerning anonymity: Quora is a platform that allows users to ask questions, answer questions, and engage in discussions on various topics. One of the primary goals of Quora is to encourage a healthy and informative exchange of knowledge while keeping the platform user-friendly and respectful. To help maintain this environment, Quora has implemented certain guidelines and policies that govern user behavior. One such policy is the restriction on asking anonymous questions. In the past, Quora permitted users to freely ask questions anonymously, but they changed this policy due to several reasons: 1. Abuse of anonymity: Some users exploited the anonymous feature to indulge in trolling or asking offensive, inappropriate, or irrelevant questions. These activities affect the quality of content on the platform and can deter others from engaging in meaningful discussions. 2. Encouraging accountability: By limiting anonymous questions, Quora seeks to establish a greater sense of responsibility among its users. When users are required to attach their names to the questions they ask, they tend to be more cautious and thoughtful, ultimately leading to higher-quality content. 3. Reduction of spam: Anonymous questions opened the door for spamming and promoting irrelevant or low-quality content. Restricting this feature helps reduce spam and maintain a more organized and user-friendly environment. 4. Quality control: Quora aims to provide valuable, accurate, and reliable information to users. By limiting anonymity, it helps foster an environment where users' identities and credentials can be verified, facilitating the process of assessing the reliability of answers. It's important to note that while Quora has limited the ability to ask anonymous questions, it still allows users to answer questions anonymously when appropriate. Users can also edit their privacy settings to manage who can see the questions they ask. In conclusion, the two questions mentioned in the prompt are paraphrases of each other, as they both address the same policy of preventing anonymous questions on the Quora platform. The reasons behind this policy are grounded in promoting a high-quality, respectful, and reliable user experience for all participants."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Who was on the losing side in 31 BC?\\" is in \\"Scholars and historians are divided as to what event signals the end of the Hellenistic era.

The answer is:","output":"Batiatus' ludus"},{"instruction":"Who consumes less power, an air conditioner or ceiling fan? Which consumes less power, an air conditioner in fan mode or a ceiling fan? Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"A ceiling fan generally consumes less power than an air conditioner. They both serve different purposes, with the air conditioner being designed to cool down the air and maintain a specific temperature, while the ceiling fan is designed to circulate air and provide a cooling effect of the breeze. Air conditioners use between 500 to 3,500 watts of electricity depending on their cooling capacity, while a ceiling fan typically uses between 15 to 75 watts of electricity. This makes ceiling fans a more energy-efficient option for maintaining comfortable room temperatures, especially when the temperature is only moderately warm. However, in extremely hot conditions, an air conditioner is necessary to lower the air temperature rather than just circulate it. Regarding the second question, when an air conditioner is set in fan mode, it only circulates the air without engaging the cooling system. The consumption of power in this mode is significantly lower than when the cooling function is on, but it still uses more power compared to a ceiling fan. In fan mode, an air conditioner typically uses about 150 to 300 watts, which is higher than the power consumption of an average ceiling fan. The two questions do not have the exact same meaning, even though they are related. The first question compares the power consumption of an air conditioner and a ceiling fan, while the second question compares the power consumption of an air conditioner in fan mode with that of a ceiling fan. The latter indicates that the air conditioner running in fan mode may have the cooling function turned off, thus focusing on its power usage in that specific situation. By comparison, the first question is general and relates to the overall power consumption difference between an air conditioner and a ceiling fan, without focusing on a particular mode."},{"instruction":"What is the answer: Which Roman Catholic sacrament consists of the anointing of a dying person with oil, which has been blessed?","output":"The Roman Catholic sacrament you are referring to is called the Anointing of the Sick, which was formerly known as Extreme Unction or Last Rites. This sacrament has a crucial role in the spiritual lives of the faithful in the Roman Catholic Church, as it is administered to those who are gravely ill, approaching the end of life, or facing a significant surgery. The purpose of this sacrament is to offer spiritual, emotional, and sometimes physical healing to the person receiving it. The Anointing of the Sick is based on the biblical support found in the Letter of James (James 5:14-15). The passage calls for the elders of the Church to go to the person who is sick, anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord, pray over them, and their sins will be forgiven, potentially leading to their healing. The oil used in this sacrament is typically \\"Oil of the Sick\\" also known as \\"OLEUM INFIRMORUM,\\" which is consecrated by the bishop during the Chrism Mass on Holy Thursday. The Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC) describes the Anointing of the Sick as a sacrament intended to strengthen those who are facing the weakening and even the disintegration of their physical and mental faculties. By anointing the person with blessed oil and accompanying the act with specific prayers, the priest administering this sacrament seeks to invoke God's healing presence in the life of the sick person. In this way, it not only seeks to offer spiritual solace but also aims to improve and aid the individual's physical and emotional well-being. Though commonly associated with the dying, the Anointing of the Sick is not reserved exclusively for those close to death. It can be offered to anyone who is experiencing grave illness or suffering from a significant medical condition. Additionally, if a person's condition worsens or if they fall gravely ill again, the sacrament can be repeated. The Anointing of the Sick has several effects and implications in the life of a Roman Catholic believer. These include: 1. Uniting the individual's suffering with the passion of Christ, providing spiritual and emotional relief. 2. Strengthening the person to endure their illness or present suffering with hope, courage, and a sense of peace. 3. Forgiving the sins of the person, assuring them of God's mercy and love in their moment of vulnerability. 4. The potential for physical healing or improvement in their condition if deemed suitable by God. 5. Offering support and comfort from the faith community, reinforcing the person's connection to the Church. In conclusion, the Anointing of the Sick is a Roman Catholic sacrament that focuses on providing spiritual, emotional, and sometimes physical healing to individuals who are gravely ill or facing a significant health concern. It utilizes anointing with blessed oil and prayers to invoke God's presence and align the individual's suffering with the passion of Christ. The sacrament aims to offer strength, forgiveness, and a sense of hope during a person's time of vulnerability."},{"instruction":"Dialogue: Jessica: Did you write a prv mssg to Nate? Lucy: Yeah, why?

Reasons for Postponement While fans have been eagerly awaiting Radiohead's European tour, it was announced last week that the band has decided to postpone their shows. The decision comes amidst the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, which has forced many artists to cancel or reschedule live events.

With the pandemic still ongoing and travel restrictions being enforced in many countries, it has become increasingly difficult for large-scale events to be organized safely.

The band has also urged fans to hold onto their tickets, as they will remain valid for the rescheduled dates.

Fact 2: The suitability for septic drainfields is poor because of slow permeability. Given the two facts above, the best place to locate a septic system is? Answer:","output":"To determine the best place to locate a septic system, let's think through these steps based on the given facts: Step 1: Understand the facts Fact 1: If soil is permeable, water easily flows through that soil. This means that water can easily spread through the soil layers. Fact 2: The suitability for septic drainfields is poor because of slow permeability. This implies that septic drainfields need moderately permeable soil to function efficiently. Step 2: Analyze the requirements Based on facts 1 and 2, we know that septic drainfields cannot function properly in soil with poor permeability. So, we need to find a location with soil that has moderate permeability. Step 3: Determine the best location The best location for a septic system, given the above information, is in an area where the soil has moderate permeability. This allows for efficient drainage of wastewater without allowing it to flow too quickly, thereby preventing potential contamination of nearby water sources and ensuring proper treatment of the wastewater. So, the best place to locate a septic system is in an area with moderately permeable soil, which allows for optimal function of the septic drainfields."},{"instruction":"Given the question: I read this background article the other day: Magnetism is the ability of a material to be attracted by a magnet and to act as a magnet. Magnetism is due to the movement of electrons within atoms of matter. When electrons spin around the nucleus of an atom, it causes the atom to become a tiny magnet, with north and south poles and a magnetic field. In most materials, the north and south poles of atoms point in all different directions, so overall the material is not magnetic. Examples of nonmagnetic materials include wood, glass, plastic, paper, copper, and aluminum. These materials are not attracted to magnets and cannot become magnets. I am facing a new situation today: Rob got a compass as a present for his birthday. The magnet in the compass made him very interested in how magnets work. To understand magnets better he categorized objects in two groups, group A and group B. In group A all objects were magnetic, but in group B none of the objects was magnetic. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which groups atom's poles would align in more orderly fashion, group A or group B? The answer is:","output":"Group A's atom's poles would align in a more orderly fashion because all objects in group A are magnetic. This means that their north and south poles of atoms are aligned in a way that the material exhibits magnetic properties. In contrast, group B's atom's poles are not aligned in an orderly manner, making the objects in this group nonmagnetic."},{"instruction":"Question: Who teaches that desires are the cause of suffering and must be suppressed?

Critics of antihumanism, most notably Jürgen Habermas, counter that while antihumanists may highlight humanism's failure to fulfil its emancipatory ideal, they do not offer an alternative emancipatory project of their own. Others, like the German philosopher Heidegger considered themselves humanists on the model of the ancient Greeks, but thought humanism applied only to the German \\"race\\" and specifically to the Nazis and thus, in Davies' words, were anti-humanist humanists. Such a reading of Heidegger's thought is itself deeply controversial; Heidegger includes his own views and critique of Humanism in Letter On Humanism. Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of the wars of the 20th century \\"it should no longer be possible to formulate phrases like 'the destiny of man' or the 'triumph of human reason' without an instant consciousness of the folly and brutality they drag behind them\\". For \\"it is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason\\". Yet, he continues, \\"it would be unwise to simply abandon the ground occupied by the historical humanisms. For one thing humanism remains on many occasions the only available alternative to bigotry and persecution.

The results of World War I would be important factors in the development of World War II approximately 20 years later. More immediate to the time, the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire was a political event that redrew the political boundaries of West Asia. The huge conglomeration of territories and peoples formerly ruled by the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire was divided into several new nations. The partitioning brought the creation of the modern Arab world and the Republic of Turkey. The League of Nations granted France mandates over Syria and Lebanon and granted the United Kingdom mandates over Mesopotamia and Palestine (which was later divided into two regions: Palestine and Transjordan). Parts of the Ottoman Empire on the Arabian Peninsula became parts of what are today Saudi Arabia and Yemen.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

In 1972, the name of the Territory changed to \\"Papua New Guinea\\" and in 1975 it became the independent nation of Papua New Guinea. - Pomerania is a region on the southern shore of the Baltic Sea in Central Europe, split between Germany and Poland. - The Battle of Cape Gloucester was a battle in the Pacific theater of World War II between Japanese and Allied forces which took place on the island of New Britain , Territory of New Guinea , between late December 1943 and April 1944 . The battle was a major part of Operation Cartwheel , the main Allied strategy in the South West Pacific Area and Pacific Ocean Areas during 1943 -- 44 , and was the second World War II landing of the U.S. 1st Marine Division , after Guadalcanal . - The Territory of New Guinea was an Australian administered territory on the island of New Guinea from 1920 until 1975. In 1949, the Territory and the Territory of Papua were established in an administrative union by the name of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. That administrative union was renamed as Papua New Guinea in 1971. Notwithstanding that it was part of an administrative union, the Territory of New Guinea at all times retained a distinct legal status and identity until the advent of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea. - Rabaul is a township in East New Britain province, on the island of New Britain, in the country of Papua New Guinea. New Britain is an island about 60 kilometres to the east of the island of New Guinea. Rabaul was the provincial capital and most important settlement in the province until it was destroyed in 1994 by falling ash of a volcanic eruption. - New Britain, is the largest island in the Bismarck Archipelago (named after Otto von Bismarck) of Papua New Guinea. It is separated from the island of New Guinea by the Dampier and Vitiaz Straits and from New Ireland by St. George's Channel. The main towns of New Britain are Rabaul/Kokopo and Kimbe. The island is roughly the size of Taiwan. While the island was part of German New Guinea, it was named Neupommern (\\"New Pomerania\\"). - Kimbe is the capital of the province of West New Britain in Papua New Guinea. It is a port town on the great Kimbe Bay which boasts more than 60 percent of the coral species of the entire Indo-Pacific. The bustling town of Kimbe is the third largest port in Papua New Guinea and is the fastest growing city in the South Pacific. Accommodation in Kimbe is readily available in many high-class resorts and hotels, as well as many budget guesthouses and motels dribbled along the province. The town of Kimbe is served by Hoskins Airport. - Vitiaz Strait is a strait between New Britain and the Huon Peninsula, northern New Guinea. - During World War II, the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki made Nagasaki the second and, to date, last city in the world to experience a nuclear attack. - German New Guinea was the first part of the German colonial empire. It was a protectorate from 1884 until 1914 when it fell to Australian forces following the outbreak of the First World War. It consisted of the northeastern part of New Guinea and several nearby island groups. The mainland part of German New Guinea and the nearby islands of the Bismarck Archipelago and the North Solomon Islands are now part of Papua New Guinea. The Micronesian islands of German New Guinea are now governed as the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, the Northern Mariana Islands and Palau. - Operation Cartwheel (19431944) was a major military strategy for the Allies in the Pacific theater of World War II. Cartwheel was a twin-axis of advance operation, aimed at militarily neutralizing the major Japanese base at Rabaul. The operation was directed by the Supreme Allied Commander in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA)General Douglas MacArthurwhose forces advanced along the northeast coast of New Guinea and occupied nearby islands. Allied forces from the Pacific Ocean Areas commandunder Admiral Chester W. Nimitzadvanced through the Solomon Islands toward Bougainville. The Allied forces involved were from Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the US and various Pacific Islands. - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history. - Cape Gloucester (also known as Tuluvu) is a headland on the northern side of the far west of the island of New Britain, Papua New Guinea. During World War II, the Japanese captured New Britain, and had driven most of Cape Gloucester's native population out to construct two airfields. During the New Britain Campaign, American forces had decided to capture Cape Gloucester for its two airfields, to assist planned attacks on the garrison on Rabaul, an important area in New Britain. It became the site of the Battle of Cape Gloucester, part of Operation Cartwheel, in 1943. After long fighting through rain, and Japanese, the United States 1st Marine Division had it declared secured. After the war, the headland was given back to the natives. - Papua New Guinea (PNG Hiri Motu: \\"Papua Niu Gini\\"), officially the Independent State of Papua New Guinea, is an Oceanian country that occupies the eastern half of the island of New Guinea and its offshore islands in Melanesia, a region of the southwestern Pacific Ocean north of Australia. Its capital, located along its southeastern coast, is Port Moresby. The western half of New Guinea forms the Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua. - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II. - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany. - Otto Eduard Leopold, Prince of Bismarck, Duke of Lauenburg (1 April 1815 30 July 1898), known as Otto von Bismarck, was a conservative Prussian statesman who dominated German and European affairs from the 1860s until 1890. In the 1860s, he engineered a series of wars that unified the German states, significantly and deliberately excluding Austria, into a powerful German Empire under Prussian leadership. With that accomplished by 1871, he skillfully used balance of power diplomacy to maintain Germany's position in a Europe which, despite many disputes and war scares, remained at peace. For historian Eric Hobsbawm, it was Bismarck who \\"remained undisputed world champion at the game of multilateral diplomatic chess for almost twenty years after 1871, [and] devoted himself exclusively, and successfully, to maintaining peace between the powers.\\" - The Bismarck Archipelago is a group of islands off the northeastern coast of New Guinea in the western Pacific Ocean and is part of the Islands Region of Papua New Guinea. Its area is about 50,000 square km. - Kokopo is the capital of East New Britain in Papua New Guinea. The capital was moved from Rabaul in 1994 when the volcanoes Tavurvur and Vulcan erupted. As a result, the population of the town increased more than sixfold from 3,150 in 1990 to 20,262 in 2000. - Taiwan, officially the Republic of China (ROC), is a state in East Asia. Neighbors include China (officially the People's Republic of China, abbreviated as PRC) to the west, Japan to the northeast, and the Philippines to the south. Taiwan is the most populous state that is not a member of the United Nations, and the one with the largest economy. - New Guinea (or, historically, \\"\\") is a large Island in the South West Pacific region. - The Territory of Papua comprised the southeastern quarter of the island of New Guinea from 1883 to 1975. In 1883, the Government of Queensland annexed this territory for the British Empire. The United Kingdom Government refused to ratify the annexation but in 1884 a Protectorate was proclaimed over the territory, then called \\"British New Guinea\\". There is a certain ambiguity about the exact date on which the entire territory was annexed by the British. The Papua Act 1905 recites that this happened \\"on or about\\" 4 September 1888. On 18 March 1902, the Territory was placed under the authority of the Commonwealth of Australia. Resolutions of acceptance were passed by the Commonwealth Parliament, who accepted the territory under the name of Papua. What is the relationship between 'battle of cape gloucester' and 'papua new guinea'? Answer:","output":"The relationship between the 'Battle of Cape Gloucester' and 'Papua New Guinea' lies in their connection to the island of New Britain during World War II. The Battle of Cape Gloucester was a military engagement between Japanese and Allied forces, taking place on the island of New Britain, which was part of the Territory of New Guinea at that time. The battle occurred between late December 1943 and April 1944 and was a significant part of Operation Cartwheel, the main Allied strategy in the South West Pacific Area and Pacific Ocean Areas during 1943-44. The Territory of Papua and New Guinea was established in 1949 following an administrative union between the Australian-administered territories of Papua and New Guinea. New Britain is an island situated to the east of the island of New Guinea and is currently part of Papua New Guinea, which became an independent nation in 1975. In summary, the Battle of Cape Gloucester occurred on the island of New Britain, which later became a part of the independent nation of Papua New Guinea."},{"instruction":"Determine the sentiment: 2 stars for Kay Francis -- she's wonderful! And she didn't deserve this horrible tripe that Warner Bros. threw her way! The two-pronged premise that this movie is based on is ridiculous and unbelievable in the extreme. Kay is a small-town wife and mother who yearns for something bigger: she wants to be an actress. When a big-shot actor comes to town and invites Kay to his hotel to talk about possibilities, Kay tells her husband she's going to the movies. The hubby's biddy of a mother puts a bug in hubby's ear that Kay's not being truthful, and he sets out looking for her. He finds her w/ the actor in the hotel (they are only talking!) and he slugs the guy, who falls over a railing, lands face-first in a pond (lake?), and dies. Now here's the two unbelievable premises upon which the rest of the movie is based: 1) the judge tells the jury that if it's determined that the man died *before* his head went into the water, that they must find the hubby guilty of first degree murder. (Whaaaaa?????? I think slugging a guy in a fit of rage would count for manslaughter or murder 2 at the most, not FIRST DEGREE murder. Give me a break! But the plot required him being found guilty of murder 1 so that he could be sent to prison for life. Whatever.) 2) the hubby's lawyer, after the conviction and sentencing, tells Kay that it's all HER fault. His reasoning is that if she hadn't gone over to the actor's room, then her husband wouldn't have had to go after her and slug the guy and kill him. He tells her that she's the guilty one, not her husband, and she nods and agrees. What. The. Hell?!?!?! The rest of the movie is all about Kay trying to achieve fame and money in order to get her husband released from prison and right the wrong she committed by causing him to kill the actor dude in the first place. I can't even go on with this review. The movie was just all too painful. Four years earlier, in the pre-code days, you'd never have caught Kay playing such a wimp! In true Kay Francis fashion, though, she did do her best to make us believe that this woman was a believable character. I give her much credit for trying to breathe some life and credibility to this thankless role. This character was a far cry from pre-code Kay roles and real-life spitfire Kay Francis.

The given equation is: -127*c + 10482 = -3441 + 1604 On the right side of the equation, combine the constants (-3441 and 1604): -3441 + 1604 = -1837 Now the simplified equation is: -127*c + 10482 = -1837 Step 2: Isolate the term with the variable c. To do this, we need to move the constant 10482 from the left side of the equation to the right side. We accomplish this by subtracting 10482 from both sides of the equation: -127*c + 10482 - 10482 = -1837 - 10482 -127*c = -13319 Step 3: Solve for c.

And I'm very thankful to him. I remember when I was a child my father always got up very early, quietly putting on his clothes and going off to work. To arrive in time to open his tiny store at 8:30, he needed to leave our apartment at 6:30. After all, he had to take a bus and then the subway. The last journey was a long walk through a neighborhood much of which was full of the smell of rubbish. I learned: it is very important to work. No excuse. When I was 12, I would, on some Saturdays, go to my father's store to help out. After helping set up the outside clothing display, for the rest of the day, I'd watch to make sure no one stole anything. When I noticed someone looking unusual or strange, I would look the person in the eye, smile and say, \\"May I help you?\\" Usually that worked, but sometimes, someone would run off with something. The first time, I ran after the thief but my father shouted, \\"Martin, stop! There is no need to do that.\\" It's true that safety is more important than money. After 10 years of hard work, he saved up enough money to buy his first car, a cheap one--he wouldn't buy one until he could afford to pay for it without borrowing money.

Neill was promoted to lieutenant colonel during his participation in the Siege of Béxar, and 10 days later Houston placed him in charge of the Texian garrison in the city. In January residents had begun evacuating ahead of Santa Anna's approaching forces. Neill pleaded with Houston for replenishment of troops, supplies and weaponry. The departure of Texians who joined the Matamoros Expedition had left Neill with only about 100 men. At that point Houston viewed Béxar as a military liability and did not want Santa Anna's advancing army gaining control of any remaining soldiers or artillery. He dispatched Bowie with instructions to remove the artillery, have the defenders abandon the Alamo mission and destroy it. Upon his January 19 arrival and subsequent discussions with Neill, Bowie decided the mission was the right place to stop the Mexican army in its tracks. He stayed and began to help Neill prepare for the coming attack. Lieutenant Colonel William B. Travis arrived with reinforcements on February 3. When Neill was given leave to attend to family matters on February 11, Travis assumed command of the mission, and three days later he and Bowie agreed to a joint command. Santa Anna crossed the Rio Grande on February 16, and the Mexican army's assault on the Alamo began February 23. Captain Juan Seguín left the mission on February 25, carrying a letter from Travis to Fannin at Goliad requesting more reinforcements. Santa Anna extended an offer of amnesty to Tejanos inside the fortress; a non-combatant survivor, Enrique Esparza, said that most Tejanos left when Bowie advised them to take the offer. In response to Travis' February 24 letter To the People of Texas, 32 militia volunteers formed the Gonzales Ranging Company of Mounted Volunteers and arrived at the Alamo on February 29.

The passage does not provide any information related to the dog's name. Instead, it focuses on the behavior of Tom's dog fetching Tom's slippers and how it stopped doing so when the slippers smelled bad. Once Tom got a new pair of slippers, the dog resumed fetching them. Several observations can be made based on the passage: 1. Tom's dog has been trained to fetch slippers: It is mentioned that Tom trained his dog to get his slippers for him, and the dog would do it every single time, establishing that it has been conditioned to perform this specific task. 2. The dog stopped fetching the slippers when they smelled bad: It is possible that the odor from the slippers was unappealing to the dog, causing him to stop fetching them. This suggests that dogs might exhibit certain behaviors or preferences based on their olfactory senses. 3. The dog resumed fetching when Tom got a new pair: The fact that the dog resumed fetching slippers when Tom got a new pair suggests the negative olfactory factor played a role in its behavior change. Dogs have a sensitive sense of smell, and it seems likely that the odor of the old slippers was the primary deterrent for the dog's refusal to fetch them. However, none of the given information reveals the name of Tom's dog. Therefore, inferring that the dog's name is Cheemo cannot be substantiated by the passage.

Its roots can be traced back to the establishment of the first newspapers, when bulletins made of silk in ancient Rome delivered announcements and news to the public. As an art form, journalism embodies a delicate balance of delivering accurate and relevant information at the right time and doing so in a way that captures its audience's attention. This article aims to explore the craft and timeliness in journalism, delving into its essence and highlighting the skills and values essential to its practice. The Art of Journalism While most people are familiar with the basic idea of journalism - providing facts and context to inform the public - it is also important to acknowledge the artistic dimension of this profession. Storytelling is at the core of journalism. Journalists and reporters meticulously select words, phrases, and storytelling techniques to craft engaging, informative, and impactful narratives. A well-executed piece of journalism reflects the author's creativity and ability to illuminate complex issues and present them in an accessible and appealing manner. Styles such as feature writing, investigative reporting, opinion columns, and photojournalism showcase the diversity in the art of journalism. Each format requires a unique approach to storytelling, giving journalists the opportunity to employ various creative techniques that cater to their strengths and engage different segments of the audience. The role of artistry in journalism is evident in the wide range of styles and formats available. A reporter can choose from various multimedia platforms like print, online, video, or podcast to present a story in the most compelling manner, keeping in mind their target audience's preferences. Skilled journalists often leverage a blend of technology and creativity to enhance storytelling, making it more immersive and interactive. In the digital era, journalists have an opportunity to create engaging visuals, interactive infographics, and real-time updates that cater to the fast-paced and ever-changing landscape of information consumption. Timeliness in Journalism A defining characteristic of journalism is its focus on timeliness. Journalism relies on accurate, insightful, and up-to-date information that empowers the audience to understand current events and make informed decisions. Timeliness is integral to the legitimacy and relevance of a journalist's work, emphasizing the importance of staying ahead of the curve in terms of investigating and reporting new developments and emerging trends. The 24-hour news cycle, spurred on by technological advancements and a global interconnected society, has amplified the importance of timeliness in journalism. Journalists must stay vigilant of breaking news stories unfolding across the world and rapidly adapt their coverage to shifts in public interest or unfolding events. Social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram play a significant role in this process, enabling both journalists and citizens to share and access real-time information on a scale never before possible. Balancing Art and Information Striking the right balance between art and information in journalism is challenging. A journalist must passionately pursue the truth to deliver accurate and reliable information while demonstrating creativity to ensure stories resonate with their audience. Facts alone are not always enough to maintain public interest; the manner in which they are presented can greatly influence audience engagement, understanding, and recall. In the age of 'infotainment,' journalists are constantly competing for readership and viewership, which can sometimes blur the lines between providing informative news and embracing sensationalism for entertainment purposes. It is crucial for journalists to stay mindful of their role as objective and neutral purveyors of truth and avoid compromising journalistic integrity. Conclusion Journalism is a complex art form, requiring a balance of creativity, technical aptitude, and timeliness. A journalist must be dedicated to gathering accurate and meaningful information and weaving it into compelling narratives that inspire thought and foster understanding. While timeliness remains a cornerstone of journalism, it is the artistry and craftsmanship of reporters that elevate mere facts into persuasive, engaging stories that inform and educate the public. As our world continues to evolve, the interplay between the art of journalism and the delivery of information will remain as vital as ever in safeguarding free, informed, and empowered societies."},{"instruction":"Tunnel Vision is a 2001 novel by author Keith Lowe, his debut novel, published by MTV Books on 1 October 2001.

They ate all that they could find, and then moved on. Then around 10,000 years ago, about 1% of human history, people learned to farm the land. The kind of food we eat depends on which part of the world we live in, or which part of our country we live in. For example, in the south of China they eat rice, but in the north they eat noodles. In European countries near the sea, people eat a lot of fish. In central Europe, away from the sea, people don't eat so much fish, but they eat more meat. For example, in Germany and Poland, there are hundreds of different kinds of sausages. In North America, Australia, and Europe, people eat with knives and forks. In China, people eat with chopsticks. In parts of India and the Middle East, people use their fingers to pick up food. Nowadays it is possible to transport food easily from one part of the world to another. We can eat whatever we like, at any time of the year. In Britain, bananas come from Africa; rice comes from India or the U.S.A.; strawberries come from Chile or Spain. Food is a very big business. But people in poor countries are still hungry while people in rich countries eat too much. Question: In North America, Australia, and Europe, people _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"eat with knives and forks\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer is \\"eat with knives and forks.\\" In North America, Australia, and Europe, people generally use knives and forks as their primary utensils for eating meals. This dining tradition has been a predominant part of Western culture for centuries and continues to be so today. Using knives and forks is not the only method of eating around the world, however. As mentioned in the article, in China, people predominantly use chopsticks as their primary eating utensils, while in parts of India and the Middle East, people often use their fingers to pick up food. These cultural differences in dining habits highlight the diverse customs and traditions that exist across the globe. Furthermore, the article points out that the type of food people eat depends on the part of the world they live in or their regional location within their country. Local food preferences are influenced by regional agricultural capacities, climate, and available resources. With advances in transportation, people can now enjoy food from all over the world, no matter where they live. This has led to increased food diversity, but it has also caused issues where people in poor countries continue to suffer from hunger while those in rich countries have an abundance of food choices, sometimes resulting in overconsumption. In conclusion, the answer to the question is \\"Yes.\\" People in North America, Australia, and Europe predominantly eat with knives and forks, reflecting the unique cultural dining habits present across different regions of the world."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information: - The Democratic Republic of the Congo , also known as DR Congo, DRC, DROC, East Congo, Congo-Kinshasa, or simply the Congo is a country located in Central Africa.

What was supposed to be a court-approved trip turned into a complex international custody battle as the mother hid the child in France. Against all odds, Mr. Hummel embarked on a journey to retrieve his son and managed to bring him back to the United States. The Trip In the summer of the previous year, Larry Hummel signed off on an agreement for his son's mother to take their child on a trip to Eastern Europe. The European vacation had been thoroughly examined and approved by the court, as both parents had a share in custody. However, when the journey's end date came and went, Mr. Hummel's son was not returned to Los Angeles. Instead, unbeknownst to him, the pair remained overseas in France, hidden away in an attempt to evade any legal pressure to bring the child back. A Father's Determination Frustrated and determined to recover his son, Larry Hummel leaped into action. He consulted with his legal team and contacted authorities both locally and overseas seeking help and guidance. Through persistence and determination, he eventually managed to locate his son and the mother in France. With little help and few options, Mr. Hummel decided to embark on a journey to France and aggressively pursue the return of his child. This decision showed the commitment and love of a father willing to face an unprecedented situation to reunite with his son. The Reunion Larry Hummel traveled to France and pursued all legal channels available to him. He faced numerous challenges, from dealing with a foreign legal system to navigating the intricacies of international custody law.

In 1894 Wood went to the Wagner festival at Bayreuth where he met the conductor Felix Mottl, who subsequently appointed him as his assistant and chorus master for a series of Wagner concerts at the newly built Queen's Hall in London. The manager of the hall, Robert Newman, was proposing to run a ten-week season of promenade concerts and, impressed by Wood, invited him to conduct. There had been such concerts in London since 1838, under conductors from Louis Antoine Jullien to Arthur Sullivan. Sullivan's concerts in the 1870s had been particularly successful, because he offered his audiences something more than the usual light music. He introduced major classical works, such as Beethoven symphonies, normally restricted to the more expensive concerts presented by the Philharmonic Society and others. Newman aimed to do the same: \\"I am going to run nightly concerts and train the public by easy stages. Popular at first, gradually raising the standard until I have created a public for classical and modern music.\\"Newman's determination to make the promenade concerts attractive to everyone led him to permit smoking during concerts, which was not formally prohibited at the Proms until 1971. Refreshments were available in all parts of the hall throughout the concerts, not only during intervals. Prices were considerably lower than those customarily charged for classical concerts: the promenade (the standing area) was one shilling, the balcony two shillings, and the grand circle (reserved seats) three and five shillings.Newman needed to find financial backing for his first season. Dr George Cathcart, a wealthy ear, nose and throat specialist, offered to sponsor it on two conditions: that Wood should conduct every concert, and that the pitch of the orchestral instruments should be lowered to the European standard diapason normal. Concert pitch in England was nearly a semitone higher than that used on the continent, and Cathcart regarded it as damaging for singers' voices. Wood, from his experience as a singing teacher,...

These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect. Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending (black comedy being an exception). One of the oldest genres in film, some of the very first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound. When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s, comedy films took another swing, as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue. - The Rank Organisation was a British entertainment conglomerate founded by industrialist J. Arthur Rank in April 1937. It quickly became the largest and most vertically integrated film company in Britain, owning production, distribution and exhibition facilities. It also diversified into the manufacture of radios, TVs and photocopiers (as one of the owners of Rank Xerox). The company name lasted until February 1996 when the name and some of the remaining assets were absorbed into the newly structured the Rank Group Plc and in the years that followed asset stripping and streamlining of the business has left it a shadow of its former self, with all their remaining operating interests now in gambling. - Sir Derek Jules Gaspard Ulric Niven van den Bogaerde, known as Dirk Bogarde (28 March 1921 8 May 1999), was an English actor and writer. Initially a matinée idol in films such as \\"Doctor in the House\\" (1954) for the Rank Organisation, he later acted in art-house films. In a second career, he wrote seven best-selling volumes of memoirs, six novels and a volume of collected journalism, mainly from articles in \\"The Daily Telegraph\\". - The Daily Telegraph, commonly referred to simply as The Telegraph, is a national British daily broadsheet newspaper published in London by Telegraph Media Group and distributed across the United Kingdom and internationally. It was founded by Arthur B. Sleigh in 1855 as \\"The Daily Telegraph and Courier\\". - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - Sir Alec Guinness (2 April 1914 5 August 2000) was an English actor.

Witnesses to the terrifying incident described seeing the two planes collide and flames erupting in the sky, shortly followed by debris free falling to the ground. Despite the horrific nature of the accident, they commended the quick thinking and skilled actions of the glider pilot, who managed to detach from the Piper Pawnee and land safely with their passengers.

The premise states that there is a man who has a blue toy sticking to the back of his pants. 2. By definition, \\"sticking\\" implies that the toy is attached or adhered to the man's pants. 3. Thus, we can assume that the blue toy is \\"stuck\\" to the man's pants, as \\"stuck\\" also implies that an object is attached to another object in some manner. 4.

Texas Rural Legal Aid - known for its fearless and sometimes controversial advocacy of the poorest of the poor - last week took over four other corporations serving the legal needs of the indigent in Southwest Texas, including the one in Bexar County. The new 68-county legal aid organization has yet to be named and stretches from El Paso to Corpus Christi, Harlingen to Austin. The leader for the super-sized law firm has big plans. \\"I'm more interested in looking at what we as advocates can do to address the serious problems of poverty than the number of cases we close,\\" said David Hall, the TRLA executive director. In the Rio Grande Valley, Hall's attorneys set up separate groups to assist small-business owners and residents with low-interest loans and legal representation. They also operate a legal arm that assists migrant workers from Texas to Kentucky. Now, Hall said, he wants to make services to the poor more efficient by working with law students who will handle less complicated legal matters, allowing licensed attorneys to take more \\"high impact\\" cases to court. \\"What we need to do is handle cases as efficiently as we can, leveraging the amount of time of the lawyer that goes in there and maximizing the number of people that they can help at one time,\\" Hall said. His plan is to place the 110 attorneys on staff in teams working on specialized legal issues. He wants to expand the law clinic it already has with St. Mary's University Law School to involve students at the University of Texas Law School. The law students at St. Mary's interview potential clients, assist them with filling out legal documents and answer the telephones for the legal hotline, freeing up TRLA lawyers to handle the complicated cases, Hall said. By the end of September, Hall said all the attorneys working with the poor in the 68county area will be placed on the same computer network so they can pass cases to the best available attorneys. Last year, board members on the former Legal Aid of Central Texas and Bexar County Legal Aid resisted the merger, saying that the mergers were done illegally and without the input of board members. They also argued that Hall's litigious style hampered their ability to garner funds from Congress. TRLA generated controversy in 1996, when its attorneys challenged the rights of 800 military personnel to vote in Val Verde County elections by absentee ballot after a former Ku Klux Klan member won a county commissioner post. Brendan Gill, the former executive director of the Bexar County group, said he has since come to see the merger as a positive move for South Texas. \\"I always knew there were good points to merging, just as I knew that there were bad points,\\" Gill said.

Billy are cheeseburgers more often than some people, but less often than others. You could say that it was something he did only when? Options: - occasionally - seldom - hardly ever - infrequently - never Explain why a human would choose \\"occasionally\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"occasionally\\" to answer the question above for multiple reasons, which are based on the context of the question, its structure, and the possible options provided. Here's a detailed analysis of why \\"occasionally\\" is the most appropriate answer: 1. Context and story analysis: The context of the question revolves around Billy's eating habits, specifically his preference for eating hamburgers with or without cheese. The statement \\"Billy often eats hamburgers, but he did not always have them with cheese\\" hints at the variations in his consumption patterns. In other words, the information suggests that there are moments when Billy prefers cheeseburgers, but he does not do so all the time. 2. Comparison with other people: The question further highlights that \\"Billy ate cheeseburgers more often than some people but less often than others.\\" This statement indicates that his preference for cheeseburgers falls in the middle of an arbitrary spectrum compared to others' eating habits. Thus, it suggests a frequency that is neither too high nor too low but rather in-between. 3. Analysis of answer options: Given the options provided, we need to determine which of them would best describe the described frequency. Here's a brief evaluation of each option: - \\"Occasionally\\": Implies that something happens sometimes but not always. It is often used to describe a frequency that lies in the middle of an arbitrary spectrum, making it a convenient choice for the provided context. - \\"Seldom\\": Indicates a lower frequency, generally closer to \\"rare\\" or \\"scarce.\\" This option would imply that Billy rarely consumes cheeseburgers, which does not align well with the given context. - \\"Hardly ever\\": This phrase denotes an even lower frequency, suggesting the event is barely or infrequently occurring. This choice contradicts the statement that Billy eats cheeseburgers more often than some people. - \\"Infrequently\\": Similar to \\"seldom\\" and \\"hardly ever,\\" this option suggests a lower frequency. Although it could be considered as a possible choice, it is less precise than \\"occasionally\\" in specifying Billy's habits. - \\"Never\\": This option is the least suitable, as it implies that Billy never eats cheeseburgers, which contradicts the entire context of the question. 4. Conclusion: Considering the context, the story about Billy's habits, and the analysis of the answer options, a human would choose \\"occasionally\\" because it best describes a middle-of-the-spectrum frequency that aligns with the given information. By selecting \\"occasionally,\\" it would imply that Billy's consumption of cheeseburgers is neither too high nor too low, accurately reflecting the fact that he eats them more often than some people and less often than others."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a science question (easy-level) and four answer options (associated with \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\", \\"D\\").

During the cell cycle, a single cell undergoes replication of its DNA and subsequently divides into two daughter cells. So, the correct answer is that two cells are produced during the cell cycle. The answer you found on Google refers to meiosis, which is a different process involved in the formation of gametes in sexually reproducing organisms.

(AP Photo/Austin... (Associated Press) The country music icon who turns 81 this week received his fifth-degree black belt in the martial art of Gong Kwon Yu Sul on Monday night, parking his tour bus outside the Austin studio of his instructor who began teaching him two decades ago. Nelson didn't show off his chops but Grand Master Sam Um assured a packed room that the \\"Red Headed Stranger\\" could hold his own against anyone. As is typically the case wherever Nelson goes, other celebrities were close: this time Austin resident Lance Armstrong tiptoed past parents of other students to see his fellow Texan honored. \\"Honestly, I was surprised to be getting this degree,\\" Nelson said on his bus before the ceremony. \\"I don't know what else is out there. I never thought about anything beyond second-degree black belt.\\" Nelson's birthday is Wednesday — though he's claimed before that the date is really April 29, a day earlier. He said a doctor gave him a clean bill of health earlier Monday during an annual exam. The singer gives martial arts a lot of credit for that. Although off stage he's more famously known for more mellow interests — like smoking pot — Nelson said he stays physical whenever possible. He's also a runner and avid bike rider. \\"I'm pretty healthy at 81. I think a lot of it has to do with the exercise that you do,\\" Nelson said. \\"I think martial arts is one of the best exercises you can do. Mentally, spiritually, physically, everything.

The mechanical advantage is the factor by which a machine changes the input force. The ideal mechanical advantage is the increase or decrease in force that would occur if there were no friction to overcome in the use of the machine. Because all machines must overcome some friction, the ideal mechanical advantage is always somewhat greater than the actual mechanical advantage of the machine as it is used in the real world. Paragraph: John designed a hypothetical lever that would have ideal mechanical advantage. He labeled the lever as lever A. He then wanted to compare this lever with a real world lever, which he labeled as lever B. He intended to use these levers to increase force.

De Long's party found no immediate sign at their landing-place of any human habitation, and had only a sketchy idea of where they were—Petermann's map provided few useful details. On September 19, having buried their non-essential possessions in a mound marked by a tent pole, they set out in search of settlements. Progress was hampered by the poor physical condition of the men, in particular Eriksen, who was badly affected by frostbite. On September 21 they halted at two empty huts, probably part of a hunting camp, where Alexey raised spirits by shooting a deer to replenish their dwindling food stocks. De Long allowed his exhausted party several days' rest before resuming the march.On September 28 the party found a large hut, with signs of recent occupation–edible food in the store, and moccasin tracks in the snow. When searches in the locality brought no sign of people, De Long decided to move on. By October 4, Eriksen could not continue; the party halted at another abandoned hut where, on October 6, Eriksen died. On October 9, with the condition of several men worsening, De Long decided to send two of the fittest in the group, Nindemann and Noros, to seek help. Ambler was offered the opportunity to go with them, but felt that his duty as a doctor required him to stay with the main body.For the next week De Long's party struggled on, sometimes making barely a mile a day. Although they jettisoned more of their possessions on the way, De Long insisted on carrying his maps and journals. His entry for October 10 recorded that there was \\"nothing for supper but a spoonful of glycerine\\". A few days later Alexey, the group's principal hunter, shot a ptarmigan which provided soup. But Alexey was weakening, and on October 17 he died.On October 20, trapped by the weather and without supplies, the party came to a final halt.

From the given text, it is mentioned that De Long offered Ambler the opportunity to leave with two of the fittest members Nindemann and Noros to seek help, as the condition of several men was worsening.

Article: On Thanksgiving Day, a teacher asked her class of firstgraders to draw a picture of something they were thankful for. She thought that these children from poor families actually had little to be thankful for. And she found most of them drawing pictures of flowers or tables with food. The teacher was very surprised to see the picture Douglas handed in. It's a hand,a simple hand. But whose hand? The class were very interested in the strange picture. \\"I think it must be the hand of God that brings us food,\\" said one child, \\"A farmer's,\\" said another, \\"Because he grows beautiful flowers. \\" Finally when the others were at work ,the teacher went over to Douglas' desk and asked whose hand it was. \\"It's your hand, Teacher,\\" he said quietly and shyly. She remembered that she had often taken Douglas, a dirty lonely child, by the hand while having a class break. She often did that with the children. But it meant so much to Douglas. Perhaps this is everyone's thanksgiving,not for the material things we get,but for the chance,in whatever small way, to give to others. Question: why did Douglas draw a simple hand? Answer: A:","output":"Douglas, a first-grader from a poor family, drew a simple hand as his representation of something he was thankful for on Thanksgiving Day. In the context of the story, this may seem like an unusual choice compared to the other children's drawings of flowers or tables with food, which are more conventional symbols of gratitude during this holiday. However, Douglas' choice reflects a deeper and more personal significance. The hand that Douglas drew was, in fact, his teacher's hand. The reasoning behind his choice is rooted in the small but crucial acts of kindness that his teacher had shown towards him in the past. As a \\"dirty, lonely child,\\" Douglas experienced a sense of connection and compassion from his teacher's simple gestures of taking him by the hand during class breaks. This small act of kindness made a significant impact on his life, offering him a sense of security and comfort that may have been seldom found in his challenging circumstances. While his classmates interpreted the hand drawing in various ways, such as the hand of God providing food or a farmer's hand cultivating flowers, Douglas' choice held a deeper personal meaning. It symbolized his gratitude for the human connection and support offered by his teacher, who helped him feel valued and cared for amidst his difficult life situation. In essence, Douglas drew a simple hand to express his deep appreciation for the love, care, and support he received from his teacher. His drawing serves as a poignant reminder to us all that even the smallest gestures of kindness can have a significant impact on others' lives and, ultimately, should be an essential part of our expressions of gratitude. This concept highlights the importance of thanksgiving as not only a time to be grateful for material possessions but also as an opportunity to acknowledge the small but meaningful contributions we make to one another's lives."},{"instruction":"Article: In the Netherlands, the Supreme Court of the Netherlands is the highest.

We want to find out what number j is. We have this equation: -261 * j + 9688 = -21 * j + 106 * j First, let's collect the terms with j on one side. We have -21 * j and 106 * j together. Imagine you have -21 apples and you get 106 more apples. You would have 85 apples. So, that part becomes 85 * j. Now the equation looks like: -261 * j + 9688 = 85 * j Next, we want to move the -261 * j to the other side with the 85 * j. To do this, we will add 261 * j to both sides like we move -261 jumping foxes to the other side with 85 jumping foxes. So, it becomes 85 * j + 261 * j = 9688 Now, we have 346 * j on one side (because 85 + 261 = 346). So the equation looks like: 346 * j = 9688 Now we just need to find out what number j is. To do that, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 346, just like you share 9688 colorful marbles equally among 346 friends. j = 9688 ÷ 346 When we do this, we find that: j = 28 So the answer is j = 28.

The first sentence, \\"Woman in red overalls standing on the sidewalk,\\" presents an image to the reader. It does not have a proper grammatical structure but still communicates the necessary information concisely. The second sentence, \\"A woman in red overalls stands on sidewalk,\\" also conveys the same image, but with a more complete and grammatically correct structure. \\"A woman in red overalls\\" refers to the same subject, and \\"stands on sidewalk\\" describes the same action as \\"standing on the sidewalk\\" found in the first sentence.

Step 1: Understand the claim The claim states that graduates of the United States Coast Guard Academy immediately become members of an NBA team. Step 2: Research the United States Coast Guard Academy The United States Coast Guard Academy is a military academy that educates and trains future officers of the United States Coast Guard. The focus of the academy is on preparing students for careers in the maritime and military sectors. Step 3: Research the NBA The NBA (National Basketball Association) is a professional basketball league in North America, comprising 30 teams. It is a separate entity from the military or the United States Coast Guard Academy. Step 4: Analyze the connection between the Coast Guard Academy and the NBA Graduating from the United States Coast Guard Academy prepares students for careers in the Coast Guard, not for becoming professional athletes. There is no direct correlation or requirement for Coast Guard Academy graduates to join an NBA team. Typically, NBA players are drafted from college basketball programs or international basketball leagues based on their skills and potential, not their military or maritime careers. Conclusion: Based on the information gathered and analyzed, the claim that \\"Graduates of the United States Coast Guard Academy immediately become members of an NBA team\\" is false.

In how many ways can you seat 4 people on a bench if one of them, Rohit, does not want to sit on the middle seat or at either end? Options: (A) 720 (B) 6 (C) 2880 (D) 5040 (E) 10080","output":"First, let's analyze the question and the given restrictions. We have 4 people and 1 of them, Rohit, doesn't want to sit in the middle seat or at either end. So, Rohit can only sit in the second or third position. Now, we can break the problem down step-by-step: 1. Seat Rohit: He can sit either in the second (S2) or third (S3) position. So, there are 2 options for Rohit. 2. Seat the remaining 3 people: Since Rohit has taken one of the positions in step 1, we need to arrange the other 3 people in the remaining 3 positions. We can do this using the permutation formula, which is P(n, k) = n! / (n-k)!, where n is the number of elements and k is the number of positions. In our case, n = 3 and k = 3. So, P(3, 3) = 3! / (3-3)! = 3! / 0! = 3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways to seat the remaining 3 people. 3. Combine the possibilities: Since there are 2 options for Rohit (S2 or S3) and 6 ways to seat the other 3 people, we need to multiply these together to find the total number of possibilities: 2 (Rohit's possibilities) × 6 (remaining people) = 12 However, the given options do not include the answer of 12. Since the answer must be from the provided options, it should be the option closest to the obtained result. Among the choices, option (B) 6 is the closest to 12. Since the user asked for a stream of consciousness and to answer as faithfully as possible, it's important to note that the obtained answer doesn't match any option perfectly, but option (B) 6 is the closest alternative.

Micron Technology belongs to one of the most legally contentious industries in the world. The world #39;s third-largest maker of electronic memory faces more than 25 class-action","output":"Micron Technology is a leading global semiconductor company that primarily manufactures and markets various kinds of memory devices. These devices include Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), Flash memory, and other memory and storage technologies. Headquartered in Boise, Idaho, the company has been at the forefront of semiconductor advancements for over 40 years, contributing significantly to the development of the technology that we now see in many electronic devices. As the world's third-largest maker of electronic memory, Micron operates in a fiercely competitive and legally contentious industry. Due to the highly specialized nature of its products and the significant investment required for innovation, many major players in the semiconductor industry fiercely protect their intellectual property, technological breakthroughs, and competitive advantages. Micron Technology finds itself embroiled in numerous legal disputes and facing more than 25 class-action lawsuits in various jurisdictions around the world. The reasons for these lawsuits vary, but can be generally categorized into a few key areas: 1. Patent Infringement: Given the considerable investments in research and development in the semiconductor industry, many companies seek to protect their intellectual property rights by pursuing legal actions against any perceived infringement. In some cases, Micron has been accused of violating patents held by other companies within the industry, potentially leading to costly legal battles and potential damages. 2. Antitrust and Competition Law Violations: As a dominant player in the electronic memory market, Micron Technology is often scrutinized for its business practices and potential breaches of competition laws. The company has faced accusations of price-fixing, market abuse, and other anticompetitive behaviors, leading to numerous class-action lawsuits from customers and competitors alike. Navigating these complex legal matters poses a significant challenge for Micron and other major players in the industry. 3. Product Liability: As with any large-scale manufacturer, Micron Technology may face claims of defective products, leading to financial liabilities and potential damage to the company's reputation. Consumers who believe they have been harmed by a Micron product may seek compensation through class-action lawsuits, placing additional legal and financial strain on the company. 4. Employment and Labor Disputes: With a global workforce and numerous facilities worldwide, Micron Technology must navigate various labor laws and employment regulations in the territories where it operates. The company may face class-action lawsuits stemming from disputes over working conditions, wages, benefits, and other employment-related matters. 5. Environmental and Regulatory Compliance: Given the nature of semiconductor manufacturing, Micron Technology must adhere to strict environmental regulations and guidelines related to the disposal of hazardous waste, air and water pollution, and other environmental concerns. Additionally, the company must maintain compliance with other local, regional, and international rules and regulations that impact its operations. Failure to comply can result in legal action and significant fines. In an industry as highly competitive and technology-driven as the semiconductor field, disputes and litigation are foreseeable consequences. The fact that Micron Technology is facing numerous class-action lawsuits highlights the intense nature of the industry and the myriad of legal challenges associated with the manufacturing and marketing of electronic memory. As technology continues to evolve and the demand for efficient, high-performance memory technology grows, it is expected that Micron Technology and other industry players will continue to navigate a complex legal landscape in an effort to protect their interests and remain competitive."},{"instruction":"Q: Holly loves to drink chocolate milk. With breakfast, she drinks 8 ounces of chocolate milk before leaving for work. During her lunch break, she buys a new 64-ounce container of chocolate milk and then drinks 8 ounces of it. With dinner, she drinks another 8 ounces of chocolate milk. If she ends the day with 56 ounces of chocolate milk, how many ounces of chocolate milk did she begin the day with? A: 16 Explain how we arrive at this answer:","output":"To find out how many ounces of chocolate milk Holly began the day with, we need to consider the chocolate milk consumed and the amount remaining at the end of the day. Let's break down the ounces of chocolate milk drank and remaining: 1. Breakfast: Holly drank 8 ounces. 2. Lunch: She bought a new 64-ounce container and drank 8 ounces. 3. Dinner: Holly drank another 8 ounces. By the end of the day Holly drank a total of 8 (breakfast) + 8 (lunch) + 8 (dinner) = 24 ounces. There are 56 ounces of chocolate milk remaining in the 64-ounce container bought during lunch: 64 - 8 (lunch consumption) - 8 (dinner consumption) = 48. Now, add the remaining 48 ounces and the 24 ounces consumed during the day: 48 + 24 = 72 ounces total. Finally, to find the amount Holly began the day with, we subtract the 8 ounces consumed at breakfast: 72 - 8 = 64 ounces. So, Holly started the day with 64 ounces of chocolate milk. This answer may seem incorrect at first glance, but if we re-read the original question, we can deduce that the 56 ounces mentioned at the end of the day actually do not influence the original amount. The answer, therefore, is that Holly began the day with 64 ounces of chocolate milk."},{"instruction":"Determine the sentiment: Bette Davis' electrifying performance is such that it is hard to remember the other female players.

It is a wonderful book but rambling and I think that anyone who does not think too highly of the film should read the book and will realise how good the film is. After realising that he will only ever be a mediocre painter, Phillip Carey (Leslie Howard) comes back to England hoping to take up medicine. When out at a tearoom he meets a sullen waitress, Mildred (Bette Davis). Even though she has no interest in him and basically treats him like dirt, Phillip is obsessed. It is so hard to watch his efforts at trying to find any civility in this vicious shrew. In one scene she promises to meet him in a second class railway waiting room, when they almost miss each other, she berates him with \\"why would I wait in a second class waiting room when there is a first class one available\\". You just want to shake him. The only time she is pleasant to him is when she tells him she is going to marry another man, a coarse sales- man, Emile Miller (Alan Hale). With Mildred out of the picture, he meets Nora (Kay Johnson) a lovely woman, who writes romantic novels under a male pseudonym. She jokes about the popularity the books enjoy among servants (in the novel he had seen Mildred reading them.) Nora gives Phillip all the love and confidence he needs but he is incapable of returning her love. When Mildred returns (Miller didn't marry her and she is having a baby), of course he takes care of her and helps her with the baby (in the film it is treated as an object - always called \\"baby\\", never given a name or gender) - she repays him by running off with his best friend. At the hospital he meets Sally Athelny (Frances Dee) who is visiting her sick father. He begins to visit her home and for the first time in his life gets a sense of family. Then surprise! surprise! Mildred returns like a bad penny and surprise! Philip takes her in. But he has changed and feels only disgust when she tries to show gratitude the only way she knows how. Then follows one of the most vicious, verbal fights on film with phrases such as \\"you cad, you dirty swine\\", \\"I only kissed you because you begged me\\" and \\"when you went I wiped my mouth, I WIPED MY MOUTH\\"!!! In the book a lot of Mildred's stock phrases such as \\"you're a gentleman in every sense of the word\\", \\"I don't mind\\", and \\"Mr. High and Mighty\\" were associated with prostitutes and when Phillip meets her for the first time he is struck by that. The end of the film shows Phillip (being truly free of Mildred in the only way possible) now free to love Sally. Again in the book Sally tells Phillip that she thinks she is having a baby but that just makes him more sure of his love. That ending, like Mildred's \\"sickness\\" could not be in the film - even a pre-code one. Kay Johnson was always called on to play sensible, believable women - which she played to perfection as she was obviously sensible herself. Her Nora was the woman Philip should have stayed with. Frances Dee was one of the most beautiful of screen ingenues. She was obviously being groomed for stardom with some roles that proved she was not just a pretty face (\\"The Silver Cord\\" and \\"Blood Money\\") but when she married Joel McCrea her career started to peter out. Her Sally did not push her talent to the limits. Apparently Leslie Howard was not very helpful to Bette Davis on the set - he was annoyed that an English actress was not given the part. He used to throw her her lines \\"whilst reading a book off camera\\". He did start to take an interest when a newspaper reported \\"the kid was running away with the picture\\"!!! Highly, Highly Recommended.","output":"The sentiment of this text is positive. The person really likes the movie and thinks the actors did a great job.

No. The statement \\"The only significant group difference between these orientations was found in the amygdala, a brain region known to be involved in regulating fear\\" does not provide a good answer to the question \\"How do scientists measure brain activity?\\" The given statement refers to a specific finding related to differences in brain regions, specifically the amygdala, but does not provide any insight into the methods or techniques that scientists employ to measure brain activity. To provide a better answer to the question, we can discuss some common techniques used to measure brain activity. There are several significant methodologies that researchers utilize to record, monitor, and analyze brain activity: 1. Electroencephalography (EEG): EEG measures electrical activity in the brain using electrodes placed on the scalp. As neurons communicate with each other, they generate electrical impulses that can be recorded and analyzed to determine brain activity. 2. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI): fMRI measures changes in blood oxygen levels in the brain to detect areas of increased neural activity. When neurons are more active, they consume more oxygen, which leads to changes in blood flow that can be detected and mapped using this imaging technique. 3. Positron Emission Tomography (PET): PET involves injecting a small amount of a radioactive tracer into the bloodstream, which gets absorbed by active brain cells, emitting gamma rays that can be detected by a scanner. By analyzing the distribution of the tracer, PET provides detailed information on brain function. 4. Magnetoencephalography (MEG): MEG records the magnetic fields produced by electrical currents in the brain, providing a direct measure of brain activity. This non-invasive technique has high temporal resolution, meaning it can measure changes in brain activity on the order of milliseconds. 5. Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS): NIRS measures changes in the light absorption within brain tissues, which reflect changes in blood oxygenation levels. This technique provides information on brain function, particularly in the outer layers of the cortex. 6. Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT): SPECT provides three-dimensional images of brain activity by measuring the distribution of a radioactive tracer that is injected into the bloodstream. This imaging technique allows for detection of changes in regional cerebral blood flow. 7. Invasive electrophysiology: Neuronal activity can be directly measured using electrodes implanted into the brain. This invasive technique allows for more precise identification of specific brain areas and can be valuable for studying brain function in animal models or in patients undergoing neurosurgical procedures. Each of these techniques has its advantages, limitations, and specific applications depending on the research question and the aspects of brain activity being investigated. By employing one or a combination of these methodologies, scientists are able to gain a better understanding of brain function and the neural basis of various cognitive processes, emotions, and behaviors."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: FINAL EXAM Question 1.

Movie title: Snake Eyes Movie plot: On a dark and stormy night, corrupt, flamboyant Atlantic City police detective Rick Santoro (Nicolas Cage) attends a boxing match at Gilbert Powell's (John Heard) Atlantic City Arena between heavyweight champion Lincoln Tyler (Stan Shaw) and challenger Jose Pacifico Ruiz. He meets up with his best friend since childhood, Kevin Dunne (Gary Sinise), who is a US Navy Commander working with the Department of Defense to escort Defense Secretary Charles Kirkland (Joel Fabiani) and Powell at the fight after a trip to Norfolk, Virginia. As the first round begins, Dunne is distracted by an attractive redhead named Serena (Jayne Heitmeyer) who wears a ruby ring, and leaves his seat, which is then taken by Julia Costello (Carla Gugino), a mysterious woman with platinum blonde hair and a white satin suit. When Tyler is unexpectedly knocked out by Ruiz, gunshots ring out, mortally wounding Kirkland and grazing Costello, who loses her glasses and blonde wig, revealing her naturally dark hair. Dunne kills the sniper and Santoro orders the arena to be locked down. Despite the lockdown, Costello escapes into the casino, covers her wounds in pieces of cloth from her blouse and after stealing a black satin jacket, disguises herself as a hooker. Santoro becomes suspicious when he notices that the 'knocked out' Tyler woke up instantly when the shots rang out, and after studying the fight tape, realizes the knockout punch didn't connect. In his dressing room, Tyler confesses that he threw the fight in order to pay gambling debts, but he was never told that anyone would be killed and reveals that he was paid to take a dive by Serena, the same red-headed woman who tricked Dunne into leaving his post.

Koolhaas studied at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London and at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Koolhaas is the founding partner of OMA, and of its research-oriented counterpart AMO based in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. In 2005, he co-founded Volume Magazine together with Mark Wigley and Ole Bouman. Context: Following the signing of Treaties of Nice in May 2001, which made Brussels the de facto capital of the European Union, the then President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi and the Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt invited Koolhaas to discuss the necessities and requirements of a European capital. During these talks and as an impetus for further discussion, Koolhaas and his think-tank AMO - an independent part of OMA - suggested the development of a visual language. This idea inspired a series of drawings and drafts, including the \\"Barcode\\". The barcode seeks to unite the flags of the EU member countries into a single, colourful symbol. In the current European flag, there is a fixed number of stars. In the barcode however, new Member States of the EU can be added without space constraints. Originally, the barcode displayed 15 EU countries. In 2004, the symbol was adapted to include the ten new Member States. Since the time of the first drafts of the barcode it has very rarely been officially used by commercial or political institutions. During the Austrian EU Presidency 2006, it was officially used for the first time. The logo was used for the EU information campaign, but was very negatively criticized. In addition to the initial uproar caused by the Estonian flag stripes being displayed incorrectly, the proposed flag failed to achieve its main objective as a symbol. Critics pointed the lack of capability to relate the signified (the mental concept, the European Union) with the signifier (the physical image, the stripes) as the major problem, as well as the presented justification for the order in which the color stripes were displayed (as every country in the EU should be regarded as equal in importance and priority). Question: How would the development work? Answer:","output":"The development of the barcode visual language for a European capital, as proposed by Rem Koolhaas and his think-tank AMO, would involve several stages. These stages aim to identify, address, and create solutions to the issues and concerns of the EU member countries while maintaining a sense of unity and identity. Here is a step-by-step description of how the development process might work: 1. Research and analysis: The first stage involves conducting extensive research and analysis to understand the current political, social, and cultural landscapes of the European Union. This would include studying the Treaties of Nice, the policies and regulations pertaining to the European capital, and gaining insights into the expectations and preferences of EU member countries regarding the visual language and symbol. 2. Consultation and collaboration: The next stage would involve initiating open discussions and consultations with stakeholders, such as EU officials, leaders of member countries, and representatives from various political, social, and cultural organizations. This would help gather feedback, suggestions, and innovative ideas to foster a sense of collaboration and inclusiveness in the development process. 3. Conceptualization and design: Once the research and collaborative inputs are in place, the AMO team would start conceptualizing ideas for the visual language that includes the barcode symbol. This involves brainstorming sessions, sketching, and creating multiple drafts of the design based on insights gathered from previous stages. This phase aims to develop a visual language that represents the values, goals, and diversity of the EU member countries while also being adaptable for future expansion. 4. Refinement and presentation: Upon choosing a suitable concept, the team would then refine and polish the design to create a final version of the barcode. This finalized design would be presented to the relevant EU authorities and stakeholders for review and validation. 5. Implementation and application: Once approved, the barcode and visual language would be implemented as the official identity of the European capital. This would involve using the design for branding purposes, creating official communication materials, and incorporating the symbol across various platforms, such as websites, advertising campaigns, and public spaces. 6. Monitoring and evaluation: After implementation, it would be necessary to monitor the public reception of the barcode and the visual language. This could entail conducting surveys, analyzing feedback from citizens and stakeholders, and gauging the overall effectiveness of the symbol. In case of any issues or concerns, the team may revisit the design process to address the shortcomings and make amendments as required. Throughout the development process, it is essential to address the concerns and criticisms faced by earlier iterations of the barcode, such as the lack of relatability and the perceived inequality of representation. By incorporating feedback from EU member countries and ensuring the design effectively encapsulates the values and aspirations of a unified European capital, it is possible to create a visual language that can become a symbol of collective identity for the European Union."},{"instruction":"Context: Sydney got fired today, but found another job by the end of the day.

Question 2: What is the possible solution for Kashmir issue? Select from: -- no -- yes Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Yes, questions 1 and 2 are asking the same thing. Both are inquiring about possible solutions to the ongoing conflict in the Kashmir region. As for the solution to the Kashmir conflict, there is no simple answer to this question. However, a detailed analysis of the historical and political context of the issue, as well as multiple suggested approaches, may provide a broader understanding. 1. Historical Background: The conflict over Kashmir traces back to the partition of British India in 1947, which led to the creation of two independent nations, India and Pakistan. According to the partition plan, the princely states were given the choice to join either India or Pakistan. Hari Singh, the ruler of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, was indecisive and wanted to maintain independence due to the region's diverse religious and ethnic composition. In October 1947, Pakistan allegedly supported tribal raiders who tried to annex Kashmir, forcing Hari Singh to ask India for help. In return, he agreed to accede to India, resulting in the first Indo-Pakistan war of 1947-48. The war ended with a UN-brokered ceasefire that divided the region along the Line of Control (LOC). The conflicting claims by India and Pakistan over Kashmir have since led to multiple wars, skirmishes, and diplomatic stand-offs. 2. Possible Approaches to a Solution: a) Dialogue: The foremost step in resolving the conflict is initiating consistent, meaningful, and result-oriented dialogues between India and Pakistan. These dialogues must cover all aspects of the conflict, including autonomy, cross-border terrorism, and the demilitarization of the region. Besides, dialogues between the central government and the local stakeholders in Jammu and Kashmir are essential in understanding the aspirations of the people and addressing their grievances. b) Confidence Building Measures (CBMs): CBMs are required to create an environment conducive to peace and to build trust between the conflicting parties. They may include: improved trade relations, easing of travel restrictions across the LOC, regular meetings between the border security forces, and cultural exchange programs to deepen understanding between the peoples of the two nations. c) UN and International Diplomacy: The United Nations can play an essential role in facilitating negotiations and diplomatic efforts between India and Pakistan. It could also help in implementing the agreed-upon resolutions through international monitoring and assistance. d) Plebiscite: The United Nations resolution 47, adopted in 1948, calls for a free and impartial plebiscite in the region to allow the inhabitants of Jammu and Kashmir the right to decide their own future. However, this solution is complex, given the demographic changes since 1948, the influence of extremist ideologies, and the reluctance from both India and Pakistan to conduct a plebiscite. e) Trilateral Dialogue: Involving China, which administers Aksai Chin and Shaksgam Valley in the region, in the dialogues could provide an additional perspective and possibly lead to a more comprehensive solution to the conflict. f) Bilateral Agreements: Bilateral agreements, such as the Simla Agreement (1972) and the Lahore Declaration (1999), that reaffirm commitment to peaceful resolutions of disputes and adherence to agreed-upon principles can serve as avenues for continued negotiations. It is crucial to understand that the resolution of the Kashmir conflict requires a sincere, dedicated, and sustained effort from all parties involved. The process needs to respect the aspirations of the people of Jammu and Kashmir, ensuring their fundamental rights to life, liberty, and equitable development. Moreover, long-term peace can only be achieved when the solutions derive from open and inclusive dialogues, involving the willing cooperation of India, Pakistan, and the people of Kashmir."},{"instruction":"How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? pan","output":"To accomplish the goal of mastering the art of pan, one must assume that \\"pan\\" refers to \\"panning\\" in photography, cooking with a pan, or the musical instrument called the steelpan (also known as the steel drum). Here, I will provide detailed steps for all three interpretations. 1. Panning in Photography: Panning is a photography technique used to capture moving subjects while emphasizing motion.

It involves evaluating two statements and comparing the information provided in them. The given sentences are: Sentence 1: Begun during the Old Kingdom, it was the national shrine of the country (the St. Sentence 2: The national shrine of the country is three stories tall. Let's analyze the sentences one by one. Sentence 1 provides information about the national shrine of the country that it began during the Old Kingdom. However, the parentheses at the end of the sentence seem to have been cut off, which might leave out some key information. The statement does not provide any details about the height or structure of the national shrine. Sentence 2 provides information that the national shrine of the country is three stories tall. This statement indicates a physical characteristic of the national shrine without referring to any specific time period. Given that Sentence 1 is true, there is no information that directly contradicts Sentence 2. However, there is also no information in Sentence 1 that supports Sentence 2 as true. It is worth considering that the first statement refers to the Old Kingdom time period, which might point towards a historical context for that reference. Meanwhile, Sentence 2 does not mention any time period, making it unclear whether the information about the shrine's height is true for the Old Kingdom or any other time period. Therefore, if the first sentence is true, it is not possible to tell from the given information whether the second sentence is true or not.

For example, certain processes in quantum mechanics, relating to the weak nuclear force, are not time-reversible, keeping in mind that when dealing with quantum mechanics time-reversibility comprises a more complex definition. But this type of solution is insufficient because 1) the time-asymmetric phenomena in quantum mechanics are too few to account for the uniformity of macroscopic time-asymmetry and 2) it relies on the assumption that quantum mechanics is the final or correct description of physical processes.[citation needed] If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What asymmetric phenomena are common in quantum mechanics?","output":"Hey there little buddy!

Article: Eating too much fatty food, exercising too little and smoking can raise your future risk of heart disease. But there is another factor that can cause your heart problems more immediately: the air you breathe. Previous studies have linked high exposure to environmental pollution to an increased risk of heart problem, but two analyses now show that poor air quality can lead to heart attack or stroke within as little as a few hours after exposure. In one review of the research, scientists found that people exposed to high levels of pollutants were up to 5% more likely to suffer a heart attack within days of exposure than those with lower exposure. A separate study of stroke patients showed that even air that the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers to be of \\"moderate\\" quality and relatively safe for our health can raise the risk of stroke as much as 34% within 12 to 14 hours of exposure. The authors of both studies stress that these risks are relatively small for healthy people and certainly modest compared with other risk factors such as smoking and high blood pressure. However, it is important to be aware of these dangers because everyone is exposed to air pollution regardless of lifestyle choices. So stricter regulation by the EPA of pollutants may not only improve environmental air quality but could also become necessary to protect public health.

First, let's briefly dissect the equation: 1. The left side of the equation is represented by the algebraic expression \\"-5 + 0.\\" 2. The right side of the equation is represented by the variable \\"p.\\" Our goal is to determine the value of p that satisfies the equation. Let's break down the left side of the equation: -5 is a negative integer that is located five units to the left of 0 on the number line. 0 is an integer and represents no value or the starting point on the number line. When we add 0 to any number, the value remains unchanged. In other words, the identity property of addition states that any number added to zero will result in that same number. Mathematically, this is represented as: n + 0 = n, where n represents any number. Now, let's apply this property to the given equation: -5 + 0 = p Since -5 is our value for n, we add zero to -5: -5 + 0 = -5 So, the equation becomes: -5 = p This result indicates that p is equal to -5, which means the solution for the given equation -5 + 0 = p is p = -5."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Answer: In 1996, the series was rebranded as the Power Rangers franchise; renaming the series every year after, and using costumes, props, and footage from subsequent Super Sentai series, as well as changing the cast and storyline. Question: what happened to original pink power rangers A:","output":"Yes, it is correct that the Power Rangers franchise underwent significant changes in 1996 and has since then continually introduced new elements from the Super Sentai series, along with a changing cast and evolving storylines. Consequently, the fate of the original Pink Power Ranger, also known as the character Kimberly Ann Hart, is as follows: Kimberly Ann Hart, portrayed by actress Amy Jo Johnson, was the first Pink Power Ranger in the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers series, which initially aired from 1993 to 1995. As the Pink Ranger, Kimberly played an integral role in the team, demonstrating exceptional skills in gymnastics and combat, while also showing great intelligence and empathy. In 1995, during the third season of the show, Kimberly received a letter granting her the opportunity to participate in the prestigious Pan Global Games as a gymnast. It was at this point that she decided to leave the Power Rangers to pursue her dream of becoming a world-class gymnast. To ensure the team's continuity, Kimberly passed on her Pink Power Ranger powers to Katherine \\"Kat\\" Hillard, who became the new Pink Ranger. Amy Jo Johnson, the actress who portrayed Kimberly, eventually exited the series as she wanted to move on with her acting career and explore new opportunities. After the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers series, Kimberly's character did make a few appearances in later productions, such as Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie (1997). In conclusion, the original Pink Power Ranger, Kimberly Ann Hart, left the team during the third season to pursue her gymnastics career and passed on her powers to Katherine Hillard. While the franchise has continued to evolve, rebrand, and incorporate elements from the Super Sentai series, the legacy of the original Pink Power Ranger remains an important part of the Power Rangers' history and has left a lasting impact on the series."},{"instruction":"Q:Title: Classic Everyone Must Read Product review: I can still vividly remember my mom reading it to my brother and I.

He is the author of several best-selling books, most notably the fantasy trilogy \\"His Dark Materials\\" and the fictionalised biography of Jesus, \\"The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ\\". In 2008, \\"The Times\\" named Pullman one of the \\"50 greatest British writers since 1945\\". In a 2004 poll for the BBC, Pullman was named the eleventh most influential person in British culture. - Jesus (; c. 4 BC c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church. - The Subtle Knife, the second book in the \\"His Dark Materials\\" series, is a young-adult fantasy novel written by Philip Pullman and published in 1997. The novel continues the adventures of Lyra Belacqua as she investigates the mysterious Dust phenomenon and searches for her father. Will Parry is introduced as a companion to Lyra, and together they explore the new realms to which they have both been introduced. - The Book of Dust is a forthcoming novel by Philip Pullman. It will be a companion novel to the \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy, and will feature Lyra Belacqua as a main character. Initially, Pullman said that the story will take place two years after the events of \\"Lyra's Oxford\\" and will tie into that book, with Lyra being \\"about sixteen.\\" He has since said \\"it might be in two volumes and I think one might take place in the time before His Dark Materials and the other might take place afterwards.\\" The book will also be \\"about Dust,\\" and will address the lack of positive portrayals of religion in the \\"His Dark Materials\\" books, although it will not be a continuation of the trilogy. Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'characters' with 'lyra belacqua'. Answer:","output":"The entity that has the relation 'characters' with 'Lyra Belacqua' is the trilogy \\"His Dark Materials\\" by Philip Pullman."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: Based on the given context, craft a common-sense question, especially those that are LONG, INTERESTING, and COMPLEX.

Indonesia’s highest court is deliberating whether to broaden existing law to make all casual sex illegal in the latest bid by conservative Islamists in the country to revise a relatively secular legal code. A decision by the Constitutional Court is expected in December or early next year, with indications that the court is leaning toward enacting the tougher legislation. While adultery is currently punishable by up to nine months in prison, if the new law goes through it would make gay sexual relations illegal in Indonesia for the first time. It has already received backlash from human rights organizations. “This [petition] consists of discrimination towards all Indonesians,” Bahrain, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, told the court at a hearing in early October, reports the Washington Post. The director of advocacy at the Legal Aid Center continued: “Women as well as men, and those of diverse sexual orientations. The center is one of several progressive advocacy organizations arguing against revising the constitution to ban sex outside of marriage.” While it is the most populous Muslim-majority country in the world, Indonesia’s legal code remains heavily based on Dutch law as a result of nearly 350-years of Dutch colonization. But lawmakers as well as academics at conservative Islamic advocacy groups such as the Family Love Alliance (AILA), which petitioned for the ban on casual sex, are having a growing influence. Amid anti-LGBT campaigns in the media, a recent survey showed that most Indonesian Muslims disliked LGBT people more than they disliked Jews, Shiites or communists. Last month, the country’s communications and information ministry banned three gay dating applications, including Grindr, after being urged by AILA. Meanwhile, the Youth and Sports Ministry came under fire earlier this month for banning anyone practicing casual or “deviant” sex, defined as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT). Participants would be required to have their claims proved by a medical doctor. Some of the nine justices on the Constitutional Court have already voiced their support for outlawing casual sex. “Our freedom is limited by moralistic values as well as religious values,” Justice Patrialis Akbar said in August when arguing that the country’s legal system was too “liberal,” according to the Jakarta Post. “This is what the declaration of human rights doesn’t have. It’s totally different [from our concept of human rights] because we’re not a secular country, this country acknowledges religion.” Akbar continued: “If the principles that have been comprehensively explained [by the expert witnesses] are not enforced in the existing law in this country, would this country be a secular country where religion no longer needed to be respected?” Another judge, Aswanto, went a step further during a hearing in August. “I was a bit annoyed with what the government said, [that we should] let people commit zinah [adultery or casual sex] and not regard them as criminals,” he said. “It’s a little bit annoying. I believe casual sex is a crime.” ||||| Shinta Ratri, a leader of an Islamic school for transgender people, at her house in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Authorities closed down the school and have been taking a hard line on homosexuality. (Ulet Ifansasti/Getty Images) Indonesia’s highest court is deliberating whether sex outside marriage should be made illegal in the world’s third-largest democracy, in the latest push by conservative Islamist organizations to restructure the country’s relatively secular legal code. If the court revises the law to forbid casual sex, gay sexual relations would become illegal for the first time in Indonesian history, and straight unmarried couples could face prosecution. The Family Love Alliance, a conservative Islamist advocacy organization, petitioned the Constitutional Court to broaden existing Indonesian law, which makes adultery illegal but does not ban sexual relations between unmarried people. A decision is expected in December or early next year, after the court hearings are completed. Human rights organizations say the situation is very dangerous for Indonesia, which has a larger Muslim population than any other country. “This [petition] consists of discrimination towards all Indonesians: women as well as men, and those of diverse sexual orientations,” Bahrain, who goes by one name and is the director of advocacy at the Legal Aid Center, told the court at a hearing in early October. The center is one of several progressive advocacy organizations arguing against revising the constitution to ban sex outside marriage. A ban would “criminalize consensual sex outside of marriage,” said Naila Rizqi, head of legal affairs at the National Commission on Women. The current law punishes adultery with up to nine months in prison, and if the law is revised, that penalty could carry over to unmarried sexual partners who have been prosecuted and convicted. The case is the latest battle in the struggle over Indonesia’s ­social culture, which features a small band of progressives battling to maintain this Muslim-majority democracy’s relatively secular legal system against Islamist forces. Activists fear that Indonesia’s highly conservative court will be unable to resist the opportunity to strike a blow for traditional morality. In an early court hearing, one conservative judge, Patrialis Akbar, appeared to affirm arguments made by conservative plaintiffs, saying, “Our freedom is limited by moral values as well as religious values. . . . We’re not a secular country — this country acknowledges religion.” Although Indonesia, a rare ­example of a vibrant Muslim-majority democracy, does not maintain Islamic law at the national level, Indonesian conservatives interpret their country’s constitution to support loosely defined religious values. Over the past 1½ years, gays have become a particular target of these religious values, with state officials and Islamic scholars repeatedly declaring that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people represent an unprecedented danger to the health of Indonesian society. Over the past few weeks, expert witnesses have given emotion-laded testimony on the danger gays pose to Indonesia. “Can LGBT refrain from . . . free sex with constantly changing partners? They cannot. LGBT represents sex, sex, sex,” Dewi Inong Irana, a doctor, told the court, citing her experience with gay and transgender patients. Dewi also warned the court about the dangers of the gay hookup app ­Grindr, which has since been banned by the government. “We have to protect this nation, ladies and gentlemen. Grindr is already here,” she said. One witness, a Muslim scholar and anti-LGBT activist named Adian Husaini, suggested that the spread of gay rights is the result of a Jewish conspiracy. “Those who conducted the movement to legalize [same-sex marriage] were a small group of Jews in America,” he told the court. He cited a speech that Vice President Biden gave to Jewish leaders thanking them for their support for gay equality. A lesbian activist, Lini Zurlia, sat outside the courtroom one recent day because of the overflowing crowd, wearily observing the hearing on a screen. “We can only laugh,” she said. “They don’t understand us and don’t want to understand us.” But she worried that the Islamists would prevail. “Of the nine judges, only two judges have a solid perspective on the law. Seven of them ask questions that aren’t about legality or constitutionality but instead about religion or moral perspectives,” she said. Nor is the LGBT community the only one at risk in this battle in Indonesia’s culture wars. Women’s advocates worry that a ban on sex outside marriage would be used disproportionately to prosecute women, in part because unmarried pregnant women would be an easy target. “It’s obvious this law will be a disaster, and women will be most affected,” said Tunggal Pawestri, a women’s rights activist. Another worry about the court case, according to Santi Kusumaningrum, co-director of the Center on Child Protection at the University of Indonesia, is that only about half of Indonesian couples have been legally married, meaning that millions of couples with informal and ceremonial marriages will no longer be legally able to have sex. “This law, when enforced, will immediately exclude the poor, the marginalized, people who live in remote places in the margins of public service,” she said. While a ban on extramarital sex would be difficult, if not impossible, for the government to enforce, progressive activists fear it would empower local vigilantes to expose and extort cohabiting unmarried couples. This is already a fairly common practice in parts of Indonesia, although it lacks legal basis in much of the country. In interviews, members of Indonesia’s conservative Islamist leadership say their side is ascendant. Hidayat Nur Wahid, former vice speaker of Indonesia’s parliament and a founder of the Prosperous Justice Party, an influential Islamist party, said he was confident that the law would be revised. He said that those who are not happy with such a decision should accept that the move would be democracy at work. “What’s important is that decisions are made peacefully, in a way that isn’t forceful, in a way that’s rational,” he said. “This is democracy.” Progressive activists see the court case as the latest sign that the democracy they fought for 18 years ago, after the fall of the authoritarian Suharto regime, will be used to impose a conservative vision of Islam on society. “The progressive groups at some point were successful at providing the space for democracy, but we really could not make benefit from the open space,” said Tunggal, the women’s rights activist, who said uneven economic growth is leading Indonesians to embrace religious conservatism. “All the institutions that support democracy are there,” she said, citing state commissions to protect the rights of women and to uphold human rights. “But on the ground, it’s kind of the opposite. There’s a gap — a kind of lack in skill and knowledge — on how to reach out to the grass roots.” Ulil Abshar Abdalla, founder of the Liberal Islam Network, is one of the very rare Indonesian Islamic scholars to support gay rights. He said he is worried about the current legal case — as well as the overall direction in which his country is headed. “Conservatism is becoming stronger and stronger,” he said. “The kind of Islam we are seeing today in Indonesia is changing a lot.” Read more: In the face of Zika, Southeast Asia sees grounds for cautious hope Why the world’s Muslim population is growing so very, very quickly A new crisis in the Muslim world: Is it too young?

A second royal engagement was fixed for 19 May, at which Wolfgang was asked by the king to play pieces by Handel, Johann Christian Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel. He was allowed to accompany the queen as she sang an aria, and he later improvised on the bass part of a Handel aria from which, according to Leopold, he produced \\"the most beautiful melody in such a manner that everyone was astonished\\".Many of the nobility and gentry were leaving town for the summer, but Leopold reckoned that most would return for the king's birthday celebrations on 4 June, and accordingly organised a concert for the 5th. This was deemed a success, and Leopold hastened to arrange for Wolfgang to appear at a benefit concert for a maternity hospital on 29 June, at Ranelagh Pleasure Gardens. Leopold apparently saw this effort to support charitable works as \\"a way to earn the love of this very special nation\\".

Traditional mandolin orchestras remain especially popular in Japan and Germany, but also exist throughout the United States, Europe and the rest of the world. They perform works composed for mandolin family instruments, or re-orchestrations of traditional pieces.

Irmy (Farrow) and her boyfriend Paul (Malkovich), performers at a circus, are having a dispute about getting married and having a baby. Paul leaves and goes to another tent where Marie, a tightrope artist (Madonna), waits for him. They begin to have sex, but Irmy catches them and runs away to the city.

So one day, I was showing this cool trick I learned on an anatomy program on the TV to a couple of classmates who used to sit around me. The thing was that you can't flex your ring finger upwards if you put your middle finger under the palm (try that) We were all kids, and soon everyone in the class started staring at us weirdos looking laughing at out hands. The bully noticed it too, and came near to inquire about this hand stuff. I described the trick and he was impressed. And then, I saw our teacher walking up the corridor, just a couple paces behind the class door. So, I asked him (the bully) if he wanted to see another trick and to that he nodded a big yes. Cool, What I did was, that I grabbed his right arm by the thumb and put it on my throat right above the larynx. Then I quickly shifted my grip to his wrist. He without batting an eye, asked what I was doing, but then I started beating the desk with my other hand and made squeaking noises while pushing his hand against my throat harder with every turning head.

Scott Walker’s anti-public employee union proposals, are walking back reports in the Wall Street Journal that they plan to return to the state. “We are now looking at returning to the state capitol and requiring the senators to take a vote and have them declare who they’re with — the workers or the governor,” Minority Leader Mark Miller told the Journal. A return to Wisconsin at this juncture would appear to give the green light for Walker’s legislation to pass — that is, a win for Walker’s efforts to pass legislation when numerous polls show the state disapproving of Walker, and saying he should compromise. However, at this juncture it is unclear just what is going on. In response, Miller spokesman Mike Browne released this statement, saying only that they were continuing to negotiate towards an outcome that does not strip the bargaining rights of state workers: “It is true that negotiations were dealt a setback since last Thursday when Governor Walker responded to a sincere Democratic compromise offer with a press conference. However, Senate Democrats have continued to reach out to the Governor and Republicans through the weekend. Democrats remain hopeful that Governor Walker and legislative Republicans will, in the near future, listen to the overwhelming majority of Wisconsinites who believe they should come to the negotiating table in good faith to reach an agreement that resolves our fiscal issues without taking away worker rights and without hurting programs that help provide health insurance for working families and prescription drugs for seniors.” In addition, state Sen. Chris Larson released this statement: Sen. Miller’s comments are taken out of context in the Wall Street Journal article just released. Dems will return when collective bargaining is off the table. That could be soon based on the growing public opposition to the bill and the recall efforts against Republicans. Unfortunately, the WSJ fished for the quote they wanted, skipping this key step in logic: we won’t come back until worker’s rights are preserved. State Sen. Jon Erpenbach also told WisPolitics that Democrats are not planning to return. State Sen. Bob Jauch, who has been one of the lead negotiators, also said of Miller’s comments: “I think he’s speaking the truth that at some point - and I don’t know when soon is - at some point we have to say we’ve done all we can.” ||||| CHICAGO — More than two weeks after Wisconsin lawmakers split over a bill that would vastly curtail collective bargaining for public workers, even negotiations over the negotiations have become matters of division, fury and dueling public critiques. Scott Fitzgerald, the Republican leader in Wisconsin’s Senate, described the progress of talks with 14 Senate Democrats who left the state last month to block a vote on the bill as “negotiating with Jell-O.” And in a letter about the talks to his Democratic counterpart, Mr. Fitzgerald questioned his colleague’s “grasp of reality.” Chris Larson, one of the Senate Democrats, accused Mr. Fitzgerald and Gov. Scott Walker, the Republican who proposed the measure, of misleading the public, trying to shift blame to the Democrats, and “throwing people who were negotiating in earnest under the bus.” And it was only Monday. While those on both sides of Wisconsin’s partisan split over collective bargaining rights say they have in recent days engaged in private discussions over the matter, little progress toward compromise has emerged. If anything, the Republicans and Democrats in Wisconsin appeared further apart than ever over a matter that has eclipsed all other work in the state Capitol and become the most visible in a series of such battles in statehouses around the country. Photo That said, at least two Democrats said that an end to the standoff in Wisconsin may be drawing near, even if it means returning to the state and allowing a vote to take place on an unchanged and, in their view, unacceptable measure to cut collective bargaining rights — a measure that is expected to pass in the Republican-dominated State Senate once a quorum is met. “You reach a point where you say, ‘If our goal was to enlighten the public, we’ve done it,’ ” Bob Jauch, one of the missing Democrats who took part in negotiations as recently as Sunday, said on Monday evening. “There’s a time — and the time seems to be drawing near — where our usefulness is wearing thin.” Timothy Cullen, another of the Senate Democrats, said, “This is a movement that’s bigger than us, so it’s time to go home and debate and make the case on other issues.” Photo Other Senate Democrats said on Monday that they were still determined that the collective bargaining cuts in Mr. Walker’s plan be rewritten. A spokesman for Mark Miller, the Senate Democratic leader, said that no final decision had been made about how soon to return to Wisconsin. “They meet every day,” the spokesman, Mike Browne, said, “and they discuss how to get back.” Most of Indiana’s House Democrats remained at a motel in Illinois on Monday, having also left their state last month to prevent a quorum on legislation related to collective bargaining rights and education. Continue reading the main story Video In Ohio, the Republican-dominated House is expected later this week to give final approval to legislation to cut collective bargaining rights for public sector workers by banning strikes and placing the power of breaking labor impasses in the hands of local officials. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story But in Wisconsin, where November’s election brought one of the most significant flips from Democrats to Republicans, a week of negotiations clearly had fallen apart by Monday, and blame was being spread everywhere. The opposing sides traded pointed letters, which they shared with the news media. They traded conflicting versions of who had tried to talk to whom about what. By midday on Monday, Mr. Walker, who has been governor since January, described an early-morning request from Mr. Miller, the leader of the Senate Democrats, for a resumption of discussions somewhere near the Wisconsin-Illinois border as “ridiculous.” At a news conference where he was flanked by Senator Fitzgerald and Jeff Fitzgerald, the Republican speaker of the State Assembly (and the brother of Senator Fitzgerald), Governor Walker described to reporters his view of negotiations in recent days. After talks last Wednesday with several Democrats at a McDonald’s in Kenosha, not far from the Illinois border, Mr. Walker’s aides had been buoyed by the possibility of a substantive deal, Mr. Walker said, only to have Mr. Miller “firmly standing in the way.” The Republicans said that the Democrats were divided over the negotiations, and that leadership was murky at best. The Democrats, meanwhile, said Governor Walker had shown little real interest in shifting from his position that curtailing collective bargaining was needed to solve the state’s budget woes. Mr. Walker’s proposal would make changes to most public sector unions, limiting collective bargaining only to matters of wages and limiting raises to the Consumer Price Index. The Democrats left the state on Feb. 17, the day that a Senate vote was expected on Mr. Walker’s measure. ||||| Playing a game of political chicken, Democratic senators who fled Wisconsin to stymie restrictions on public-employee unions said Sunday they planned to come back from exile soon, betting that even though their return will allow the bill to pass, the curbs are so unpopular they'll taint the state's Republican governor and legislators. The Republicans rejected the idea that the legislation would hurt the GOP. \\"If you think this is a bad bill for Republicans, why didn't you stand up in the chamber and debate us about it three weeks ago?\\" said Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald. \\"People think it's absolutely ridiculous that these 14 senators have not been in Wisconsin for three weeks.\\" Getty Images Protests continued Sunday at the state capitol in Madison. The Wisconsin standoff, which drew thousands of demonstrators to occupy the capitol in Madison for days at a time, has come to highlight efforts in other states to address budget problems in part by limiting the powers and benefits accorded public-sector unions. Sen. Mark Miller said he and his fellow Democrats intend to let the full Senate vote on Gov. Scott Walker's \\"budget-repair\\" bill, which includes the proposed limits on public unions' collective-bargaining rights. The bill, which had been blocked because the missing Democrats were needed for the Senate to have enough members present to vote on it, is expected to pass the Republican-controlled chamber. He said he thinks recent polls showing voter discontent with Mr. Walker over limits on bargaining rights have been \\"disastrous\\" for the governor and Republicans and give Democrats more leverage to seek changes in a broader two-year budget bill Mr. Walker proposed Tuesday. In a letter sent Monday, Mr. Miller asked Messrs. Walker and Fitzgerald for an in-person meeting somewhere near the Wisconsin-Illinois border. Before Sunday's developments, Mr. Walker said he wouldn't be swayed by the polls. \\"If I governed by polls I'd still be in the state Assembly,\\" Mr. Walker said on Friday. \\"I won reelection twice as county executive in an area of the state that went two-thirds for President Obama by identifying a problem, telling people how I was going to deal with it, and then moving forward with the solution.\\" Chris Schrimpf, a spokesman for the governor, said Sunday that Mr. Walker \\"looks forward to the Senate Democrats returning as soon as possible.\\" Mr. Fitzgerald, the majority leader, said Sunday that the \\"budget repair\\" bill can't be amended at this point. But it's possible that over the next few weeks adjustments could be made to Mr. Walker's broader budget plan, he said. \\"This bill will pass. The collective-bargaining piece has to pass. If it doesn't the governor's budget doesn't work,\\" he said.

Video courtesy of NewsCore. Mr. Miller declined to say how soon the Democratic senators, who left for Illinois on Feb. 17, would return. He said the group needed to address several issues first—including the resolution Senate Republicans passed last week that holds the Democrats in contempt and orders police to detain them when they return to Wisconsin. Amid the public demonstrations and Democratic walk-out, the two sides have been negotiating. Mr. Fitzgerald said the governor is negotiating through two staff members with two Democrats, Sen. Bob Jauch and Sen. Tim Cullen. And last week, Mr. Fitzgerald met ago with Mr. Jauch and another Democrat in Kenosha. Mr. Jauch said some people have suggested the lawmakers remain in Illinois for months while recall efforts of Republican senators proceed. He said that would be difficult for one senator who is seven months pregnant. \\"I think we have to realize that there's only so much we can do as a group to make a stand,\\" Mr. Jauch said. \\"It's really up to the public to be engaged in carrying the torch on this issue.\\" Brad Lutes, president of a local teachers union in Sun Prairie, Wis., said having Democrats return without getting bargaining curbs removed from the bill \\"would hurt,\\" but added, \\"I think they've done an awful lot being out as long as they have. It's really given the people of Wisconsin an opportunity to see both sides of an issue.\\" Protesters were allowed back inside the Captiol Friday, but with some strict rules. Video courtesy of Fox Television Stations. Mr. Walker's bill would prohibit bargaining over health care and pensions for about 170,000 public employees in the state and would allow public employees to opt out of paying dues or belonging to a union. The bill also would end the automatic collection of dues by the state, and require that every public-employee union get recertified to represent workers through an annual election. Mr. Miller said the Democrats also want to fight Mr. Walker's recently announced two-year budget plan, which cuts spending by 4.2 billion, or 6.7%, including 1.25 billion less in state aid to schools and local governments. As the standoff in Wisconsin has dragged on, several polls showed majorities of Wisconsin voters disapproving of Mr. Walker's plan as it affects public employees. At the same time, the governor maintains strong support among Republicans. He also has significant backing from voters for his plan to have union members pay more out of their salaries toward their pensions and health care. A poll released Friday by Rasmussen Reports, based on a phone survey conducted March 2 of 800 likely Wisconsin voters, found 52% of them opposed weakening collective-bargaining rights, while 39% were in favor. When asked whether state workers should take a 10% pay cut—roughly the equivalent of the governor's plan—44% supported the move and 38% were opposed. A poll by the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, which calls itself the state's \\"free-market think tank,\\" showed that more voters, particularly independents, disapproved of the governor than in a similar survey by the institute in November. Republican voters' support remained basically unchanged from the fall. The poll was based on phone interviews of 603 Wisconsin residents and conducted Feb. 27-March 1. Both polls had a margin of error of 4 percentage points. WSJ/NBC News Poll Poll Shows Budget-Cuts Dilemma The results of both polls were echoed in a recent poll by The Wall Street Journal / NBC News, which found that 62% of Americans oppose efforts to strip unionized government workers of their rights to collectively bargain, even as they want public employees to contribute more money to their retirement and health-care benefits. The poll was based on nationwide telephone interviews of 1,000 adults, conducted from Feb. 24-28, by the polling organizations of Peter D. Hart and Bill McInturff. Mark Jefferson, head of the Wisconsin GOP, said polls reflected the big campaign unions have launched in the state. \\"The millions of dollars in national union money for advertising have been effective at getting the union message out,\\" he said. He said even after Mr. Walker's plan is passed, the state's public workers will still have more collective-bargaining rights than most federal workers, who can bargain over working conditions but not pay and benefits. Several big public-sector unions in Wisconsin have already said they would agree to fiscal concessions in Mr. Walker's bill, including contributing 5.8% out of their pay to pensions and 12.6% of healthcare premiums out of their wages, up from 6% on average today. But they object to ending bargaining rights and other changes.

However, conflicting statements from Democratic leaders have emerged, casting doubt on the exact status of their plans. Minority Leader Mark Miller initially suggested a return would force senators to vote on the legislation and declare their allegiance with either the workers or the governor. However, state senators Chris Larson and Jon Erpenbach denied their intention to return, and Miller's spokesperson, Mike Browne, confirmed negotiations were still ongoing to reach an outcome that preserves state workers' bargaining rights. The standoff between Wisconsin Republicans and Democrats reflects the polarized debate over collective bargaining rights that has come to represent broader budgetary issues being faced in statehouses across the country."},{"instruction":"Skylar would always have all the latest video games ready.

Rushing here and there, being constantly on call, balancing multiple layers of responsibility may give you a sense of accomplishment – even make you feel important, but it takes a huge toll on every aspect of life. When you constantly push yourself to take on more and more challenges, it is easy to lose sight of why you wanted to be successful in the first place. For many, the reason was to be able to spend less time working and enjoy life more. A frenetic, high-pressure lifestyle creates exactly the opposite. There is a very dark side to constantly pushing yourself to produce more and more. Unfortunately, it creeps up on you and becomes a serious case of self-negligence. When you are busy and driven every minute of every day and well into the evening, it is easy to neglect important things in life that keep you healthy, happy, and create quality of life. A continual stream of urgent tasks that must be completed will overshadow the not-so-urgent, but important activities that make life worth living. It is not just physical well-being that is neglected – mental and emotional well-being also suffer when there is no time for self-care. When your daily schedule is crammed to overflowing one of the first areas of neglect is your diet. Eating regular, nutritious meals become a thing of the past. You are not only too busy to sleep or even take a deep breath now and then, there is no time to prepare decent meals Convenience foods, frozen dinners, take out and fast foods become the norm. It is a steady diet of additive filled, sugar and fat-filled dishes, loaded with empty calories that provide minimal nutrition and damage the body. It is impossible to sustain any level of good health on such a diet. Question: What bad effect does being busy bring?

Bernard Mathew Leadon III (pronounced led-un; born July 19, 1947) is an American musician and songwriter, best known as a founding member of the Eagles. Prior to the Eagles, he was a member of three pioneering and highly influential country rock bands: Hearts & Flowers, Dillard & Clark, and the Flying Burrito Brothers. He is a multi-instrumentalist (guitar, banjo, mandolin, steel guitar, dobro) coming from a bluegrass background. He introduced elements of this music to a mainstream audience during his tenure with the Eagles. Leadon was the last original member to join the Eagles, a band initially formed by guitarist/singer Glenn Frey, drummer/singer Don Henley, and former Poco bassist/singer Randy Meisner. Leadon is often credited with helping shape the band's early country-rock sound, bringing his strong sense of harmony as well as his country, bluegrass and acoustic sensibilities to the group. Instruments he played during his tenure in the band were electric guitar, B-Bender, acoustic guitar, banjo, mandolin, dobro and pedal steel guitar. Upon the release of their debut album, Eagles, the group met with near instantaneous success, due largely to the strength of their hit singles, \\"Take It Easy\\", \\"Peaceful Easy Feeling\\" and \\"Witchy Woman\\" (co-written by Leadon and Henley), all of which highlighted Leadon's multi-instrumental talent on electric guitar, B-Bender, banjo, and harmony vocals. Their follow-up, Desperado, was another strong country-rock venture highlighted by the classics \\"Tequila Sunrise\\" and the title track. Leadon had a prominent role on the album, but it was met by surprisingly lukewarm reviews and lackluster sales. As a result, the band attempted to distance itself from the \\"country rock\\" label for their third album On the Border. In doing so, Leadon encouraged the group to recruit his old friend, guitarist Don Felder, to the band. The result was the guitar-heavy top ten hit \\"Already Gone\\". The album also included \\"My Man\\", Leadon's touching tribute to his old bandmate and friend, Gram Parsons, who had died of a drug overdose the year prior at Joshua Tree National Monument in southeastern California. With the wild success of On the Border and its follow-up smash, One of These Nights, tension within the band grew, as Leadon grew increasingly frustrated by the band's direction away from his beloved country and bluegrass and toward album-oriented stadium rock. He famously quit the band in 1975 by pouring a beer over Glenn Frey's head. He later cited a need to get healthy and break the vicious cycle of touring, recording and heavy drug use that was rampant within the band. Upon his departure, Asylum Records released Their Greatest Hits (1971-1975), which highlighted the band's Leadon years and went on to become the biggest-selling album of all time for sales in excess of 42 million units, awarded to the band members by the RIAA. He was replaced by former James Gang guitarist/singer, Joe Walsh. Although it has long been believed that he left because he was dissatisfied with the band moving into rock and roll, Leadon denies it and said in 2013: \\"That's an oversimplification; it implies that I had no interest in rock or blues or anything but country rock. That's just not the case. I didn't just play Fender Telecaster. I played a Gibson Les Paul and I enjoyed rock & roll. That's evident from the early albums.\\"","output":"This text is about Bernard Mathew Leadon III, an American musician and songwriter who is best known as a founding member of the Eagles.

If you haven’t set up your tent before, set it up in your yard once or twice before you arrive at your campsite to get some practice. Tents come in many different sizes. If you’re camping alone, you could get a small, single-person tent. If you’re camping with someone else, get a tent that accommodates both of you. If you plan on going hiking or climbing during your camping trip, you’ll want a backpack. The size of the pack you decide to bring depends on how far you’ll be hiking. Longer, more intense hikes will require a larger and sturdier backpack, while easier day hikes will only require a small day pack. Backpacks are either frameless, or have an internal or external frame. Internal frame packs tend to be more expensive and sit flush against your back. External frame packs are more affordable and tend to provide more ventilation. However, they are bulkier than internal frame packs. Smaller day packs that don’t hold much are usually frameless. A sturdy rope has lots of uses when camping. You can use it as a clothesline, or cut it into various lengths in order to hang pots or bind your sleeping pad to your backpack. You'll want to store and coil your rope correctly when you pack it to avoid tangling. A tarp can provide additional protection for the bottom of your tent, or it can be stretched over your tent to keep it extra-dry. The size of the tarp you get depends on the size of your tent. The larger your tent, the larger the tarp you bring along. A battery-powered flashlight or headlamp is important for helping you find your way around your campsite after dark. Headlamps can be useful to complete tasks around your campsite, as your hands will be free. Be sure to pack extra batteries. You might also want to bring a battery-powered lantern. Collapsible camping chairs are perfect for sitting around the fire or just lounging around the campsite. The best camping chairs are lightweight and sold in specialty backpacking stores. If you’re camping with a group, advise each person in your party to bring a foldable camping chair of their own. Summary:","output":"When camping, a tent is a crucial shelter, with sizes varying based on the number of campers. Practice setting up the tent beforehand. Backpacks are necessary for hiking, with size and type determined by hike length and intensity. Ropes serve multiple purposes, but proper storage is essential. Tarps add extra protection for tents, sized according to the tent. Flashlights or headlamps are vital for nighttime navigation, along with extra batteries.

A series of directives also instructs U.S. diplomatic posts overseas to review the social media accounts of visa applicants who are suspected of terrorist ties or of having been in Islamic State group-controlled areas. The diplomatic cables sent by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson directed embassies to convene security and intelligence working groups to determine criteria for \\"population sets\\" that would warrant increased scrutiny before traveling to the U.S. Even if the applicant otherwise qualifies for a visa, those identified as meeting the criteria would require additional scrutiny, leading to a possible visa denial.

Human rights groups are protesting the proposed guidelines for extreme vetting because they believe that these guidelines could be used to discriminate based on religion and/or national origin. The U.S. State Department's directives to identify certain groups for extra scrutiny when applying for visas and to review social media accounts of visa applicants suspected of terrorist ties or having been in Islamic State group-controlled areas have raised concerns among rights groups and critics. These critics, including Amnesty International, argue that the measures can potentially be used as a tool for discrimination based on national origin and religion. They also contend that these guidelines are discriminatory against Muslims, given that President Trump's travel ban, which has been suspended, targeted travelers from six predominantly Muslim countries - Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. While the extreme vetting process proposed by the Trump administration includes questions about an applicant's workplaces, employers, addresses, and travel history going back 15 years and all email addresses and social media handles used in the last five years, these guidelines have not been cited as the main reasons behind the protests from human rights groups. Instead, their primary concern lies with the potential for discrimination based on religion and national origin, which they believe violates fundamental human rights principles."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Set in a fantasy world where technology has allowed man to fly in magic-powered aircraft, a boy named Yuki is determined to become a great pilot like his idol, the Sky Captain Schmidt.

Christine starts the conversation by expressing her feelings of tiredness, indicating that she is not able to wait for Greg to return home or to their meeting point. This statement implies that they may have had an arrangement to meet up or spend time together, but Christine's exhaustion prevents her from being able to follow through with their original plan. Greg, understanding Christine's state, responds sympathetically by telling her that it's not a problem and that she should go to bed to rest. His reply suggests that he is concerned for Christine's well-being and does not want her to push herself too hard by staying awake to wait for him. Christine then inquires about Greg's plans, specifically asking when he intends to return. This question indicates that she is still interested in Greg's activities and wants to know his whereabouts, likely for both her peace of mind and to ensure that he is safe. Greg answers by estimating that he will need one more hour before he can come back. The use of a sad face emoticon suggests that he too is disappointed by the change in plans and the fact that he won't be able to spend time with Christine as they initially intended. However, he also seems to recognize that both of their circumstances are out of their control.

In summary, this conversation revolves around Christine and Greg discussing their immediate plans for the evening and addressing the impact of Christine's tiredness on their original arrangement. Both parties demonstrate concern and affection for one another, ultimately accepting the situation and expressing their goodnight wishes."},{"instruction":"Reconstruct a question, answer pair from this explanation: Computer is not something that can be used in preparing food.","output":"Question: Can a computer be used in preparing food?

She takes the dog into the woods.Still crying, Megan buries her dog in the woods, and then recites the 23rd Psalm, interjecting her comments. Calm music plays, and local scenery is interspersed while she prays: The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. \\"But I do want.\\" He leadeth me beside still waters. He restoreth my soul. \\"But they killed my dog.\\" Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil. \\"But I am afraid.\\" Thou art with me.

The festival witnessed a performance by musician Shantanu Moitra and a workshop by music director Benny Prasad of Parineeta and 3 Idiots fame . The festival experienced a performance by musician Benny Prasad and a workshop by music director Shantanu Moitra of Parineeta and 3 idiots fame .","output":"No, these two sentences do not convey the exact same information. While both sentences describe the same festival and mention a performance and a workshop, the individuals involved in each activity are switched between the two sentences. Here's a breakdown of the differences: In the first sentence: - The festival witnessed a performance by musician Shantanu Moitra. - There was a workshop by music director Benny Prasad of Parineeta and 3 Idiots fame. In the second sentence: - The festival experienced a performance by musician Benny Prasad. - There was a workshop by music director Shantanu Moitra of Parineeta and 3 Idiots fame. As can be seen above, the roles of the individuals mentioned, Shantanu Moitra and Benny Prasad, are reversed in each sentence. In the first sentence, Shantanu Moitra is responsible for the performance, while Benny Prasad leads the workshop. In the second sentence, Benny Prasad is responsible for the performance, and Shantanu Moitra leads the workshop. Additionally, it's worth noting that the verbs are different between the two sentences - \\"witnessed\\" is used in the first sentence, while \\"experienced\\" is used in the second. Although both verbs convey that observers were present during the festival events, they have slightly different implications. \\"Witnessed\\" suggests that the festival was merely a host and a passive observer of the activities, while \\"experienced\\" implies that the festival as a whole was actively involved in and affected by the events. In summary, these two sentences do not convey the same meaning due to the role reversal of the individuals mentioned, as well as a subtle difference in the verbs used to describe the festival's involvement."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information: - WBLM 102.9 FM is a classic rock radio station serving the central and southern Maine and northern and eastern New Hampshire listening areas from Portland, Maine.

The European Parliament's records from January show €400,000 granted to the APF and €197,625 to an APF foundation, called Europa Terra Nostra. The APF was launched in 2015. Its deputy chairman is Nick Griffin, formerly an MEP who led the British National Party (BNP). An Italian veteran of the far-right, Roberto Fiore, chairs the alliance. He was convicted in absentia in 1985 for links to NAR, a fascist group blamed over the 1980 Bologna train station bombing, which killed 85 people. He now leads a party called Forza Nuova (New Force). Another deputy to Mr Fiore is Artemis Matthaiopoulos from Greece's Golden Dawn, an anti-immigrant party which sports Nazi-style symbols. Party members have been accused of serious crimes including murder, and some went on trial last year. The APF also embraces the German National Democratic Party (NPD), whose leader Udo Voigt is an MEP. Germany's Constitutional Court is considering whether to ban the NPD.

If enough MEPs object, a parliamentary committee will assess whether the APF acts in accordance with EU principles, namely \\"liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law\\". As head of the powerful European People's Party (EPP) group Manfred Weber should be able to get the required 25% of MEPs united against the grant, the source said. Last month Mr Weber wrote to other parliamentary group leaders and Parliament President Martin Schulz, saying there should be no such EU support for \\"some of the most radical and militant right-wing extremist parties\\". Similar complaints against the APF were made by MEPs Marita Ulvskog (Sweden) and Daniele Viotti (Italy). In its programme the APF says it stands for \\"promoting our common Christian values\\" and giving a voice to citizens who are \\"alienated from the democratic process\\" in the EU. The APF has forged links with officials close to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and has condemned Nato, alleging that Western politicians are fomenting \\"Russophobia\\".

Today, we are going to learn how to make a fun and beautiful doily bowl using simple things you can find at home. This is a great way to reuse an old doily that nobody wants anymore. Are you ready? Let's begin! First, ask an adult to help you find a big, unwanted doily. A doily is a pretty piece of fabric with lots of holes and designs in it. They are usually used to decorate tables, but we will use it to make a lovely bowl! Next, we need to find a bowl to use as a shape for our doily bowl. Ask an adult to help you cover the bowl with plastic kitchen wrap, like the kind your mom uses to keep food fresh. Make sure the wrap goes over the rim of the bowl so we can easily remove it later. Now, it's time to choose what will make our doily stiff like a bowl. We can use either fabric stiffener (a special liquid that makes fabric hard) or some sugar water (which is just sugar and water mixed together). Ask an adult to help you with this part. Dip the doily into the liquid you chose and make sure it's wet all over. Carefully place the wet doily over the plastic-covered bowl. Spread it out evenly, so it takes the shape of the bowl. Now, we need to wait for it to dry. Put it in a warm and dry place, like near a sunny window, and let it sit there until it's hard and dry. Finally, when the doily is nice and stiff, gently lift the bowl. Use the kitchen plastic wrap to help you lift the doily off the molding bowl. Ta-da! You have just made a beautiful and unique doily bowl! You can use your new doily bowl to hold small toys, collect your treasures, or even give it as a gift to someone you love. Making fun crafts like this is a cool way to recycle old things and create something special.

When you’re doing classwork, avoid browsing the Internet, checking your email, and other distractions. If necessary, you can install an app that will restrict your access to certain websites during a designated period of time so you can focus on your studies. Never go into a study session undirected. Have specific goals each time you sit down to study. You can break the material up into chunks and study one chunk at a time. Make a schedule for yourself, with individual study sessions divided by topic. You should also remember your overall academic goals when you study. This can help with your motivation. Think about how a good grade will contribute to your overall GPA. Think about how the material will benefit you after the course. Simple memorization can only go so far. One of the most effective means to memorize material is giving yourself tests and quizzes. Quizzing can improve memorization because of a process called \\"retrieval.\\" Every time a memory is retrieved, it becomes more accessible in the future. If there are practice tests and quizzes available online, take as many as you can. You can also make up tests and quizzes for yourself. Flashcards can be a great way to test yourself on things like vocabulary and dates. You can also write down potential exam questions as you study. This can be very helpful if you're expecting an essay test. After you finish studying, take the test you made for yourself. Studying for long hours can easily lead to burnout. It's important to take breaks as you study. Take a break about every hour or so. Do something fun, like watch TV for a few minutes or go for a brief walk, and then return to your materials. You will find yourself feeling refreshed and recharged after a quick break. Remember, your instructor in an online course is a valuable resource. Just because you don't see them every day does not mean you can't reach out to them. If you stumble across anything confusing while studying, do not hesitate to send your instructor an email asking for clarification.

Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination... Paragraph: Two neighboring farms used different farming methods. Hill farm used GMO seeds, fertilizers and pesticides. Valley farm used only organic methods and non-GMO seeds.

The three actors also later performed a sketch at the 2008 MTV Movie Awards which featured the actors attempting to create a successful viral video to promote the film with awkward results. In September 2008, Stiller and Downey attended the San Sebastian International Film Festival to promote the film. A screening was shown, but it was not chosen to compete against the other films at the festival. Between April 2008 and the film's commercial release in August 2008, the film had over 250 promotional screenings. On August 3, 2008, Stiller, Downey, and Black visited Camp Pendleton, a U.S. Marine Corps base in California, to present a screening to over a thousand military members and their families. The screening was on behalf of the United Service Organizations and included the actors heading to the screening by helicopter and Humvees. On August 8, 2008, a special 30-minute fictional E! True Hollywood Story aired about the making of Tropic Thunder. In video games, a themed scavenger hunt was incorporated into Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas 2, and Stiller allowed his likeness to be used in the online Facebook application game based on the film. As a tie-in for the film's release, Paramount announced it would market the energy drink known in the film as \\"Booty Sweat\\". Michael Corcoran, Paramount's president of consumer products, commented on the release: \\"We're very excited, because it has the potential to live for quite a while, well beyond the film.\\" The drink was sold in college bookstores, on Amazon.com, and at other retailers. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Was the promotional efforts successful?","output":"The promotional efforts for Tropic Thunder appear to have been quite extensive and successful, as indicated by various promotional events and tie-ins mentioned in the description. For instance, the film had over 250 promotional screenings between April 2008 and its commercial release in August 2008. Additionally, marketing efforts included appearances by the main actors on American Idol, the 2008 MTV Movie Awards, and a special 30-minute fictional E! True Hollywood Story. The film also had tie-ins with video games and even the release of a themed energy drink called \\"Booty Sweat.\\" As Michael Corcoran, Paramount's president of consumer products, said, \\"We're very excited, because it has the potential to live for quite a while, well beyond the film.\\" This statement suggests that the promotional efforts were successful in generating interest and excitement around the movie."},{"instruction":"Why do I feel anxious easily? Why do I feel anxious? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"To determine if these two questions are inquiring about the same information, we can analyze their meaning and context. 1. Analyzing the questions: a. \\"Why do I feel anxious easily?\\": This question is asking about the reason behind a person's susceptibility or predisposition to feeling anxious in various situations. It implies that the person feels anxiety frequently or with little provocation. b. \\"Why do I feel anxious?\\": This question is more general in its inquiry, asking about the reason behind a person's anxiety without emphasizing the ease or frequency of their anxious feelings. It is focused on understanding the cause of the anxiety but not necessarily its prevalence. 2. Comparing the questions: Both questions are related to understanding the cause of anxiety in an individual. However, the first question emphasizes the ease with which a person becomes anxious, while the second question has a more general focus on the cause of anxiety. Conclusion: While these two questions are similar in nature, they are not inquiring about the exact same information. The first question is specifically concerned with the ease and frequency of anxiety, while the second question focuses more broadly on the reasons for anxiety in general."},{"instruction":"Read this and answer the question The language of treaties, like that of any law or contract, must be interpreted when the wording does not seem clear or it is not immediately apparent how it should be applied in a perhaps unforeseen circumstance.

Answer:","output":"Mr. Brown"},{"instruction":"Here is a news article: Coldplay headlined the Super Bowl 50 halftime show, but it was Beyoncé who came to play. When the NFL first announced that Coldplay would be playing the halftime show, a couple simple assumptions emerged: 1) They'd have to pay lip service to past Super Bowls (which they did, via a montage of past performers set to \\"Fix You\\"), and 2) Beyoncé would be joining, since Coldplay and Beyoncé had only recently released their collaboration song, \\"Hymn For the Weekend.\\" It was also kind of expected that Beyoncé might outshine them. To be fair, Coldplay gave it their eager best. Lead singer Chris Martin started the proceedings on the field, surrounded by fans, and then performed songs like \\"Viva La Vida\\" and \\"Adventure of a Lifetime\\" with a giant grin on his face and a hyperactive spring in his step. The band's Technicolor trappings paired with Martin's enthusiasm made for one of the most earnest halftime performances in recent memory. The whole thing felt as if it was unfolding underneath one of those rainbow kindergarten parachutes. Then 2014 Super Bowl headliner Bruno Mars slid out to perform songwriter Mark Ronson's \\"Uptown Funk\\" with a slick line of dancers. It looked great; unfortunately, the audio was so mangled that viewers at home could barely hear anything above the screaming crowds. Still, both Martin and Mars seemed to be having a hell of a time. And then the drum line parted, and there was Beyoncé. It's not surprising that Beyoncé slayed; in 2013, she gave one of the best Super Bowl performances in the game's history. But there was far more behind Beyoncé's performance of her brand new single \\"Formation\\" than her shutting down the dance floor — which she did, even in a dance-off with Mars that included a gracefully swerved stumble. The day before the Super Bowl, Beyoncé debuted the song by dropping one of her best and boldest videos yet. As Vox's Alex Abad-Santos wrote, \\"Formation\\" is \\"riskier, filthier, angrier, and pulpier\\" than is typical for Beyoncé. It's also proudly steeped in black American culture, celebrates black femininity, and is overtly political, with Beyoncé sinking a New Orleans cop car as a little boy in a hoodie dances in front of riot cops. And her Super Bowl performance followed right in the video's footsteps. Beyoncé emerged, flanked by black women backup dancers with Afros and Black Panther-adjacent uniforms, and clad in a jacket that echoed another iconic black performer: Michael Jackson, circa 1993. So there was, as there always is, a little more than met the eye during Beyoncé's performance. And by the time Bruno Mars challenged Bey to a dance-off, she'd stolen the show once and for all. To top it all off, the second the broadcast cut away from all the shiny happy people singing Coldplay's finale to go to commercial, the first ad was for Beyoncé, announcing a new Formation world tour. She's since announced a new fund to help the children of Flint, Michigan, during the city's current water crisis. Beyoncé performing \\"Formation\\" at the Super Bowl is a huge, purposeful statement. Putting black America center stage smack dab in the middle of Coldplay's set was a significant move right from the start, but it is especially poignant in the context of the song's defiant social commentary, the constant criticism against black Panthers quarterback Cam Newton for so-called excessive arrogance, and a 1.5 million donation from Tidal — Jay Z's ever-halting streaming service — to nonprofit social justice organizations like Black Lives Matter on February 5, the day Trayvon Martin would have turned 21. In short, Beyoncé dominated the show the minute she stepped onto the field, from her knowing smirks during meticulously choreographed dances to the moment when she joined Coldplay and Mars onstage to make sure everyone knew she could smoke them while sharing the screen. More crucially, she transformed one of the biggest events in sports, corporate synergy, and entertainment into a distinctly political act. But if you need more succinct proof of just how thoroughly Beyoncé's attitude and charisma overtook Martin's earnest bopping, here's a picture of Martin trying to squeeze between Bey and Mars; she's crushing the show too hard to even notice: Beyoncé, Chris Martin and Bruno Mars wrapping up the Super Bowl Halftime show #SB50. pic.twitter.com/0JL3Z2MiYJ — Music News & Facts (@musicnews_facts) February 8, 2016 Take heart, Chris Martin: You did what you could.

Her idea of swag in this song is keeping a bottle of hot sauce in her purse. That’s seriously, gloriously specific. WORTHAM Wesley, it’s the blackest of black. It’s not Pharrell’s new black (no shade!) — it’s your grandmother’s black. Her idea of swag is keeping hot sauce in her bag while she’s decked out in Givenchy. That’s baller, and that’s why the world slash Internet is going nuts. It’s a dab in a video form, playing on a loop; it’s phenomenally delicious. CARAMANICA “Earned all this money but they never take the country out me”: What’s fascinating about this song and video is how Beyoncé renders her politics both literally and colloquially. Her radicalism is both overt and implicit — she knows that creatively drawn statements of black identity and pride are as powerful as any direct social-political statement. I think you’re right, Wesley, in that she’s making clear her claims to her old identity even in this new space. But it’s also important to remember that she was doing similar things all over “Beyoncé,” the album she surprise released at the end of 2013. “Formation” feels like a refinement and amplification of that album — it’s sinewy and thrusting, but also angular and tough. Between the song and the video, there’s the club, the church, the wig shop, line dancing, donks on parade, black cowboys and, yes, some footage of New Orleans borrowed from a mini-documentary called “That B.E.A.T.” (which the filmmakers seem alternately frustrated by and pleased with). Beyoncé is both old South and new South — her musical and aesthetic approaches posit them as existing on a continuum. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

(Scott Halleran/Getty Images) There were freakouts over Red Lobster and hot sauce, Blue Ivy and #BlackLivesMatter. In the hours after Beyoncé released her surprise music video “Formation” on Saturday, social media was awash in praise, once again, for Queen B. Except from two upset documentary filmmakers, who claimed their footage was used in the video without permission. “New Beyonce video used hella clips from the doc I produced and directed,” Los Angeles-based filmmaker Chris Black wrote on Twitter. “…but why?!?!” [Watch 2016 Super Bowl ads] Black linked to a documentary called “That B.E.A.T.” which he created with director Abteen Bagheri. (NSFW warning, but you can watch it here.) Bagheri responded on Twitter, too: “I’m not mad. It’s the sad reality of the music business. Doesn’t affect my friends’ and my work, but not cool.” The accusations were amplified by timing: “Formation” debuted on the eve of Super Bowl 50, where Beyoncé will perform her second halftime show, three years after her highly praised act in the 2013 Super Bowl in New Orleans. The song, which she is likely to play Sunday, features New Orleans as its backdrop and inspiration. That’s where the clips from “That B.E.A.T.,” a documentary about NOLA’s dance culture, come in. A representative for Beyoncé told Entertainment Weekly that those clips were purchased fairly. “The documentary footage was used with permission and licensed from the owner of the footage,” the representative said. “They were given proper compensation. The footage was provided to us by the filmmaker’s production company. The filmmaker is listed in the credits for additional photography direction. We are thankful that they granted us permission.” Those credits aren’t listed beneath YouTube’s version of “Formation,” which has already been viewed more than 6 million times. Nor are they easy to find on Tidal, the Jay Z-owned steaming service where “Formation” debuted. To find them, head to VideoStatic, where Bagheri’s name is listed next to”additional photography direction.” In a surprise release a day before her Super Bowl performance, Beyoncé dropped the song \\"Formation\\" and its music video. Here's a guide to the video, the lyrics and things you might have missed. (Nicki DeMarco/The Washington Post) Black told the Fader, a music news site, that he received a request for permission in January. It came from director Lily Keber, who also has footage featured in the video. Black didn’t give Keber permission because he didn’t own the footage. He told Keber “That B.E.A.T.” was commissioned by Nokia in partnership with Sundance. That was the last he heard from Team Beyoncé, he said. A spokesperson for Nokia said the company’s music services business was sold to Microsoft in 2014. The Washington Post has reached out to Microsoft to ask whether it licensed the footage. If that’s the case, it appears that Microsoft, not the filmmakers, were paid for the clips. “All we want is respect and credit,” Black said. “They don’t know what we sacrificed to make [the film]. They just came along and took it without crediting us.” “Anyone who works in the industry knows that putting out a work is a miracle,”Bagheri said in an email to the Post. “There needs to be a unity amongst directors. We need to preserve the sanctity of the craft and champion individual voices. Our work isn’t just b-roll for someone else. It just shouldn’t be considered, whether or not it’s legal. It’s a bad precedent to set.” Why Melina gotta use clips from our doc?!? Was the budget not big enough to spend a week in New Orleans and actually build with the people. — chris black (@TheBlack) February 6, 2016 Later in the day, “Formation” director Melina Matsoukas responded: Must give much love to the beautiful NOLA footage shot and directed by @abteen and @lkeber to make #FORMATION whole. — melina matsoukas (@melinamatsoukas) February 7, 2016 Bagheri tweeted to Matsoukas thanking her for the recognition, and Black said they aren’t planning to pursue legal action. They may not have received money or prominent attribution, but it’s hard to imagine how being associated with Beyoncé wouldn’t benefit their careers. Still, maybe they could ask her team to send over some of the new “Formation” merchandise that is already on sale.

Here's What People Are Saying YouTube Beyoncé is one of a kind — the kind of star who can drop a surprise music video and see much of the Internet and social media instantly explode. \\"Formation,\\" released Saturday, has already racked up more than 7 million views on YouTube. It's full of implicit and explicit commentary on subjects like being black in America, Hurricane Katrina and Black Lives Matter. And the Internet responded swiftly. The video is a \\"powerful proclamation of being a proud, powerful black woman,\\" writes Margaret E. Jacobsen on Romper. Jacobsen connects the imagery of the video to #BlackGirlMagic, a hashtag used to celebrate African-American women on Twitter. The song is \\"an anthem for black women,\\" writes Jacobsen. \\"And the response has been amazing. Following the video's release, we're talking about the blood that runs through our veins and the hoods we grew up in. We're holding all of those in our black communities who came before us up high. We're wearing every little thing that's contributed to our blackness proudly. We're letting our black girl magic shine.\\" At The Root, Danielle C. Belton says the video is \\"black\\" — \\"cornbread and collard greens black. 'Hot sauce in my bag' black. Southern black. Dirty South black. Your grandma telling you to go cut down a switch black,\\" she writes. \\"Did you know Beyoncé was black?\\" The video focuses on New Orleans, in particular, opening and closing with Beyoncé atop a New Orleans police car, with a background reminiscent of Hurricane Katrina. The reference to the hurricane of a decade ago still resonates, says Regina N. Bradley on Red Clay Scholar. \\"Katrina is not just a historical event,\\" she writes. \\"It is a springboard for re-rendering southern trauma and its association with blackness. Trauma is the spring board of southern blackness. But its foundation is resilience and creativity.\\" The video also mixes in footage of New Orleans taken from the 2013 documentary That B.E.A.T. (which filmmakers initially said was used without permission). \\"She wants us to know — more than ever — that she's still grounded, she's paying attention and still a little hood,\\" writes Jenna Wortham in The New York Times. \\"I think she wants us to know that even though she's headlining a mainstream event like the Super Bowl, she has opinions and isn't afraid to share them, nor is she afraid to do it on a national and global scale.\\" The video is political. A boy dances in front of a line of police officers in riot gear. He raises his hands — but so does the line of cops. Graffiti on the wall reads \\"Stop shooting us,\\" echoing the principal demand from Black Lives Matter activists for reform in policing and criminal justice. As The Daily Beast noted, Beyoncé and husband Jay-Z have paid to bail out protesters in Baltimore and Ferguson. And Tidal, a music service that Jay-Z started and Beyoncé partly owns, announced a 1.5 million donation to the Black Lives Matter movement and other social justice groups. Beyoncé was always political, because she had to be, says The Root's Belton. \\"What if I told you that to be black in a public space, with all eyes on you and choosing carefully how to handle that spotlight is a form of politics, a negotiation between the self and the world that all black people must make?\\" The video ends with the police car sinking into the water, Beyoncé lying on top. That ending is a \\"celebration of the margins,\\" writes Zandria F. Robinson on New South Negress. \\"Black bodies in motion, women's voices centered, black queer voices centered — is what ultimately vanquishes the state, represented by a NOPD car. Beyoncé as the conjured every-southern-black-woman, slays atop the car and uses the weight of her body to finish it off, sacrificing herself in the process.\\" Zandria F. Robinson reads from her piece on New South Negress 3:31 The timing of the song's release, just before her performance at the Super Bowl, is also \\"not insignificant,\\" writes The New York Times' Wortham. \\"She's electing to parade her substantial wealth and ability to outearn most men in the music industry (including her husband, Jay Z) during the Super Bowl — the flagship event of male virility and violence in this country.\\" ||||| Photo: TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP/Getty Images I’m sure I’m not the only one for whom a question infinitely more pressing than “Broncos or Panthers?” was “Will she play it or won’t she?” As everyone and your football-loving grandfather now knows, yesterday afternoon Beyoncé stopped the world and dropped the gloriously provocative, instantly iconic video for her new single, “Formation,” the most explicitly political work she’s released to date. The visuals are timely and stirring: A dancing, hoodie-clad black boy commands a line of riot-geared police officers to put their hands up; Beyoncé double-flips the bird in an image that makes me want Alejandro Jodorowsky to direct a remake of Gone With the Wind; and in the powerful final scene, Bey, proud daughter of the American South (“My daddy Alabama, my ma Louisiana”), sinks atop a cop car into Katrina’s murky waters. I was afraid she wouldn’t play this song. That she’d take a more conservative route in the face of an organization that has banned or fined women of color for stepping out of line. I prepared myself for the disappointing possibility that she might just show up to do a cameo for that truly inexplicable Coldplay duet, do a few “Single Ladies” moves, and go collect her check. But now I must ask for forgiveness for doubting the Queen even for a second, because not only did she play “Formation,” she fearlessly led a squad of women dressed as Black Panthers across the field at the goddamned Super Bowl, all while dressed like the democratically elected ruler of Rhythm Nation. New plan: If Trump gets elected, I’m not moving to Canada — I’m moving to Beyoncé’s utopia. This motley hodgepodge of a Pepsi-sponsored Super Bowl Halftime Show had a theme, senior-prom-style, and that theme was “Past, Present, and Future.” Those three words do literally nothing to explain what Coldplay, Bruno Mars, and Beyoncé were doing on a stage together, save for throwing some gentle shade at Coldplay’s tired old Sgt. Pepper–does–Mardi Gras aesthetic. But I’ll go easy on the Fab Adequate Four, who took the stage first. The internet’s inevitable deluge of Coldplay-snark felt excessive; their performance was spirited and benignly feel-good, even if I am not exactly seeking out a copy of Chris Martin’s isolated vocal track. But the exuberant and anthemic quality of “Viva La Vida” worked in a context like this, and their disco-tinged recent single “Adventure of a Lifetime” suitably sustained the energy. Chris Martin seemed happy to be there and also seemed to be getting a great cardiovascular workout, complete with many squats. Were the children watching at home more scandalized by Janet Jackson’s boob or M.I.A.’s middle finger than they were by almost seeing Chris Martin’s butt crack? Only time will tell. Then the preternaturally suave Bruno Mars came out in an expertly tailored Missy Elliott garbage bag and did a kind of B-Boy remix of “Uptown Funk.” Was this supposed to represent “the Past”? Or was this “the Present,” and considered an homage to the “this sick beat” part in Taylor Swift’s “Shake It Off” video? (I kid!) This was the precise moment I stopped asking questions about the performance’s theme, and also the precise moment I went back on my words that I would never tire of hearing “Uptown Funk.” Beyoncé’s performance of “Formation” was a welcome gust of now-ness and relevance in a show so often bogged down with Greatest Hits montages and (see above) played-to-death radio smashes we never needed to hear again. Has anyone ever used the Super Bowl Halftime Show as a showcase for a song they released yesterday? The whole thing was a display of Beyoncé’s unimpeachable confidence in her own cultural influence and artistic vision, and the contrast of Coldplay and Bruno Mars emphasized just how radical that vision really is. Would the show have been more entertaining and thematically coherent if Beyoncé had been given the whole 15 minutes? Of course. But something about the contrast between the performers and her casual domination of that shared stage actually asserted her singularity in the pop landscape more dramatically than she might have on her own. There it was, plain to see for 100 million people: Chris Martin is left shark. Bruno Mars is right shark. Beyoncé is the nucleus. After “Formation,” the performance inexplicably turned into an “In Memorium” montage set to the soaring strains of one of Coldplay’s best songs, “Fix You.” Sure, why not. Coldplay’s music has a kind of one-size-fits-all grandeur about it, so this audiovisual pairing made as much sense as any. “Fix You” on the jukebox at 3 a.m.? If you insist. “Fix You” at your bar mitzvah? Not mad. But Coldplay’s aural vagueness only served to put the precision of Beyoncé’s message into harsher relief. Sure, in the midst of the nation’s continued racial tensions, Coldplay’s fuzzy message that everything will be okay if we just (hold your cards high, audience) “BELIEVE IN LOVE” might have struck some as tone-deaf and silly. But Beyoncé, on the other hand, didn’t need to say it. Her song, her staging, her slaying delivered a harder-won message loud and clear. As the crowd roared, we still did not get our answer to that other pressing question: “Yeah but why’s she here again?” And then we did: An ad for her just-announced Formation World Tour ran in one of the televisual year’s most sought-after commercial slots. You could almost see the ripple of lightbulbs going off across the globe: Beyoncé, that Black Bill Gates in the Making, basically just got paid to run an ad at the Super Bowl. It felt, elegantly, like an echo of that last line of “Formation”: “Always stay gracious, best revenge is your paper.” ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Beyoncé dominated the Super Bowl 50 halftime show with her performance of new single \\"Formation\\", viewed as a celebration of African-American culture and a radical statement of protest, stealing the limelight from Coldplay's headline act. The video for the new single has over 22 million views on YouTube, which features references to the Black Lives Matter movement, Hurricane Katrina, and African-American culture, and has sparked new conversations in the US about black history, with the song being dubbed \\"an anthem for black women\\".

Article: It was the end of the school term and my son Tom had less than three months left before he would finish his six years at high school. During this time he had developed a love for basketball. Sadly, because of my work over the last twelve months, I had only been able to attend a few of his games; however, I was determined to get to his last game for the school term. Tom's team came out in the first 10 minutes with a burst of goals that saw them leading by just over 20 points at the end of the first half. The second half changed as the other team quickly played themselves back into the game. Tom's team started to miss an increasing number of shots. It was at that point that the coach called his first time out. The noise of the spectators became quiet as the coach spoke to them. He had the team standing in a half circle, but he squatted down, looking up at them and fiving some very calm and clear instructions on what they needed to do in the last couple of minutes. As he stood up to allow the team to return to the court, I saw him give some further words of encouragement to all of them. You could see that he knew that the team was fighting to save the game and that he needed to lift them up. By squatting down he placed himself in a position where he was talking up to them, rather than down or at them, and as the players went back onto the court his words of encouragement served to lift their energy and spirits. Well, Tom's team went on to win the final by 5 points. As I drove away I thought about what can happen to us all in our everyday life. One of my favourite quotes is about the half filled glass of water --- \\"Is it half full or is it half empty?\\" Like the coach, the answer to this quote all depends on how you look at things.

This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin. After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. Question: What does Selina think will help repair redness and brown spots from skin? Options: - using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser - use just water to cleanse - use abrasive soap - not enough information === The correct answer is Answer:","output":"Selina suggests that using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser will help repair redness and brown spots from sun-damaged skin. This type of cleanser effectively removes dirt, oil, and the top layer of dead skin cells without causing further injury to the skin. It also reveals fresh skin cells ready for treatment, which can aid in repairing skin damage caused by the sun."},{"instruction":"Read this article and answer this question On 2 April, 2012, Mayor Jeffrey Lim of Salug, Zamboanga del Norte was kidnapped by ten armed men disguised as policemen.

Abner Gumandol, alias Sehar Muloc and Red Eye, was said to be the leader of a criminal syndicate called the Muloc Group. Gumandol was arrested on 12 June 2016. How many years after the kidnapping was Gumandol arrested?","output":"Abner Gumandol, alias Sehar Muloc and Red Eye, was arrested on 12 June 2016. The kidnapping of Mayor Jeffrey Lim occurred on 2 April 2012. To determine the number of years between these two events, we need to calculate the time difference between the two dates. First, we find the difference in years: 2016 (year of arrest) - 2012 (year of kidnapping) = 4 years Next, we need to find the difference in months and days: June 12, 2016 - April 2, 2012 April, May, and the first 12 days of June account for the difference in months and days. This translates to roughly 2 months and 10 days. Now we need to consider if there is a need to subtract or add a year based on the difference in months and days. In this case, since the arrest occurred after the kidnapping (in both month and day), there is no need to subtract a year from the difference.

This statement describes a specific scene. There is a single biker who is wearing a black helmet and is currently riding on a dirt hill. The information provided includes details about the biker's helmet color (black) as well as his/her location and activity (riding on a dirt hill). Statement 2: A biker wearing an orange helmet rides in the grass. This statement also describes a specific scene. In this case, there is a biker wearing an orange helmet and is riding in the grass. Similar to the first statement, this provides information about the biker's helmet color (orange), location, and activity (riding in the grass). Now, to determine if there is a logical relationship between these two statements, we should consider if Statement 2 is a direct or indirect consequence of Statement 1, or if they are mutually exclusive or independent. Direct Consequence: Statement 2 would be a direct consequence of Statement 1 if the information in Statement 1 leads us to conclude that Statement 2 must also be true. In this case, there is no clear cause-and-effect relationship between the two statements, and Statement 2 is not a direct consequence of Statement 1. Indirect Consequence: Statement 2 would be an indirect consequence of Statement 1 if a combination of additional information (including background knowledge) and Statement 1 leads us to conclude that Statement 2 is true. In this case, the two statements describe two distinct scenes, both involving bikers wearing different helmet colors and riding in different locations. There is no information in the first statement that suggests that it would lead to the second statement or vice versa. Mutually Exclusive: The two statements would be mutually exclusive if the truth of one statement would imply the falsity of the other. However, the two statements describe different bikers, as indicated by the different helmet colors, so the truth of one statement doesn't necessarily mean that the other is false. Therefore, the statements are not mutually exclusive. Independent: Finally, the two statements can be considered independent if the truth or falsity of one statement has no effect on the other statement's validity. In this case, both statements involve bikers who are wearing different helmet colors and riding in different places. Each statement describes its scene without any specific relationship between the two. Therefore, they can be viewed as independent statements. In conclusion, the statement \\"One biker wearing a black helmet riding on a dirt hill\\" does not logically imply \\"A biker wearing an orange helmet rides in the grass.\\" The two statements appear to be independent, describing different individuals wearing different helmet colors, participating in separate activities in different locations. There is no direct or indirect constraint between them, and they are not mutually exclusive."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and answer the question.

Now, regarding the difference between bhajans and kirtans: Bhajans and kirtans are similar but not the same. They are both religious musical performances from the Indian subcontinent, primarily used in Hindu worship practices. However, they vary in their structure and manner of performance. 1. Bhajans are devotional songs that usually convey a spiritual message or theme. They are sung traditionally in a group setting or individually. The emphasis in bhajans is on the lyrics and the emotions they evoke. Bhajans often include a chorus and verses, and may come from a large variety of sources, like poems, ancient scriptures, or the works of saint-poets. 2. Kirtans, on the other hand, follow a call-and-response format. A lead singer or group will sing a part of the song, and the congregation or audience will respond by repeating that line or verse. Kirtans are usually more lively, and often involve the use of musical instruments and dancing. They are an interactive way of connecting with the divine through song and music.

Context: ROLAND NARROWED HIS EYES AND STARED UPWARD INTO THE DARKNESS, across the top of Mont Segur toward the Cathar fortress. Standing on a high walkway of planks behind the palisade of the crusaders' small wooden fort, he heard faraway voices and saw torches moving on the Cathar rampart. The two men on watch with him that night, a sergeant from Champagne and a young man-at-arms from Brittany, were talking in low tones about the women to be had far below, at the foot of the mountain. They seemed not to see the activity about the Cathar stronghold on the upper peak of the mountaintop opposite their own fort. But Roland, knowing Diane was in the besieged fortress, could not take his eyes from it. He knew he had to act soon. Each day the crusaders grew stronger and the Cathars weaker. Once the Cathar stronghold fell, the crusaders would slaughter all within, including Diane. The sergeant, chuckling, was offering his young companion a wineskin. The Breton never received it. From behind the Cathar wall came the sound of a huge thump, as if a giant's fist had pounded Mont Segur. Roland recognized the sound, and fought panic as he thrust his arms out, trying to push the other two men toward the ladder. But there was no time for them to climb down to safety. The thump was the counter-weight of a stone-caster, and the whistling noise that followed fast upon it was the rock it had thrown. A shape as big as a wine barrel blotted out the stars. The stone hit the parapet beside Roland, and the whole palisade shuddered. Roland caught a glimpse of the sergeant's horrified face and heard his scream as the boulder struck him, crushing him to the ground.

On his way home he saw two balloons, balloon A and balloon B. Balloon A was flat, but balloon B was inflated. He was wondering how balloons go up so effortlessly. and a hint : Many people enjoy riding in hot air balloons. Some use them for romantic picnics and marriage proposals. Others race in competitions. Being above the earth gives a whole new perspective on the world around us. As the beginning of a hot air balloon ride, the balloon is flat because the pressure inside the balloon equals the pressure outside. When the air inside the balloon is heated, the speed of movement of those air molecules increases and the pressure goes up. After a while the balloon is completely expanded and the flight is ready to take off. Please answer this question : Which balloon is less likely to take off, balloon A or balloon B? A:","output":"Balloon A is less likely to take off because it is flat. This indicates that the air pressure inside the balloon is equal to the pressure outside the balloon. In order for a hot air balloon to take off, the air inside needs to be heated, causing the air molecules to move faster, increasing the pressure inside the balloon. This makes the balloon expand and become buoyant, eventually lifting it into the air. Since balloon A is flat, it has not yet been heated and expanded, while balloon B is already inflated and likely closer to being ready for takeoff."},{"instruction":"Generate a 5-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package com.dozuki.ifixit.","output":"Title: Exceptional Repair Guide App - The Ultimate DIY Companion Rating: 5 stars As a DIY enthusiast, I couldn't be happier to give com.dozuki.ifixit a resoundingly positive 5-star review!

Comte had proposed an atheistic culte founded on human principles – a secular Religion of Humanity (which worshiped the dead, since most humans who have ever lived are dead), complete with holidays and liturgy, modeled on the rituals of what was seen as a discredited and dilapidated Catholicism. Although Comte's English followers, like Eliot and Martineau, for the most part rejected the full gloomy panoply of his system, they liked the idea of a religion of humanity. Comte's austere vision of the universe, his injunction to \\"vivre pour altrui\\" (\\"live for others\\", from which comes the word \\"altruism\\"), and his idealisation of women inform the works of Victorian novelists and poets from George Eliot and Matthew Arnold to Thomas Hardy.\\" Answer: Answer:","output":"Auguste Comte, a French philosopher and sociologist, proposed a religion known as the Religion of Humanity. This religion was influenced by his philosophical approach called Positivism, which emphasized empirical and scientific methods to understand society and human behavior. In the context of the Victorian era, influential figures like Eliot, Lewes, and Martineau were drawn to Comte's ideas and his pursuit of a secular, rational alternative to traditional religious beliefs. The Religion of Humanity aimed to replace the conventional religious framework with a system founded on human principles rather than divine ones. Offering a secular alternative, the religion denied the existence of any supernatural beings or deities. Instead, it focused on the human experience, moral values, and social progress. Comte believed that in order for society to advance, it needed a moral and spiritual foundation that was grounded in reason and empirical evidence. At the core of the Religion of Humanity was the principle of altruism, derived from Comte's famous injunction to \\"vivre pour altrui\\" (\\"live for others\\"). This emphasis on living for others encouraged individuals to contribute to the greater good and promote the wellbeing of their fellow human beings. Comte's idealization of women also played a crucial role in his religion, as he saw women as moral guides for society. The Religion of Humanity incorporated rituals and practices that were inspired by the Catholic Church. However, Comte repurposed these traditions and based them on a secular, humanist foundation. The religion included holidays and a liturgy, as well as the veneration of the dead. By honoring the deceased, Comte believed that society could appreciate the contributions of past generations and acknowledge the human continuum. Although many of Comte's English followers did not adopt the entirety of his religious system, they appreciated the concept of a religion based on human principles. Victorian novelists and poets, such as George Eliot, Matthew Arnold, and Thomas Hardy, incorporated elements of Comte's austere vision of the universe, his altruistic principles, and his celebration of human virtues in their works. They saw the Religion of Humanity as a way to explore and promote moral and social values within a secular context. In conclusion, Auguste Comte proposed a secular religion known as the Religion of Humanity, which was grounded in human principles and emphasized altruistic living. Abandoning supernatural beliefs, the religion focused on human experience, social progress, and moral values. Although not entirely embraced by his English followers, Comte's ideas profoundly influenced the works of Victorian writers, contributing to the intellectual and moral landscape of the era."},{"instruction":"Don't get me wrong - I love David Suchet as Poirot.

Red city was 10 miles from a volcano, while Tree city was 60 miles away. Red city experienced many earthquakes, Tree city few and far between. But I can use this background: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ). What is an answer for this question: Which city experienced less convection within the Earth causing the plates to move? A:","output":"A: Based on the information provided, it is not possible to definitively determine which city experienced less convection within the Earth causing the plates to move. However, we can analyze the given information and make some educated assumptions. Convection within the Earth's mantle drives the movement of tectonic plates, leading to various geological events such as earthquakes and volcanic activity. Plate boundaries are areas where two or more plates meet, and these regions are more susceptible to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. In the case of Red City and Tree City, both are located on plate boundaries and near volcanoes, making them prone to these geological occurrences. However, the distances from the volcanoes and the frequency of earthquakes vary between the two cities. Red City is only 10 miles away from a volcano and experiences many earthquakes, while Tree City is located 60 miles away from a volcano and has fewer earthquakes. This difference in distance and earthquake frequency suggests that the tectonic activity might be more intense in the vicinity of Red City. Despite these observations, we cannot conclusively determine which city experienced less convection within the Earth causing the plates to move. This is because various factors can influence the movement of tectonic plates and affect the occurrence of earthquakes, such as the type of plate boundary, the rate of plate movement, and the composition of the Earth's crust in that area. Additionally, the earthquake frequency might not be the sole indicator of the intensity of convection in the mantle beneath each city. It is possible that both cities experience similar levels of convection, but the tectonic and geological settings at each location result in different types and frequencies of earthquakes and volcanic activity. In conclusion, although Red City and Tree City display different distances from volcanoes and varying frequencies of earthquakes, we cannot definitively determine which city experienced less convection within the Earth causing the plates to move. Further study of local geology, plate tectonics, and the specific type of plate boundary will be required to increase our understanding of the convection and tectonic activity occurring beneath each city."},{"instruction":"**SPOILERS** I rented \\"Tesis\\" (or \\"Thesis\\" in English) on the strength of director Alejandro Amenabar's later effort \\"The Others\\". Based on what a brilliantly measured and horrifyingly effective creepfest that film was, I assumed his earlier efforts would be of a similar quality and I was in the mood for some good horror. Instead I wound up with the most tedious, preposterous excuse for a lame-brained slasher movie I've seen since the German film \\"Anatomie\\" (which this one kinda reminded me of). The plot has potential but it's thrown away within the first 20 minutes. It revolves around innocent-n-pretty psychology student Angela's (Ana Torrent - a Jessica Harper deadringer) thesis on the subject of violence in films. Through some far-fetched circumstances too dumb to go into here, she winds up in possession of a 'snuff' tape on which two men torture, mutilate and kill a young girl for the camera. Angela, and her horror-buff friend Chema (Fele Martinez) are both shocked yet intrigued by the tape and decide to get to the bottom of who's responsible for it. This leads to... well, nothing. They never really give a reason for why they want to find the girl's killers (since they resolutely refuse to contact the police throughout any of the unfolding events, even when their own lives at risk) and the mystery itself is as limp as Graham Norton in a room full of bunny girls. There is only one proper 'clue' (the type of camera the killers used is discovered) and that's a) a really weak one and b) wheeled out in the first 20 minutes. The rest of the so-called 'unravelling' just occurs through blind luck, increasingly ridiculous plot twists and a SLEW of awful, transparent and thoroughly pointless red herrings that are chucked in merely to pad out the running time. Seriously - Amenabar might know his stuff about ghost stories but he's clearly never read a detective book in his life. The key to a good whodunnit is to have a large cluster of potential suspects and to eliminate them one by one with clever deduction and the gradual discovery of more and more evidence, before moving in for the final twist. In \\"Tesis\\", *POTENTIAL SPOILER AHEAD* the killer's identity is guessed correctly by the amateur 'detectives' almost instantly and then we get 100 minutes of the writer trying feebly to throw us off the scent until he runs out of ideas, throws his hands up and says \\"OK, ya got me, it was him after all\\"! As for any kind of logic or motive behind the crimes - no such luck. You're watching the wrong movie if that's what you're after. The only thing that drags \\"Tesis\\" down further from just being a dumb, badly written thriller is the way it actually tries to make some ludicrous, muddled-up 'point' about violence in films. I have no idea what stance it's attempting to take on the subject but it seems determined to cram in a ton of misguided, confused psychobabble, in between the rest of the gibberish, and say \\"look at me! I'm political!\\". The final scenes, in which the \\"point\\" of the movie is supposedly hammered home, are so utterly absurd and puerile, one can't help but wonder if Amenabar feels embarrassed now when he watches this. If he doesn't, he certainly should. This is total 'amateur night at the slasher house' stuff. Overall I can't believe I wasted two whole hours (it felt like at least six) on this, just hoping something might happen. The urban legend of 'snuff films' (and that is basically all they are, despite the way this film tries to suggest they're some kind of criminal phenomenon sweeping the world!) is an area that can be so tantalisingly exploited in good horror films (\\"Videodrome\\" anyone?) but it's so easy to step over the line into childlike 'wouldn't it be cool if!' territory with it (ie: \\"My Little Eye\\")... \\"Tesis\\" hits an all-time low for the 'snuff movie' genre. On every level, this one is better left dead and buried. I'll award it a 1 out of 10, for some nice lighting, but that's all it's getting. Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative?","output":"The sentiment of this review is negative. Justification: The user provides a detailed critique of the film \\"Tesis\\" in which they express their dissatisfaction with a variety of aspects of the movie. They criticize the plot, pacing, character motivations, and the use of red herrings. They also refer to the film as \\"the most tedious, preposterous excuse for a lame-brained slasher movie\\" and write that they \\"can't believe I wasted two whole hours\\" watching it.

A. see king B. hello C. meow D. drink water E. live many years The best answer is Answer:","output":"C. meow Cats are known for their distinctive vocalization, which is commonly referred to as \\"meowing.\\" This sound is a primary mode of communication for cats and can convey various messages, both to humans and other animals. Cats meow for various reasons, such as: 1. Seeking attention: Cats may meow to get their owner's attention, either to be petted, played with, or receive food. Some cats meow more frequently when they are lonely, bored, or seeking interaction. 2. Greeting: When a cat sees its owner or another familiar human, it may meow as a friendly greeting. This sound is often accompanied by other signs of affection, like purring or rubbing against the person's leg. 3. Requesting food: Cats might meow when they are hungry and asking for food. This meowing can become more insistent if the cat is eager for its meal. 4. Expressing discomfort or pain: If a cat is experiencing pain or discomfort, it may meow to alert its owner to the issue. This could be caused by a medical issue, injury, or other distressing situations. 5. Communicating with other animals: Meow sounds can also be used to communicate with other cats or animals, especially during mating season when cats meow to attract their potential mates. 6. Indicating territorial behavior: Cats sometimes meow to mark their territory and establish their dominance. In contrast, answers A, B, D, and E are not typical vocalizations that one would expect from a cat. They might represent various actions or sentiments, but they are not typical sounds made by cats. In summary, the best answer for what you would normally expect a cat to say is \\"C. meow,\\" as this is their most common form of vocal communication, used for various purposes, including seeking attention, greeting, requesting food, and expressing discomfort."},{"instruction":"Context: Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Steelers the Dolphins flew to Paul Brown Stadium for an AFC duel with the Bengals.

The same is true of the Southern Hemisphere in November, December, and January. It is Earth's axial tilt that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months, which increases the solar flux. However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the warmest months in the Northern Hemisphere while December, January, and February are the warmest months in the Southern Hemisphere. Please answer this question : Which month is colder in the northern hemisphere, June or December? Answer:","output":"The colder month in the Northern Hemisphere is December. This can be understood by first taking a closer look at the Earth's axial tilt and the distribution of sunlight over the year. The Earth is tilted at an angle of about 23.5 degrees relative to its orbital plane around the Sun. This axial tilt is responsible for the different seasons experienced in different parts of the world due to the varying angles at which sunlight reaches the Earth's surface. During May, June, and July, the Northern Hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight as it faces the Sun. This causes the Sun to appear higher in the sky, increasing the solar flux or the amount of solar energy received by the Earth's surface. As a result, these months are generally warmer in the Northern Hemisphere, with June marking the beginning of the summer season. Meanwhile, the Southern Hemisphere experiences the opposite situation during these months as it faces away from the Sun. This results in less direct sunlight and cooler temperatures. In November, December, and January, however, the Southern Hemisphere faces the Sun more directly, leading to warmer temperatures and the summer season in this part of the world. Seasonal lag is another factor that affects the distribution of temperatures over the year. This phenomenon describes the delay between the maximum and minimum solar radiation received on Earth and the corresponding peak of temperature. As a result, even though the longest day (summer solstice) occurs around June 21 in the Northern Hemisphere, the warmest months are typically June, July, and August, while the coldest months are December, January, and February. Considering these factors, it becomes evident that December is colder than June in the Northern Hemisphere. In December, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun's direct rays, leading to cooler temperatures and the winter season. On the other hand, June marks the beginning of the summer months, with the hemisphere tilted towards the Sun, resulting in greater exposure to sunlight and higher temperatures."},{"instruction":"Here are some concepts: bathroom, shower, tub, walk What is a sentence about these concepts?","output":"The modern bathroom, a serene sanctuary within one's home, typically features an elegant walk-in shower for quick and invigorating cleansing sessions, while a luxurious bathtub serves as the perfect spot for relaxing and unwinding after a long day - coming together harmoniously to create an essential, multi-functional space designed for both personal hygiene and rejuvenating respite."},{"instruction":"Question: I grew up in the south of Spain in a little community called Estepona.

Having just learned to drive and hardly ever having the opportunity to use the car, I readily accepted. I drove Dad into Mijas and promised to pick him up at 4 p.m., then drove to a nearby garage and dropped off the car. Because I had a few hours to spare, I decided to catch a couple of movies at a theatre near the garage. However, I became so interested in the films that I didn't pay attention to the time.

More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - The United States Army Air Forces (USAAF or AAF) was the military aviation service of the United States of America during and immediately after World War II, successor to the United States Army Air Corps and the direct predecessor of the United States Air Force. The AAF were a component of the United States Army, which in 1942 was divided functionally by executive order into three autonomous forces: the Army Ground Forces, the Services of Supply (which in 1943 became the Army Service Forces), and the Army Air Forces. Each of these forces had a commanding general who reported directly to the Army Chief of Staff. - Aviation is the practical aspect or art of aeronautics, being the design, development, production, operation and use of aircraft, especially heavier than air aircraft. The word \\"aviation\\" was coined by French writer and former naval officer Gabriel La Landelle in 1863, from the verb \\"avier\\" (synonymous flying), itself derived from the Latin word \\"avis\\" (\\"bird\\") and the suffix \\"-ation\\". - The Enola Gay is a Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber, named for Enola Gay Tibbets, the mother of the pilot, Colonel Paul Tibbets, who selected the aircraft while it was still on the assembly line. On 6 August 1945, during the final stages of World War II, it became the first aircraft to drop an atomic bomb. The bomb, code-named \\"Little Boy\\", was targeted at the city of Hiroshima, Japan, and caused unprecedented destruction. \\"Enola Gay\\" participated in the second atomic attack as the weather reconnaissance aircraft for the primary target of Kokura. Clouds and drifting smoke resulted in a secondary target, Nagasaki, being bombed instead. - A navigator is the person on board a ship or aircraft responsible for its navigation. The navigator's primary responsibility is to be aware of ship or aircraft position at all times. Responsibilities include planning the journey, advising the ship's captain or aircraft commander of estimated timing to destinations while en route, and ensuring hazards are avoided. The navigator is in charge of maintaining the aircraft or ship's nautical charts, nautical publications, and navigational equipment, and generally has responsibility for meteorological equipment and communications. - The Boeing B-29 Superfortress is a four-engine propeller-driven heavy bomber designed by Boeing which was flown primarily by the United States during World War II and the Korean War. It was one of the largest aircraft operational during World War II and featured state of the art technology. It was the single most expensive weapons project undertaken by the United States in World War II, exceeding the cost of the Manhattan Project by between 1 and 1.7 billion dollars. Innovations introduced included a pressurized cabin, dual-wheeled, tricycle landing gear, and a remote, computer-controlled fire-control system that directed four machine gun turrets that could be operated by a single gunner and a fire-control officer. A manned tail gun installation was semi-remote. The name \\"Superfortress\\" continued the pattern Boeing started with its well-known predecessor, the B-17 Flying Fortress. Designed for the high-altitude strategic bomber role, the B-29 also excelled in low-altitude nighttime incendiary bombing missions. One of the B-29's final roles during World War II was carrying out the atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. - \\"Little Boy\\" was the codename for the atomic bomb dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945 during World War II by the Boeing B-29 Superfortress \\"Enola Gay\\", piloted by Colonel Paul W. Tibbets, Jr., commander of the 509th Composite Group of the United States Army Air Forces. It was the first atomic bomb to be used in warfare. The Hiroshima bombing was the second artificial nuclear explosion in history, after the Trinity test, and the first uranium-based detonation. It exploded with an energy of approximately . The bomb caused significant destruction to the city of Hiroshima. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - History. Edo period. The Ogasawara and Hosokawa clans were \\"daimys\\" at Kokura Castle during the Edo period (16031868).

Maureen McCarron said a soldier, known only as Sergeant O, should now be prosecuted. The Telegraph has reported Sergeant O could face an attempted murder charge. The new head of the UK armed forces said on Friday he would not allow British soldiers to be \\"chased\\" by people making \\"vexatious claims\\" about their conduct in the Troubles. Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir Nick Carter told the BBC serving and former service personnel should face action for \\"genuine\\" wrongdoing, but said groundless cases \\"will not happen on my watch\\". Brain injury Thirteen people were shot dead on Bloody Sunday. The 76-year-old former soldier is alleged to have fired the shot that struck masonry that injured Mr McCarron and another protestor. The Saville Inquiry report found that Mr McCarron and Patrick McDaid were injured by debris sent flying by shots fired as they were attempting to run away from the south-eastern area of the Rossville Flats car park. A year after he was injured, Mr McCarron suffered a brain haemorrhage. His family believe that is directly linked to the injuries he sustained on Bloody Sunday. Mr McCarron's daughter Maureen told BBC Radio Foyle: \\"Everyone says daddy was left the way he was because of Bloody Sunday. \\"We know deep down it was Bloody Sunday, he was bleeding that day from the ears and that indicates brain damage, a brain injury.\\" She said the brain haemorrhage changed her father.

It can't go on like this.\\" A spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence (MOD) said the \\"relative peace and stability that Northern Ireland enjoys today\\" is \\"due to the courageous efforts of our security forces\\". \\"We are now consulting on new legacy institutions to replace the current processes and ensure that there is no unfair and disproportionate focus on former members of the Armed Forces and police officers,\\" the spokesperson added. The MOD also said it provides \\"legal and pastoral support to any veteran who requires it\\". Clarification 9 April 2019: This article was amended to remove a reference to the death of John Johnston. This reflects the Bloody Sunday Inquiry's finding about Mr Johnston's death several months after he was wounded in Derry on 30 January 1972.

One of the earliest hits was \\"Big Fun\\" by Inner City. Detroit techno developed as the DJ The Electrifying Mojo did his radio program, which fused eclectic sounds into the signature Detroit techno sound. This sound, also influenced by European electronica (Kraftwerk, Art of Noise), Japanese synthpop (Yellow Magic Orchestra), early B-boy (breakdancing) Hip-Hop (Man Parrish, Soul Sonic Force) and Italo disco (Doctor's Cat, Ris, Klein M.B.O.), was further pioneered by Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson, known as the Belleville Three. Derrick May a.k.a. \\"MAYDAY\\" and Thomas Barnett released \\"Nude Photo\\" in 1987 on May's label \\"Transmat Records\\", which helped start the Detroit techno music scene. This record was played on Chicago's Hot Mix 5 Radio DJ mix show and in Chicago clubs. A year later, Transmat released \\"Strings of Life\\". Transmat Records also released such as 1988's \\"Wiggin\\". As well, Derrick May had releases on Kool Kat Records and many remixes for underground and mainstream recording artists. Kevin Saunderson's company KMS Records contributed many releases that were as much house music as they were techno.

In 1988, as house music became more popular among general audiences, Kevin Saunderson's group Inner City with Paris Gray released the 1988 hits \\"Big Fun\\" and \\"Good Life\\", which eventually were picked up by Virgin Records. Each EP / 12 inch single sported remixes by Mike \\"Hitman\\" Wilson and Steve \\"Silk\\" Hurley of Chicago and Derrick \\"Mayday\\" May and Juan Atkins of Detroit.

Sentence: Two persons were injured in dynamite attacks by terrorists","output":"Based on the given text, it can be inferred that the sentence \\"Two persons were injured in dynamite attacks by terrorists\\" is likely true. The text states that there were dynamite attacks against two bank branches in a northwestern Colombian city, which led to two individuals being injured. The term \\"perpetrated\\" implies that these actions were deliberate and unlawful.

It is revealed that that meteorite is actually Black Adam, returning to Earth after a long exile. The film then cuts to young Billy Batson living in a rundown slum, with very little food and rats for pets. He gets out of bed wearing a t-shirt with the Superman crest. He goes to the kitchen to find food, but discovers he only has potato chips, which he ends up feeding to the rats. On his way to meet with Clark Kent in a nearby diner, he sees some bullies mugging a homeless man. After attempting to defend the man, Billy himself receives a black eye. The homeless man thanks Billy for his intervention, calling him \\"The Captain\\". Billy tells him that he always tries to do the right thing. Billy gives him the only thing of value he has â a subway token. At the diner, Clark buys the boy three breakfasts, and tells him he wants to write a story to bring his plight, and those in his same situation, to public light. He tells Mr. Kent that he tries to be good no matter what. As the conversation continues, neither notice that Black Adam has appeared, hovering outside the diner. He claps his hands together, blowing a hole in the side of the diner. Clark attempts to protect the boy, but a blow from Black Adam sends him through several walls. He emerges from beneath the rubble and quickly changes into Superman. Adam stalks young Billy through the streets stating his surprise over the Wizard's choice to become the next Marvel, but Billy does not know what he means. Black Adam picks up a fire engine to smash Billy, but Superman intervenes and blocks the blow. While Billy makes good his escape, Superman gets a blast of electricity from Black Adam.

Tommy A:","output":"Title: A Bruised Victory Genre: Drama, Action, Sports Plot Summary: Krista, a talented but emotionally closed-off young woman from a small town, finds herself trying to navigate the complexities of life, family, and the fierce world of underground fighting in the hopes of escaping the cycle of poverty and violence that grips her family. When she beats up Tommy, a local rival who challenges her both physically and emotionally, she ultimately has to confront her own fears, aspirations, and relationships. Act 1: Krista (20s) lives in a small, economically-depressed town where there are few opportunities for young people to rise above their circumstances. Krista's mother, Ellen (40s), a hardworking yet disillusioned single mom, constantly urges her daughter to break free from her aggressive nature that often lands her in trouble. An athlete since childhood, Krista channels her frustrations and unresolved anger into training as a mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter. The local gym is where Krista meets Derek (20s), an older, disillusioned MMA fighter who, due to his own personal demons, never managed to reach the pinnacle of success, despite his natural talent. He sees much of himself in Krista and takes her under his wing. They form a strong bond, as Derek trains and mentors Krista, helping her hone her skills as a fighter. Act 2: Krista's quiet life takes a sudden turn when Tommy (20s), a cocky and self-assured newcomer, arrives in town. Tommy starts to train at the same gym and quickly becomes a force to reckon within the underground fighting scene. As both Tommy and Krista gain a reputation for their respective fighting skills, their rivalry grows, fueled by harsh words, insults, and constant power play. Rumors of an illegal underground fighting championship come to the forefront, and both Krista and Tommy find themselves caught in the middle. All bets are on, but the winner gets a chance to compete professionally in a prestigious MMA tournament. Act 3: In the climactic buildup to the illegal underground championship, Krista learns that her mother suffers from a dwindling health condition that requires expensive treatment. This emboldens her motivation to win the underground championship and progress to the professional league. In the final fight, Krista faces Tommy in a brutal, high-octane confrontation, where they test each other to their physical and emotional limits. During the exchange of blows, Krista begins to realize that her rivalry with Tommy mirrors her inner struggle, including her fear of failure, long-held resentments, and deep insecurities. In a powerful sequence, Krista manages to overcome her emotions and use her honed skills and sheer willpower to defeat Tommy. However, instead of reveling in her victory, she finds compassion for Tommy and ensures he's not severely injured. Epilogue: Krista's victory astounds everyone present and propels her into the professional fighting world, where she not only begins to find recognition and success, but also uses her newfound platform to create better opportunities for the troubled youth in her community. Her relationship with her mother and mentor, Derek, becomes stronger, as conflict and vulnerability get replaced by understanding, respect, and love. As for Tommy, his defeat at Krista's hands leads to internal reflection, a reassessment of his own choices, and ultimately, a change of heart. He eventually finds solace and redemption in training other young fighters, using his past as a reminder of the importance of humility, compassion, and resilience. A Bruised Victory focuses on themes of strength, resilience, and overcoming one's troubled past, to rise above adversity and find hope, forgiveness, and redemption."},{"instruction":"Cambridge University students are forced to dig trenches and clean toilets as punishment, it has been revealed. One student at St John's College, who asked to remain anonymous, said he was forced to help groundsmen dig and fill in a trench while another claimed they had been made to clean toilets at 8am for an hour every day - for six days after breaking rules. The Draconian measures were revealed as. part of an investigation into the punitive system employed by each. college at the university. Fooled: The homeless man is believed to have slept at a St John's College library for six weeks before being kicked out. Most colleges impose fines for misbehaviour, ranging from loud parties and parking bikes in the wrong place, to skipping supervisions. But St John’s college employs a 'community service' scheme instead of fines; the Office of the Dean can hand out any disciplinary measure it sees fit. A spokesman for St John's college. said: 'The range of disciplinary measures that can be imposed by the. Dean of St John’s is defined in the College's Standing Orders. 'These include making a community service order up to a permitted maximum of hours per term. Punishment: One student at St John's College claimed he was forced to dig a trench while another said they had been made to clean the toilets for an hour at 8am for six days (file pictures) 'The Dean's policy is to make such an. order in preference to imposing a fine. The College recognises that the. effect of a fine varies according to students' ability to pay it.' The claims of trench digging and toilet cleaning were made in the student newspaper The Cambridge Student. It also revealed student have paid out a total of £38,209 in fines for bad behaviour since October 2011 - an average of £1,232.54 per college. A Freedom of Information request found Newnham college had levied the most - more than a quarter of the total fines at £12,872 - all of which supplemented college income. Meanwhile student fines at Downing College were used to fund a staff coach trip, figures released under the Freedom of Information Act revealed. Newnham College (pictured) levied the most fines upon students. It collected £12,872. The College said the annual trip for ‘bedders,’ porters and administrative staff is justifiable because it rewards the staff inconvenienced by student misbehaviour. A spokesman for Downing college added:. 'Most fines are suspended, as a means. of encouraging better behaviour in the future and only in the worst. cases are they imposed immediately. 'Any fines which are actually. collected - and this may vary from nothing to a few hundred pounds in. any year - are fed back into the staff social fund. 'In many cases the staff have been. those who have had to deal with the often unpleasant outcome; the fine. is hardly a 'reward' more a small compensation. 'The staff fund is used to support an. annual outing, designed to improve inter-staff bonding; however, the. far greater part of this cost is covered by their own fundraising events. - raffles, cake sales, coffee mornings etc. The College agrees a day's. absence from work to support this aim.' One student from the college was fined £200 for stealing a candlestick and another student at Magdalene college was made to pay £600 for smoking cannabis in their room. The spokesman added: 'The theft of a silver. candlestick from another College was intended to send a very stern. message that theft is never condoned, and potentially avoided the. individual concerned being reported to the Police and ending up with a. criminal record which could affect his future job prospects.' Harsh: One student at Downing College (pictured) was fined £200 for a stolen candlestick. Students at Girton college are charged up to £15 for each supervision session they miss. But the figures showed the actual amount varies with £43.43 being charged for missing two supervisions and £50.32 for missing three. Students are also fined £50 for leaving their bikes unattended in prohibited areas. And if there is an act of vandalism on college grounds the entire student body is fined. King’s college charges students £25 per head for every person involved in 'noise disturbance' while a 'noise violation' in Pembroke college merits a fine of £180. Pembroke also fines £70 for setting off the fire alarm. But a Pembroke student, who asked to remain anonymous, said: 'One of my friends was fined £80 for setting off the fire alarm by boiling a kettle. Pembroke said they’d lower the fine if he didn’t contest them.' Newnham £12,872 Gonville & Caius £9,930 Fitzwilliam £6,245 Clare £1,764 Girton £1,275.25. All fines revealed in the figures at Lucy Cavendish arise from leaving rooms in what were perceived to be unacceptable states. A spokesman for Lucy Cavendish college said: 'Students are asked to clean their rooms on departure. 'If this is not the case, fines (as set out in College handbook) will be imposed.' Newnham College charged £6,719 for 'housekeeping', but it did not state specific charges. Queen’s college revealed it does not levy fines, but has other means of maintaining discipline. A student from the college said: 'I think fining is terrible, as how severely people are affected by the fines will be largely dependent on the economic situation of the student and his/her family, which makes the system of punishment highly unfair.' The University has no overarching policy with regard to fining students as it is at the discretion of individual colleges to enforce behavioural discipline. Girton College (pictured) fined students £1,275.25 since October 2011. In total, Cambridge University students have paid out £38,209. Clare £1,205 - split between 5 students for a party. Magdalene £600 - smoking cannabis in room. Fitzwilliam £240 - bringing college into disrepute. Downing £200 - stolen candlestick. The University’s Statutes and Ordinances states that the University 'shall have all the powers of a natural. person to acquire, manage, charge, deal with, and dispose of property,. both real and personal [...] so that it may exercise any power and may. enter into and carry out any kind of transaction without limitation.' Colleges fine students for missing supervision, leaving their bikes unattended or for having disruptive parties. The majority of colleges charge for any damage done to rooms, but as this is a remunerative sum it is therefore classed as a charge rather than a fine. At matriculation, a student effectively acknowledges the University’s authority to deal with damage to property in any way the University sees fit.

This step prepares the food for easier swallowing and further digestion down the gastrointestinal tract."},{"instruction":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Jeremy Kerr, a researcher at the University of Ottawa in Canada, and his colleagues analyzed more than 400,000 observations of bumblebee species collected in North America and Europe from 1975 to 2010. When the researchers recorded the locations of these bee populations, they found that many of the 67 species analyzed were moving northward from their southern limits while the northern edges of the bees' ranges are staying in place. What it results in is obvious. Bees have been paid more attention to in recent years, with populations of honeybees and bumblebees obviously declining in some parts of Europe. Previously, attention on the decline of bee populations has focused on causes including habitat loss, pesticide use and the spread of bee parasites . But the work by Kerr's team found something different. \\"For every species, there is one or two species declining and others that are not moving at all,\\" says Kerr. This shift has also been observed in other species, such as butterflies. But due to a new cause -- the rise of temperatures instead of total pesticide use, a change in land use or parasites, bumblebees -- unlike butterflies -- have failed to extend the northern boundaries of their ranges into the territory that is now habitable for them, so bumblebee species across Europe and North America are declining rapidly, the latest study led by Kerr's team finds. \\"Our data suggest that the new factor plays a leading, or perhaps the leading, role in this trend,\\" says Kerr. \\"This study shows that a fourth factor is also beginning to affect it. It is likely that the combined stresses from all of these pressures will have destructive impacts on bumblebees in the not-too-distant future,\\" says Dave Goulson, a bee researcher at the University of Sussex, Brighton, UK. Exactly what can be done to help bumblebees is not clear. Kerr's team suggests that relocating colonies might be an answer but Goulson says that because the insects are mobile they are capable of moving northwards if there is suitable habitat available. Options: A Relocating bumblebees isn't much good. B The findings of Kerr's study are doubtful. C The future of bumblebees is still promising. D Knowing bumblebees' living habits is the most urgent. Answer: A Relocating bumblebees isn't much good. Question:","output":"According to the research study led by Jeremy Kerr at the University of Ottawa, which examined over 400,000 observations of bumblebee species across North America and Europe, what is the primary cause for the rapid decline of bumblebees, and why is relocating bumblebee colonies not a very effective solution? A) Habitat loss, pesticide use, and parasites are causing the decline, and relocating colonies is not effective because bumblebees are mobile and can move northwards if suitable habitats are available. B) The rise of temperatures is the main cause, and relocating colonies isn't much good because bumblebees can already move northwards if suitable habitats exist. C) Total pesticide use, land use change, and parasites contribute to the decline, and relocating colonies isn't efficient due to the risk of spreading parasites to new habitats. D) Land use changes and the spread of parasites are mainly responsible for the decline, and relocating colonies is a risky strategy as it may increase competition with other species for limited resources. Answer: B) The rise of temperatures is the main cause, and relocating colonies isn't much good because bumblebees can already move northwards if suitable habitats exist."},{"instruction":"Next question: what is a cross between a lion and tiger called?","output":"A cross between a lion and tiger is called a \\"liger.\\" It's kind of like mixing ice cream flavors, where you take a lion (like chocolate) and a tiger (like vanilla) and mix them together to create a new flavor.

As a result, fewer seeds were available for finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks could crack open and eat only the smaller seeds. Birds with bigger beaks could crack and eat seeds of all sizes. As a result, many of the small-beaked birds died in the drought. Birds with bigger beaks survived and reproduced (see Figure below ). Within 2 years, the average beak size in the finch population increased. Evolution by natural selection had occurred. The explorers visited Galapagos 1 and Galapagos 2, both islands part of the same archipelago. Island 1 had experienced a drought in recent years. Both islands had populations of birds living there. Which island had fewer small-beaked birds that could only crack open smaller seeds? The answer is:","output":"Island 1 Step 1: Understand the context given in the question: - The Grants were on the Galapagos - A drought occurred, resulting in fewer seeds for finches to eat - Birds with smaller beaks could only eat smaller seeds, while birds with bigger beaks could eat all sizes of seeds - Many small-beaked birds died during the drought, and big-beaked birds survived and reproduced, increasing the average beak size in the population - Evolution by natural selection had occurred - The explorers visited Island 1 (which experienced a drought) and Island 2 (no indication of a drought) Step 2: Identify the relationship between the drought and bird beak sizes: - The drought resulted in fewer seeds - As a consequence, small-beaked birds struggled to survive and many of them died Step 3: Compare Islands 1 and 2: - Island 1 experienced a drought, which affected the bird population by favoring birds with bigger beaks - Island 2 had no indication of a drought, and thus we can assume the small-beaked bird population was not affected in the same way as on Island 1 Step 4: Determine which island had fewer small-beaked birds: - Since the drought on Island 1 resulted in the death of many small-beaked birds and an increase in the average beak size of the surviving bird population, we can conclude that Island 1 had fewer small-beaked birds that could only crack open smaller seeds."},{"instruction":"If \\"Closeup of dog in profile with mouth open.\\", can we conclude \\"This photo is of a dinosaur.\\"?","output":"Based on the provided description, \\"Closeup of dog in profile with mouth open,\\" it is highly unlikely, in fact almost impossible, to conclude that \\"This photo is of a dinosaur.\\" Here's why: 1. Animal Recognition: Dogs and dinosaurs, despite both being animals, are fundamentally different. A dog is a mammal, commonly domesticated and kept as a pet with a variety of breeds and appearances. Dinosaurs, on the other hand, are a group of reptiles that existed millions of years ago with phenotypes vastly different from modern dogs. The distinction between the physical characteristics of dogs and dinosaurs is stark, making it hard to mistake one for the other based on visual evidence. 2. Time Frame: Another important factor is the time frame of each species. Dinosaurs went extinct approximately 65 million years ago. On the other hand, dogs have been man's best friend for thousands of years and are alive presently. Therefore, the likelihood of having a picture of a living, breathing dinosaur is non-existent based on what we know. 3. Evolution: In connection to the time frame, due to evolution processes, modern dogs evolved from wolves through selective breeding by humans, whereas dinosaurs have no direct descendants alive today in the form we know them but evolved into birds. 4. Description Given: The description given explicitly states that the photo is a \\"Closeup of a dog in profile with mouth open.\\" There is no mention of a dinosaur. It is crucial to stick to the facts presented without making unfounded assumptions. 5. Photography and Fossils: Dinosaurs thrived in an era before humans and more so before the invention of photography. Hence, the only visuals we have of dinosaurs are either archaeological remains, which typically include bones and fossils, or artistic renditions based on scientific research. These would look much different than a closeup shot of a dog with its mouth open. In conclusion, the description provided does not lend itself to the conclusion that \\"This photo is of a dinosaur.\\" Rather, it clearly indicates an image of a dog, which is an entirely different species with a distinct set of physical and biological characteristics. So, without additional context or evidence, it would not be reasonable to deduce that a photo depicting a dog is actually that of a dinosaur. Asserting such would require overlooking a vast amount of evidence to the contrary."},{"instruction":"Write some highlights for the following article: Acupuncture does not improve chronic knee pain in middle-aged people, experts said today. Their new study found real acupuncture using needles and lasers was no more helpful than sham acupuncture. It specifically looked at the effects of acupuncture on chronic knee pain in people aged 50 or over. Rana Hinman, lead author from the University of Melbourne, said the team of researchers were surprised at their results. She said: 'It is surprising that our study showed acupuncture was not effective compared to sham acupuncture, because many people with chronic knee pain report that treatment with acupuncture is beneficial for their symptoms.' Scientists in Australia found acupuncture does not improve chronic knee pain in middle-aged people. File photo. Previous studies has found acupuncture is effective, although the benefits compared to mock acupuncture have been generally small and of questionable benefit, she said. Her team found many people over the age of 50 are plagued with chronic knee pain, and many turn to alternative treatments, including acupuncture. Acupuncturists often use a combination of traditional Chinese and Western techniques with needles and low-intensity lasers. But the effectiveness of laser acupuncture has been questioned, the researchers said. To test whether needle or laser acupuncture is more effective than no acupuncture, the scientists divided 282 patients over the age of 50 with chronic knee pain and morning stiffness into four groups. The knee pain targeted in the study is common with osteoarthritis - the result of normal joint wear and tear over the years. One group received no acupuncture at all. Another received needle acupuncture, another laser acupuncture, while the last group received sham laser acupuncture. Patients received eight to 12 treatments over three months. Each treatment session lasted about 20 minutes. The laser and sham laser treatments looked the same to both patients and acupuncturists, but the laser was not turned on for the sham group. The patients rated their average knee pain and physical function on questionnaires at the beginning of the study, after three months of treatment and again at one year. There were 'modest improvements' in pain at three months in the needle and laser acupuncture groups compared to the no-treatment group, but not compared to the sham group. Researchers looked at the effects of laser acupuncture, pictured, and needle treatment on 282 patients. File picture. And there were no differences between any of the groups on measures of knee pain and function after one year. This suggests that there were no 'real' or 'direct' effects of needle or laser acupuncture, Dr Hinman said. The improvements patients felt were likely due to the placebo effect. 'Acupuncture tends to be more effective for people who believe in the benefits of acupuncture,' she said. 'In our study, people did not know that were signing up for an acupuncture study, so our participants were less likely to be 'believers' in acupuncture, which probably explains why acupuncture was ineffective in our study.' The new results are very similar to those of a review of individual patient data in 2012, said Andrew Vickers. Dr Vickers, who led the previous review, is an attending research methodologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City and was not involved in the new study. The new review may have found a benefit from real acupuncture compared to sham acupuncture if the study included more people, he said. 'About three million Americans try acupuncture per year, and chronic pain is the most common indication,' he said. People with chronic pain should see a pain specialist, as there are many options for treatment, including acupuncture, he said. 'As the authors suggest, the findings of this study are applicable to patients with moderate to severe persistent knee pain, and acupuncture may be effective in some people with neuropathic (nerve related) pain,' said Dr. Abhishek Abhishek, an arthritis researcher and associate professor at the University of Nottingham. The UK's National Institute for Clinical Excellence and Health does not recommend acupuncture for treating knee osteoarthritis, but does recommend it for persistent low back pain as it can be effective in that scenario, Dr Abhishek, who was not part of the new study, said. As alternatives to acupuncture, Dr Hinman said physical therapy, knee braces and exercise can all help alleviate chronic knee pain. The new study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Highlights:","output":"1.

Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians.

It takes longer on average to register a new business in Guinea-Bissau (233 days or about 33 weeks) than in any other country in the world except Suriname. [The Economist, Pocket World in Figures, 2008 Edition, London: Profile Books] Question: Political instability has resulted in what description of social conditions?","output":"Political instability has had a significant and noticeable impact on social conditions in Guinea-Bissau. The extract from The Economist points to a deterioration of these social conditions due to prolonged periods of political uncertainty. This uneasy political climate has disrupted the normal functioning of the society, leading to a decline in the overall quality of life for the citizens. Political instability often leads to uncertain policy environments and inconsistent decision-making by the authorities. It disrupts the investment climate, which in turn, stifles economic growth. The net result is a depressing economic activity that directly affects social conditions. Poor economic performance means there is less revenue for the government to spend on welfare programs, which leads to lower spending on essential services such as education, healthcare, social security, and public infrastructure. This reduced spending can manifest itself in various ways in the society. People may face worsening standards of healthcare, declining quality of education, reduced security, and even collapsed infrastructure. These problems then further endanger the livelihoods of the people, driving them into cycles of poverty and reinforcing social inequality, thus further deteriorating social conditions. Furthermore, the economic disparity induced by the depressed economy can potentially lead to higher levels of crime, as individuals resort to illegal activities out of desperation or lack of choices. This insecurity creates an environment where both physical and mental health can deteriorate, consequently worsening social conditions. In the case of Guinea-Bissau mentioned in the excerpt, this is reflected in the fact that it takes significantly longer to register a new business, which is indicative of bureaucratic inefficiency. This difficulty in starting a new business can discourage entrepreneurship and hinder job creation, leading to higher levels of unemployment and poverty, thereby exacerbating the already deteriorated social conditions. In conclusion, the political instability in Guinea-Bissau resulted in depressed economic activity, which in turn led to a considerable deterioration in the social conditions. The deteriorating social conditions are characterized by poverty, inequality, insecurity, poor education and healthcare services, unemployment, and compromised living standards, among others. Thus, political instability has a far-reaching impact on all aspects of social life."},{"instruction":"Find the right ending to this passage.

Below is a quick look at what Obama said Wednesday -- a few hours before he spoke to the public at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate -- on European concerns about U.S. surveillance programs, Russia's disagreement with the United States over Syria, and more: 1) Germany still leery about U.S. surveillance There have been some reports here in OPTIONS: - Afghanistan that that might be the case, but that is not,\\" he said. - America that that might be the case, but that is not,\\" he said. - Angela Merkel that that might be the case, but that is not,\\" he said. - Barack Obama that that might be the case, but that is not,\\" he said. - Berlin that that might be the case, but that is not,\\" he said. - Brandenburg Gate that that might be the case, but that is not,\\" he said. - CNN that that might be the case, but that is not,\\" he said. - European that that might be the case, but that is not,\\" he said. - G8 that that might be the case, but that is not,\\" he said. - German that that might be the case, but that is not,\\" he said. - Germany that that might be the case, but that is not,\\" he said. - Merkel that that might be the case, but that is not,\\" he said. - Northern Ireland that that might be the case, but that is not,\\" he said. - Obama that that might be the case, but that is not,\\" he said. - Russia that that might be the case, but that is not,\\" he said. - Syria that that might be the case, but that is not,\\" he said. - U.S. that that might be the case, but that is not,\\" he said. - United States that that might be the case, but that is not,\\" he said.","output":"The correct ending to the passage would be: \\"Germany that that might be the case, but that is not,\\" he said. This sentence makes sense because it refers to the reports in Germany, the place where the talk is happening, where they still have concerns about U.S. surveillance programs."},{"instruction":"What are the keywords in the following sentence: nd law a line drawn to any planet sweeps out equal areas in equal time intervals .","output":"1. nd law: The term \\"nd law\\" is referencing a principle, likely it's a shorthand for a more specific law. Since it involves planets and sweeping out equal areas in equal time intervals, it's referring to Kepler's Second Law. Step justification: It's essential to identify the foundation of the statement, and in this case, it's the law that the sentence is referring to. 2. line drawn: This specifies that a line is being considered in the context of this statement. Step justification: Identifying specific elements or shapes in the statement helps to better understand the context of the statement. 3. planet: The fact that the statement refers to a planet implies that the law discussed is related to celestial bodies and their motion. Step justification: Recognizing what objects are involved in the statement provides an understanding of the intended application of the law. 4. sweeps out: This term indicates the motion of the line drawn to the planet. Step justification: Identifying the action in the statement plays a significant role in understanding the statement's purpose. 5. equal areas: The idea of equal areas being swept out is a critical component of the concept being explained. Step justification: Recognizing the equality aspect gives insight into the pattern or behavior being discussed in the statement. 6. equal time intervals: This aspect is another crucial component of the concept since it specifies the time-related pattern occurring within the system. Step justification: Understanding the relevance of time in this statement is vital to comprehending the principle being conveyed."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

CONTEXT: Legado Deportivamente, los Juegos Olímpicos finalizaron con treinta plusmarcas mundiales y setenta y seis olímpicas nuevas. Las condiciones de la Ciudad de México ayudaron a los atletas de cortos esfuerzos, mientras que en el resto «provocó más de un desfallecimiento». Tres de esas marcas tuvieron una gran duración. Primeramente, la marca de Beamon tardó más de veinte años en ser superada. En el Campeonato Mundial de Atletismo de 1991, inicialmente Carl Lewis logró una nueva marca al saltar 8.91 metros, sin embargo, una hora después Mike Powell alcanzó los 8.95 metros. Por otro lado, la marca de Hines se mantuvo hasta 1988, cuando Calvin Smith la mejoró por 0.02 segundos. Finalmente, la plusmarca de Evans en los 400 metros duró hasta 1983, año en que Butch Reynolds llegó en 43.29 segundos. QUESTION: ¿Cuántos récords se obtuvieron en los Juegos Olímpicos?
