Through the dark, I could see three bolts left in the wall from where they'd taken down the crucifix. A confessional too beaten-up to have been sold was shaking in a way that suggested activity inside, and where the pews had been taken out, a couple hundred people were testifying to the DJ's moving sermon. Rachel stepped forward into the crowd while I took a moment to drink in the ceiling's blue-lit, shadowed vault and the light-catching haze from who-knows-what rising between the DJ and the crowd. There was a terrific echo, each beat reverberating inside of the next, and the old stained-glass windows rattled in their frames. On the dance floor, people moved with their eyes closed and their hands in the air. I danced with Rachel for a while, but then something by the bar seemed to be pulling her eyes. She told me that she was heading for a drink and slipped out of the crowd. When she hadn't come back halfway through the next song, I glanced over at the bar. It was just a little set-up where someone had stacked a few crates and brought something alcoholic to share, mostly beer. Rachel was standing with a plastic cup, looking like she was having a conversation, but I couldn't see anyone else there. The next time the crowd split, I saw him. He stood in front of a blue light, so I couldn't see him clearly, but what I saw was memorable. He wore a jacket of what might have been blue velvet, and his hair gleamed black against his white skin. The blue haze seemed to stop just shy of his pallor, setting off his striking face without illuminating its details, and his wrists flashed white in the darkness. He didn't move, just stared and held his drink. The next time I saw them, his mouth was moving. She nodded and he took her arm.

Here is the result: \\"registration 8 july 2004 18:29\\" In general, converting text to lower case involves replacing every uppercase letter with its corresponding lowercase letter, while keeping other characters like numbers, spaces and symbols unchanged. For instance, the word \\"Hello\\" would be transformed to \\"hello\\" in lower case. Lower case letters are also known as minuscules, and the process of converting uppercase letters (majuscules) to minuscules is often used in tasks like data manipulation, sorting or comparison. It's particularly useful in case-insensitive environments, like programming languages or search engines, where \\"HELLO\\" and \\"hello\\" should be treated as the same keyword or variable. Most programming languages and tools provide built-in functions or methods for converting text to lower case, making it simple to handle if necessary. For example, you can use the toLowerCase() method in JavaScript, .lower() in Python, or .ToLower() in C#. To sum up, converting text to lower case means transforming uppercase letters to their corresponding lowercase versions while leaving other characters intact. This process has valuable applications in various computing tasks, where case-insensitive treatment of words or phrases is required, and it can be easily achieved using standard functions or methods available in most programming languages."},{"instruction":"Instructions: You are given a math word problem and you are supposed to apply a single mathematical operators like addition, subtraction, multiplication or division on the numbers embedded in the text to answer the following question and then only report final the numerical answer.

How can I look pretty? Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"The questions \\"What are some tips for becoming pretty?\\" and \\"How can I look pretty?\\" generally have the same meaning. Both of them aim to ask for advice or suggestions on ways to improve one's physical appearance or attractiveness. While 'becoming pretty' might slightly imply a more permanent change, and 'looking pretty' might emphasize more on temporary measures, the distinction is subtle, and both questions can be adequately addressed using similar tips and suggestions. Here are some tips for improving one's physical appearance and becoming more attractive: 1. Personal hygiene: Maintaining a good, consistent hygiene routine is essential. Taking regular showers, brushing your teeth, flossing, and using mouthwash help prevent bad odors and promote overall cleanliness. 2. Skincare: Developing an effective skincare routine that caters to your skin type and also addresses specific concerns (e.g., acne, dry skin) enhances the natural texture and beauty of your skin. Be sure to cleanse, tone, moisturize, and apply sunscreen daily. 3. Hair care: Regularly shampoo, condition, and brush your hair, according to your hair type. Maintain a flattering haircut or hairstyle that suits your preferences and face shape. You can also use hair styling tools and products to enhance the look of your hair. 4. Makeup: Makeup can be used to accentuate and highlight certain facial features. Learn makeup techniques and choose products that compliment your skin tone, eye color, and other features. Remember that less is often more, so don't feel compelled to use heavy makeup to look pretty. 5. Clothing: Choose clothes that fit your body type, are well-maintained, and reflect your personal style. Ensure that your clothes are always clean and neatly pressed. Mixing and matching different outfits can also provide variety and keep your look fresh. Accessorize to further enhance your outfit and show your personality. 6. Posture and body language: Stand and sit up straight while maintaining an open and confident posture. Your body language says a lot about you, so being mindful of it can significantly impact your appearance. 7. Fitness and nutrition: Eating a well-balanced diet and engaging in regular physical activity boosts your overall health and positively impacts your appearance. It enhances your skin's condition, helps maintain a healthy weight, and promotes good posture and muscle tone. 8. Sleep: Prioritize getting enough sleep, as it helps improve your mood, maintain mental sharpness, and ensures your skin looks its best. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night. 9. Personal grooming: Keep your nails well-trimmed and clean, remove or groom facial hair if needed, and maintain your eyebrows in a shape that flatters your face. 10. Confidence: Embrace your unique qualities and express yourself confidently. People are often drawn to those who genuinely believe in themselves. 11. Smile: A genuine, warm smile can instantly light up your face and make you look more approachable and attractive. Remember that being pretty is subjective, and it's essential to find a balance between improving your appearance while staying true to who you are. Rather than just focusing on external factors, prioritize self-care and inner confidence to truly embark on the journey of becoming (and feeling) more attractive."},{"instruction":"Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Friends are important in our lives, but how to keep our friendship is more important.

The film tells the story of middleweight boxer Rubin \\"The Hurricane\\" Carter, who was convicted of committing a triple murder in a bar in Paterson, New Jersey. His sentence was set aside after he had spent nearly 20 years in prison. The film concentrates on Rubin Carter's life between 1966 and 1985. It describes his fight against the conviction for triple murder and how he copes with nearly 20 years in prison. A parallel plot follows Lesra Martin, an underprivileged Afro-American youth from Brooklyn, now living in Toronto. In the 1980s, the child becomes interested in Carter's life and circumstances after reading Carter's autobiography. He convinces his Canadian foster family to commit themselves to Carter's case. The story culminates with Carter's legal team's successful pleas to Judge H. Lee Sarokin of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. In 1966, Rubin \\"The Hurricane\\" Carter was a top-ranked middleweight boxer, expected by many fans to become the world's greatest boxing champion. When three victims, specifically the club's bartender and a male and a female customer, were shot to death in a bar in Paterson, New Jersey, Carter and his friend John Artis, driving home from another club in Paterson, were stopped and interrogated by the police. Although the police asserted that Carter and Artis were innocent and thus, \\"were never suspects,\\" a man named Alfred Bello, a suspect himself in the killings, claimed that Carter and Artis were present at the time of the murders. On the basis of Bello's testimony, Carter and Artis were convicted of the triple homicide in the club, Carter was given three consecutive life sentences. The answer is:","output":"The Hurricane's sentence at the time of conviction was three consecutive life sentences."},{"instruction":"Select from: [i] negative.

Jack: I'll be there :D Jake: I new you'd be happy :D Jack: See you tonight then ;) What was going on in that conversation?","output":"In the given conversation, there are two characters involved: Jake and Jack. The conversation evolves around a plan for the night, specifically involving Jake inviting Jack to come over to his place and help him with assembling a wardrobe. The conversation starts with Jake asking Jack if he would like to come over and visit him that night. Jake goes on to mention that he has a wardrobe to assemble, and he would appreciate Jack's help in the process. This implies that Jake may have recently bought a piece of furniture – the wardrobe – which is probably in a disassembled state, requiring assembly before it can be used. In response, Jack light-heartedly says that assembling a wardrobe is a great excuse to purchase a few beers, showing that he is viewing this task as an opportunity to have a good, casual time with his friend. He enthusiastically accepts the invitation by adding a smiling face emoticon to emphasize his excitement. Jake is pleased with Jack's willingness to help, and knows that his friend would be excited about this plan, as he replies, \\"I new (knew) you'd be happy :D\\". He uses a typo (new instead of knew) and emoticons to demonstrate a laid-back tone, which suggests that Jake and Jack share a close and friendly relationship. Jack confirms that he will be coming over later by saying, \\"See you tonight then ;)\\". He ends his sentence with a winking face emoticon to further display his friendly, excited demeanor. Overall, the conversation presents a casual and light-hearted interaction between two friends, Jake and Jack, who have planned to spend their night together while assembling a wardrobe and enjoying a couple of beers. The use of emoticons and colloquial language throughout their exchange helps to demonstrate the familiarity and friendly rapport between the characters."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: In which year did Bush announce that he will run for Congress? 1977 Answer:","output":"Title: A Race to Remember Genre: Political Drama Setting: Mid-late 1970s, United States Plot: The film begins in early 1977, as the United States is undergoing a time of significant change and turbulence, both politically and socially. The Vietnam War has recently ended, and the American public is growing increasingly disillusioned with politicians and corruption in the government. George W. Bush, a charismatic but controversial figure in Texas, is introduced as he struggles with the decision to pursue a career in politics or to continue his path in the oil industry. Encouraged by his family, particularly his father, George H.W. Bush, George ultimately decides to announce his candidacy for Congress in Texas's 19th Congressional District. The film follows George's passionate campaign team, led by seasoned political strategist Jack Ryan (played by a notable character actor), as they work tirelessly to secure support from the people of Texas. They face numerous obstacles and setbacks, including George's lack of political experience and personal demons, particularly his past issues with alcohol. Meanwhile, George's opponent in the race, Democrat Kent Hance (played by another noteworthy actor), is also working hard to secure votes and is presented as a stark contrast in both political beliefs and personality to George. The film focuses on the relationship between these two men, their differing ideas for the future of Texas and America, and the tactics each employs to try to win over the public's support. As the heated and drama-filled election season unfolds, candidates and their teams use different strategies and political maneuvers, leading up to a nail-biting climax on Election Day. The tension rises as the two campaigns await the announcement of the winner. In a shocking turn of events, George W. Bush loses the election to Kent Hance by a narrow margin. Despite his loss, the film ends on a hopeful note, as George learns from his experience and vows to continue his political journey. His resolve is strengthened, and he credits his run for Congress as the turning point where he began to take politics, and himself, more seriously. \\"A Race to Remember\\" serves as a powerful retelling of George W. Bush's first foray into politics and his eventual rise to become the 43rd President of the United States. The movie celebrates the idea that setbacks and losses can lead to growth and success in the future, and offers a unique window into the early political career of one of America's most influential figures."},{"instruction":"Question: U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch visited Orlando, Florida, on Tuesday, nine days after what she called a \\"shattering attack\\" at a gay nightclub.

Her visit comes as investigators continue to dig into the background of Omar Mateen, the gunman who killed 49 people and injured dozens more on June 12 at the Pulse nightclub. Lynch said it was a \\"cruel irony\\" that the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community — one defined almost entirely by love — is so often a target of hate.

Chinese is the language with the most speakers. English, Russian and Spanish are also spoken by many millions of people. On the other hand, some languages in the world have less than one hundred speakers. There are several important families of languages in the world. For example, most of the languages of Europe are in one large family called Indo-European. The original language of this family was spoken about 4,500 years ago. Many of the present day languages of Europe and India are modern forms of the language of 4,500 yeas ago. Languages are always changing. The English of today is very different from the English of 500 years ago. In time some even died out completely.

The first statement, \\"Swimmers by a nearby wave along with one surfer on the wave\\" seems to describe a scene at a beach or an ocean, where swimmers are present close to a wave, and there is a surfer riding the wave. It creates an image of a coastal setting, populated by people engaging in water activities. This statement does not provide any information related to the act of whaling, killing whales, or the weapons used in such activities. The second statement, \\"whalers kill 1000 unarmed whales\\", presents a fact or claim about a specific event or practice in which whaling - the act of hunting whales - is involved. This statement seems to emphasize that the whales being targeted by the whalers do not have any means of defense or are \\"unarmed\\". To draw a connection between these two statements, we would require more context or information that can link the two together. For example, it needs some additional data showing a causal relationship between these activities or the possibility of a shared location, timeframe, or any common factors between swimmers and surfers, and whaling activities. In summary, the two statements provided do not inherently relate to one another based on the information given. While the first statement describes a coastal setting with swimmers and a surfer, the second statement presents whaling activity involving the killing of 1000 whales.

The movie was written by Clooney and Grant Heslov (both of whom also have acting roles in the film) and portrays the conflict between veteran radio and television journalist Edward R. Murrow and U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin, especially relating to the anti-Communist Senator's actions with the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. Although released in black and white, Good Night, and Good Luck was filmed on color film stock but on a greyscale set, and was color corrected to black and white during post-production. It focuses on the theme of media responsibility, and also addresses what occurs when the media offer a voice of dissent from government policy. The film was critically acclaimed upon release. It was named \\"Best Reviewed Film of 2005 in Limited Release\\" by Rotten Tomatoes, where it achieved a 93% positive review rating, based on reviews from 217 critics. The film received six Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Director (Clooney), and Actor (Strathairn). Roger Ebert, in his Chicago Sun-Times review, contends that \\"the movie is not really about the abuses of McCarthy, but about the process by which Murrow and his team eventually brought about his downfall (some would say his self-destruction). It is like a morality play, from which we learn how journalists should behave. It shows Murrow as fearless, but not flawless.\\" Margaret Pomeranz and David Stratton from the ABC show At the Movies each gave the film five stars, making Good Night, and Good Luck the only other film besides Brokeback Mountain to receive such a score from the hosts in 2005. Both described the film as \\"beautiful\\" but also praised Clooney for the film's importance. Margaret commented that \\"[The film] is so important, because it's about things that are really vital today, like the responsibility of the press and examining the press' role in forming opinion.\\" David noted \\"Though [the film] is in black-and-white, there's nothing monochromatic about Clooney's passion for his subject or the importance of his message.\\" Jack Shafer, a libertarian-leaning columnist for the online magazine Slate, accused the film of continuing what he characterizes as the hagiography of Murrow. Clooney's film gives the impression that Murrow brought down McCarthy single-handedly, while Shafer notes that in reality much of the mainstream media, many Democrats and some of McCarthy's Republican peers were condemning him before Murrow. Furthermore, Shafer writes, evidence obtained via the declassified Venona espionage program confirmed that many Soviet agents and sympathizers were in fact in positions of influence in the U.S. government, a disclosure the film entirely overlooks: \\"Clooney and company ignore the material that might argue against their simple-minded thesis about Murrow, the era, and the press to produce an after-school special\\". One complaint about the film among test audiences was their belief that the actor playing McCarthy was too over the top, not realizing that the film used actual archive footage of McCarthy himself. Why was he over the top?","output":"The test audience believed that the actor playing McCarthy was too over the top because they might not have been fully aware of McCarthy's actual mannerisms and behavior during that period of history. The film used actual archive footage of McCarthy instead of having an actor portray him, so his behavior was not exaggerated or over the top for dramatic effect; it was a true representation of how he behaved during the events portrayed in the film. Their belief likely stems from being unfamiliar with the intensity and fervor that surrounded McCarthyism and the Red Scare, which led to Senator Joseph McCarthy's aggressive and sensationalized tactics in his anti-communist crusade. In reality, McCarthy was known for his dramatic and often controversial methods, which ultimately contributed to his downfall. As a result, the audience's perception of his behavior as overly dramatic demonstrates how accurately the film conveyed the real-life events and historical context."},{"instruction":"Given the question: FINAL EXAM Question 1.

So now our equation looks like this: 0 = 2 * o - 8 Now, we need to get the \\"o\\" all by itself. Let's find out how many times 2 can fit in 8. If you have 8 cookies and you share them with a friend, how many cookies would you each get? Yes, you both would get 4 cookies each! So, our equation becomes: 0 = o - 4 We're so close! Now, we just need to figure out what number \\"o\\" is. If you have 0 and you add 4 more, what number do you get? You're absolutely right! You get 4! That means that \\"o\\" = 4 in our equation! Our final answer is: o = 4"},{"instruction":"Identify the most salient words in this sentence: this sculpture of builder bearing his cross is a graphic focal point for this chapel .","output":"1.

While the first 10 to 15 minutes of the film were very promising and seemed like the beginning of a not too mainstream psychological thriller, it soon went downhill from there and eventually degraded into one of the most generic slasher films I've seen so far, including a massive amount of plot holes, unrealistic emotional responses and sub-par acting. It seems like Boll tried his best to come up with a decent plot but after a while just gave up on it. Maybe he should stick to comedy?! The few good things about this film is that he does manage to create an overall creepy atmosphere, that the special effects are better than I expected and the soundtrack does go well with the overall atmosphere, but the unbalanced pacing of this film combined with the utter generic nature thereof makes he last half hour quite tedious to watch, which ruined my experience altogether. There are a very fairly well done shocking scenes, but they seem to be there for the shock value alone. And let's not forget the camera work that was pretty nauseating at times. I hope Uwe Boll will one day learn what makes a good film, because between a lot of horrible films he does seem to make a decent film every now and then. Seed just isn't one of those.

They massacre the ranch hands and kidnap Little Jake, the grandson, leaving a ransom note and heading back for Mexico, where they have been hiding out. Martha, the head of the family, is offered the help of both the army and the Texas Rangers in hunting the gang. She replies that this will be \\"a harsh and unpleasant kind of business and will require an extremely harsh and unpleasant kind of person to see it through.\\" In consequence, she sends for her estranged husband, the aging Jacob \\"Big Jake\\" McCandles, a near-legendary gunfighter who wanders the west with his Rough Collie, simply named Dog. When Jake arrives by train, he and Martha discuss a plan to take the ransom to the kidnappers, a million dollars in a big red strongbox, although Jake warns that, \\"Pay or not, we run the risk of never seeing the boy again\\". Then his son Michael rides up on a motorcycle, bringing word that he has seen the kidnappers in the Chilicothe Canyon. The Texas Ranger captain is present and offers the services of his men, equipped with three REO touring cars. They, however, are ambushed and their cars put out of action. Jake, preferring the old ways, has followed on horseback, accompanied by an old Apache associate, Sam Sharpnose. He is now joined by his sons, Michael and James, with whom his relations are tense because of his desertion of the family ten years before. That night, Fain rides into their camp to make arrangements for the handover, telling Jake that they will âsend the boy's body back in a basket\\" if anything should go wrong. Both men deny any personal stake in the business, each claiming to be \\"just a messenger boy\\". The family party crosses into Mexico the next day and checks into a hotel.

Choose your answer from: a). yes; b). it is not possible to tell; c). no;...I think the answer is","output":"c). no; The reason for this conclusion is that the two statements provided do not seem to have any apparent connection or correlation between them. They describe two distinct scenarios involving different subjects and contexts. Let's analyze both statements separately for better understanding: Statement 1: \\"An adorable little boy plays in the dirt while lying on a brick divider.\\" This statement tells us that there is a young boy, presumably of a tender age, engaged in some activity in the dirt. He is lying on a brick divider, which could indicate that the setting is an urban area, perhaps a park or a playground. The brick divider could be a structural element separating different sections of the play area or the park. The focus of the statement is on the playful actions of the young child. Statement 2: \\"An old woman lays on the dirt road.\\" This statement introduces a completely different scenario. The subject is an elderly woman who is lying on a dirt road. The use of the term \\"dirt road\\" implies that the setting could be more rural or undeveloped, which contrasts with the brick divider in the first statement. Additionally, the woman's action - laying down - does not suggest that she is engaged in any activity similar to the boy in the first statement. Given the disparity in the subjects, settings, and actions described in the two statements, it is clear that we cannot draw a conclusion that links the situations in any meaningful manner.

Centuries later, Ernest P. Worrell works as a maintenance man at Kamp Kikakee but hopes to become a counselor. He quickly becomes a valuable addition to the staff, skilled at Plains Indian Sign Language, used by Kikakee's owner, Chief St. Cloud. A small group of juvenile delinquents, the Second Chancers, come to Kikakee. Head Counselor Tipton assigns Kikakee's most experienced counselor, Ross Stennis, to be the boys' counselor. Stennis is unhappy with this assignment, and he treats the boys harshly. After he goes too far by intentionally causing Moustafa Jones, the smallest boy in the group, to nearly drown in the lake during swimming, only for Moustafa to be rescued by Ernest, the boys retaliate against Stennis's cruelty by toppling his lifeguard perch into the lake, badly injuring Stennis's leg in the process. Since Stennis is no longer able to perform his duties as a counselor and Kikakee is already shorthanded, Tipton offers Stennis's position to Ernest.

He is most famous for unearthing the palace of Knossos on the Greek island of Crete. Evans continued Heinrich Schliemann's concept of a Mycenaean civilization, but found that he needed to distinguish another civilization, the Minoan, from the structures and artifacts found there and throughout the eastern Mediterranean. Evans was also the first to define Cretan scripts Linear A and Linear B, as well as an earlier pictographic writing. Context: Evans and Margaret moved back to Oxford, renting a house there in January 1883. This period of unemployment was the only one of his life; he employed himself finishing up his Balkan studies. He completed his articles on Roman roads and cities there. It was suggested that he apply to a new Professorship of Classical Archaeology at Oxford. When he found out that Jowett and Newton were among the electors, he decided not to apply. He wrote to Freeman that to confine archaeology to classics was an absurdity. Instead he and Margaret travelled to Greece, seeking out Heinrich Schliemann at Athens. Margaret and Sophia had a long visit for several hours, during which Evans examined the Mycenaean antiquities at hand with Heinrich. Meanwhile, Ashmolean Museum, an adjunct of Oxford University, was in a chaotic state of transition. It had been a natural history museum, but the collections had been transferred to other museums. The lower floor housed some art and archaeology, but the upper floor was being used for university functions. John Henry Parker, appointed the first keeper in 1870, had the task of trying to manage it. His efforts to negotiate with the art collector C. Drury E. Fortnum, over housing his extensive collection, were being undercut university administrators. In January 1874, Parker died. The museum was in the hands of its assistant keepers, one of whom, Edward Evans (no relation), was to be Evans's executive during Evans's extended absences. The strategy for the museum now was to convert it to an art and archaeology museum, expanding the remaining collections . In November 1883, Fortnum wrote to Evans asking for his assistance in locating some letters in the Bodleian Library that would help to validate a noted ring in his collection; he did so on the advice of John Evans of the Society of Antiquaries. Unable to find the letters, Arthur Evans suggested Fortnum visit Oxford. Fortnum in fact was becoming dissatisfied with rivals for his collection, the South Kensington Museum, because of their \\"lack of a properly informed and competent person as keeper.\\" Evans had the right qualifications and took the position of keeper at the Ashmolean when it was offered. In 1884, therefore, Evans, at the age of 34, was appointed Keeper of the Ashmolean Museum. He held a grand inauguration at which he outlined his planned changes, publishing it as The Ashmolean as a Home of Archaeology in Oxford. Already the great frontage building had been erected. Evans took it firmly in the direction of being an archaeology museum. He insisted the artifacts be transferred back to the museum, negotiated for and succeeded in acquiring Fortnum's collections, later gave his father's collections to the museum, and finally, bequeathed his own Minoan collections, not without the intended effect. Today it has the finest Minoan assemblages outside Crete. He also persuaded Fortnum to donate PS10,000 to build the extensive rooms behind the impressive facade, buildings which have only recently been demolished to make way for the new Ashmolean Museum. Evans gave the Ilchester Lectures for 1884 on the Slavonic conquest of Illyricum, which remained unpublished. Question: What are some of the artifacts that he is in charge of?. Whats the answer?","output":"As the Keeper of the Ashmolean Museum, Arthur Evans was in charge of a wide range of artifacts, spanning various periods, cultures, and geographical regions. Some of the key artifacts and collections he oversaw and contributed to include: 1. The Fortnum Collection: A significant collection of artworks, especially Italian Renaissance bronze sculptures, maiolica, and other decorative arts, that Evans succeeded in acquiring for the Ashmolean by working closely with the art collector C. Drury E. Fortnum. 2. The John Evans Collection: Arthur Evans donated his father's collection to the Ashmolean, which comprised of a variety of archaeological and prehistoric finds, including Paleolithic stone tools, Bronze Age implements, and antiquities from various ancient cultures. 3. The Minoan Collection: Perhaps the most distinguished collection in the Ashmolean Museum, thanks to Arthur Evans' own work in Crete. This assemblage consists of artifacts unearthed at the palace of Knossos and other Minoan sites, such as frescoes, pottery, stone carvings, and Linear A and Linear B scripts. 4. The Ashmolean Museum also possesses a diverse range of antiquities from ancient civilizations, such as Egypt, Greece, and Rome, including sculptures, pottery, coins, jewelry, and inscriptions. Arthur Evans would have been responsible for these artifacts as well during his tenure as Keeper. 5. The museum also houses an extensive collection of Eastern Art from regions like China, Japan, India, and the Islamic world. These collections include porcelain, jade, paintings, and various other objects representing the artistic and cultural heritage of these regions. As Keeper of the Ashmolean Museum, Arthur Evans not only supervised and expanded these collections but also ensured that the museum moved in the direction of being an archaeology-focused institution, thus establishing it as one of the most prominent archaeology and art museums in the world today. His persistence in negotiating the acquisition of important collections, securing the return of artefacts, and spearheading the development of new facilities greatly contributed to the museum's standing and reputation."},{"instruction":"Q: Title: Focuses on private life Review: This book is an excellent discussion of JQA's private life, his thoughts, motives, feelings, etc. I feel that I understand him as a man after having read the books and learned a lot about determination and perseverance that personally benefited me.

But the freckle-faced former \\"Happy Days\\" star radiated an infectious delight in smashing as many roaring muscle cars as he could get away with. Since then, of course, Howard has become one of Hollywood's most consistent and respected filmmakers, crafting well-made crowd-pleasers that tackle more highbrow subjects. But judging from his white-knuckle new film, \\"Rush,\\" he hasn't outgrown his youthful sweet tooth for four-wheeled mayhem. He still has hot rods and the death-defying men who drive them on his mind. Based on the real-life rivalry between Formula One racing legends James Hunt and Niki Lauda, \\"Rush\\" is a tale of two opposite personalities eyeing the same checkered-flag goal: winning the 1976 world championship. Chris Hemsworth draws the flashier role in Hunt, a fast-burning British bad boy with flowing blond locks, silk shirts unbuttoned to his navel, and a rakish playboy swagger. On and off the track, he's wild, cocky, and undisciplined — a deadly combination when you're strapped into a coffin on wheels going 170 miles an hour. ''The closer you are to death, the more alive you feel,'' Hemsworth's Hunt says. And it's thanks to the \\"Thor\\" star's champagne-spraying charisma that he makes risking your neck look like the coolest job on the planet.

While the increasingly imposing architectural profiles of these urban centers can be visually jarring, the deeper scars of the march of tower blocks extend beyond aesthetics. The lives of countless individuals and families have been impacted in ways that paint an even more troubling picture of tower block-related harm. Negative Impact on Communities: (Step 2: Discuss the impact of tower blocks on local communities) 1. Loss of community spirit: Tower blocks, with their cold, impersonal designs, have contributed greatly to the fragmentation and isolation of communities. Smaller, neighborhood-driven spaces, where residents could socialize and interact with one another, have gradually been replaced with the towering skyscrapers. Consequently, a sense of belonging and the strength of close-knit communities have been significantly diminished. 2. Economic disparity: As real estate developers and investors sought to capitalize on the potential luxury housing boom that tower blocks represented, housing prices skyrocketed. This resulted in lower-income residents being displaced from their neighborhoods, leading to increasing gaps in economic equality within cities. Environmental Impacts: (Step 3: Highlight the environmental consequences of tower block construction and living) The construction of tower blocks has led to several environmental concerns, ranging from energy consumption to waste management. The towering structures are responsible for consuming vast amounts of energy for heating, cooling, and lighting, contributing significantly to a city's carbon footprint. Additionally, these densely populated buildings produce large amounts of waste, thereby placing further pressure on already strained waste management systems and leading to issues such as pollution and public health risks. Physical and Mental Health Implications: (Step 4: Analyze the negative impact of tower blocks on the physical and mental health of residents) 1. Reduced green spaces and outdoor areas: As cities become more crowded due to tower blocks, open green spaces are often sacrificed, which has a direct link to decreased physical activity and, as a result, reduced overall health. 2. Mental health concerns: High-rise living has been linked to increased feelings of isolation, depression, and anxiety among residents. The lack of connection to neighbors and communities, coupled with minimal access to outdoor spaces and sunlight, contributes significantly to these mental health issues. The Need for Change: (Step 5: Highlight the importance of addressing the issue and possible solutions) For cities around the world to continue thriving, it is essential that urban planners, architects, and policymakers work together to create a more sustainable and equitable urban landscape. This may require a focus on designing buildings that foster strong communities, incorporating more green spaces into cityscapes, and implementing policies that prevent economic displacement. Conclusion: (Step 6: Sum up the main points and re-emphasize the impact of tower blocks on lives) The encroachment of tower blocks on city skylines is not just an aesthetic blight; rather, it is emblematic of deeper fissures in contemporary urban life. From fractured communities to negative environmental implications and deleterious effects on physical and mental health, the rise of tower blocks has left an indelible mark on the lives of those who dwell in their shadows. As urban dwellers and policymakers alike grapple with the complexities and challenges of modern city life, the quest for more harmonious and sustainable solutions is more important than ever."},{"instruction":"What is the answer to this question? in what year was the fall of jerusalem to the romans and destruction of the second temple?","output":"The fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of the Second Temple occurred in the year 70 CE (Common Era). This catastrophic event was the culmination of a series of conflicts between the Romans and the Jews living in the province of Judea. To provide a comprehensive understanding of this event, it's important to delve into the historical context and the factors that led to this tragedy. The Second Temple was an essential religious and cultural hub for the Jewish people. It was built on Jerusalem's Temple Mount in 516 BCE after the return of the Jewish exiles from Babylon. The temple was later renovated and expanded by King Herod the Great around 20 BCE, making it a monumental architectural wonder. The Roman Empire ruled over a vast area, including the province of Judea. In the first century CE, various Jewish factions, including the Pharisees, Sadducees, Zealots, and Essenes, had distinct views on their relationship with the Roman authorities. Tensions between the Jews and the Romans continued to escalate as the Jews struggled for religious and political autonomy. In 66 CE, the Great Jewish Revolt broke out after the Romans plundered the Second Temple's treasury and murdered several Jewish leaders. This conflict marked the beginning of the First Jewish-Roman War, which lasted until 73 CE. The Zealots and other Jewish rebel factions fought against the Roman forces, led initially by Cestius Gallus and later by Vespasian and his son Titus. The Roman forces, known for their tactical prowess, had managed to suppress the Jewish rebellion in other parts of Judea before laying siege to Jerusalem in April 70 CE. The Roman legions led by Titus surrounded the city, cutting off food and water supplies, leading to desperate conditions within the city walls. The fall of Jerusalem occurred on the 10th of August (Tisha B'Av). After weeks of siege, the Romans breached the city walls, proceeded to sack the city, and put the remaining defenders to the sword. The Second Temple, considered the holiest site in Judaism, was destroyed in the process, a severe blow to the Jewish people's religious and cultural identity. The aftermath of this calamity included the enslavement and mass displacement of a significant portion of the Jewish population, along with the establishment of the Fiscus Judaicus, a tax system imposed on the Jews, both in Judea and across the Roman Empire. Jerusalem's fall and the Second Temple's destruction in 70 CE, as well as the subsequent Jewish diaspora, remain pivotal moments in Jewish history. These events not only shaped the course of Judaism but also influenced the development and spread of Christianity. The memory of the Second Temple's destruction continues to be commemorated annually during the Jewish fast of Tisha B'Av."},{"instruction":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Antares, a prominent launch vehicle designed and developed by the American aerospace manufacturer Northrop Grumman, is a two-stage rocket primarily utilized for transporting payloads into a low Earth orbit (LEO), which consists of altitudes between 160 and 2,000 kilometers above the Earth's surface. Bearing a key role in the realm of space transportation, Antares has been utilized extensively for commercial purposes, as well as scientific and technological endeavors. Initially conceived under the Cygnus spacecraft program – a joint venture between Orbital Sciences Corporation (now part of Northrop Grumman) and Thales Alenia Space – Antares was designed to meet the cargo resupply needs of the International Space Station (ISS). This goal aligned with NASA's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program, which sought to facilitate ISS missions through collaborations with private companies. The maiden flight of Antares, which transpired on April 21, 2013, marked a pivotal milestone in its development and application. Launched from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS) at the Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, Antares embarked on its first-ever journey, carrying a mass simulator payload to replicate the Cygnus spacecraft. This test flight aimed to validate the rocket's performance and functionality before actual ISS missions. The result of this maiden flight proved to be a resounding success, as Antares flawlessly executed its primary objectives, demonstrating its capability to deliver payloads into LEO. Since then, Antares has built upon this achievement, most notably serving as the launch vehicle for the Orbital Sciences' Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) program, supporting a total of 16 ISS cargo resupply missions as of January 2022. In summary, the data provided refers to the Antares rocket and its highly significant maiden flight, which occurred on April 21, 2013.

Wind-up type alarm clocks with bells, clock radios, and even many cell phones and pagers can be set to play an alert that can wake even the deepest sleepers. Choose alarm type.","output":"When selecting the alarm type, consider the following options to ensure that it best suits your personal preferences and sleep habits: 1. Sound options: Traditional alarm clocks often make use of a loud, jarring buzzer or bell sound that can be effective in waking you up from a deep slumber. Digital alarm clocks and smartphones, on the other hand, offer a wider variety of sounds, such as beeps, songs, nature sounds, and even your favorite tunes. In addition, some devices allow you to adjust the volume and gradually increase the noise level, ensuring a more gentle wake-up experience. 2. Vibration: For individuals who are heavy sleepers, a vibrating alarm clock may be the ideal choice. These alarms create a physical sensation instead of relying on noise that can be felt even when the volume is low. Using a vibrating wristband or placing the alarm under your pillow can be effective methods to wake up without disturbing a sleeping partner. 3. Light-based alarms: Light-based alarm clocks simulate the rising sun by gradually increasing the brightness in the room, providing a natural way to wake up that doesn't rely on startling noises. These devices can be especially helpful for individuals who suffer from seasonal affective disorder, since they mimic the effect of a sunrise and provide an energizing start to the day. 4. Sleep cycle alarms: Some alarm clocks are designed to work in conjunction with sleep analysis apps or devices that monitor your sleep cycle. These alarms aim to wake you up during a lighter stage of sleep, leading to a less groggy wake-up experience. By tracking your sleep patterns and movements, these clocks can help reduce the likelihood of interrupting a deep sleep, making it easier to rise and feel refreshed. 5. Dual alarms: For those who need an extra boost to get out of bed, using a dual alarm system that combines both sound and vibration can be an effective wake-up strategy. This approach may also be useful for couples with different schedules, as one partner may require a louder alarm than the other. 6. Snooze button: While some individuals may benefit from a snooze function, enabling them to gradually wake up over a period of time, others may find that hitting snooze repeatedly leads to oversleeping and reduced productivity. In this instance, consider finding an alarm without a snooze button or pursuing additional strategies to help resist the temptation to snooze. Once you have chosen your preferred alarm type, be sure to test it out for several mornings to ensure its effectiveness. Modify the settings as needed to create the most optimal wake-up experience, accounting for factors such as volume, vibration intensity, and light brightness. Consistently waking up with an alarm clock may take some time to adjust to, but with persistence and a suitable device, you can train yourself to rise on time and optimize your daily routine."},{"instruction":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: \\"Bosch\\" is an American police procedural television series produced by Amazon Studios.

Content: The review \\"Very interested\\" consists of only two words, which provides minimal information to form a conclusive opinion. It, however, implies a positive outlook towards the subject. The lack of details or supporting information makes it difficult to provide a complete understanding of the reviewer's experience or evaluate the product/service being discussed. Therefore, on the content criteria, I would give this review a rating of 2. 2. Context: Without knowing the context in which the review was written, it is challenging to determine its accuracy, relevance, and helpfulness. If \\"Very interested\\" is a review for an event, workshop, or a book, it portrays the writer's enthusiasm rather than a review of the content itself. On the other hand, if the review is for a product or service, it might be considered more relevant. Due to the lack of context, it is hard to assign a precise rating. However, I would cautiously rate it as a 2, and this could vary depending on the context. 3. Relevance: The relevance of a review is based on how well it upholds the expectations and requirements of future readers seeking accurate information. A review titled \\"Very interested\\" creates interest in learning more, but it fails to provide a potential reader or user with concrete information to make an informed decision. Therefore, I would rate the relevance of this review as 2. Considering these three criteria, the average rating of the review stands at 2.

Born in 1888 in Helensburgh, Scotland, Baird had a passion for the study of engineering and development of new ideas. His demonstration took place on January 26, 1925, at the Royal Institution in London; however, leading up to this event, he had been conducting experiments in Glasgow and other parts of Scotland. During these initial experiments, Baird worked tirelessly to develop the initial prototype of the television system and carried out much of his research in Glasgow from 1920 to 1923. He moved to Hastings in 1923 and continued to work on improving his television system. In October 1924, a milestone was reached when he achieved a crude, flickering black and white image through his mechanical television system. This early success gave him the motivation to prepare a public demonstration, which eventually took place in London followed by a second demonstration in Glasgow. In the 1925 London demonstration, Baird projected an image of a ventriloquist's dummy known as \\"Stooky Bill.\\" The image was less than perfect -- low quality and flickering, but it was remarkable in the fact that it represented the first working example of a television system. On March 25, 1925, Baird repeated the demonstration for a gathering of technical experts at the Grand Central Hotel in Glasgow, where he received much acclaim for his invention. Following these demonstrations, Baird's fame grew and he continued to refine his system. By the end of 1925, he was able to transmit recognizable human faces, and by 1926, he had successfully transmitted moving images of people. This eventually led to his invention of the television as we know it today, which went on to become a major staple in households around the world."},{"instruction":"Given the question: - Over time, more sediment piles on top - The resulting heat and pressure transforms the organic layer into a dark and waxy substance known as kerogen - Left alone, the kerogen molecules eventually crack - The molecules break up into shorter and lighter molecules composed almost solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms - It will turn into either petroleum or natural gas - What might be the first step of the process?

At the same time a bastion known as Legge's Mount was built at the castle's north-west corner. Brass Mount, the bastion in the north-east corner, was a later addition. The three rectangular towers along the east wall 15 metres (49 ft) apart were dismantled in 1843. Although the bastions have often been ascribed to the Tudor period, there is no evidence to support this; archaeological investigations suggest that Legge's Mount dates from the reign of Edward I. Blocked battlements (also known as crenellations) in the south side of Legge's Mount are the only surviving medieval battlements at the Tower of London (the rest are Victorian replacements). A new 50-metre (160 ft) moat was dug beyond the castle's new limits; it was originally 4.5 metres (15 ft) deeper in the middle than it is today. With the addition of a new curtain wall, the old main entrance to the Tower of London was obscured and made redundant; a new entrance was created in the south-west corner of the external wall circuit. The complex consisted of an inner and an outer gatehouse and a barbican, which became known as the Lion Tower as it was associated with the animals as part of the Royal Menagerie since at least the 1330s. The Lion Tower itself no longer survives. Edward extended the south side of the Tower of London onto land that had previously been submerged by the River Thames. In this wall, he built St Thomas's Tower between 1275 and 1279; later known as Traitors' Gate, it replaced the Bloody Tower as the castle's water-gate.

Walsall's ambitions: Walsall FC, a League Two club, has been focusing on improving their squad for the upcoming season. Their goal is to gain promotion by strengthening their defense, which has been an area of concern for the club. By signing Devlin, Walsall has added an experienced and skilled defender to their roster who could potentially contribute to their ambitions to climb the ranks. 4. Impact on Walsall's squad: Nicky Devlin's arrival will likely have a substantial impact on Walsall's defensive lineup. His versatility and strong defensive skills will provide the team with additional depth and options in their defensive strategy. Furthermore, as a former captain, Devlin brings leadership qualities and experience that could benefit the team's overall dynamic. 5. Conclusion: Walsall's acquisition of Ayr United skipper Nicky Devlin is a strategic move aimed at strengthening their defensive lineup and overall squad performance. As Walsall FC gears up for the upcoming season, fans and analysts will be eager to see the impact that Devlin's experience and skill set will have on the club's ambitions to climb the league ladder."},{"instruction":"Read the below conversation.

Riley began digging a hole in the backyard. Given the context: What does Riley need to do before this? Answer:","output":"Before Riley begins digging a hole in the backyard to hide a bone from her dog, there are several steps and considerations she should take into account to ensure the task is done properly and safely. Here is a detailed outline of the steps Riley should follow before digging the hole: 1. Choose an appropriate location: The first thing Riley needs to do is to decide on the best spot in the backyard to dig the hole. She should pick an area that is not easily accessible to her dog and away from any utility lines or pipes. Additionally, she should consider factors like drainage, sunlight, and the type of soil present. 2. Gather the necessary tools and equipment: To dig a hole, Riley will need some essential tools and equipment. These may include a shovel or spade, gloves to protect her hands, a tarp or bucket to collect the excavated soil, and a measuring tape or ruler to gauge the depth of the hole. She may also find it helpful to have a wheelbarrow handy to transport the excavated soil, if necessary. 3. Check for utility lines and pipes: To avoid damaging any underground utility lines or pipes, Riley should call her local utility company to ensure that she can dig safely in her chosen location. In many areas, there is a specific phone number for this purpose, such as \\"Call Before You Dig\\" or \\"Dial 811.\\" This service will make sure that Riley does not inadvertently cause any damage while digging. 4. Mark the boundaries: Once she has selected a spot and confirmed that it is safe to dig, Riley should mark the boundaries of the hole using a combination of stakes and string or a spray paint specifically designed for marking grass. This will give her a clear visual guide to follow as she digs and will help her maintain the desired size and shape of the hole. 5. Plan for excavated soil: As Riley digs the hole, she will need a place to temporarily store the excavated soil. A tarp or bucket can be useful for this purpose, and she should set up these items near the digging site before starting. Planning for excavated soil will make the process tidier and easier. 6. Ensure her dog's safety and well-being: Riley should make sure that her dog is safely secured in another area of the yard or inside the house during the digging process to prevent it from interfering or getting hurt. She should also ensure that her dog has everything it needs, like water and shade, to remain comfortable while she works. 7. Prepare for potential complications: Finally, Riley should think ahead about any potential difficulties that she may encounter during the digging process, such as hitting rocks, roots, or particularly hard soil. Having a plan in place to address such issues will make it easier for her to adapt and continue with her task. By following these steps and taking the time to plan and organize her approach, Riley will be better prepared to dig a hole in her backyard to hide the bone from her dog effectively. This will give her a higher success rate of achieving her desired outcome while ensuring the safety of her property and her furry friend."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Devour the Power is the debut album by American heavy metal band Destroy Destroy Destroy . - Black Market Activities (sometimes abbreviated BMA) is an American independent record label that was founded in 2003 by Guy Kozowyk, the frontman of the Boston, Massachusetts-based extreme metal band the Red Chord. - Destroy Destroy Destroy is an American heavy metal band formed in Murfreesboro, Tennessee in late February 2003.

Bellette and Haefliger returned to Australia just before the outbreak of World War II. Shortly after her arrival, Bellette held an exhibition at Sydney's Macquarie Galleries. The couple became influential members of the Sydney Art Group, a network of \\"fashionable\\" moderns whose membership included William Dobell and Russell Drysdale. Bellette painted and held regular shows – \\"a solo show every second year and a group show every year at the Macquarie Galleries\\". Her husband served as art critic for The Sydney Morning Herald for a decade and a half.In 1942, Bellette won the Sir John Sulman Prize with For Whom the Bell Tolls. She won it again in 1944 with her painting Iphigenia in Tauris, inspired by Euripides' play. The composition is set in a dry, open landscape, with several riders on horses whose appearance suggests \\"the Australian present, rather than Greek antiquity\\". The judge awarding the prize actually preferred another of her entries, Electra, depicting the sister of Iphigenia also prominent in Greek tragedy – but it failed to meet the size requirements. Both Iphigenia in Tauris and Electra were among the many works created by Bellette in the 1940s that were inspired by the tragedies of Euripides, Sophocles and Homer. Her choice of subject matter and approach placed her at odds with mainstream modernism, while she seemed to shun explicit links between the classical and the Australian. Bellette reasoned that she preferred to choose her palette and the spatial arrangements of her compositions to evoke a place's atmosphere. Critics identified the influence of European modernists Aristide Maillol and Giorgio de Chirico, as well as Italian Quattrocento painters Masaccio and Piero della Francesca, about some of whom Bellette wrote articles in the journal Art in Australia.The most distinctive feature of the artist's work was this choice of classical subjects. In 1946, Bellette's paintings were hung in at least four separate exhibitions. Reviewers commented on her synthesis of \\"the impulsiveness of romanticism...

She is approached by an enigmatic and wealthy client, Mr. Williams. Williams hires her to keep a close eye on a man named Collins (main antagonist), claiming that Collins has stolen sensitive information from his company, which could put national security at risk. Act 2: Sonia takes the job and moves to the city where Collins resides. She immerses herself in Collins' life, trying to maintain a low profile as an average neighbor. As she gets closer to Collins, she discovers that he is not as malicious as she'd thought. Instead, he's a family man with a wife and a teenage daughter and seems to be just an ordinary citizen. Despite Collins' seemingly normal life, Sonia starts to notice some strange activities. Late-night phone calls, unusual meetings with mysterious people, and encrypted messages arouse her suspicions. Sonia gathers evidence and relays the information to Mr. Williams, building a case against Collins. Act 3: As Sonia continues her surveillance, she inadvertently becomes close to Collins' family, particularly his daughter, Emily. An emotional bond forms between Sonia and Emily, which leads to Sonia feeling conflicted about her mission and doubting the true intentions of her client, Mr. Williams. In a surprising turn of events, Sonia discovers evidence that points to Mr. Williams being involved in illegal arms trade and corruption, using Collins as a scapegoat. The sensitive information Collins possesses is evidence crucial to expose Mr. Williams' illicit activities and bring down his criminal empire. Act 4: Upon realizing the full extent of Mr. Williams' actions, Sonia decides to help Collins instead of spying on him. She confronts Collins and informs him about her initial mission, gaining his trust by revealing Williams' true intentions. Together, Collins, Sonia, and Emily work on a plan to expose Mr. Williams and clear Collins' name. The film reaches its climax with a thrilling sequence in which Sonia, Collins, and Emily must outsmart both Mr. Williams' henchmen and the authorities, who believe Collins to be the national security threat. Act 5: In an intense finale, Sonia and Collins deliver the evidence against Mr. Williams to the proper authorities, leading to Williams' arrest and incarceration.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less sediment would be transported happens, how will it affect MORE sediment being transported. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you propose suggests that if less sediment is transported, it may somehow affect more sediment being transported. To analyze this, we can examine each step of the sediment transportation process and consider the direct and indirect effects of the perturbation. 1. Sediment settles in a place due to gravity: If less sediment is being transported, this step might be less impacted. Initially, there could be potentially fewer areas with significant sediment deposits. 2. Sediment breaks down into small particles: This step would remain mostly unchanged. The breakdown of sediment into smaller particles will still occur, but the overall quantity of sediment particles may be reduced. 3. Wind or water picks up the sediment: With less sediment available for transport, wind or water might potentially pick up fewer particles. This could lead to a decreased rate of sediment transport, which reinforces the perturbation hypothesis. 4. Sediment travels along the same route as the wind or water: This step should remain unchanged, as the sediment particles will continue to be transported along the same pathways. The intensity of sediment transport, however, may be reduced. 5. Sediment is deposited at new locations by the wind or water: As less sediment is transported, fewer new deposits would be created. This may lead to less sediment accumulation and, consequently, less sediment available for future transport. 6. Sediment is picked up again by new wind or water: In areas with reduced sediment deposits and less sediment being transported, there would be less sediment available for this re-transport. 7. Sediment travels further: The sediment particles that do get transported will still follow the same process; however, the quantity could be less compared to the scenario before the perturbation. 8. Sediment is deposited again in a new place: As less sediment is transported, fewer new deposits would be created in these secondary locations, leading to a reduced overall sediment transport. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of less sediment being transported does have direct and indirect effects on the process. Directly, there would be less sediment available for transport and, therefore, fewer new deposits. Indirectly, the reduced sediment availability could lead to an overall decline in sediment transport, which then reinforces the perturbation. The entire sediment transportation process would likely slow down, with fewer movements and lesser accumulations observed in various locations."},{"instruction":"This is a test of commonsense.

What might be the first step of the process? A:","output":"The first step in the process of regulating blood composition would be to maintain the balance of water and electrolytes within the blood. This is important because the volume of water in blood must be kept constant, and the correct balance of electrolytes is necessary for proper cellular function. To achieve this step-by-step: 1. Monitor the blood volume and concentration: The body detects changes in blood volume and electrolyte concentrations by using specialized receptors called osmoreceptors, located in the hypothalamus of the brain, and baroreceptors, found in blood vessels like the aorta and carotid arteries. 2. Trigger the release of hormones: When the blood volume or electrolyte concentration deviates from the desired levels, the brain signals the release of appropriate hormones such as antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the posterior pituitary gland and aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. 3. Adjust water and electrolyte balance: ADH increases the reabsorption of water by the kidneys, returning more water to the bloodstream and consequently reducing urine production. Aldosterone stimulates the kidneys to reabsorb more sodium and excrete more potassium, and water follows the sodium, helping to maintain the proper blood volume. 4. Maintain blood pressure: As the kidneys help regulate blood volume, they also play a role in maintaining blood pressure. When blood pressure is low, the kidneys release an enzyme called renin, which activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). This process helps to increase blood pressure, mainly by causing blood vessel constriction and increasing the reabsorption of sodium and water in the kidneys. 5. Stimulate production of red blood cells: Kidneys produce the hormone erythropoietin (EPO), which stimulates the bone marrow to produce more red blood cells. This helps to maintain the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. 6. Maintain calcium levels: The balance of calcium in the blood is maintained through the interaction of hormones like parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitriol (active form of vitamin D). PTH stimulates the release of calcium from bones, reabsorption of calcium in the kidneys, and the conversion of precursor vitamin D to calcitriol. Calcitriol works with PTH to increase calcium absorption in the intestines. By following these steps, the body can efficiently regulate blood composition and maintain optimal conditions for overall health."},{"instruction":"Student: Given the sentence \\"A child plays a red toy guitar and sings into multicolored plastic microphone.\\" can we conclude that \\"A young boy eats dinner.\\"?

Hypothesis: A boy was unaware that a picture was being taken of him. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"Based on the given premise, we cannot definitively conclude the hypothesis that the boy was unaware that a picture was being taken of him. The premise simply describes a scene in which a boy dressed in a red and black shirt and black sandals is kicking his foot back while looking at the camera. It does not provide information about the boy's awareness or intention regarding the picture being taken. To analyze this further, let us consider different aspects of the premise and the hypothesis. First, let us examine the boy's actions. He is kicking his foot back and looking at the camera. Kicking his foot back could be interpreted as an intentional pose or a candid, spontaneous movement. Since both possibilities are plausible, we cannot determine the boy's awareness of the picture. Next, let's look at the boy's gaze. He is looking at the camera, which could indicate that he is aware of the camera and potentially the photograph being taken. However, it's also possible that he is looking in the camera's direction simply by coincidence or for another reason that has nothing to do with the picture being taken. Lastly, it is important to consider any additional context that might be available alongside the premise. Is there information about the setting, the photographer, or the events leading up to the scene that might help to clarify the boy's awareness or intentions? Without any such context, we are left with an incomplete understanding of the situation, and we can't definitively conclude whether the boy was aware or unaware of the picture being taken. In conclusion, while the premise does offer some information about the boy's actions and appearance, it does not provide enough evidence to conclusively determine the hypothesis that the boy was unaware of the picture being taken. Additional context or a clearer description of his actions and expressions could help to confirm or refute the hypothesis, but based on the provided premise alone, we must acknowledge that both possibilities remain plausible."},{"instruction":"How does the sentence end? (CNN) -- Indiana can't kick all registered sex offenders off instant messaging services, chat rooms or social networking sites like Facebook, a federal appeals court ruled Wednesday. The state passed a law in 2008 that was aimed at keeping predators from trolling the Internet for new victims. But that law \\"broadly prohibits substantial protected speech rather than specifically targeting the evil of improper communications to minors,\\" a three-judge panel of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals concluded. State courts can impose limits on social media as a condition of a sex offender's probation or parole, but a \\"blanket ban\\" on Internet use violates the First Amendment's guarantee of free expression, the judges found. \\"We have worked with county sheriffs and prosecutors in our defense of the legal challenges to these protections of our children, and we will need to review this 7th","output":"Circuit opinion and consider our options for an appeal with their input,\\" said Indiana Attorney General Curtis Hill in a statement. \\"The internet can be a dangerous place for children, providing those who wish to do them harm with access to potential victims. Our goal has always been to prevent such harm from occurring and to ensure that registered sex offenders do not exploit online platforms to prey on our most vulnerable citizens.\\" Since the passage of the law in 2008, several individuals have challenged its constitutionality. Critics argue that the ban goes too far and infringes on the essential rights of registered sex offenders to participate in contemporary society. They point out that social media and instant messaging platforms have become indispensable tools for communication, staying informed and accessing various services. Supporters of the law, however, argue that the restrictions are necessary to ensure the safety of children and that they would prevent predators from using these platforms to contact and victimize minors. They also contend that the law gives law enforcement authorities the ability to monitor the activities of registered sex offenders more effectively and intervene when necessary. The 7th Circuit's ruling echoes decisions in other circuits, including the 4th Circuit, which struck down a similar North Carolina law in 2016, stating that \\"even convicted criminals - and, in particular, convicted sex offenders - are entitled to enjoy the First Amendment's protections.\\" The U.S. Supreme Court echoed this sentiment when it refused to hear an appeal of the North Carolina case in 2017, effectively upholding the lower court's ruling. While the courts have made it clear that blanket bans on internet and social media use for registered sex offenders are unconstitutional, there is still debate about what restrictions can be deemed appropriate. For instance, some states have enacted laws targeting a narrower set of online activities, such as prohibiting registered sex offenders from accessing or engaging in communication with minors on specific websites and platforms. Such laws may stand a better chance of surviving legal scrutiny, as they more narrowly focus on the core issue. In conclusion, the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision reaffirms the position that blanket bans on internet use for registered sex offenders violate their First Amendment rights to free expression. While the ruling does not preclude the possibility of enacting targeted restrictions to protect children, it underscores the delicate balance between preserving public safety and upholding constitutional rights. As states and the federal government continue to grapple with this issue, it is likely that further legal challenges and refinements of these laws will be essential in shaping the policies for the digital age."},{"instruction":"UCAS announced earlier this year that there had been a notable decrease in students from England applying to do at least one nursing course, saying it had fallen 23% to 33,810 in 2017. Chancellor Philip Hammond spoke last week about the \\"very high numbers of foreign workers keeping our NHS going\\". Looking at the figures from NHS Digital, overall, 82% of NHS staff are UK nationals, with 5% from the European Economic Area (EEA, that's the EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) and 6% from the rest of the world. The remaining 7% are of unknown nationalities. The unknowns are relatively high because they come from electronic staff records, not HR information, and it is not compulsory for staff to declare their nationalities for those records. For doctors, it's 70% UK, 9% EEA, 16% from the rest of the world and 5% unknown. And for nurses and health visitors it is 78% UK, 7% EEA, 8% from the rest of the world and 6% unknown. To put that into context, according to the latest labour market figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), 7.3% of workers in the UK are EU nationals while 3.9% are from the rest of the world. Clearly, the unknowns throw comparisons out a bit, but the proportion of NHS staff from the EEA appears to be a bit below the workforce as a whole while there are considerably more from the rest of the world than the workforce average. For doctors, there are proportionally more foreign nationals than in the workforce as a whole, especially for those from the rest of the world. If you look at the figures for where doctors earned their qualifications, the rest of the world comes even higher with 27%, compared with 64% from the UK and 9% from the EEA.

The band released three albums and several singles, including \\"For What It's Worth\\". The band combined elements of folk and country music with British invasion and psychedelic-rock influences, and, along with the Byrds, were part of the early development of folk-rock. With a name taken from a brand of steamroller, Buffalo Springfield formed in Los Angeles in 1966 with Stills (guitar, keyboards, vocals), Dewey Martin (drums, vocals), Bruce Palmer (electric bass), Furay (guitar, vocals), and Young (guitar, harmonica, piano, vocals). Chris Hillman of the Byrds persuaded the owners of the Whisky a Go Go to give Buffalo Springfield an audition, and they essentially became the house band at the Whisky for seven weeks, from May 2 to June 18, 1966. This series of concerts solidified the band's reputation for live performances and attracted interest from a number of record labels. It also brought an invitation from Friedman to Dickie Davis (who had been the Byrds' lighting manager) to become involved in the group's management. In turn, Davis sought advice from Sonny & Cher's management team, Charlie Greene and Brian Stone; unbeknownst to Davis and Friedman, Greene and Stone then aggressively pitched themselves to the band to be their new managers. Friedman was fired, and Davis was made the group's tour manager. Greene and Stone made a deal with Ahmet Ertegun of Atlantic Records for a four-album contract with a 12,000 advance, following a brief bidding war with Elektra Records and Warner Bros. Records, and arranged for the band to start recording at Gold Star Studios in Hollywood. The first Buffalo Springfield single, \\"Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing\\", was released in August, but made little impact outside Los Angeles, where it reached the Top 25. Young and Stills have long maintained that their own mono mix was superior to the stereo mix engineered by Greene and Stone. The band's eponymous album was released by the Atlantic subsidiary Atco in mono and in stereo in December 1966. A revamped version issued both in mono and stereo with a different track order was issued in March of the following year. In November 1966, Stills composed \\"For What It's Worth\\" in response to a protest that had turned into a riot following the closing of a nightclub called Pandora's Box on Sunset Strip. The song was performed on Thanksgiving night at the Whisky a Go Go, recorded within the next few days, and on the air in Los Angeles on radio station KHJ soon afterwards. By March 1967, it was a Top Ten hit. Atco took advantage of this momentum by replacing the song \\"Baby Don't Scold Me\\" with \\"For What It's Worth\\" and re-releasing the album. \\"For What It's Worth\\" sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc., Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Was the album a success?","output":"Yes, the album was a success.

This is because starfish, along with sea urchins, are echinoderms, and echinoderms are known for their lack of respiratory and excretory systems. Echinoderms are marine invertebrates belonging to the phylum Echinodermata. This diverse group of organisms includes starfish (also known as sea stars or asteroids), sea urchins, and other related species. Echinoderms are characterized by their radial symmetry, which means their body has five or more similar parts arranged symmetrically around a central axis. One interesting feature of echinoderms is that they lack specialized respiratory and excretory systems typically found in other animals. In many echinoderms, these functions are performed by their water vascular system, which is a network of fluid-filled canals and tube feet that help in gas exchange and waste elimination. Oxygen and carbon dioxide diffuse directly across the thin walls of the tube feet and canals, providing the necessary gas exchange for respiration, while waste products are also removed through this system. While other creatures in the provided list, such as insects, humans, fish, and barnacles, do have respiratory and excretory systems, each of these systems function differently depending on the specific organism. For example, humans use lungs for respiration and kidneys for excretion, while fish use gills for respiration and a combination of gills and kidneys for excretion. Ferns, being plants, have a completely different way of handling gas exchange and excretion. They possess specialized microscopic openings called stomata on their leaves and stems, which facilitate the exchange of gases like carbon dioxide and oxygen with the atmosphere. Waste products in plants are often stored in specialized cells or compartments within the organism or eliminated through the process of senescence, where older leaves or parts of the plant die off and are shed. Lastly, graptolites are an extinct group of colonial animals that were primarily marine and lived during the Paleozoic era. Although their exact physiology is not fully understood, they were likely more similar to modern-day hydrozoans and would have possessed some form of excretory systems suited for their needs. In conclusion, given the information provided, starfish are the best answer choice for organisms that lack respiratory and excretory systems among the options given. Their unique water vascular system serves the dual purpose of facilitating gas exchange, waste removal, and locomotion in lieu of specialized respiratory and excretory organs."},{"instruction":"Q:Context: Carson tossed it back in the trash after realizing it was ruined.

Own house: Not all gardeners necessarily own a house. They might work in public parks, botanical gardens, or even at other people's houses. Owning a house is not a requirement for being a gardener. So, this option is not an accurate answer. 2. Contribution to society: Gardeners do provide a contribution to society in the form of maintaining and beautifying public and private green spaces, promoting biodiversity, and providing a relaxing environment, improving mental health. Therefore, this option could be considered relevant. 3. Food: Gardeners may grow food themselves, but not all gardeners specialize in growing fruits and vegetables. Some might focus on ornamental plants, flower gardens, or landscaping. While food production could be a part of the profession for some gardeners, it is not definitive of the profession as a whole. So, this option may not be entirely accurate. 4. Ride horses: Riding horses is unrelated to gardening. This option is not applicable to the profession of a gardener, so it's not a valid answer. 5. Green thumb: A green thumb refers to having a natural talent or skill for gardening and plant care. Being a gardener would generally imply that the person has a green thumb, as they have chosen to pursue this profession. Thus, this option is highly relevant to a person who is a gardener. Based on the step-by-step evaluation, the best answer is option 5, a green thumb. The person who is a gardener has a green thumb, reflecting their expertise in plant care and gardening."},{"instruction":"Reconstruct a question, answer pair from this explanation: Pail is a utility item and is kept in utility room.

Scanlon told the new citizens from 55 countries immediately after they recited the Naturalization Oath of Allegiance to the United States. “That is one of the special privileges you have that you didn’t have three minutes ago.” Voter registration forms were distributed inside the courtroom, and Judge Scanlon promptly directed the people to mail them at the post office next door. But Fryda Guedes, a staff member from the advocacy group Hispanic Federation, made it even easier. Ms. Guedes went through the aisles and collected the forms, saying she would hand-deliver them to the Board of Elections. That made Beverly Greig’s day. A native of Guyana and a 30-year Queens resident, Ms. Greig, 67, wondered for weeks whether she would have enough time to register. “I was asking everybody: ‘Can I vote, can I vote? I have to vote,’ Ms. Greig said. Thrilled, she handed her form to Ms. Guedes. In three ceremonies in New York City on Friday, 685 people became American citizens, the latest in a national wave preceding the presidential election. For many, the campaign of Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, was motivation. Humera Qayyum, 25, a medical assistant from Coney Island by way of Pakistan, said she had experienced discrimination as a Muslim wearing a hijab, and was displeased with Mr. Trump’s call to bar Muslims from the United States. “I want to vote Democratic because they have respect for all religions, respect for everything,” Ms. Qayyum said. She added: “I have been here for five years. I worked really hard to be in this country and I don’t want to get kicked out.” A Muslim student from Bangladesh, Nazmus Sakib Choudhury, 25, said he was afraid of a Trump presidency and intended to vote Democratic. “We don’t have an option,” he said. Not everybody agreed. An older man from Canada, who did not want to give his name, said he wanted to use his citizenship to vote for Mr. Trump. Maria Ester Lopez, 34, a Bronx resident from Mexico, said she felt both lucky and blessed to get her citizenship on the last day to register to vote by mail. “It’s kind of a miracle,” she said. “Just in time.” But not everybody made it. In line with a national trend, applications for citizenship rose over the last 12 months in the area that includes New York City and Long Island, with 110,895 people trying to become citizens, compared with 88,627 over the previous 12-month period, according to the federal Citizenship and Immigration Services. And applicants faced significant waits. As of June 30, 72,595 applications were pending. (By comparison, 52,953 applications were pending at the same point the previous year.) The federal Citizenship and Immigration Services, which processes the applications, denied that those numbers represented delays. “We are monitoring the situation and managing resources to address disparities in processing times,” Katie Tichacek, a spokeswoman for the agency, said. But the Northern Manhattan Coalition for Immigrant Rights, which helped prepare 600 applications for citizenship over the last year, has noticed a substantial lag time in processing in 2016, which has resulted in some people not being naturalized in time to vote, Angela Fernandez, the group’s executive director, said. It took only three months to process applications in New York at this time last year, but now took longer than five months, she said. “My understanding was that because of the election, things would be moving more quickly,” said Sergia Ramos, 68, a client of the coalition who came to the office on Thursday to plead for intervention. She had been waiting five months just to get an interview, she said. Ms. Fernandez said it was too late for this election, and referred Ms. Ramos to her local elected officials. For applicants who have naturalization ceremonies in New York scheduled up until Oct. 28, there is one last, little known resort: New York State allows them to bring their application in person to a Board of Elections office. Raymundo Nelio Read Pinedo, a boiler mechanic who lives in the Bronx, was among those who became a citizen with the Northern Manhattan Coalition’s help. At the federal court in Manhattan on Friday, he was dressed for the occasion, wearing a red velvet blazer and bright red loafers. On his briefcase he displayed a small American flag, a gift from his 12-year-old daughter. Mr. Read, 55, moved to the United States from the Dominican Republic in 1988, he said, but had always been so busy with work that he had not made time to apply for citizenship until this year. He said he planned to celebrate on Friday night by having dinner with his 82-year-old mother, who has been a United States citizen for 15 years. “It means a lot to her,” Mr. Read said. “For the first time, a woman has the opportunity to govern this country.” In Manhattan, workers for Dominicanos USA and the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund were handing out registration forms in the federal courthouse hallways and outside the building on Friday. Inside the courtroom, District Judge Richard J. Sullivan encouraged the 167 new citizens to vote, but spent more time talking to them on a personal level about his children, his Irish ancestry and the significance of the moment. “I know I’m going to celebrate today,” he said. “I’m going to have an ice cream cone on your behalf. I’ll raise it up like the Statue of Liberty and I’ll think of you.” A version of this article appears in print on October 15, 2016, on page A17 of the New York edition with the headline: Becoming U.S. Citizens, and Just in Time to Vote.

They did this by attending a special event at a courthouse, where they officially became citizens and then registered to vote. For many of these new citizens, voting is very important because they care about issues like how different religions are treated and they want to have a say in choosing the country's leader. Sometimes, becoming a citizen can take a long time, so these people were very happy to be able to do it just before the deadline to register to vote."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"A girl in a lavender shirt looks puzzled.\\" Hypothesis: \\"A girl is wearing a lavender shirt.\\" Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise?

Depending on market conditions, the cow may be bred with a \`\`dairy bull'' or a \`\`beef bull.'' Female calves (heifers) with dairy breeding may be kept as replacement cows for the dairy herd. If a replacement cow turns out to be a substandard producer of milk, she then goes to market and can be slaughtered for beef. Male calves can either be used later as a breeding bull or sold and used for veal or beef. Dairy farmers usually begin breeding or artificially inseminating heifers around 13 months of age.

Like all marriages, we have had our share of happy and sad, growing together as the years passed us by. My husband is my best friend, a wonderful father, a hard worker, a great provider, treats me like a queen, and loves me unconditionally. He is my soul mate in many ways. My husband is also gay. I had no idea when I married him. I was a virgin on our wedding night and had never had any type of physical relationship prior to my husband. Having nothing to compare it to, I thought our sexual intimacy was normal. It was fun, sexy, enjoyable. My husband was a giving partner, and I almost always experienced orgasm. But as the years went by, the frequency of our sexual activity became less. It was not unusual to go months without sex — not for lack of trying on my part. We rarely fought, but we would fight about the growing lack of intimacy. I often wondered what it was about me that made my husband not want to have sex with me. And then one day, shortly after our 25th anniversary, I found gay porn on his computer. At first he denied everything, but finally, through tears, he confessed that he’d had these same-sex attractions as long as he could remember. In his teens, a church counsellor had told him marriage would “cure” him. Feeling as though I had just been punched in the gut, I was heartbroken. I felt betrayed, confused, angry, sad, and yet, miraculously relieved. There was nothing wrong with me — I was just not his type. The emotions flew through me leaving my head and heart confused. What now? I loved this man with every fibre of my being. We had a good life together, sex aside, and had built a family. We were happy. I did not want a divorce and neither did he.

Sir Robert Owen’s inquiry looked at the former FSB agent’s “highly personal attacks” on the Russian President, which culminated with an article on the Chechenpress website in July 2006, four months before he was poisoned. Mr Litvinenko’s article, which was published as evidence in the report, started by recounting a meeting between Mr Putin and a boy “aged four or five” in a square near the Kremlin. Litvinenko widow's statement “Putin kneeled, lifted the boy’s T-shirt and kissed his stomach,” Mr Litvinenko wrote. “Nobody can understand why the Russian president did such a strange thing as kissing the stomach of an unfamiliar small boy.” The former FSB agent claimed there were “blank spots” in Mr Putin’s career that could be explained by his superiors’ alleged knowledge “that he was a paedophile”. Mr Litvinenko claimed the Russian President had himself found “videotapes in the FSB Internal Security directorate, which showed him making sex with some underage boys” that he then hid. Alexander Litvinenko pictured at the Intensive Care Unit of University College Hospital on November 20, 2006 in London Commenting on the extraordinary and unfounded allegations, Sir Robert wrote: “It hardly needs saying that the allegations made by Mr Litvinenko against President Putin in this article were of the most serious nature. Could they have had any connection with his death?” The judge’s 300-page report concludes that Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitri Kovtun poisoned the 43-year-old with radioactive polonium 210 at a Mayfair hotel in 2006. It found that there is a “strong probability” that the Russian secret service directed the killing, and that operation was “probably approved” by Mr Putin. Sir Robert said there were “several reasons” why the Russian state may have wanted to kill Mr Litvinenko by late 2006.

The Russian Foreign Ministry dismissed Sir Robert’s report as “politically motivated” today and warned that it would overshadow relations with the UK. “We need time to study in detail the contents of this document, and then give a detailed assessment,” a spokesperson said. “We would like to note that Russia's position on this issue remains unchanged and is well known…there was no reason to expect the final report of a politically engaged and highly opaque process to be objective and impartial.” ||||| LONDON (AP) — President Vladimir Putin probably approved a plan by Russia's FSB security service to kill former agent Alexander Litvinenko, who died three weeks after drinking tea laced with poison at a London hotel, a British judge said Thursday.

(Associated Press) In a lengthy report, Judge Robert Owen said that he is certain Litvinenko was given tea with a fatal dose of polonium-210, a radioactive isotope that is deadly if ingested even in tiny quantities, in November 2006. He said there is a \\"strong probability\\" that the FSB, successor to the Soviet spy agency the KGB, directed the killing, and the operation was \\"probably approved\\" by Putin. Before he died, Litvinenko accused Putin of ordering his killing, but this appears to be the first time anyone has officially linked Putin to it. Moscow has always strongly denied involvement in Litvinenko's death, and Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zhakarova said Thursday that the government does not consider Owen's conclusions to be objective or impartial. \\"We regret that a purely criminal case has been politicized and has darkened the general atmosphere of bilateral relations,\\" Zhakarova said in a statement. She said Britain's decision to hold a public inquiry on the case was politically motivated and that the process was not transparent for the Russian side or the public. Russia has refused to extradite the two main suspects, Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun. Lugovoi is a member of the Russian parliament, which means he is immune from prosecution. In an interview with the Interfax news agency, he called the charges against him \\"absurd.\\" \\"As we expected, there was no sensation,\\" he said. \\"The results of the investigation that were announced today once again confirm London's anti-Russian position and the blinkered view and unwillingness of the British to establish the true cause of Litvinenko's death.\\" Litvinenko, a former FSB agent, fled to Britain in 2000 and became a vocal critic of Russia's security service and of Putin, whom he accused of links to organized crime. Owen said Litvinenko \\"was regarded as having betrayed the FSB\\" with his actions, and that \\"there were powerful motives for organizations and individuals within the Russian state to take action against Mr. Litvinenko, including killing him.\\" Litvinenko's widow, Marina, said outside the High Court on Thursday that she was \\"very pleased that the words my husband spoke on his deathbed when he accused Mr. Putin have been proved by an English court.\\" She called for British Prime Minister David Cameron to take urgent steps against Russian agents operating inside Britain in light of the report. \\"I'm calling immediately for expulsion from the UK of all Russian intelligence operatives ... based at the London embassy,\\" she said. \\"I'm also calling for the imposition of targeted economic sanctions and travel bans against named individuals including Mr (former FSB chief Nikolai) Patrushev and Mr Putin.\\" She said Britain's Home Office had written to her Wednesday night promising action. Home Secretary Theresa May is scheduled to discuss the report in Parliament later Thursday. In his 326-page report, Owen said that based on the evidence he had seen, the operation to kill Litvinenko was \\"probably\\" approved by then-FSB head Nikolai Patrushev, now head of Putin's security council, and by Putin. Owen said Litvinenko \\"had repeatedly targeted President Putin\\" with \\"highly personal\\" public criticism. The British government appointed Owen to head a public inquiry into the slaying, which soured relations between London and Moscow. He heard from dozens of witnesses during months of public hearings last year, and also saw secret British intelligence evidence. Announcing his findings at London's Royal Courts of Justice, Owen said that \\"there can be no doubt that Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned by Mr. Lugovoi and Mr. Kovtun\\" in the Pine Bar of London's luxury Millennium Hotel on Nov. 1, 2006. He died three weeks later of acute radiation syndrome. \\"I have concluded that there is a strong probability that when Mr. Lugovoi poisoned Mr. Litvinenko, he did so under the direction of the FSB ... I have further concluded that the FSB operation to kill Mr. Litvinenko was probably approved by My. Patrushev, then head of the FSB, and also by President Putin.\\" ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why would Vladimir Putin want Alexander Litvinenko dead? The murder of ex-Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 in the UK was \\"probably\\" approved by President Vladimir Putin, an inquiry has found. Mr Putin is likely to have signed off the poisoning of Mr Litvinenko with polonium-210 in part due to personal \\"antagonism\\" between the pair, it said. Home Secretary Theresa May said the murder was a \\"blatant and unacceptable\\" breach of international law. But the Russian Foreign Ministry said the public inquiry was \\"politicised\\". It said: \\"We regret that the purely criminal case was politicised and overshadowed the general atmosphere of bilateral relations.\\" What Litvinenko report means for UK Key findings of the public inquiry Who was Alexander Litvinenko? Who are the Litvinenko murder suspects? Story of a perplexing murder Dmitry Peskov, Mr Putin's spokesman, said Moscow's official response to the report will happen through \\"diplomatic channels\\", the Russian news agency Interfax was quoted as saying. Prime Minister David Cameron said the UK would have to go on having \\"some sort of relationship with them [Russia]\\" because of the Syria crisis, but it would be done with \\"clear eyes and a very cold heart\\". Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption David Cameron said the murder of Alexander Litvinenko had been shown to be \\"state-sponsored\\" The long-awaited report into Mr Litvinenko's death found that two Russian men - Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun - deliberately poisoned the 43-year-old in London in 2006 by putting the radioactive substance polonium-210 into his drink at a hotel. Sir Robert Owen, the public inquiry chairman, said he was \\"sure\\" Mr Litvinenko's murder had been carried out by the two men and that they were probably acting under the direction of Moscow's FSB intelligence service, and approved by the organisation's chief, Nikolai Patrushev, as well as the Russian president. He said Mr Litvinenko's work for British intelligence agencies, his criticism of the FSB and Mr Putin, and his association with other Russian dissidents were possible motives for his killing. 'Send a message' There was also \\"undoubtedly a personal dimension to the antagonism\\" between Mr Putin and Mr Litvinenko, he said. The use of polonium-210 was \\"at the very least a strong indicator of state involvement\\" as it had to be made in a nuclear reactor, the report said. The inquiry heard evidence that Mr Litvinenko may have been consigned to a slow death from radiation to \\"send a message\\". What is polonium-210? Image caption The teapot where traces of polonium-210 were discovered Giving a statement to the House of Commons, Mrs May said Mr Cameron would raise the findings with President Putin at \\"the next available opportunity\\".

She urged the UK government to expel all Russian intelligence operatives, impose economic sanctions on Moscow and impose a travel ban on Mr Putin. The view from Moscow Image copyright AP Image caption Andrei Lugovoi, left, and Dmitry Kovtun pictured in Moscow, in 2007 By the BBC's Oleg Boldyrev For years Moscow rejected allegations of high-level involvement in the murder of Alexander Litvinenko. The fact President Putin himself is now associated with this assassination has not changed anything. Taking their lead from Robert Owen's use of the words \\"high probability\\", the second tier of the Russian establishment, mainly Kremlin-loyalist MPs, are dismissing the entire report as a politically-based fabrication. Russians on social media are making fun of its conclusions by using the hashtag \\"PutinPossiblyApproved\\" in Russian - that is #ПутинВозможноОдобрил - to include all manner of crimes. One Russian MP, Nikolai Kovalev, himself an ex-FSB boss, pointed out relations between Moscow and London would not be harmed by the report as there was no room for making them any worse. How Russian media reported the Litvinenko inquiry Responding to the report, Mr Lugovoi, who is now a politician in Russia, said the accusations against him were \\"absurd\\", the Russian news agency Interfax was quoted as saying. \\"As we expected, there were no surprises,\\" he said. \\"The results of the investigation made public today yet again confirm London's anti-Russian position, its blinkeredness and the unwillingness of the English to establish the true reason of Litvinenko's death.\\" Mr Kovtun, now a businessman in Russia, said he would not comment on the report until he got more information about its contents, Interfax reported. 'Harm relations' London's Metropolitan Police said the investigation into the \\"cold and calculated murder\\" remained ongoing. Alexander Yakovenko, the Russian ambassador in the UK, said Russia would not accept any decisions reached in secret and based on evidence not tested in open court. The length of time taken to come to these conclusions led them to believe it was \\"a whitewash of British security services' incompetence\\", he said. Mr Yakovenko said these events \\"can't help but harm our bilateral relations\\". White House spokesman Josh Earnest said he did not have \\"any actions\\" to announce following the inquiry's findings. \\"But I certainly wouldn't rule out future steps,\\" he said. Analysis Image copyright Reuters Image caption Alexander Litvinenko at a news conference in Moscow in 1998, when he was an officer of Russia's state security service FSB By BBC security correspondent, Gordon Corera The conclusions of this inquiry are stronger than many expected in pointing the finger at Vladimir Putin personally. The evidence behind that seems to have come from secret intelligence heard in closed session. Saying that Alexander Litvinenko was killed because he was an enemy of the Russian state will raise pressure on the British government to take real action - the steps taken nearly a decade ago were only limited in scope. That may pose difficulties given the importance of Russia's role in the Middle East, but without tough action people may ask if the Russian government has been allowed to get away with what has been described as an act of nuclear terrorism on the streets of London. Mr Litvinenko fled to the UK in 2000, claiming persecution. He was granted asylum and gained British citizenship several years later. In the years before his death, he worked as a writer and journalist, becoming a strong critic of the Kremlin. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Russian President Vladimir Putin \\"probably\\" approved the killing, the report says It is believed he also worked as a consultant for MI6, specialising in Russian organised crime.

Article: \\"Slow City\\" -- a recently launched project focused on preserving the traditional quality of life enjoyed in some of Italy's smaller cities and towns. The project was born from the idea of the \\"Slow Food\\" movement -- started in Italy in the 1980s -- which promotes leisurely eating and the growing of local, healthy products to fight against the American fast-food style. \\"The American urban model has invaded our cities, making Italian towns look the same. We want to stop this kind of globalization,\\" says Paolo Saturnini, an Italian mayor. The \\"Slow City\\" project plans to emphasize the rich, cultural, culinary and artistic local traditions of each community. Walking areas will be enlarged and squares and parks will be made greener with more plants. Car alarms and other noise that disturbs the peace will be banned, and ugly TV aerials , advertising posters, and signs will be taken down. City councils will also insist on the use of recycling and renewable energy sources, and will also introduce ecological transport systems. Parking will be made stress-free by creating more public parking areas, and easily accessible walkways and bike lanes will cross the city. But in the \\"Slow City\\" way, all improvements will probably come about slowly. Thirty-two Italian city councils, which joined the \\"Slow City\\" program, have decided to take further steps in this direction by increasing the numbers of traditional family-style eating establishments, reducing noise pollution, and concentrating on making their towns friendlier for people to live in. Organic local produce will be promoted in all restaurants and genetically modified foods will be banned. \\"We can't stop large, fast-food chains from coming here, but we hope that people who come to our towns will not want to eat exactly the same hamburger they can eat in Melbourne, London or Paris, but want something genuine and different,\\" said Saturnini. Question: According to the passage, the \\"Slow City\\" project aims at _ .

However, some discrepancy exists regarding the year mentioned (1988) and the actual years he competed. The birthdate and birthplace (Orange, California) align perfectly with Danny Ongais' information, and he is a retired American racing driver. Ongais' achievements notably include six Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) wins and participation in the Indianapolis 500.

However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22] Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23] Now, I have a new situation: Two brothers had bike repair shops in neighboring towns. Bob's was located in a hilly area, with more precipitation and full of bike trails, while Rob's was in the valley, near the parks.

Article: You might think that Olympic athletes are the healthiest people in the world. It's true that many are. However, it's also true that many Olympic athletes had to overcome illnesses early in their lives. One excellent example is Wilma Rudolph. She competed in track-and-field events in the 1960 Olympics. She didn't win just one gold. She won three. At the time, people called her \\"the fastest woman in the world.\\" As a young child, Wilma could not take part in sports. She had a series of serious illnesses, and then, at the age of 4, she got _ . She lost the use of her left leg, and the doctor said she would never walk again. The people in Wilma's family did everything they could to help her walk again. Wilma and her mother often traveled 100 miles to get treatments for her leg. Her brothers and sisters took turns giving her leg a daily massage. Four times a day, they helped her do special exercises for her leg. Amazingly, by the time Wilma was 9 years old, she was able to walk again. Before long, she started playing basketball and running. In high school, she was a track star and then she went to the Olympics. Wilma stopped being a runner when she was 22 years old. She then became a teacher and track coach. Her story encouraged many people to work hard and to overcome difficulties. Question: What's the main idea of the passage? Options: A: Wilma Rudolph's family helped her overcome polio.

In experiments, they found that extra rainfall drives up the amount of organic material flowing into the seas. This alters the food chain, adding another layer of complex organisms which boosts the concentrations of mercury up the line. The study has been published in the journal, Science Advances. Mercury is one of the world's most toxic metals, and according to the World Health Organization, is one of the top ten threats to public health. The substance at high levels has been linked to damage to the nervous system, paralysis and mental impairment in children. The most common form of exposure to mercury is by eating fish containing methylmercury, an organic form of the chemical which forms when bacteria react with mercury in water, soil or plants. Levels of mercury in the world's ecosystems have increased by between 200 and 500%, since the industrial revolution say experts, driven up by the use of fossil fuels such as coal. In recent years there are have been concentrated efforts to limit the amount of mercury entering the environment, with an international treaty, called the Minamata Convention, signed by 136 countries in place since 2013. But this new study suggests that climate change could be driving up levels of methylmercury in a manner not previously recognised. In a large laboratory, Swedish researchers recreated the conditions found in the Bothnian sea estuary. They discovered that as temperatures increase, there is an increased run-off of organic matter into the world's oceans and lakes. This encourages the growth of bacteria at the expense of phytoplankton. \\"When bacteria become abundant in the water there is also a growth of a new type of predators that feed on bacteria,\\" lead author Dr Erik Bjorn from Umea University in Sweden told BBC News. \\"You basically get one extra step in the food chain and methylmercury is enriched by about a factor of ten in each such step in the food web.\\" Under the warmest climate scenario suggested by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, there would be an increase in organic matter run-off of 15-20% by the end of this century. This in turn would see levels of methylmercury in zooplankton, the bottom link in the food chain, grow by between two and seven fold. Different parts of the world will suffer different impacts say the researchers, with lakes and coastal waters in the northern hemisphere being the most likely to have significant increases in methylmercury levels in fish, while the Mediterranean, the central US and Southern Africa will likely see reductions. Researchers hope that the Minamata treaty will be successful and countries reduce the amount of mercury that is being produced. Otherwise this discovery of a previously unknown source could have impacts for human health. \\"If we reduce mercury emissions, then we need to know how fast will ecosystems recover,\\" said Dr Bjorn. \\"If we don't do anything and mercury doesn't decrease, and we add this on top then the implications would be severe.\\" Other researchers in the field say that the new study highlights important issues that have previously been little known. \\"This work experimentally proves that climate change will have a significant effect of methylmercury budgets in coastal waters and its concentrations in fish,\\" said Milena Horvat from the Jozef Stefan Institute in Slovenia. \\"This work will also have an important impact on future scenario simulations on the presence of mercury in fish in response to global mercury reductions from emission sources (primarily industrial).\\" Follow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook","output":"A new study published in Science Advances has found that climate change may increase the levels of mercury in sea creatures.

Because the field is reset after each tackle in American football, it is much slower-paced than the more hectic rugby league, in which play stops for only as long as it takes the tackled player to get back to his feet and return the ball to play. Another major difference is that only the player with possession of the ball may be interfered with in rugby league; defending players interfering with any other attacking player (and vice versa) will incur a penalty. Passing in the two sports also differs: while backward passing is common to both sports, in American football players are allowed to throw the ball forward in certain situations whereas in rugby league forward passing is always illegal. Rugby league players have to kick the ball or run it forward to advance it downfield. To score a try or touchdown in rugby league, the player has to push the ball directly onto the ground once in the try zone, whereas in American football the player has to simply cross the line. American football also requires its players to use a large amount of protective equipment, including helmets, gloves and padding around the body, whereas protective clothing is much more minimal in rugby league, usually amounting to light padding (if any) and soft head gear (hard helmets being illegal). The rugby pitch and American football field are both similar in size with a pitch being 100 meters while a football field is 100 yards.

They may look similar because both games have players running with a ball, but there are some important differences between the two sports. Here are a few: 1. In American football, players can throw the ball forward to their teammates, but in rugby, players can only pass the ball backward or sideways. 2. American football has more protective gear like helmets and shoulder pads, while rugby players usually wear less padding and no hard helmets. 3. American football has many stops and starts, making it a slower-paced game. In rugby, the game flows more and doesn't stop as often, so it's faster and more hectic. 4. In rugby, all players can run with the ball, pass, and tackle.

Amid soaring tensions over the Ukraine crisis, Russians have grown increasingly leery of the intentions and capabilities of the United States, according to the results of a survey released by independent pollster the Levada Center on Tuesday. According to the poll, which was conducted in April among 1,600 adults across the country, 59 percent of Russians believe that America poses a threat to their country. This figure represents a 12 percent increase since the same question was presented to respondents in 2007. Asked about the nature of the threat posed by the United States to Russia, 48 percent of respondents voiced concern that the United States could hinder Russia's efforts on the path toward further development, 40 percent feared the United States taking control of the Russian economy and 36 percent were wary of the unnecessary imposition of U.S. values and ideals. Nearly one-third of Russians — 31 percent — fear U.S. military intervention and occupation, a 10 percent increase since 2007, while 24 percent feared the United States would assert control over Russia's political course. \\"Lately we can see that all the measures are directed at the consolidation of [Russians'] national identity. And depicting the United States as the enemy has become one of the structural elements for social consolidation,\\" Karina Pipiya, sociologist at the Levada Center, was quoted by Izvestia newspaper as saying. When asked about a hypothetical military conflict between the United States and Russia, 52 percent of the population said that no one would end up being a winner in that scenario. Still, 33 percent of respondents expressed certainty that Russia would emerge the victor should such a conflict materialize. The number of respondents who opined that the United States does not pose a threat to Russia plunged from 42 percent in 2007 to 32 percent now. The poll's margin of error was no greater than 3.4 percent, according to the Levada Center. ||||| Story Highlights Russia edges out North Korea as perceived top U.S. enemy Favorable ratings of Russia sink to 24% More Americans view Russian military power as critical threat PRINCETON, N.J. -- Russia now edges out North Korea as the country Americans consider the United States' greatest enemy. Two years ago, only 2% of Americans named Russia, but that increased to 9% in 2014 as tensions between Russia and the U.S. increased, and now sits at 18%. The results are based on a Feb. 8-11 Gallup poll, completed just before the international community brokered a cease-fire agreement between Ukraine and pro-Russian separatists in the country's east region. European leaders had hoped to reach an agreement to head off the possibility that the United States would send weapons and military equipment to Ukrainian military forces. As Russia has risen in the \\"enemy\\" rankings, the two countries that topped the list in the previous three updates -- China in 2014 and Iran in 2011 and 2012 -- have slipped. The percentage mentioning China has dropped eight points over the past year, to 12%, and the percentage mentioning Iran has fallen seven points to 9%. Nearly Half Now See Russian Military Power as Threat to U.S. Americans have also become significantly more likely to view Russia's military power as a critical threat to the U.S. -- 49% now hold this view, compared with 32% a year ago. Another 41% currently view Russia's military power as an important, but not critical, threat, down from 49% last year. Seven percent do not consider Russia a threat, down from 17% in 2014. Despite the increase in perceptions of Russia's military power as a critical threat, the issue still is rated well behind other international challenges such as terrorism generally, the ISIS group specifically, and Iran's development of nuclear weapons. Favorable Ratings of Russia Tumble Americans' basic views of Russia are the worst Gallup has measured in its 26-year trend, with 24% having favorable and 70% unfavorable views. Russia's favorable rating has declined 10 points in each of the last two years. Just three years ago, Americans' views of Russia were more positive than negative. Gallup's trend on ratings of Russia began as the Cold War was ending, and has fluctuated a great deal over its 26 years. For most of that time, Americans have been more positive than negative toward Russia. The major exceptions were during and shortly after the Kosovo situation in 1999, when the U.S. and Russia were at odds over the NATO-led bombing campaign against the Yugoslavians. That included the prior low point in Americans' views of Russia, a 33% favorable rating in April 1999. Americans' views of Russia also turned more negative just before the start of the 2003 Iraq war, given Russia's opposition to the United States' planned military action, and again after the Russia-Georgia war in 2008. Shortly after coming into office in early 2009, the Obama administration tried to repair relations, with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton famously giving her Russian counterpart the gift of a \\"reset button.\\" Americans' ratings of Russian President Vladimir Putin are even worse than their ratings of the country more generally, as 13% have a favorable and 72% an unfavorable view of Putin. Putin's favorable ratings are similar to what Gallup measured last March, but are down a bit from earlier readings in his second presidential administration, and well below what they were in his first administration from 2000-2008. Implications Recent U.S.-Russia foreign policy disagreements, including the situation in Ukraine, have taken a toll on U.S.-Russia relations as well as on Americans' opinions of Russia. Americans increasingly see Russia's military power as a threat to the United States, rate Russia the worst they have since the Cold War ended and are more likely to name Russia as the United States' greatest enemy over any other country, including long-standing U.S. foes such as North Korea and Iran. The feeling appears to be mutual, given that a Gallup World Poll survey of Russians conducted from April-June 2014 found 4% of Russians approving and 82% disapproving of U.S. leadership. However, because Americans' attitudes about Russia have changed substantially in the past and have been quite positive at times -- which has not been the case for countries such as Iran, Iraq and North Korea -- if Russian and American policy interests find more common ground, Americans' views of Russia could recover quickly. Survey Methods Results for this Gallup poll are based on telephone interviews conducted Feb. 8-11, 2015, with a random sample of 837 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia.

Relations between their governments are at their worst point in 25 years. Good thing there were gifts: tomatoes, potatoes and a “Victory” T-shirt for Kerry; a leather portfolio for Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. Even so, the friends-again act looks pretty hard to swallow for many residents in each country. According to a fresh survey by the respected Levada Center think tank, 59 percent of Russians now see the United States as a “threat.” That’s up from 47 percent in 2007. Of those who responded that there’s an American threat, 31 percent believed in the possibility of US military invasion and occupation of Russia. There’s plenty of aggressive media messaging from both sides to get the public worked up. But the Russians’ deepening concerns are largely thanks to Moscow’s powerful state media machine. It has exploited the ongoing Ukraine conflict, which Russia blames on the West, to shore up support for the Kremlin. For a growing number of Americans, the feeling is mutual. When a Gallup poll asked US residents to name one country anywhere in the world that’s America's greatest enemy, Russia got the highest vote, 18 percent.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Sherman McCoy is a Wall Street bond trader who makes millions while enjoying the good life and the sexual favors of Maria Ruskin, a Southern belle gold digger. Sherman and Maria are driving back to Maria's apartment from JFK Airport when they take a wrong turn on the expressway and find themselves in the \\"war-zone\\" of the South Bronx. They are approached by two black youths after Sherman gets out of the car to move a tire out of the road. Sherman jumps back into the car and Maria guns the engine in reverse, running over one of the teenagers. The two drive away. Sherman initially wants to report the incident to the police, but Maria immediately talks him out of it, fearing that their affair would be publicly exposed. Meanwhile, alcoholic journalist Peter Fallow, anxious for a story to make good with his editor, comes upon the hit-and-run case as a rallying point for the black community calling upon Jewish district attorney Abe Weiss, who is the Bronx District Attorney seeking re-election. According to Judge Leonard White, almost all of DA Weiss' prosecutions end up with black and Puerto Rican defendants going to prison and Weiss is seeking a white defendant for purposes of convincing the minority-majority community that he is worth re-electing. Weiss recognizes the press coverage inherent in prosecuting the callow Sherman, who has been discovered as the owner of the car, and therefore presumed to be the hit-and-run driver, in order to cultivate the image as an avenger for the minorities and be propelled to the mayorship of New York City.

It is sometimes difficult to locate a copy of this film but it's worth it. This film is creepy yet cheesy at the same time. It seems that 3 young newswomen (Karen, Vicky, and Jennifer) travel to the small city of Solvang, California to cover a festival when a mix-up occurs involving their hotel room and they seek refuge at the home of Earnest Keller (Lassick) and his strange wife Virginia. Vickie stays behind, feeling ill, as the other 2 are off to film their story. She is soon murdered at the house, in a VERY cheesy way by some unknown force hiding in the ventilation system (she is decapitated by the closing cover of the vent as it comes crashing down on her while she is being tugged through and into the basement). Soon Karen returns and she is murdered in an even more brutal fashion by having her face rammed through the vent cover. Jennifer is fighting with her (ex?)lover in a rather boring sub plot and when she returns home, her hosts (whom by now we have discovered are brother and sister and that whatever it is that is in the basement is their son) devise a plot to try to murder her as well. Virgina does not totally agree with Earnest's plan to murder Jennifer but she is tricked into going into the basement where she meets Junior. Here the film turns almost comic as Junior (portrayed hysterically by Stephen Furst) is a deformed, mentally deficient, manchild whose actions and motions will cause a few chuckles even though it's supposed to be scary. This is where the pace of the film picks up and the ending is well done. The actors/actresses do a terrific job with the material especially Lassick, Furst, and Bach and although it's not the most horrifying film ever made it is highly entertaining!

In this task, you're given passages that contain mentions of names of people, places, or things. Some of these mentions refer to the same person, place, or thing. Your job is to write questions that evaluate one's understanding of such references. Good questions are expected to link pronouns (she, her, him, his, their, etc.) or other mentions to people, places, or things to which they may refer. Do not ask questions that can be answered correctly without understanding the paragraph or having multiple answers. Avoid questions that do not link phrases referring to the same entity. For each of your questions, the answer should be one or more phrases in the paragraph, and it should be unambiguous. Passage: Charles spoofed this double standard on the television comedy show Saturday Night Live in 1977. He hosted an episode and had the original band he toured with in the 1950s to join him. In one skit, he tells a producer that he wants to record the song, but the producer tells him that a white band named the \\"Young Caucasians\\", composed of beaming white teenagers, are to record it first, which they do on the show, in a chaste, sanitized, and unexciting performance. When Charles and his band counter with their original version, Garrett Morris tells them, \\"Sorry. That'll never make it.\\"Charles closed every show he played for the rest of his career with the song, later stating, \\"'What'd I Say' is my last song onstage. When I do 'What'd I Say', you don't have to worry about it—that's the end of me; there ain't no encore, no nothin'. I'm finished!\\"It was ranked tenth on Rolling Stone's list of \\"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\\", with the summary, \\"Charles' grunt-'n'-groan exchanges with the Raeletts were the closest you could get to the sound of orgasm on Top Forty radio during the Eisenhower era\\". In 2000, it ranked number 43 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs in Rock and Roll and number 96 on VH1's 100 Greatest Dance Songs, being the oldest song in the latter ranking. The same year it was chosen by National Public Radio as one of the 100 most influential songs of the 20th century. A central scene in the 2004 biopic Ray features the improvisation of the song performed by Jamie Foxx, who won an Academy Award for his portrayal of Charles. For its historical, artistic, and cultural significance, the Library of Congress added it to the U.S. National Recording Registry in 2002. The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame featured it as one of 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll in 2007.","output":"Part #1: Mentioning different names of people, places, or things. Usage: In the passage provided, the different names mentioned include Charles, Saturday Night Live, the 1950s, the \\"Young Caucasians,\\" Garrett Morris, \\"What'd I Say,\\" Rolling Stone, the Raeletts, the Eisenhower era, VH1, National Public Radio, Jamie Foxx, the Oscars, the Library of Congress, U.S. National Recording Registry, and the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. This meets the criteria as it identifies various mentioned entities in the passage. Part #2: Linking pronouns or other mentions to people, places, or things to which they may refer. Usage: For example, the passage states, \\"He hosted an episode and had the original band he toured with in the 1950s to join him.\\" Here, \\"he\\" refers to Charles, and \\"the original band\\" refers to the band Charles toured with in the 1950s. This meets the criteria by showing the linking of pronouns to people or things. Part #3: Writing questions that evaluate understanding of the references. Usage: A sample question for this passage could be: \\"What song did Charles perform at the end of every show for the rest of his career?\\" The answer, \\"'What'd I Say',\\" is found in the paragraph and requires an understanding of the passage to correctly answer. This meets the criteria by evaluating the reader's comprehension of the passage. Part #4: Ensuring questions have only one unambiguous answer. Usage: Using the previously mentioned sample question, \\"What song did Charles perform at the end of every show for the rest of his career?\\" The answer is unambiguous because only one song title, \\"'What'd I Say',\\" is identified as the song Charles performs last in his shows. This meets the criteria by providing an unquestionable answer based on the passage. Part #5: Avoiding questions that can be answered correctly without understanding the paragraph or having multiple answers. Usage: The sample question, \\"What song did Charles perform at the end of every show for the rest of his career?\\", avoids having multiple answers and cannot be answered without comprehending the paragraph. This is because knowledge of the song's title, \\"'What'd I Say',\\" depends on understanding its significance within the passage. This meets the criteria by avoiding multiple answers and necessitating comprehension of the paragraph."},{"instruction":"Data: name = Alimentum, food = Italian, area = city centre.

Wilton Sinclair flew last month from Guyana to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. He was traveling with two pieces of luggage and a pair of duty-free bags, each of which contained two large bottles of El Dorado rum (the “liquid gold of Guyana,” according to its manufacturer). When Sinclair, 35, was screened at a U.S. Customs and Border Protection checkpoint, agents noticed that the four bottles (seen above) contained a “thick syrup-like substance inconsistent with rum,” according to a criminal complaint. Officers opened the 1.75-liter bottles and detected an unusual chemical odor. Subsequent tests showed that all four bottles field-tested positive for cocaine. Investigators estimated that the bottles held 8.2 kilos of cocaine. After waiving his Miranda rights, Sinclair, a Georgia resident who is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Guyana, told agents that he was to be paid 6000 to get the four bottles into the country. Charged with a felony smuggling count, Sinclair (pictured above) is free on an unsecured 75,000 bond. According to his Facebook page, Sinclair has served in the U.S. Army. ||||| QUEENS, N.Y. — Two rum bottles filled with 18 pounds of liquid cocaine were seized by inspectors at John F. Kennedy Airport from a passenger arriving from Guyana, federal authorities said. A passenger presented customs with a total of four bottles of rum in two duty-free bags after arriving at JFK, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection service said. When the liquid inside the bottles appeared thicker than normal, the passenger, Wilton Sinclair, 35, a U.S. citizen who lives in Georgia, was escorted to a private search room and the bottles were opened, the CBP said. After detecting a strong chemical odor, inspectors tested the liquid, which turned out to be a cocaine solution, with an estimated street value of 310,000, the CBP said. Sinclair was arrested on Nov. 17 on federal charges of importing a controlled substance, CBP said. He could not be reached for comment, and a CBP spokesman could not say whether he had a lawyer. Robert E.

It took an alligator named Paul 4 hours to walk from his home at the River Nile to the Nile Delta. On the return journey, Paul traveled with six other alligators, the journey taking 2 more hours than Paul took to walk to the Nile Delta, to reach their home at the River Nile. What's the combined time the alligators walked? If the answer is '46'; explain the reasoning:","output":"To determine the combined time that the alligators walked, first, we need to calculate the time Paul spent walking alone and then with his friends. Paul took 4 hours to walk from his home at the River Nile to the Nile Delta alone. On the return journey, he traveled with six other alligators, and the journey took 2 more hours than Paul took when he walked alone. Since Paul took 4 hours to walk alone, the return journey time with his friends would be 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours. Now, we need to calculate the combined walking time for Paul and other alligators. There are a total of 7 alligators (Paul and six other alligators) walking together on the return journey. They took 6 hours, so the combined walking time for the return journey would be 7 (alligators) × 6 (hours) = 42 hours. To find the total time walked, we need to add the time Paul spent walking alone to the combined time of the alligators on the return journey. The total time will be 4 hours + 42 hours = 46 hours. Therefore, the answer is '46', and the reasoning behind this is we found out the time Paul walked alone and the combined walking time of all the alligators during the return journey, and then added both times to get the total time."},{"instruction":"Фонд ведёт работу по созданию собственной коллекции и реставрации прялок различных типов, планируется их демонстрация на выставках декоративно-прикладного искусства, в перспективе возможно создание музея прялок и других предметов народного быта, представляющих художественную и историческую ценность.

The term is used to contrast with offices at state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government and also to supranational government which deals with governing institutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government. In federal states, local government generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions. - A metropolitan borough is a type of local government district in England, and is a subdivision of a metropolitan county. Created in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972, metropolitan boroughs are defined in English law as metropolitan districts. However, all of them have been granted or regranted royal charters to give them borough status (as well as, in some cases, city status). Metropolitan boroughs have been effectively unitary authority areas since the abolition of the metropolitan county councils by the Local Government Act 1985. However, metropolitan boroughs pool much of their authority in joint boards and other arrangements that cover whole metropolitan counties, such as combined authorities. - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek. - A \\"metropolitan area\\", sometimes referred to as a \\"metro area\\" or just \\"metro\\", is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing. A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns. - Birmingham is a major city and metropolitan borough of West Midlands, England. It is the largest and most populous British city outside London, with a population in 2014 of 1,101,360. The city is in the West Midlands Built-up Area, the third most populous urban area in the United Kingdom, with a population of 2,440,986 at the 2011 census. Birmingham's metropolitan area is the second most populous in the UK with a population of 3.8 million. This also makes Birmingham the 9th most populous metropolitan area in Europe. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - A Councillor is a member of a local government council. - Females typically have a special ovipositor for inserting eggs into hosts or otherwise inaccessible places. The ovipositor is often modified into a stinger. The young develop through holometabolism (complete metamorphosis)that is, they have a worm-like larval stage and an inactive pupal stage before they mature. - Sir George Hamilton Kenrick FRES ( 1850 -- 28 May 1939 ) was an English entomologist who specialised in Lepidoptera especially those of New Guinea and he was a councillor in Birmingham . - Moths comprise a group of insects related to butterflies, belonging to the order Lepidoptera. Most lepidopterans are moths; and there are thought to be approximately 160,000 species of moth, many of which are yet to be described. Most species of moth are nocturnal, but there are also crepuscular and diurnal species. - Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \\"cut into sections\\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans. - In computing, WinG (pronounced \\"Win Gee\\") is an application programming interface that is a port of Windows 95's Device Independent Bitmaps to provide faster graphics performance on Windows 3.x operating environments, and was initially positioned as a way to help game developers more easily port their DOS games to Microsoft Windows, although it was quickly discontinued in favor of DirectX. - New Guinea (or, historically, \\"\\") is a large Island in the South West Pacific region. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists. - The Lepidoptera is an order of insects that includes moths and butterflies (both called lepidopterans). 180,000 species of Lepidoptera are described, in 126 families and 46 superfamilies, 10% of the total described species of living organisms.

Question: Whose child is Sonja pregnant with? Movie plot title: Underworld: Rise of the Lycans Movie plot: The film begins with a voice-over monologue by vampire Selene, telling the story of the lycans and vampires. It has been 20 years since the war between them has begun (set several years before the first Underworld movie). Viktor (Bill Nighy) has built up an army of vampires to fight off the threat and have begun the process of exterminating the lycans. It appears that when someone is infected by a lycan, they transform into werewolves, but do not change back and appear to behave like vicious animals rather than people. However, one day, in a prison cell, Viktor hears the cries of a human child, and investigates. What he discovers is a human child born of a lycan later named Lucian. Viktor contemplates killing the child, but could not bring himself to do it.Lucian grows up, and appears to be stronger and more focused than others of his kind; this is evident when Viktor tests him by making him fight vampires. Viktor decides to make more of Lucians kind (the new lycans that have human form). Viktor uses Lucian to make more like him by starving him and letting him feed on human slaves. The ones that survived became the new lycans, a new slave race to serve the vampires. The vampires think they have control of the lycans, but this may not be the case for long.Note: there are two types of were-wolves in this film, ones that are permanently in wolf form and wild, and ones that can transform when its a full moon and are in service to the vampires. I will refer to the former as wolves, and the latter as lycans.Cut to the present, a horseman is riding through the woods at night, pursued by something.

Collin Backowski’s body was found buried under 8 to 10 feet of snow and ice on Mount Hood on Sunday morning, said Lieutenant Tiffany Peterson, a spokeswoman for the Hood River Country Sheriff’s office. Backowski was reported missing on Saturday afternoon, Peterson said. The 25-year old Colorado man had been snowboarding with five friends from the children’s snowboarding camp he worked at when he broke off from the group and boarded under an ice cave, his father, John Backowski said. “He was very good at helping other people with [snowboarding],” said John Backowski. “It never worried me what he was doing late at night.

At 4 a.m. Sunday, 12 members of two rescue organizations , the Hood River County Crag Rats and Portland Mountain Rescue, returned to the fallen ice tunnel that trapped Backowski, 25, of Pines, Colo., on Saturday. They used chain saws and hand tools to cut through tons of ice and reach his body about 8:45 a.m. Backowski's family was notified. His body was transferred to Anderson's Tribute Center of Hood River. Rescuers had expected that Backowski might not survive the tunnel collapse that buried him under a huge piece of ice, said Sgt. Pete Hughes, a spokesman for the Hood River County Sheriff's Office. The incident occurred at the 8100-foot level of Mt. Hood on the White River Glacier in Hood River County. The Clackamas County Sheriff's Office and other agencies assisted in the response. Backowski, 25, and five other men in their twenties were looking for a place to snowboard Saturday on Mt. Hood's south slopes when they entered a tunnel formed by melting snow. The tunnel collapsed, trapping Backowski under a piece of ice described as the size of a school bus. Two of the other men were hit by debris but not injured. They were not identified, but the group ranged in age from 24 to 29. Searchers attempted to clear ice and debris with hand tools late Saturday in preparation for a larger recovery effort early Sunday, said Rick Ragan of the Crag Rats. All searchers have since left the glacier, and none were injured in the recovery, said Tiffany Peterson, a spokeswoman for the Hood River County Sheriff's Office. -- Michael Russell ||||| In this undated photo provided by the Hood River County Sheriffs Office, a hiker stands at the entrance to an ice tunnel that collapsed, trapping a snowboarder at Oregon's Mount Hood on Aug. 2.

Being aimless is not comfortable for most people. Find something that drives you and concentrate on it. Once you find what this is, you can change your habits. Anything or anyone that draws you away from what gives you meaning or balance should be limited or cut out entirely. It's not a black and white world of thought preceding behavior or vice versa. However, regardless of your school of thought, you have some say in how you feel and interpret things. If positive thinking is hard for you, try to manipulate your behavior. You don't necessarily have to think something genuinely, but act like you do. You may find that your mind follows suit. Try this -- start walking with your head down. How do you feel? Now throw it up. How about now? If positive behaviors are hard for you, drill in on your thoughts. Stop the negative ones. And you can! You are the only person who can stop your negative thoughts. Use that power and replace them with positive (or at least neutral!) ones. A lot of people have undue amounts of stress in their lives from situations that would resolve themselves if they were just direct about it. Other people (sources of stress) for you may not realize that they are making you pull your hair out. Talk to them. Your happiness is at stake here. Whatever problem it is, if it's stressing you out, it's worth talking about. Your emotions are valid, whatever they are. It's easy for people-pleasers to get stressed out; obviously, because pleasing everyone is impossible to do. So start saying no to avoid over-committing. You'll have more free time and more time to concentrate on you. If this is an issue for you, practice saying no at least once a week. Don't miss out on the things you enjoy! Just cut down on the activities that make you sacrifice part of your already hectic schedule. We should always push ourselves to do our best, but we also need to realize when the job we've done is good enough. Everyone else judges, so you don't have to be another source of criticism when it comes to you. Set time limits on yourself if you find yourself being a perfectionist. This is where striking a balance comes into play. If you manage your time wisely, you'll have more time to relax.","output":"Having a meaningful purpose in work helps people stay centered and avoid aimlessness.

Their route varied from night to night, but the ultimate destination was never in question. \\"May I help you?\\" The worn-out speaker was crackly, but he still recognized the particularly twangy East Texas voice of Fontana Fry. Over his six years of vocal training, he had become acutely aware of accents. This is true of all classically trained singers. Great emphasis is placed on precise pronunciation and enunciation. It is mandatory that the singer's repertoire include works written in English, Latin, Italian, German, and French. So, by the time Greg finished his graduate degree, his accent had been all but eliminated. He sounded somewhat like a network news anchor instead of an East Texan. \\"I would like a large--\\" \\"--a large dipped cone, the usual. Right?\\" The Dairy Queen drive-thru ordering station was located out in front of the restaurant, on the right side. He looked up, and saw the 19 year-old waving at him. She looked so cute in her little Dairy Queen outfit. Fontana was in her first year at Kilgore College. She planned to be an elementary teacher. He knew she would be a good one. Greg had met Fontana a few months earlier when she brought her 13-year-old brother to the studio to enroll for guitar lessons. The boy was holding a U.S. made, 1968 Harmony acoustic guitar his uncle gave him. The body and the frets were badly worn, but the instrument still played beautifully. It looked somewhat like a large violin, with arched top and f-holes. That shape produces a more mellow sound than flattops. And the guitar's age contributed additional warmth to the tone.

Let's solve this math problem step by step. We want to find out what 'w' is. First, we see there are two terms with 'w' in them: 1843*w and 3044*w. Let's add these two together: 1843*w + 3044*w = (1843 + 3044)*w = 4887*w Now, let's look at the numbers without the 'w': -44310, -204945, and 48888. We're going to add these numbers together: -44310 - 204945 + 48888 = -207367 Now our equation looks like this: 4887*w - 207367 = 0 We want to find out what 'w' is, so we need to move the numbers to the other side of the equal sign. We do that by adding 207367 to both sides: 4887*w = 207367 Now, we just have to divide both sides by 4887 to get 'w': w = 207367 / 4887 When we do the math, we find out that: w = 42.4 So, the answer to our problem is w = 42.4.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Friction is a force that opposes motion. Any two objects in contact have what is called a mutual coefficient of friction. To find the force of friction between them, we multiply the normal force by this coefficient. Like the forces above, it arises due to electromagnetic interactions of atoms in two objects. There are actually two coefficients of friction: static and kinetic. Static friction will oppose initial motion of two objects relative to each other. Once the objects are moving, however, kinetic friction will oppose their continuing motion. Kinetic friction is lower than static friction, so it is easier to keep an object in motion than to set it in motion. There are some things about friction that are not very intuitive:.

Call your landlord. Hire a locksmith as a last resort.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Ensuring Home Security: Checking Unlocked Windows and Beyond Introduction Home security is a top concern for many, as it ensures the protection of both our loved ones and our prized possessions. Several layers of security can be put in place to prevent break-ins and other forms of unwanted access. Inadequate security measures leave homes vulnerable, making them prime targets for theft and vandalism. As such, it is important to consistently review and update these measures to ensure that potential weak points in home security are attended to. In this article, we will explore the importance of checking for unlocked windows, making necessary phone calls to roommates and landlords, and considering the help of a professional locksmith as a last resort. Section 1: Checking for Unlocked Windows One of the first steps in ensuring home security is to regularly check for unlocked windows. As windows are common entry points for burglars, it is essential that they remain closed and locked when not in use. Furthermore, it is best to make a habit of locking windows upon closing for peace of mind. To make this more manageable, consider developing a daily routine to inspect windows and guarantee their proper closure. In addition, it is crucial to inspect window locks to ascertain that they are functional and correctly positioned. Section 2: Communicate with Your Roommates In shared living situations, such as apartment complexes or student housing, maintaining effective communication with roommates is vital for home security. Inform roommates of the importance of checking for unlocked windows and establishing a mutually agreed-upon routine. By working together, roommates can ensure that all points of access to the living space are secure. In the event that a roommate forgets to lock a door or window and another is unable to reach the location, instructing them to call you as soon as possible can help prevent potential security breaches. Section 3: Reach Out to Your Landlord Landlords play an essential role in maintaining home security, as they are responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of the property. If you encounter any issues with locks, doors, or windows, do not hesitate to reach out to your landlord. When communicating with your landlord, be specific about the problem, and request prompt assistance in resolving the issue. Additionally, it is always wise to have a written record of your correspondence with your landlord in case any future disputes or misunderstandings arise. Section 4: Hire a Locksmith as a Last Resort While checking windows, communicating with roommates, and reaching out to landlords are effective measures to maintain home security, there may be instances where professional intervention is necessary. If you find yourself locked out of your home or if a lock is broken or malfunctioning, hiring a locksmith may be the recommended course of action. Locksmiths can provide valuable services, including lock repair, re-keying, and replacement. Make sure that you choose a reputable locksmith who has a history of providing quality service in your area. Furthermore, it may be worth keeping the contact information of a trusted locksmith on hand in case of emergencies. Conclusion In conclusion, home security is an essential component of protecting our loved ones and possessions from unwanted access and potential harm. By taking simple steps to ensure the proper locking of windows, maintaining open communication with roommates and landlords, and utilizing the services of a professional locksmith when necessary, you can establish the foundation for a secure living environment. Remain vigilant and proactive, and always be willing to adjust your security measures as needed to safeguard your home and its occupants."},{"instruction":"Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"After Cassander's death in 298 BCE, however, Demetrius, who still maintained a sizable loyal army and fleet, invaded Macedon, seized the Macedonian throne (294) and conquered Thessaly and most of central Greece (293-291). He was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia minor and wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece. After initial successes, he was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 and later died in captivity. Lysimachus, who had seized Macedon and Thessaly for himself, was forced into war when Seleucus invaded his territories in Asia minor and was defeated and killed in 281 BCE at the Battle of Corupedium, near Sardis. Seleucus then attempted to conquer Lysimachus' European territories in Thrace and Macedon, but he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus (\\"the thunderbolt\\"), who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court and then had himself acclaimed as king of Macedon. Ptolemy was killed when Macedon was invaded by Gauls in 279, his head stuck on a spear and the country fell into anarchy.

Demetrius retreated to central Greece and later struck a treaty allowing him to invade Lysimachus' territories in Asia Minor, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece.

Widely considered as one of the most influential bands in the genre and important in the transition of death metal from its thrash metal roots, they were one of the first bands to incorporate guttural vocals, up-tempo blast beats, multiple tempo changes and dark atmosphere. They have been described as one of \\"the most influential and emulated bands in death metal\\", alongside Obituary and Cannibal Corpse, and have been cited as an influence by many later bands. They were also the first death metal band to experience mainstream success in connection with being signed to Giant Records in 1992, heavy rotation of their music videos on MTV, and having the music video for the song \\"God of Emptiness\\" shown on an episode of Beavis and Butt-head. Morbid Angel was formed in 1983 in Tampa, Florida by guitarist Trey Azagthoth and drummer/vocalist Mike Browning. The band made their debut in 1987 on the New Renaissance Records record label. They recorded their debut album, Abominations of Desolation, in 1986, but the band was unsatisfied with the final product and it remained unreleased until 1991, printing 10,000 copies. In the early stages of their career the band developed a reputation for \\"gruesome stage antics.\\" In 1986, David Vincent joined the band, replacing Michael Manson and Sterling von Scarborough as vocalist and bassist respectively. Fellow Terrorizer drummer Pete Sandoval soon followed. Their first studio album, Altars of Madness, was released in 1989, and is regarded by many as one of the most important death metal albums of all time. It is also considered the first true death metal album. Music journalist Jason Birchmeier writes that: Few albums struck a chord within the ears and minds of the late-'80s underground metal scene like Morbid Angel's Altars of Madness did at the end of the decade, setting a new precedent for metal bands to reach. With the arguable exception of Chuck Schuldiner's Death, never before had a heavy metal band carried their lightning-fast guitar riffs and equally spellbinding guitar solos into such horrific territory. Venom and Slayer redefined the extent to which a metal band could align itself with all things evil during the beginning of the decade, but Morbid Angel made these two groups sound like children's music compared to the Florida-based group's assaulting death metal sounds and their blasphemous lyrics.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Was the lead ever replaced?","output":"Morbid Angel, a death metal band from Florida, was formed in 1983 by three friends: Trey, the guitarist, Dallas, the singer and bass player, and Mike, the drummer. They helped create a new style of music called death metal by using very deep and growly voices, fast drum beats, and spooky sounds. The band became very popular, even having their music played on big TV channels like MTV. Some people think that their first album, called \\"Altars of Madness,\\" is one of the most important death metal albums ever made. In this answer, I couldn't find any information about the lead (guitarist or vocalist) being replaced. However, in 1986, David Vincent joined the band as the new singer and bass player, taking over from previous members Michael Manson and Sterling von Scarborough.

The practice of spreading fast food litter and scraps on the street rather than in the dustbin--with young men the worst group--was behind the rise. According to the National Rodent Survey in 2005, Britain's rat population has grown by nearly one quarter since 2000 and is now estimated at 60 million, two million more than the human population. On average a rat can give birth every 24-28 days and just a single pair of rats can produce a family of 2,000 a year.

Officials with the Lubbock Police Department say Texas Tech police made a student welfare check late Monday afternoon. When the officers entered the room of 19-year-old freshman Hollis A. Daniels, officers found evidence of drugs and drug paraphernalia. Officers took Daniels to the TTU police station for standard debriefing. At the TTU police station, Daniels is accused of pulling a gun and fatally shooting an officer. The suspect ran off and a full SWAT call out was made. \\"During this time, the suspect pulled a gun and mortally shot an officer,\\" Texas Tech Police Department Chief Kyle Bonath said. \\"The suspect fled on foot and later apprehended by TTPD near the Lubbock Municipal Coliseum.\\" Daniels was taken into custody at 9:28 p.m. according to officials with the Lubbock County Sheriff's Office. He was found near the Lubbock Municipal Coliseum. Sources say Daniels' ripped off the officer's body camera after the shooting, but the camera was found around 10:30 p.m. Once Daniels was taken into custody, the lockdowns at Texas Tech University and University Medical Center were lifted. Classes will resume normally on Tuesday, Oct. 10, but officials say people still need to avoid the Texas Tech Police Department and the north side of campus. Sources report after being taken into custody, Daniels repeatedly tried to spit on law enforcement officers. Officials with Texas Tech Police, Lubbock Police Department, Lubbock County Sheriff's Office, Federal agents, and the Texas Department of Public Safety were all called to assist. After Daniels' arrest, officials were searching through vehicles on the west side of the stadium. Sources say a gun was recovered, but it is not clear if it belonged to the officer or Daniels. T.C. Richards, a TTU student, says he found out about the active shooter situation and noticed there were many students walking around, unaware of the situation. He decided to drive around and pick up students and take them to their dorms. He said he pulled over in the parking lot of the Jones AT&T Stadium to send a text to a friend about the shooting. He then noticed a man walking next to his vehicle who matched the description of the shooter. \\"He walked out from behind the football stadium, between the football stadium and the training facility, started walking across the parking lot, in the same exact clothing he was wearing. He kept looking back at my truck. My headlights were on and he kind of walked pretty quick,\\" said Richards. He said that is when he called 911. Within a few minutes, officers arrived at his location to ask him some questions. They asked him to leave the area. Richards said just a few moments later he received the alert the suspected shooter was in custody. \\"They got the situation under control within the hour made me feel safe because I know they did their job properly and they did a really good job in general. So I feel much safer now knowing that our police officers here are taking care of us making sure we're safe,\\" said TTU student Bahij Atallah. Atallah was at the Rec Center on campus when the shooting happened. He was texting Richards during the shooting. He said the staff escorted those in the Rec Center to the basement to make sure everyone was safe. \\"The family of the officer is in the thoughts and prayers of the Texas Tech community,\\" Texas Tech President Lawrence Schovanec said. \\"I want to express my deep appreciation to the Texas Tech Police Department, Lubbock Police Department, Lubbock Sheriff’s Office, and other state and federal law enforcement officials for their response.\\" Governor Greg Abbott issued the following statement on the shooting that occurred at Texas Tech University this evening: \\"First and foremost, our hearts go out to the family of the police officer killed at Texas Tech University.

It originated in the United Kingdom, and is celebrated in a number of countries that previously formed part of the British Empire. Boxing Day is on 26 December, although the attached bank holiday or public holiday may take place either on that day or two days later. What's the best answer to this question: is boxing day a national holiday in canada?","output":"Yes, Boxing Day is a national holiday in Canada, which means it is widely recognized and celebrated in the country. As a former British colony, Canada has inherited many traditions and customs from the United Kingdom, including the observance of Boxing Day on December 26th. The name \\"Boxing Day\\" is thought to have originated from the tradition of giving Christmas boxes, which were gifts or monetary bonuses, to service workers such as postal workers, servants, and tradespeople during the holiday season. Boxing Day is observed as a public holiday in most provinces and territories in Canada. It is usually a day off work for employees, although this depends on local employment laws and individual contracts, as some provinces do not officially observe it as a statutory holiday. In provinces where Boxing Day is not a statutory holiday, employers may still choose to give their employees this day off or offer extra pay for working on this day. Traditionally, Boxing Day in Canada is a day for shopping, with stores offering post-Christmas discounts and sales, similar to Black Friday in the United States. People often engage in return and exchange of Christmas gifts on this day, and many retailers see high traffic and sales volume on Boxing Day. While the shopping aspect remains a significant part of Boxing Day, the holiday has evolved over time. Canadians often use this day to spend more time relaxing with friends and family, attending social events, or participating in outdoor activities such as skiing, ice-skating, or ice hockey. Moreover, some people use this day to support charitable events or give donations to those in need. In summary, although each province may have its own laws regarding the observance of Boxing Day, it is indeed considered a national holiday in Canada. Canadians, particularly those in the provinces where it is a statutory holiday, enjoy a day off work and often take advantage of the sales or engage in leisure activities with friends and family."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"10Porque convenía que Aquél para quien son todas las cosas y por quien son todas las cosas, llevando muchos hijos a la gloria, hiciera perfecto por medio de los padecimientos al autor de la salvación de ellos.\\" from Spanish to English.","output":"Ok, let me explain it like a story for you!

He'd founded the company three years back and, just a few hours ago, his partners and erstwhile friends had fired him without cause or warning. He concentrated hard as his pen brought to life demonic figures from one of the best-selling comics he'd created, scythe wielding cyber-men called Myrmidons who tore into surprised computer programmers with fangs and claws. Elsewhere on the page, computers assembled themselves into 21st century Golems, rising up against traitorous CEO's and producers to crush them to bloody pulp as they cowered beneath their desks. Sitting at the bar in Señor Goldstein's Mexican Restaurant in San Jose, California, Paul's own artwork engaged him for the first time in months, maybe years. Under other circumstances, that would have made him happy. But today's circumstances allowed only two emotions: despair and a burning desire for revenge. Not wanting to succumb to the former, and not quite wanting to find a gun and go back to the office, he instead drew. He had turned to a fresh page and begun to sketch his most elaborate revenge-scheme yet when a woman walked into his line of vision. There were four or five other women in the restaurant already (most of them employees), but this one stood out. This one would've stood out anywhere. Her hair, cut short and spiky, was dyed a magenta so bright it nearly glowed. She wore a tight black t-shirt, baggy olive drab shorts that hung on shapely hips, and heavy black boots with two inch thick soles. She had a faded black messenger bag slung across her chest, the strap pressing between her breasts. If Paul had to guess, she wasn't wearing a bra. She definitely wasn't your average Silicon Valley techie on an early lunch break, and certainly not a restaurant employee. How long Paul worked at the company? - He just started - Few month - not enough information - About 3 years A:","output":"Paul Reynolds had worked at Fear and Loading Games, the company he founded, for about three years. The period of his association with the company is clearly stated in the provided narrative. Not only does it mention that he'd founded the company three years back but also within the same duration, he experienced varied emotions of responsibility, camaraderie, betrayal, and anger. It was a journey marked by the creation of best-selling comics and ending with a bitter termination. Fired without cause or warning, Reynolds found himself abandoned by his partners and friends, leaving him in a state of shock and anger. His three years at the company solicited feelings of despair and revenge. Despite this situation, it appears that Paul's creative side never ceased to exist. His vivid imagination was reflected in his sketches, with imagery taking inspiration from his own comics. He imagined his creations coming to life in scenes of imagined revenge, where cybernetic Myrmidons tore into unsuspecting programmers and computers morphed into 21st-century Golems punishing traitors. These elaborate sketches are symbolic of his profound feelings of betrayal and his reflections on his time at the company. As he sat sketching at the bar in Señor Goldstein's Mexican Restaurant in San Jose, California, a fascinating stranger entered who was distinctly different from the usual clientele. This woman, as unique as Paul's imagination, might be perceived as a distraction or potential diversion from the heavy thoughts that preoccupied his mind regarding his past three years at Fear and Loading Games. However, this part of the narrative introduces a possible new direction or perhaps an unforeseen avenue for Paul, potentially offering him an escape from the despairs of his current situation or a companion to navigate the vicissitudes he's facing. Thus, in summary, Paul worked at Fear and Loading Games for about three years. This period was marked by creative achievements, unexpected termination, feelings of revenge, and possibly the beginning of a new chapter post his working tenure."},{"instruction":"Context: Following the Week 13 win over the Detroit Lions at home, the Bengals traveled to the Metrodome, looking for a big win over the Minnesota Vikings. In the opening quarter of the game, no one scored. The Vikings scored a field goal about 40 seconds into the second quarter, making them lead 3-0. Later in the second quarter, Sidney Rice caught a 9-yard touchdown pass from Brett Favre to make the score 10-0. The Bengals also scored in the second quarter with a 15-yard touchdown pass caught by Chad Ochocinco from Carson Palmer. The Vikings got two more field goals in the first half, making the score at halftime 16-7. The first and only score in the third quarter came for the Vikings when Adrian Peterson had a 1-yard touchdown run, to extend the Vikings' lead to 23-7. In the final quarter of the game, Shayne Graham Got a 22-yard field goal to make the score 23-10. The field goal was followed by a 3-yard touchdown run by Adrian Peterson for the Vikings, to make the final score 30-10. Cedric Benson had 96 yards rushing. Chad Ochocinco had 27 yards receiving and one touchdown, and Andre Caldwell had 25 yards receiving. Question: How many fewer yards was Favre's touchdown pass compared to Palmers? Answer:","output":"To determine the difference in yards between Brett Favre's and Carson Palmer's touchdown passes, we need to examine the specific details of each pass. Brett Favre's touchdown pass was completed to Sidney Rice for a 9-yard gain. Meanwhile, Carson Palmer's touchdown pass was caught by Chad Ochocinco and covered a distance of 15 yards. To find the difference in yards between these two passes, we simply subtract the smaller value (Favre's pass) from the larger value (Palmer's pass): 15 yards (Palmer's pass) - 9 yards (Favre's pass) = 6 yards Thus, Carson Palmer's touchdown pass was 6 yards longer than Brett Favre's touchdown pass."},{"instruction":"Tweet: Been at the hospital pretty much since 5PM yesterday, wife has intestinal inflammation issues. Sucky ass monday for shore. Predict the sentiment of this tweet.","output":"The sentiment of this tweet seems to be predominantly negative. This judgement is based on the user revealing that they have been at the hospital from 5PM yesterday, which signifies a stressful or worrisome situation. There is no feeling of happiness, joy, or positivity, instead feelings of concern, anxiety or stressfulness are evident. The most direct expression of negativity comes from the statement about the user's wife suffering from intestinal inflammation issues, a health condition that can be painful and debilitating, and is, therefore, associated with negative emotions. Illness of a loved one often causes feelings of worry, concern, and distress, particularly if it necessitates a prolonged stay at a hospital. This is reinforced by the user's mention of spending an extended period at the hospital, which is not a typical or desirable situation and generally associated with ill-health or medical emergencies. Thus, this experience also adds to the negative sentiment of the tweet. Furthermore, the user describes their Monday as a \\"sucky ass\\" one, further intensifying the misery and dissatisfaction linked to their situation. This statement indicates a very strong negative emotion as the user is not just saying their Monday was bad, but they're using a colloquial and rather emphatic term to express just how terrible it was. \\"For shore\\" appearing to be a misspelling or slang version of \\"for sure\\" implies certainty and reinforces the negative sentiment of the tweet. To summarize, an assessment based on the emotional tone, context of the situation cited, and the choice of words used by the Twitter user, it can be ascertained that the sentiment of the tweet is overwhelmingly negative. This doesn't necessarily mean that the user is always negative, but merely that they are going through a challenging situation that is causing negative emotions at this moment."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"Step 1: Choose a language other than English.

Answer the following question: What may happen after seeing the pod ?","output":"After seeing the pod, I will be able to identify whether the plant is a bindweed or a morning glory by examining the characteristics of the seed pod. Step 1: Observe the seed pod closely Step 2: Determine if the seed pod has a \\"fuzzy\\" texture. If it does, then it is likely a bindweed. Bindweed seed pods are typically larger, round, and covered with small hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. Step 3: Determine if the seed pod is smaller and has a smooth/slick texture when dry. If it matches this description, then it is likely a morning glory. Morning glory seed pods are generally smaller, oval-shaped, and have a smooth texture when dry. Step 4: Make a conclusion based on the observed characteristics of the seed pod. If the seed pod fits the description of a bindweed, then conclude that the plant growing up the pole is a bindweed. If the seed pod matches the description of a morning glory, conclude that the plant is a wild type of morning glory. Step 5: Based on the identification, decide on an appropriate course of action to manage the plant. If it is a desirable plant like a wild morning glory, you may choose to let it grow and admire its beauty. If it turns out to be an invasive plant like bindweed, you might consider removing or controlling its growth to prevent damage to other plants or garden structures. In conclusion, after seeing the pod of the plant, it becomes possible to identify if it is a bindweed or a morning glory, and the information obtained can be used to determine the appropriate action to take regarding the plant's presence in the area."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: ROLAND HELD HIS BODY STIFF AS HE FACED THE CATHAR FORTRESS and watched the tall wooden doors swing open. He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop.

Ok, well that’s a slight exaggeration but it was the first high-end make-up item that I ever bought and it made me feel like I was really getting somewhere. I’d got a good job, was in the process of buying my own house and I could afford to buy premium beauty products. I chose a transparent lemon yellow gloss with tiny flecks of iridescent glitter in, and over the following months I treated myself to several other Juicy Tube variants including a shimmery nude gloss called Pamplemousse which I wore on nights out for years (incidentally Pamplemousse is still going!). Fast forward several (ahem…) years and Juicy Tubes are still going strong, but there’s a new member of the Juicy family vying for attention – the Juicy Shaker.*. Another lip product, this one is a nourishing tinted lip oil which acts a bit like a gloss, and I was sent two of the new shades to try out – Piece of Cake and Show Me The Honey. Juicy Shakers are a bi-phase nourishing lip oil, when the product is allowed to settle the pigment falls to the bottom and the oil rises to the top, giving a split effect. Then you need to shake the bottle to mix the two layers together, giving the product it’s name. The ingredients include sweet almond oil, omega 3 and cranberry oil and really help care for your lips unlike most other glosses. Show Me The Honey is a nude coral shade, it looks rather orange and scary in the bottle but in reality it’s much more of a gentle shade. Piece of Cake is a damson pink, and again looks much darker in the bottle.

In the context of a movie review, the word \\"charming\\" typically carries an affirmative connotation, implying that the movie or the particular aspect being discussed has a certain appeal and likeability. In this sentence, the use of the word \\"still\\" hints that there might have been a reason for the aspect or the movie in question to lose its charm, but it has managed to maintain its charm in spite of that. The combination of these words indicates that the reviewer acknowledges the movie's capability to sustain the allure and captivate its audience. However, this sentence is quite brief, and without further context or additional information, we cannot give a comprehensive assessment of the sentiment.

Commanded by Sultan Mehmed III, the army marched through Edirne, Filibe , Sofia and Niš to arrive at Belgrade on 9 August. On 20 August, the army crossed the River Sava by bridge and entered the Austrian territory of Siren. A war council was called at Slankamen Castle, and it was decided that they would begin a siege on the Hungarian fort of Eger . The fort controlled the communication routes between Habsburg Austria and Transylvania, all of whom were in revolt against the Ottoman suzerainty. However, news soon arrived that the Austrians had besieged and succeeded in taking over the Castle of Hatvan and had killed all the Ottomans housed there, including the women and children. The Ottoman Army started a siege on the fort of Eger on 21 September 1596, and by 12 October the castle had capitulated. As a retaliation to the Hatvan castle massacre, the defenders of this castle were all executed. Not long after, Ottoman command received the report that a mixed army of Austrians and Transylvanians were advancing towards the Ottoman expeditionary force. A war council was conducted under Grand Vizier Damat Ibrahim Pasha. It was decided that the Ottoman Army should march out of the Erlau castle so as to meet the Austrians at a suitable battle terrain. The Sultan thought that the Ottoman army should disengage and return to Istanbul; it was with great difficulty that he was persuaded to engage the enemy forces. The most realistic troop strength figures seem to be 40,000-50,000 for the Christian and 80,000-100,000 for the Muslim army. The Christian army had 10,000 Austrians, 4,000 Germans, 3,000 reiters, 13,000 Hungarian light cavalry and 10,000 Transylvanians, for a total of 40,000 men. How many more Christian troops were Hungarian than Austrians and reiters?","output":"To determine how many more Hungarian Christian troops there were than Austrian and reiter troops, we should look at the numbers provided: - Hungarian troops: 13,000 - Austrian troops: 10,000 - Reiter troops: 3,000 To find the difference between Hungarian troops and the combined Austrian and reiter troops, we can first add the number of Austrian and reiter troops together: 10,000 (Austrians) + 3,000 (reiters) = 13,000 Now, we can subtract this combined number from the number of Hungarian troops: 13,000 (Hungarians) - 13,000 (Austrians + reiters) = 0 Based on this calculation, there were exactly the same number of Hungarian Christian troops as the combined number of Austrian and reiter troops.

Season the patty with salt and pepper. Article:","output":"Title: The Perfectly Seasoned Hamburger: Simple Steps for a Delectable Meal Introduction The humble hamburger is a staple in households across the world, with countless variations and recipes to cater to different tastes. However, many would argue that the key to a great hamburger lies in the perfect seasoning and the cooking process. In this article, we will walk you through two simple yet essential steps in achieving a delectable hamburger: flattening the meat and seasoning the patty with salt and pepper. Flatten the Hamburger Meat Step 1: Choosing the Right Meat The first step in creating the perfect hamburger is selecting the right type of ground meat. While different types of meat can be used, beef is the classic choice due to its distinct flavor and juiciness. The ideal fat-to-lean ratio is approximately 80:20, ensuring that the burger remains moist and full of flavor. Step 2: Forming the Patty Once you have chosen your ground meat, it's time to form the patty. Take a portion of the meat and gently form a ball. Avoid overworking the meat or compressing it too much, as this can make the burger dense and chewy. Step 3: Flattening the Patty Place the ball of meat on a clean surface, such as a parchment paper or plastic wrap, and gently press down until it is about ½ - ¾ inches thick. A flatter, thinner patty will cook more evenly and quickly compared to a thicker one. Additionally, the shape of the patty will affect the final texture of the burger. Slightly indent the center of the patty with your thumb, preventing it from puffing up in the middle during cooking. Season the Patty with Salt and Pepper Step 4: Seasoning the Patty Once the patty is flattened, it's time to season it properly. The classic choice is a simple combination of salt and pepper, which will enhance the natural flavor of the meat without overpowering it. It's important to season both sides of the patty, ensuring an even flavor distribution. Step 5: The Importance of Timing The timing of seasoning plays a crucial role in the final outcome of your hamburger. To avoid drawing out moisture from the meat, season your patty immediately before placing it on the heat source. This will ensure that the patty remains juicy and delicious throughout the cooking process. Conclusion By following these simple steps, you can achieve a perfectly seasoned and cooked hamburger that will impress your guests and satisfy your cravings. Remember that the simplicity of salt and pepper can go a long way in elevating the natural flavors of the meat while maintaining its juiciness. Don't forget to pair your delectable hamburger with your choice of buns and toppings for a complete and satisfying meal."},{"instruction":"Continue writing the following text.

Suicide Answer:","output":"Title: \\"The Last Stand of the Desert Fox\\" Genre: War/Drama Plot: In 1944, the tide of World War II is turning against the Axis powers. German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, nicknamed \\"the Desert Fox,\\" is widely regarded as one of the most skilled military tacticians in history. However, he has become disillusioned with Hitler's leadership and the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime. Rommel knows that the downfall of the Nazi regime is imminent, and he's faced with the difficult question: How does he choose to die? The film follows the story of Rommel's final months, as he grapples with the moral ambiguity of his allegiances and his duty as a soldier. Though he is fiercely loyal to Germany and committed to protecting his soldiers, he is also sympathetic to the growing resistance movement within the military. As Rommel's doubts grow, his own family faces danger and turmoil. His wife, Lucie, fears for the future of their children, as one son joins the Luftwaffe and their daughter becomes an unwilling target of the Gestapo's relentless manhunt for her father. As the pressure mounts, Rommel is approached by members of a secret anti-Hitler resistance group within the German military. They inform him of their plan to assassinate Hitler and end the war. Rommel is initially reluctant to participate, but he ultimately agrees to provide crucial intelligence and support to the resistance, in order to save the lives of innocent people and bring an end to Hitler's reign of terror. The film then portrays the tumultuous events leading up to the July 20th plot to assassinate Hitler, with breathtaking action sequences depicting clandestine meetings, secret codes, and desperate gambles. Despite the risks, Rommel remains committed to breaking the grip of the Nazi regime on his beloved homeland. But the plot fails, and Rommel becomes a prime suspect in the crackdown on the conspirators. As the Gestapo closes in and betrayal lurks in every shadow, Rommel faces the devastating reality that his time is running out. Ultimately, Rommel is left with no way out. He receives an ultimatum from Hitler himself: face public execution and humiliation in a sham trial, or commit suicide to preserve his honor and the safety of his family. Tormented by his seemingly impossible decision, Rommel reflects on his life, his choices, and the future of Germany. In a poignant and powerful ending, Rommel chooses suicide in order to protect his family and to defy Hitler, even in death. His legacy as a complex and enigmatic figure, both patriot and traitor, remains an integral part of history's narrative. \\"The Last Stand of the Desert Fox\\" is a riveting film that explores the moral complexities of war, loyalty, and the power of individual choice in the face of impossible circumstances.

However, a more detailed analysis is necessary before reaching a concrete conclusion. The statement, \\"higher than any other ones and then they said that we'll give you back some of your money\\" raises several red flags that suggest caution and further investigation. 1. Promising extraordinarily high returns: It is important to be cautious when someone promises returns that are significantly higher than those of other investments because it may be too good to be true. Investments that offer higher returns usually come with higher risks, and no investment can guarantee high returns without any risk. 2. The promise to return some of your money while making it sound like it is a favor or a limited-time offer might indicate that the individuals or organization behind the investment may be trying to build a sense of urgency or exclusivity to persuade investors. 3. Lack of transparency: It is essential to have all the relevant information about any investment opportunity, including the individuals or organizations involved, the specific investment strategy being employed, and the potential risks and rewards involved. If the information provided in the given scenario is all that is available, then there is not enough transparency to make an informed decision about the legitimacy and potential success of the opportunity. Given these red flags, it would be reasonable for one to be skeptical and cautious about the investment in question. Nevertheless, it is also important to remember that insufficient information and a potentially misleading initial approach do not definitively prove that this situation is a scam. Before reaching a conclusion, further investigation is needed to determine the legitimacy of the offer, the people involved, and the details of the investment. Conducting thorough research and seeking advice from trustworthy financial advisors are also ways to minimize the risk of falling victim to scams and making poor investment decisions. Thus, the most suitable answer to the question would be: 2). It is not possible to tell."},{"instruction":"Write a dialog about anything you want","output":"Title: The Intricacies of Time Travel Characters: - Susan: an astrophysics professor in her 50s - Brian: her brilliant yet curious student, in his 20s Setting: Susan's office at the university, filled with books, papers, a telescope, and a chalkboard with equations. [Scene: Brian knocks on Susan's slightly ajar office door. Susan is sitting at her desk, reading an article on her computer.] Brian: Professor Susan, may I come in? Susan: Oh, hello Brian! Of course, come on in. What brings you here today? Brian: Well, I have been thinking a lot about our recent discussions on theoretical physics, and I wanted to ask you about time travel. Do you think it's possible? Susan: Ah, the age-old question in science fiction and theoretical physics alike. Time travel is a fascinating concept, but to be honest, we still have a lot to learn before we can answer that question definitively. Brian: I've read about wormholes, parallel dimensions, and all those kinds of things. Are they just theories, or do we have any evidence of them? Susan: Both wormholes and parallel dimensions are based on mathematical theorems and models. Wormholes come from the idea of general relativity, which describes how massive objects can curve spacetime around them. In some instances, this curvature can be so strong that it creates a tunnel-like structure connecting two remote points in space – and that's a wormhole. Brian: And parallel dimensions? Susan: The idea of parallel dimensions comes from the field of string theory. In this model, the universe is made up of incredibly tiny vibrating strings. By the vibrations and interactions of these strings, we can explain all the fundamental particles and forces around us. Now, string theory also predicts that there could be more dimensions beyond the familiar three that we experience, up to a total of 26 in some versions of the theory. These extra dimensions could be curled up, hidden from us, or could even generate braneworlds – potentially parallel universes. Brian: That's mind-blowing! But, let's say we do discover solid evidence of parallel dimensions or wormholes, could we use them to travel through time? Back to the past, like in the movies? Susan: It's hard to say. If wormholes do exist, they could theoretically allow for travel through time. But simply passing through a wormhole might not necessarily transport you to a different time. For that to work, one end of the wormhole would have to be accelerated to near the speed of light, and then be brought back, while the other remains stationary. In this case, according to general relativity, time would flow differently in the two ends of the wormhole. Brian: So, what about parallel dimensions? What if we could somehow cross into a different dimension where time flows differently? Susan: The idea of traveling through parallel dimensions is even more speculative. While it's theoretically possible, we would need a way of accessing these parallel dimensions in the first place. Even if we could do that, there's no guarantee that we could control the direction or magnitude of the time shift – if there even is one. Brian: I see. So, it's possible that time travel could exist, but as of now, it remains a far-off prospect? Susan: Precisely. The scientific community still has a lot to discover and understand about the true nature of time and the universe. While many of the theories are mathematically sound and innovative, until we have experimental evidence, they will remain just that – theories. Brian: Thank you, Professor Susan. This conversation has made me even more excited about pursuing a career in physics! Susan: You're welcome, Brian! I'm glad I could help spark your curiosity even further. Remember that the most important part of being a physicist is staying open to new ideas and learning from the unknown. Who knows, maybe you'll be a part of the team that unlocks time travel!

Speaking at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue defense conference, Modi called for the Indo-Pacific region to embrace freedom of navigation, territorial integrity, and respect for all nations, regardless of their size. \\"We will promote a democratic and rules-based international order in which all nations, small and large, count as equal and sovereign,\\" the Indian prime minister said. \\"We will work with others to keep our seas, space and airways free and open.\\" While those comments did not specifically mention China, Modi's remarks are seen as a reference to Beijing's increasingly assertive behavior toward its smaller neighbors in disputed areas of the South China Sea. Modi also implicitly criticized the United States. He slammed growing protectionism, presumably a reference to recent tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. He also said nations should keep their commitments — a possible reference to Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal. India has grown close with the U.S., especially as China projects its growing military power beyond its shores. The U.S.-India relationship, Modi said, \\"has resumed new significance in the changing world.\\" An important aspect of that partnership is \\"a shared vision of an open, stable, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific,\\" he added. For decades, India has embraced a non-aligned status, which means it does not choose sides between world powers. In keeping with that position, Modi warned against a \\"return to great power rivalries.\\" The Indian prime minister also insisted that \\"Asia and the world will have a better future when India and China work together in trust and confidence, sensitive to each other's interests.\\" India is the world's largest democracy. It has the world's seventh-largest economy. Within a decade, it is expected to pass China to become the world's most populous country. Question: After the end of the story, US and India relations: Options: A. probably will improve in importance B. probably will have a great downfall C. probably will remain the same D. not enough information === The correct answer is The answer to this question is:","output":"A. probably will improve in importance In the speech by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, he emphasized the importance of promoting a democratic and rules-based international order and working with other nations to keep seas, space, and airways free and open. While not explicitly mentioning either China or the United States, his remarks can be seen as referencing China's assertive behavior in the South China Sea and the United States' growing protectionism. Modi emphasized that the U.S.-India relationship \\"has assumed new significance in the changing world\\" and that an important aspect of their partnership is a shared vision of an open, stable, secure, and prosperous Indo-Pacific region. This indicates that the relationship between the U.S. and India is expected to grow in importance as both nations seek to address shared challenges and maintain stability in the region. Additionally, with India being the world's largest democracy, having the seventh-largest economy, and projected to surpass China in population size within a decade, the country's global influence is likely to grow, which may strengthen its partnership with the U.S."},{"instruction":"Question: The boy was too nervous to dance, so what was he doing progressively at the ball?

Let's consider the following factors: 1. Length and Depth: A good review should ideally provide enough information and details to help potential customers understand the experience of using the product or service in question. Such a review should touch on aspects such as usability, features, pros and cons, and any unique benefits or drawbacks. 2. Clarity: A well-written review should be clear, concise, and easy for readers to understand. It should avoid unnecessary jargon and provide readers with meaningful insights into the product or service being reviewed. 3. Objectivity: A review should be unbiased and fair, providing both the positive and negative aspects of the experience. This allows potential customers to make an informed decision. 4. Personal Experience: The best reviews often come from people who have actually used the product or service in question. A quality review should reflect personal experience and provide specific examples of how the product or service met or failed to meet expectations. 5. Helpfulness: A helpful review provides valuable information to potential customers, addresses common questions or concerns, and enables decision-making about a product or service. Given these criteria, let's evaluate the given review, which consists of the single word \\"Good.\\" 1. Length and Depth: The review is extremely short and does not provide any information about the usability, features, pros, or cons of the product or service. It lacks depth and detail, making it difficult for a potential customer to understand the reviewer's experience. 2. Clarity: While the review is clear in that it has a singular positive word, it does not provide meaningful insights or any further context or elaboration. 3. Objectivity: The review only presents a positive aspect, with no indication of any drawbacks or negative experiences. This one-sided view could be seen as biased and unhelpful for making an informed decision. 4. Personal Experience: There is no information provided about whether the reviewer has actually used the product or service in question. There are no specific examples or personal anecdotes shared, reducing the value and credibility of the review. 5. Helpfulness: The review does not address any common questions or concerns, nor does it provide valuable information to help potential customers make a decision. Based on the aforementioned criteria, I would rate this review as a 1, being least favorable. The review lacks length, depth, clarity, objectivity, personal experience, and helpfulness.

Overall, the interaction of animals with rocks can lead to: A: More small rocks: Animals can intensify the breakdown of rocks by adding force, pressure, or by scratching the rock surfaces with their claws, hooves, or body. Some animals, such as burrowing creatures, can indirectly cause rocks to break apart more quickly by loosening the soil around them, which can increase the rate of weathering and erosion. Moreover, the waste products of animals can contribute to the chemical breakdown of rocks. B: Less small rocks: In some cases, animals may have a protective effect on the rocks, for example, by covering them with nests or other structures, which could slow down the rate at which the rocks are broken down by other forces. Similarly, some animals help in the formation of soil, which can cover the rocks and protect them from harsh weather conditions. C: No effect: If an animal's contact with rocks is minimal or insignificant, there might be no noticeable effect on the process of rock weathering and erosion. In summary, the impact of animals on rocks' breakdown can vary depending on the specific interactions between the animals and the rocks. However, it is more likely to result in A) more small rocks due to their direct and indirect influences on the weathering and erosion processes."},{"instruction":"Leuralla Toy & Railway Museum lie 100 km west of Sydney in a small town in which New South Wales national park?","output":"Leuralla Toy & Railway Museum is located in the small town of Leura within the Blue Mountains region of New South Wales, approximately 100 km west of Sydney.

See options at the end You know that the drums will take longer than the flute to learn, so the pick from the following. [i] flute was simpler to study. [ii] drums was simpler to study.","output":"You know that the drums will take longer than the flute to learn, so the flute was simpler to study. Learning to play an instrument is a challenging yet rewarding endeavor. As with most skills, there are varying degrees of difficulty and time investment associated with each instrument. In this case, we are comparing the flute and the drums. While it is true that each instrument comes with its own unique set of challenges, the general consensus is that learning to play the flute is relatively quicker and less complex than learning to play the drums. The flute is a woodwind instrument that produces sound by virtue of the player blowing air across a hole (i.e., an aperture or embouchure) on the flute's body. To produce different pitches, the flutist must accurately cover and uncover a series of tone holes with their fingers. While this technique may take some time to master, it is widely regarded as being simpler than the techniques employed by drummers. On the other hand, the drums belong to the percussion family and involve striking various drumheads with sticks (or sometimes hands) to produce sound. A drum kit usually includes multiple drums, such as the snare, tom-toms, and bass drum, as well as other percussion instruments, like cymbals, hi-hats, and cowbells. To play the drums effectively, one must develop an in-depth understanding of rhythm, timing, and coordination, all the while controlling multiple limbs moving independently. This ultimately requires a greater amount of time and practice to build muscle memory and fine motor skills, as well as the capacity to multitask and maintain focus. In summary, the flute is generally regarded as being an easier instrument to learn compared to the drums. While mastering any musical instrument takes dedication and effort, the technical nature of drumming requires a more intricate set of skills and tends to have a steeper learning curve than playing the flute. Therefore, in the context provided, the flute was indeed the simpler instrument to study."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Question: how old is sybil vane in the picture of dorian gray I found the following answer on Google: The Picture of Dorian Gray is the only published novel by Oscar Wilde , appearing as the lead story in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine on 20 June 1890, printed as the July 1890 issue of this magazine.

During the 1980s, there was increasing pressure on both the Polish and Soviet governments to release documents related to the massacre. Polish academics tried to include Katyn in the agenda of the 1987 joint Polish-Soviet commission to investigate censored episodes of the Polish-Russian history. In 1989, Soviet scholars revealed Joseph Stalin had indeed ordered the massacre, and in 1990 Mikhail Gorbachev admitted the NKVD had executed the Poles and confirmed two other burial sites similar to the site at Katyn: Mednoye and Piatykhatky. On 30 October 1989, Gorbachev allowed a delegation of several hundred Poles, organized by the Polish association Families of Katyń Victims, to visit the Katyn memorial. This group included former U.S. national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski. A mass was held and banners hailing the Solidarity movement were laid. One mourner affixed a sign reading \\"NKVD\\" on the memorial, covering the word \\"Nazis\\" in the inscription such that it read \\"In memory of Polish officers killed by the NKVD in 1941.\\" Several visitors scaled the fence of a nearby KGB compound and left burning candles on the grounds.

A: The rose window is the earliest-known example above the West portal in France. Does the answer correctly answer the question Available options: A). yes B). no","output":"B). no The Arch of Constantine is a triumphal arch in Rome, built to commemorate Emperor Constantine's victory over Maxentius at the Battle of Milvian Bridge in 312 AD. Due to its historical significance and architectural style, the arch features three large portals. There are several reasons why three large portals were used in the construction of the Roman Arch of Constantine: 1. Architectural influence: The Arch of Constantine is an example of Roman architecture inspired by earlier arches in Rome, such as the Arch of Septimius Severus and the Arch of Titus. These arches also featured three portals, which became a standard design for triumphal arches in the Roman Empire. The use of three portals in the Arch of Constantine can be seen as the continuation of this tradition. 2. Symbolism: The three portals can be interpreted symbolically. The central and largest portal represents the main passage for triumphal processions, while the two smaller side portals signify subsidiary access routes. This design emphasizes the importance of the central portal and its symbolic association with the victorious emperor. 3. Structural stability: The use of three portals provided the arch with increased structural stability. The large central portal is flanked by two smaller ones, which act as buttresses, providing support to the arch's main structure and helping to distribute the weight of the monument. This design feature contributed to the arch's durability and longevity. 4. Aesthetic appeal: The three large portals also served as an aesthetic feature. Utilizing a symmetrical design, the arch portrays balance and harmony, which were important considerations in Roman architecture. Additionally, the portals are adorned with intricate reliefs and sculptures, highlighting the artistic achievement of the time. 5. Triumphal route: The arch was a focal point for triumphal processions, celebrating military successes. The central portal would have been wide enough to accommodate a chariot, while the side portals would have been used by pedestrians participating in the procession. This design helped enhance the overall spectacle of the event. In conclusion, the Roman Arch of Constantine features three large portals because of its architectural influence, the symbolic importance of the number three, structural stability considerations, aesthetic appeal, and triumphal procession requirements. This design not only ensured the arch's durability but also contributed to its purpose as a symbol of victory and power in the Roman Empire."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: The sweet taste of cold and wood smoke hung in the air. Marlin rode low in the saddle, his shoulders curled against the hungry wind. His hat was pulled down tight and his eyes didn't move as he passed the crude shacks at the edge of town. He tied his horse in front of the saloon, unwinding his long body as if a sudden movement might snap it. He turned down the collar of his greatcoat and checked to make sure his big Army Colt was loose in its holster. The saloon door was a single chunk of white pine, still oozing sap, and he had to put his shoulder to it to force it open. The long room inside was quiet, and not much warmer than the street. Clusters of people sat nursing coffee and drinks, talking quietly if they talked at all. Marlin spotted a few farmers the railroad had brought in from Europe: rounded hats, nervous eyes, skin as red as blood. At the far end of the room a half-dozen cowboys turned over cards with patient boredom.

When he turned to face the room they were all watching him. \\"I'm looking for a man named Kraamer,\\" Marlin said. \\"Anybody here know of him?\\" One of the cowboys turned casually and rang the spittoon with a stream of tobacco juice. Marlin knew the long, thin face from somewhere, the blond hair that fell limply to his shoulders. He smiled at Marlin and showed his brown-stained teeth. Marlin felt the lines in his own face, the gray in his hair, the chill in his bones. He was too old for this. He set a half dollar on the bar and started for the door. \\"Don't get in a huff,\\" the bartender said. Marlin looked back. \\"Kraamer lives about a mile west of town.

Answer choices: - Animal survival - in the frog family - fur and fat - scarce resources - hyperthyroidism - competition - food and shelter - expenditures The answer to this question is:","output":"- Animal survival - Competition - Scarce resources - Food and Shelter Let us break down each of these options in details: 1) Animal survival: Without natural predators, an animal species' survival rate would significantly increase. Predation is one of the chief pressures that keep wildlife populations in check. If a specific species has no natural predators, individual animals within that species live longer on average, and the species' overall population may rapidly grow. 2) Competition: As the population of a species with no natural predators increases, so does the competition among its members. There will be more individuals fighting for the same resources, like food, water, and territory. This may end up causing a surge in intra-species conflicts as the competition for resources gets tighter. 3) Scarce Resources: When there are no natural predators, the population of the species grows rapidly, creating resource scarcity. There could be overgrazing or overhunting, leading to depleting resources. Since there's more demand for food, water, and living space among the growing population of a predator-less species, these resources would become increasingly scarce. 4) Food and Shelter: Without predators to control their numbers, the particular animal species would face increased competition for food and shelter. This is because a rise in population directly translates into more mouths to feed and more individuals seeking shelter. In other words, demand for food and shelter will increase. In conclusion, though the absence of natural predators may seem immediately beneficial to an animal species, it creates rising problems related to survival, increasing competition, scarce resources, and high demand for food and shelter in the long run. This essentially causes an imbalance in the ecosystem that can render conditions unfavorable even for a predator-less species. The remaining answer choices - in the frog family, fur and fat, hyperthyroidism, and expenditures are less directly related to the lack of natural predators. They mainly refer to specific, narrower circumstances or entirely different contexts, thus they don't generally apply to the broad environmental repercussions caused by the absence of natural predators."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: Who told someone \\"I've never said I'm born again\\"? , can you please find it? Growing up in Hibbing, Minnesota, Dylan and his family were part of the area's small but close-knit Jewish community, and in May 1954 Dylan had his Bar Mitzvah. Around the time of his 30th birthday, in 1971, Dylan visited Israel, and also met Rabbi Meir Kahane, founder of the New York-based Jewish Defense League. Time magazine quoted him saying about Kahane, \\"He's a really sincere guy. He's really put it all together.\\" Subsequently, Dylan downplayed the extent of his contact with Kahane. During the late 1970s, Dylan converted to Christianity. In November 1978, guided by his friend Mary Alice Artes, Dylan made contact with the Vineyard School of Discipleship. Vineyard Pastor Kenn Gulliksen has recalled: \\"Larry Myers and Paul Emond went over to Bob's house and ministered to him. He responded by saying, 'Yes he did in fact want Christ in his life.' And he prayed that day and received the Lord.\\" From January to March 1979, Dylan attended the Vineyard Bible study classes in Reseda, California.By 1984, Dylan was distancing himself from the \\"born again\\" label. He told Kurt Loder of Rolling Stone magazine: \\"I've never said I'm born again. That's just a media term. I don't think I've been an agnostic. I've always thought there's a superior power, that this is not the real world and that there's a world to come.\\" In response to Loder's asking whether he belonged to any church or synagogue, Dylan laughingly replied, \\"Not really. Uh, the Church of the Poison Mind.\\"When it was asked of Dylan in a 1986 press conference in Australia \\"How much do you feel you are a vessel, a medium for a higher power, for God, that it [the music] flows through you... for Him?\\" Dylan replied, \\"Well I feel that way about most of the stuff that I do.\\"In 1997, he told David Gates of Newsweek: Here's the thing with me and the religious thing. This is the flat-out truth: I find the religiosity and philosophy in the music. I don't find it anywhere else. Songs like \\"Let Me Rest on a Peaceful Mountain\\" or \\"I Saw the Light\\"—that's my religion. I don't...

They belong to the category of white blood cells, also known as leukocytes, and are responsible for protecting the body against infections and diseases. Macrophages and dendritic cells are two different types of these immune cells, and each has distinct functions and characteristics. Macrophages are derived from monocytes, which are precursors for various types of immune system cells. These large cells can be found all over the body, where they act as the first line of defense against invading pathogens and assist in the removal of dead cells, cellular debris, and other harmful substances. Macrophages englob foreign particles and consume them through a process called phagocytosis. After they have devoured the invaders or debris, they display the antigens on their surface, signaling the presence of the foreign substance to the rest of the immune system. By doing this, macrophages help trigger adaptive immunity, a stronger and more specific response to a particular pathogen. Dendritic cells, on the other hand, are a distinct population of immune cells that primarily function as antigen-presenting cells (APCs). They possess long, branching structures called dendrites, which allow them to make contact with many other immune system cells simultaneously. Dendritic cells are located in tissues that have contact with the external environment, such as the skin and the mucosal tissue lining the nose, lungs, and intestines. Their primary function is to capture, process, and present antigens to T-lymphocytes (T-cells), a type of white blood cell that plays a key role in the adaptive immune response. By presenting antigens to T-cells, dendritic cells enable the immune system to recognize and respond to specific pathogens more effectively. Both macrophages and dendritic cells are considered professional phagocytes because phagocytosis is central to their immune functions. While they have distinct roles and properties, they both contribute to the body's defense mechanisms by detecting and processing harmful particles. By acting as a bridge between the innate and adaptive immune systems, these phagocytic cells help maintain the body's homeostasis and protect it from infection and disease."},{"instruction":"Guvernul de coaliție din Regatul Unit va anunța într-adevăr mâine reduceri brutale de aproximativ 83 miliarde de lire sterline care vor afecta fiecare persoană din țară în parte.

These satellite-based systems provide turn-by-turn directions to help people get to where they want to go. But, they can also cause a lot of problems, send you to the wrong place or leave you completely lost. Many times, the driver is to blame. Sometimes a GPS error is responsible. Most often, says Barry Brown, it is a combination of the two. We spoke to Mr. Brown by Skype. He told us about an incident involving a friend who had flown to an airport in the eastern United States. There he borrowed a GPS-equipped car to use during his stay. Barry Brown: \\"And they just plugged in an address and then set off to their destination. And, then it wasn't until they were driving for thirty minutes that they realized they actually put in a destination back on the West Coast where they lived. They actually put their home address in. So again, the GPS is kind of 'garbage in garbage out'.\\" Mister Brown says this is a common human error. But, he says, what makes the problem worse has to do with some of the shortcomings, or failures, of GPS equipment. Barry Brown: \\"One problem with a lot of the GPS units is they have a very small screen and they just tell you the next turn. Because they just give you the next turn, sometimes that means that it is not really giving you the overview that you would need to know that it's going to the wrong place.\\" Barry Brown formerly served as a professor with the University of California, San Diego.

As the statement informs that the housemate was bored with the activities of his fellow housemates and wanted to do something else early, let's analyze the given options: 1. Read a book: Reading a book can be a good way to pass the time and escape boredom, but it may not necessarily be something one would do early. 2. Sleep: Sleeping early could indeed be a viable choice. The housemate may have been disinterested in what others were doing and chose to go to sleep early to avoid boredom and possibly start the next day refreshed. 3. Travel: Traveling isn't something that one typically does early or on a spur-of-the-moment basis. It usually takes planning and time, so it is less likely a choice that the housemate would make in this context. 4. Play games: Playing games can be entertaining and might help pass the time, but it doesn't clearly indicate that the housemate chose to do it early. 5.

The practice of developing more in-depth answers allows for a more thorough understanding, and gives us the opportunity to delve into the topic at hand. Let's start by choosing an intriguing scientific fact: Did you know that an individual human brain has more switch connections, specifically synapses, than there are stars in our galaxy? It's an astonishing truth, which often surprises many, and helps in gaining a more profound respect for the human brain and its capabilities. Approximately, it's estimated that there are around 100 billion stars in the Milky Way. In staggering contrast, the human brain presents with nearly 100 trillion synaptic connections. The synapses are the tiny spaces across which nerve impulses pass from one neuron to the next. They play a crucial role in transmitting information within the brain, allowing different parts of the brain to communicate effectively and simultaneously contribute to our motor skills, memories, emotions, and overall cognition. On a deeper level, this fact also exhibits the human brain's immense computational power. Despite modern advancements in artificial intelligence and computing technology, the human brain remains unmatched in various aspects, notably including the ability to perform various complex tasks, process emotions, and exhibit creativity and consciousness. It's mind-boggling to realize that this intricate network of connections is working ceaselessly within our heads, orchestrating all our thoughts, actions, and experiences. It's fair to say that the human brain, dense with its myriad synapses, is one of the most complex and fascinating structures in the universe, manifesting an internal cosmos that's as vast and mysterious as the stars above. So, there you have it; not only a simple sentence with a fact but a comprehensive exploration of that fact. The human brain is truly a marvel, housing more synaptic connections than there are stars in our galaxy. This notion gives new meaning to the phrase 'we have a universe inside us'."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Pick one category for the following text.

One day, as a result of the suspension of a research project dealing with a dynamically mutating vaccine following the pattern of the eyesocket flu bacillus, they had absolutely nothing to do until the end of the day, because the boss didn't order them to wash test-tubes. They decided to play a game of hockey under the microscope. For a puck they used one of the millions of experimental bacillus, and one-arm pincettes, which as it happened also resembled hockey sticks, served as sticks. The bacillus was not happy with it at all. It wanted to rest after an exhausting task involving vaccine discouragement, and these whitecoats here planned to put it to work yet again. And this time the work was much more labor-intensive and even more exhausting than before, but the condition and health of the tired bacillus not as good as in the times of youth, about two hours ago. The scientists got excited. On a microscope slide they etched a hockey rink with laser, agreed on the rules, connected the microscope's camera to the big screen display and played until the morning. They had to change pucks several times, but that was fine, they had millions of them in stock. The next day they didn't have anything to do either and they continued to play. They even invited other colleagues and the popularity of the game was so huge they could afford to play it in a championship system. Soon, the games were joined by the guys from the car-repair garage next door. They were tough opponents and even tougher fans - they took from the lab and carried away with them several flasks and some equipment, as it turned out - to set up their own game station in pit number 5. One bacillus can play without getting overly exhausted for how long? - A few hours - not enough information - Ten minutes - One week A:","output":"To determine how long one bacillus can play without getting overly exhausted, we need to consider a few factors. Here is the step-by-step analysis: 1. First, we need to understand the physical characteristics and abilities of the bacillus. Since it's a microscopic organism, its energy levels, physical strength, and endurance are likely different from larger organisms. 2. Next, we need to assess the conditions under which the bacillus is playing hockey. The game is done under a microscope, with one-arm pincettes as hockey sticks and a laser-etched hockey rink. These factors might affect the bacillus's ability to move and interact with the puck. 3. Then, we need to determine the level of physical exertion the bacillus experiences during the game. Since playing hockey involves pushing a puck and competing with others, it can be tiring for any organism, including a bacillus. 4. Finally, we need to factor in the rest it has received before the game. In this case, the bacillus has just completed a task involving vaccine discouragement and is already tired. Judging from the given information, it's clear that a bacillus wouldn't be able to play for a week without getting overly exhausted. It's also unlikely that it could continue playing for a few hours since it's already tired. As we don't have precise information about the bacillus's ideal playing time, it's safe to conclude that we do not have enough information to accurately determine its playing capacity. Therefore, the answer is: B: Not enough information"},{"instruction":"How is \\"\\"Macedonia is one of the first non-EU countries to issue ID documents with such high-level security and quality,\\" Interior Minister Gordana Jankulovska said.

The wolverine is a stocky and muscular carnivorous mammal belonging to the Mustelidae family, which includes other animals such as weasels, otters, and badgers. It primarily inhabits the remote and cold regions of the Arctic and subarctic territories of the Northern Hemisphere, such as Alaska, Northern Canada, Siberia, and Scandinavia. Wolverines are known for their strength, ferocity, and adaptability, which help them survive in harsh environments. The various names given to this animal signify different aspects of its behavior and appearance. The name \\"carcajou\\" is of Algonquian origin and is derived from the North American Indigenous peoples' word for the animal. Its exact meaning is uncertain but is often associated with a wicked, evil, or mischievous spirit, highlighting the wolverine's resourcefulness and occasionally aggressive nature. The term is widely accepted across North America, primarily in Canada. \\"Glutton\\" is another name often used for the wolverine, stemming from its reputation for having an insatiable appetite and its opportunistic feeding habits. Indeed, the wolverine is known to consume large amounts of meat in a single meal, which enables it to survive in environments where food sources can be scarce. It mainly feeds on carrion, but it is also capable of hunting live prey such as small mammals, birds, and ungulates like caribou. Furthermore, the wolverine is known to drive away larger predators from their kills to scavenge the carcasses, demonstrating its strong, fearless nature. The name \\"skunk bear\\" was given to the wolverine due to a combination of its physical appearance and its distinct odor. Its dense fur coat is usually dark brown with a light stripe running from the side of its face to the base of its tail, making it resemble a skunk or a bear upon first glance. Additionally, wolverines secrete a musky odor from their anal scent glands, which they use for marking their territory and communicating with other wolverines. This odor is sometimes compared to the smell of a skunk, explaining the origin of \\"skunk bear\\". It is important to note that despite the various names used for the wolverine, it is a unique species within the Mustelidae family and not closely related to skunks or bears. Wolverines are powerful, adaptable creatures with incredible survival skills that have made them the subject of myths and legends among Indigenous peoples. Today, the wolverine is considered vulnerable or threatened in parts of its range due to habitat loss, climate change, and human activities, emphasizing the need for conservation efforts to protect this incredible animal and its natural habitat."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: \\"Pseudoneptis\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

The multiyear, peer-reviewed study, by the National Toxicology Program, found “low incidences” of two types of tumors in male rats that were exposed to the type of radio frequencies that are commonly emitted by cellphones. The tumors were gliomas, which are in the glial cells of the brain, and schwannomas of the heart. ... ||||| A study by the Department of Health and Human Services's National Toxicology Program discovered a link between cellphone radiation and two types of cancer. Reporting on its partial results so far, researchers found low incidences of heart and brain tumors in male rats. (Reuters) First things first: No one has proven that cellphones cause cancer. No one has proven that cellphones cause cancer. In fact, most research suggests otherwise! But you might not realize that, based on some news circulating Friday morning. Many publications, including the Wall Street Journal and Mother Jones, are trumpeting the results of a U.S. government study that links cellphones to tumor growth. But while the WSJ ran with the scary \\"Cellphone-Cancer Link Found in Government Study,\\" something like \\"Research That Hasn't Been Vetted Yet Shows Possible Link Between Cellphones and Cancer in Male Rats\\" might have been more appropriate. Less sexy! But also a lot less misleading. The study, released on Thursday after the results leaked online, is the result of a 25 million, multi-year effort from the National Toxicology Program (NTP). But it hasn't been peer reviewed — despite implications to the contrary by the WSJ — because it hasn't been formally submitted to a scientific journal and accepted for publication, during which time outside experts would have had the opportunity to pinpoint possible errors or exaggerations in the data and analysis. Several experts reportedly reviewed the work before it was announced, but the researchers have not yet made all of their data public. [Why it’s too early to get excited about this ‘unprecedented’ new cancer treatment] Ron Melnick, who was the lead investigator on the study until he retired in 2009, told STAT News that he was asked to review the data and found that they “indicated that there were increased tumor responses in the brain and the heart.\\" “Where people were saying there’s no risk, I think this ends that kind of statement,” he told the WSJ. The researchers exposed mice and rats to radio-frequencies commonly used by wireless electronics, at doses comparable to a human's typical exposure. Of the male rats dosed with radiation, the study authors report, 2 to 3 percent contracted gliomas, or tumors of the glial cells of the brain, and 6 to 7 percent percent developed schwannoma tumors in their hearts. None of the non-dosed rats developed any tumors. But STAT points out that it's unusual that none of these non-dosed rats randomly developed tumors on their own, and that the cancer rates in the dosed rats might actually be pretty similar to what you'd usually expect in a random rat population. [Addicted to your cellphone? These photos may make you uncomfortable.] There was no significant cancer uptick in the female rats dosed with radiation, and the researchers have not released their data on male or female mice. All of this is to say that it's way too soon to take these findings as a reason to toss your phone out the window. We've explained before that single studies are basically useless on their own (here's why) and that's still the case. This research will almost certainly inspire new projects that try to replicate the troubling results, and that's great. But when publications blast every contrarian new finding as a groundbreaking absolute truth, it makes the public less able to develop informed opinions. \\"There are arguments in the literature now that we are at the beginning of an epidemic of cancers,\\" Chris Portier, former associate director of the NTP, told Mother Jones. \\"There are arguments against that. It is not clear who is right. I have looked through it. It's a mixed bag.\\" Indeed, most studies examining the human population over time have concluded no association between cellphone use and increased rates of cancer. Some have argued that we just haven't been using cellphones long enough to see the ill-effects borne out, but the University of Sidney's Simon Chapman recently argued against this line of thinking. \\"That is not what we see with cancer,\\" he wrote in an op-ed for Quartz. \\"We see gradual rises moving toward peak incidence, which can be as late as 30 to 40 years (as with lung cancer and smoking).\\" And his research — and that produced by other scientists — has failed to show the start of such a trend. Maybe this study really is a major turning point in understanding of the risk of cell phone usage. But it's way too soon to tell. Read More: Got a question you think science can solve? Ask it here.

When researchers exposed rats to the radiofrequency radiation emitted by cellphones, they saw higher incidence of two types of cancer: malignant gliomas in the brain and schwannomas in the heart. The increased risk was relatively small, but if the findings translate to humans — still an unknown — it could have a large public health impact, given the widespread use of cellphones worldwide. The highly anticipated, 25 million study was conducted by the US National Toxicology Program. Partial results were released late Thursday, before full results were available, because of intense public interest, according to John Bucher, associate director of the NTP. advertisement “We feel that these findings are potentially of interest to the discussion over the cellphone safety issues,” Bucher said. “We felt it was important to get the word out.” However, “the results from our studies are far from definitive at this point,” he said. For human health, “this may have relevance. This may have no relevance.” The study had some head-scratching findings. For instance, it found that despite developing more tumors, male rats exposed to radiation for about nine hours every day also lived longer than a control group not exposed to radiation. In addition, it was unusual that no cancers occurred in the control group in this study. The incidence of malignant gliomas in male rats exposed to radiation — 2.2 to 3.3 percent — was within the range seen in nonexposed rats in previous studies, the authors said. Still, the authors said that the brain and heart tumors observed in rats exposed to the radiofrequency radiation are similar to malignancies seen in some epidemiological studies of cellphone use. They say their findings “appear to support” the World Health Organization’s classification of cellphones as a possible carcinogen. (That’s the same classification given to coffee and talcum powder.) Elisabeth Cardis, the lead investigator on the study that spurred that classification, said the NTP report provided “really quite novel findings.” “A lot of people felt that the issue was closed; there’s nothing there and you can just move on. The release of these results now … really raises the question about whether, in fact, there is a real effect,” she said. Population implications But other population-level studies in humans have found no increased risk, and the incidence of brain cancer has not risen in recent decades as cellphone use has exploded. “These data will probably raise the level of suspicion that there might be a problem. I didn’t see them as strong enough to say that there’s really a problem,” said Kenneth Foster, a bioengineering professor at the University of Pennsylvania who has studied radiation and health. “It’s really hard to know just how to interpret these results.” He noted in particular the finding that male rats exposed to radiation lived longer than those not exposed to radiation. Michael Lauer, deputy director of extramural research for the NIH, who provided comment to the NTP on the study, said that because of the small sample size, the study’s findings are suspect. “It is much more likely than not that this is not a true finding,” he said. As recently as Wednesday, the NIH said the study was still under review by unnamed additional experts. “It is important to note that previous human, observational data collected in earlier, large-scale population-based studies have found limited evidence of an increased risk for developing cancer from cellphone use,” the NIH said in a statement. The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report’s release, which followed a Wednesday report by the website Microwave News that disclosed what the researchers had found. The researchers have more data stockpiled that they haven’t reported. They say the rest of the results from the study will likely trickle out starting in late 2017. Potential firestorm The new study has the potential to start a firestorm. Until now, there have been conflicting results from other research about whether cellphones cause cancer, but the general takeaway from official authorities was that there is no definitive link — as the NIH statement reiterates. Dr. Jonathan Samet, director of the University of Southern California’s Institute for Global Health, said one of the big takeaways is “we really need a more serious research agenda.” “I think the public needs to know if there’s any risk,” he said. “I think this is something that needs to be taken as a need for further research and investigation. … We should not say there is no risk.” The findings could jeopardize the conventional wisdom at a time when the number of Americans who own a cellphone has exceeded 90 percent in recent years. “None of us expected them to find anything in this study. I’ve been quoted as saying it’s a total waste of money,” said David Carpenter, director of the Institute for Health and the Environment at the University of Albany. The results have been long anticipated. An NIH official told Congress in 2009 that the results would likely be released in 2014, but their release appeared to be prompted only by this week’s leak. “We’ve been waiting a long time for this study, far too long for this study,” said Joel Moskowitz, director and principal investigator at the Center for Family and Community Health at the University of California, Berkeley. Still, he added: “The debate will keep going on, I’m sure. This is not going to be the definitive study.” This story has been updated with new details about the study and previous research on cellphones. ||||| Federal scientists released partial findings Friday from a 25-million animal study that tested the possibility of links between cancer and chronic exposure to the type of radiation emitted from cell phones and wireless devices. The findings, which chronicle an unprecedented number of rodents subjected to a lifetime of electromagnetic radiation starting in utero, present some of the strongest evidence to date that such exposure is associated with the formation of rare cancers in at least two cell types in the brains and hearts of rats. The results, which were posted on a prepublication Web site run by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, are poised to reignite controversy about how such everyday exposure might affect human health. Researchers at the National Toxicology Program (NTP), a federal interagency group under the National Institutes of Health, led the study. They chronically exposed rodents to carefully calibrated radio-frequency (RF) radiation levels designed to roughly emulate what humans with heavy cell phone use or exposure could theoretically experience in their daily lives. The animals were placed in specially built chambers that dosed their whole bodies with varying amounts and types of this radiation for approximately nine hours per day throughout their two-year life spans. “This is by far—far and away—the most carefully done cell phone bioassay, a biological assessment. This is a classic study that is done for trying to understand cancers in humans,” says Christopher Portier, a retired head of the NTP who helped launch the study and still sometimes works for the federal government as a consultant scientist. “There will have to be a lot of work after this to assess if it causes problems in humans, but the fact that you can do it in rats will be a big issue. It actually has me concerned, and I’m an expert.” More than 90 percent of American adults use cell phones. Relatively little is known about their safety, however, because current exposure guidelines are based largely on knowledge about acute injury from thermal effects, not long-term, low-level exposure. The International Agency for Research on Cancer in 2011 classified RF radiation as a possible human carcinogen. But data from human studies has been “inconsistent,” the NTP has said on its website. Such studies are also hampered by the realities of testing in humans, such as recall bias—meaning cancer patients have to try to remember their cell phone use from years before, and how they held their handsets. Those data gaps prompted the NTP to engage in planning these new animal studies back in 2009. The researchers found that as the thousands of rats in the new study were exposed to greater intensities of RF radiation, more of them developed rare forms of brain and heart cancer that could not be easily explained away, exhibiting a direct dose–response relationship. Overall, the incidence of these rare tumors was still relatively low, which would be expected with rare tumors in general, but the incidence grew with greater levels of exposure to the radiation. Some of the rats had glioma—a tumor of the glial cells in the brain—or schwannoma of the heart. Furthering concern about the findings: In prior epidemiological studies of humans and cell phone exposure, both types of tumors have also cropped up as associations. In contrast, none of the control rats—those not exposed to the radiation—developed such tumors. But complicating matters was the fact that the findings were mixed across sexes: More such lesions were found in male rats than in female rats. The tumors in the male rats “are considered likely the result of whole-body exposure” to this radiation, the study authors wrote. And the data suggests the relationship was strongest between the RF exposure and the lesions in the heart, rather than the brain: Cardiac schwannomas were observed in male rats at all exposed groups, the authors note. But no “biologically significant effects were observed in the brain or heart of female rats regardless of modulation.” Based on these findings, Portier said that this is not just an associated finding—but that the relationship between radiation exposure and cancer is clear. “I would call it a causative study, absolutely. They controlled everything in the study. It’s [the cancer] because of the exposure.” Earlier studies had never found that this type of radiation was associated with the formation of these cancers in animals at all. But none of those studies followed as many animals, for as long or with the same larger intensity exposures, says Ron Melnick, a scientist who helped design the study and is now retired from the NTP. The new results, published on Web site bioRXiv, involved experiments on multiple groups of 90 rats. The study was designed to give scientists a better sense of the magnitude of exposure that would be associated with cancer in rodents. In the study rats were exposed to RF at 900 megahertz. There were three test groups with each species of each sex, tested at different radiation intensities (1.5, three and six watts per kilogram, or W/kg), and one control group. (The lowest-intensity level roughly approximates the levels allowed by U.S. cell phone companies, which is 1.6 W/kg.) “There are only 90 animals per group, so because there is a trend—and this is the purpose of these assays where you do multiple doses you extrapolate downward and calculate a risk for humans from those trends—so that information is useful. Probably what caused cancer at the high doses will cause cancer at lower doses but to a lesser degree,” Portier says. Rodents across all the test groups were chronically exposed to RF for approximately nine hours spread out over the course of the day. (Their entire bodies were exposed because people are exposed to such radiation beyond their heads, especially when they carry them or store them in their bras, says John Bucher, the associate director of the NTP.) During the study the rats were able to run around in their cages, and to eat and sleep as usual. The experiments also included both types of modulations emitted from today’s cell phones: Code Division Multiple Access and Global System for Mobile. (Modulations are the way the information is carried, so although the total radiation levels were roughly the same across both types, there were differences in how radiation is emitted from the antenna—either a higher exposure for a relatively short time or a lower exposure for a longer time.) Overall, there was no statistically significant difference between the number of tumors that developed in the animals exposed to CDMA versus GSM modulations. With both modulations and tumor types, there was also a statistically significant trend upward—meaning the incidence increased with more radiation exposure. Yet, drilling down into the data, in the male rats exposed to GSM-modulated RF radiation the number of brain tumors at all levels of exposure was not statistically different than in control males—those who had no exposure at all. “The trend here is important. The question is, ‘Should one be concerned?’ The answer is clearly ‘Yes.’ But it raises a number of questions that couldn’t be fully answered, ” says David Carpenter, a public health clinician and the director of the Institute for Health and the Environment at the University at Albany, S.U.N.Y. The findings are not definitive, and there were other confusing findings that scientists cannot explain—including that male rats exposed to the radiation seemed to live longer than those in the control group. “Overall we feel that the tumors are likely related to the exposures,” says Bucher, but such unanswered questions “have been the subject of very intense discussions here.” The NTP released the partial findings on Friday after an online publication called Microwave News reported them earlier this week. The program will still be putting out other results about the work in rats and additional findings about similar testing conducted in mice. The NIH told Scientific American in a statement, “This study in mice and rats is under review by additional experts. It is important to note that previous human, observational data collected in earlier, large-scale population-based studies have found limited evidence of an increased risk for developing cancer from cell phone use.” Still, the NTP was clearly expecting these findings to carry some serious weight: Ahead of Friday’s publication the NTP said on its Web site that the study (and prior work leading to these experiments) would “provide critical information regarding the safety of exposure to radio-frequency radiation and strengthen the science base for determining any potential health effects in humans.” In response to media queries, cell phone industry group CTIA–The Wireless Association issued a statement Friday saying that it and the wireless industry are still reviewing the study’s findings. “Numerous international and U.S. organizations including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, World Health Organization and American Cancer Society have determined that the already existing body of peer-reviewed and published studies shows that there are no established health effects from radio frequency signals used in cellphones,” the CTIA statement said. The Federal Communications Commission, which had been briefed by NIH officials, told Scientific American in a statement, “We are aware that the National Toxicology Program is studying this important issue. Scientific evidence always informs FCC rules on this matter. We will continue to follow all recommendations from federal health and safety experts including whether the FCC should modify its current policies and RF exposure limits.” This animal study was designed primarily to answer questions about cancer risks humans might experience when they use phones themselves, as opposed to smaller levels of exposure from wireless devices in the workplace or from living or working near cell phone towers. But it may have implications for those smaller levels as well, Portier says. The findings shocked some scientists who had been closely tracking the study. “I was surprised because I had thought it was a waste of money to continue to do animal research in this area. There had been so many studies before that had pretty consistently not shown elevations in cancer. In retrospect the reason for that is that nobody maintained a sufficient number of animals for a sufficient period of time to get results like this,” Carpenter says. Exposing rodents to radiation for this type of experiment is a tricky business. First, scientists need to be able to calculate exactly how much the rats should be exposed to relative to humans. Too much exposure would not be a good proxy for human use. And with finely calculated low-level exposure rates, scientists still need to be sure they are not going to heat the animals enough to kill them or to cause other health problems. (Subsequent work will be published on the animals’ temperatures.) The fact that scientists were able to expose animals to nonionizing radiation (like that emitted by cell phones) and those animals went on to develop tumors but that exposure did not significantly raise the animals' body temperatures was “important” to release, Bucher says. There are safety steps individuals can take, Carpenter says. Using the speakerphone, keeping the phone on the desk instead of on the body and using a wired headset whenever possible would help limit RF exposure. “We are certainly not going to go back to a pre-wireless age,” he says. But there are a number of ways to reduce exposure, particularly among sensitive populations.” Editor's Note (5/27/16, 2:10 P.M.): This story was updated to reflect information provided during an NTP press conference and a statement from an industry group. ||||| A giant U.S. study meant to help decide whether cellphones cause cancer is coming back with confusing results. A report on the study, conducted in rats and mice, is not finished yet. But advocates pushing for more research got wind of the partial findings and the U.S. National Toxicology Program has released them early. The findings are giving new life to the longstanding debate over whether cellphone use might cause cancer. They suggest that male rats exposed to constant, heavy doses of certain types of cellphone radiation develop brain and heart tumors. But female rats didn’t, and even the rats that developed tumors lived longer than rats not exposed to the radiation. The National Toxicology Program, part of the National Institutes of Health, is still analyzing the findings. But John Bucher, associate director of the program, said the initial findings were so significant that the agency decided to release them. \\"We felt it was important to get that word out,\\" Bucher told reporters on a telephone briefing. \\"Overall, we feel that the tumors are likely to be related to the exposures.\\" What they do not show is whether humans are at any risk from using cellphones, or whether using a headset or keeping them away from the head and body might make a difference. \\"It may well be that current cellphone use is safe.\\" \\"It may well be that current cellphone use is safe.\\" Dr.Otis Brawley, chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, says it's good science and will change the way people think about cellphones and cancer risk. \\"The findings are unexpected; we wouldn’t reasonably expect non-ionizing radiation to cause these tumors,\\" he said. \\"This is a striking example of why serious study is so important in evaluating cancer risk. It’s interesting to note that early studies on the link between lung cancer and smoking had similar resistance, since theoretical arguments at the time suggested that there could not be a link.\\" Brain tumors are rare. About 23,770 malignant tumors of the brain or spinal cord will be diagnosed this year, according to the American Cancer Society, and 16,000 people will die from them. And there has not been an increase in rates since the 1990s, when cellphones started to be used. \\"It is very reassuring in fact that there has been no dramatic increase. It may well be that current cellphone use is safe,\\" Bucher said. Bucher said he has not changed his own cellphone habits because of the findings. The partial report covers what the researchers considered the most worrying findings. “The occurrences of two tumor types in male Harlan Sprague Dawley rats exposed to RFR (radiofrequency radiation), malignant gliomas in the brain and schwannomas of the heart, were considered of particular interest, and are the subject of this report,” the team writes in its report. Sprague Dawley rats are a common type of lab rat. “These findings appear to support the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) conclusions regarding the possible carcinogenic potential of RFR.” IARC, the cancer arm of the World Health Organization, said in 2011 it was possible the devices might cause cancer and recommended further study. Related: Questions About Cellphone Use and Cancer Cellphones are used by billions of people around the world — 92 percent of American adults own a cellphone, according to Pew Research Center. Children as young as toddlers carry and use the devices for hours on end, so any hint that they might somehow cause cancer would be of enormous concern. Previous studies have had very mixed results. One study found that holding a mobile phone next to the head might warm up brain cells, but there was not any clear consequence of that. Studies on rats are considered of only partial reliability, because lab rats have their own unpredictable vulnerabilities to cancer. For the experiment, a contract lab in Chicago generated cellphone signals, both in the GSM and CDMA radio systems — two major systems used by cellphone providers. They directed the signals into cages with pregnant rats, and then kept the signals focused on the rat pups for 10 minutes on, 10 minutes off, nine hours a day, as they grew for two years. So called control rats were raised nearby without radiation exposure. There was little effect on the newborn rats, except the pups appeared to be very slightly lighter when the mothers were exposed to the signals. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"A new US government study has discovered a link between cellphones and cancer.

(Quick, what does GoDaddy.com sell?)Still, thanks to Fox's guidelines, viewers of this Sunday's Super Bowl matchup between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Green Bay Packers won't see an ad for an online dating service aimed at spouses looking to have affairs. Or the dueling bobbleheads spot from the conservative comedy site JesusHatesObama.com, in which an angry Jesus doll pushes a smiling Obama doll into a fish bowl. And Fox also put the kibosh on an entry into the annual Pepsi-and-Doritos ad competition that envisioned the snack chip and soft drink as the bread and wine of the Eucharist . Not!So Larry Taunton, head of the Fixed Point Foundation , an Alabama-based organization that seeks to defend Christianity in the public square, figured he was on solid ground with his professionally produced commercial featuring a group of friends drinking beer, eating chips and watching football -- and asking each other what the phrase \\"John 3:16\\" written in a player's eye black means. That was it.\\"We thought in this case, let's put forward something that is understated, that feels secular,\\" Taunton said. Click play to watch video:It was not to be. The Fox Broadcasting Company rejected the commercial, which would have brought in 3 million -- the going rate for a half-minute ad this year -- because under company policy, it \\"does not accept advertising from religious organizations for the purpose of advancing particular beliefs or practices.\\"\\"The Fixed Point Foundation was provided with our guidelines prior to their submission of storyboards for our review,\\" the company said in a statement. \\"Upon examination, the advertising submitted clearly delivers a religious message and as a result has been rejected.\\"It's hard to argue with Fox's point about the spot's religious content. The verse is one in which Jesus tells his listeners, \\"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.\\"If Fox execs hadn't understood the ad's religious message, then Taunton and Fixed Point would have to go back to the editing suite in order to produce something that would do what any good ad should -- communicate clearly. (The commercial cost Fixed Point just 50,000 to make, about a tenth of what such ads normally cost, and two Fox affiliates, one in Alabama and the Fox station in Washington -- of all places -- said they'll air it during the Super Bowl. Taunton said that if Fox had OK'd the ad for national distribution, he felt sure he could have raised the money to cover the 3 million broadcast fee.)Of course, as always happens when an ad is rejected, the media coverage generated by the controversy is probably more effective P.R. than anything money could buy.Taunton was also quick to exonerate Fox Broadcasting from blame for its decision.\\"They were very courteous and gracious,\\" Taunton stressed. \\"Fox Sports isn't the enemy. We aren't out to demonize them. We think this is more of a cultural issue than it is a Fox Sports issue. Their solution was just to run from it because they think this is something that would offend their viewership. I think we have become so utterly sensitive and politically correct that the result is we end up doing absurd things like this.\\"A more likely explanation is that Fox, like all broadcasters, doesn't want too much controversy, or rather the wrong kind of controversy -- think of Janet Jackson's infamous \\"wardrobe malfunction\\" from the 2004 Super Bowl. CBS, which broadcast last year's Super Bowl, found itself on the defensive for reversing its policy against advocacy ads and allowing a pro-life spot by Heisman-winning quarterback and born-again Christian Tim Tebow -- though the commercial wound up being so subtle it's hard to know if anyone got the anti-abortion message.Moreover, in the case of the Fixed Point Foundation's ad, it's hard to see how a commercial whose only religious reference is a brief shot of a player's eye black and \\"John 3:16\\" could offend an audience of sports fans.Evangelical Christians who consider the verse a kind of motto for their faith have been holding up signs displaying the verse at televised sporting events for years, starting in the 1970s with the \\"Rainbow Man,\\" a.k.a. Rollen Stewart, who wore a distinctive, multi-hued afro wig to draw attention to his placard.Taunton acknowledged that John 3:16 is by now part of the scenery in sports, and especially football, which has a reputation as a culturally conservative sport. There are on-field prayer circles after games, players thanking Jesus after every score, and big-time, publicly professing Christians like Kurt Warner, Drew Brees and Sam Bradford are commonplace.But Taunton believes the John 3:16-themed ad was needed for that very reason.\\"Our thought was this: We're not trying to import Christianity into a sport or into part of the culture where it isn't,\\" he said. \\"We're trying to draw people's attention to the fact that it's already there . . . John 3:16 has become so ubiquitous in the game that people sort of become numb to it.\\"\\"It's sort of like seeing the Nike swoosh,\\" he added. \\"How many people know what that means?\\" (Good question. Answer: it apparently represents the wing of Nike, the Greek goddess of victory. But that's not the kind of religious reference to get Michael Jordan ads barred from the airwaves.)Taunton also noted that commercials airing during NFL games for the new exorcism movie, \\"The Rite,\\" are loaded with religious imagery, though the intent seems to scare rather than convert viewers.Indeed, it is religion itself, with its potential to incite furious reactions and its association with political divisions, that really seems to give broadcasters a fright.Taunton agrees, which is why he said the ad was apolitical by design and \\"not in your face\\" with the faith message.The ad's rejection, he said, sends the message that \\"religion, and more specifically Christianity, is increasingly being treated like smoking -- you can only do it in designated areas. You may not bring it into the public space.\\"As a sports fan, Taunton said he'd be happy to have some serious competition for the best religion-themed Super Bowl ad. It would beat another overrated Doritos spot or even race car driver Danica Patrick baring skin for a GoDaddy commercial.\\"If the Hindus want to put out an ad, I'm all for it,\\" Taunton said. \\"Muslims?

The ad, featuring friends discussing the biblical verse \\"John 3:16\\" during a football game, was deemed by Fox to be advancing particular religious beliefs, which is against their policy. Despite the fact the Fox affiliates in Alabama and Washington will air the ad, this decision is reflective of a growing sensitivity and political correctness in broadcasting. The Fixed Point Foundation respects Fox's decision but believes this is highlighting a cultural issue of treating religion as a confined, private practice. The foundation clarifies that the ad was not asserting Christianity into the culture but pointing out its existing presence."},{"instruction":"What's the most logical way to complete this passage? By Matt Barlow Follow @@Matt_Barlow_DM The serene setting has echoes of England’s remote base in South Africa, isolated in the red-dirt countryside of a state mined for precious metals and gemstones. Yet behind the iron gates of the Uruguayan camp in Sete Lagoas, there has been great turmoil and upheaval and an inquest into Saturday’s humbling 3-1 defeat at the hands of Costa Rica. ‘We got really heated up after the game,’ said captain Diego Lugano and although the fury has since subsided it has been replaced by paranoia ahead of Thursday’s date with England. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch All Star XI: Luis Suarez High stakes: Uruguay defender Lugano described Thursday's game against","output":"England as 'life or death' for the South American side. The loss to Costa Rica has raised many questions about the team's tactics, fitness, and overall performance, with players and staff under immense pressure to deliver a win against Roy Hodgson's men. Head coach Óscar Tabárez and his support staff have been working round the clock, analyzing footage, devising new strategies, and attempting to exploit any weaknesses in the English squad. The usually tight-knit Uruguayan team have found themselves tackling internal divisions as well, with rumors of disagreements between players over tactics and the role of star striker Luis Suarez, whose fitness levels have been a major talking point in the press and among fans. Despite assurances from the Liverpool forward and the coaching staff, doubts over Suarez’s readiness for the tournament persist, and some players have reportedly questioned the wisdom of relying too heavily upon him. As the match day approaches, the atmosphere in the camp has evolved from one of introspection to a more focused, determined state of mind. Discussions among players and staff have been intense, but productive, with the collective effort now directed at making the necessary adjustments to ensure their World Cup dreams do not end in bitter disappointment. Team psychologist Dr. Alberto Pan has been a vital source of support during these trying times, helping the players to regain their confidence and shed the negativity that has gripped the camp since their loss to Costa Rica. Dr. Pan has been working closely with the team to help them maintain their mental equilibrium and fortify their resilience, in the belief that a united and composed mindset will prove crucial in resisting the pressure of the must-win match against England. Meanwhile, back home in Uruguay, the nation has rallied around their team, with fans and media alike offering unwavering support and encouragement. From families gathered around television sets to banners adorning the streets, Uruguayans have demonstrated their belief in their heroes and their conviction that the team has the talent and spirit to overcome their current setbacks and progress to the knockout stages. It is now a matter of whether this sense of national pride and unity can translate onto the field, as Uruguay face the daunting prospect of taking on an England team equally eager to prove their worth after their own opening match defeat. A high-stakes encounter with no room for error is set to unfold in Sete Lagoas, where both teams will be driven by the desperate determination to salvage their World Cup hopes. This could well prove to be a turning point for both nations – which way that turn takes remains to be seen."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"Therefore money has been put into reserve pending that interinstitutional call for tender.\\" to German?","output":"To translate the sentence \\"Therefore money has been put into reserve pending that interinstitutional call for tender.\\" into German, I'll take into account the grammar rules, vocabulary, and sentence structure of the German language. The translation would be: \\"Daher wurde Geld zur Rücklage gelegt, in Erwartung dieser interinstitutionellen Ausschreibung.\\" Here's my reasoning for the translation chosen: 1. \\"Therefore\\" translates to \\"Daher\\". This is a common way to introduce the consequence or result of something in German. 2. \\"money has been put into reserve\\" translates to \\"Geld wurde zur Rücklage gelegt.\\" In German, the verb typically goes to the end of the phrase when using passive voice, hence 'wurde' is placed before 'gelegt'. 3. \\"pending\\" can be translated to \\"in Erwartung\\". It signifies the concept of waiting for something to happen. 4. \\"that interinstitutional call for tender\\" translates to \\"dieser interinstitutionellen Ausschreibung\\". In this case, \\"dieser\\" is used because \\"Ausschreibung\\" is a feminine noun in German, and \\"interinstitutionellen\\" agrees with \\"Ausschreibung\\" in gender and case. This translation preserves the meaning of the original sentence in German."},{"instruction":"Question: Q: Besides the endocrine system, what other system exerts control over all the organ systems of the body?

The visual system is processing what is seen on the page; the motor system controls your eye movements and the turn of the pages (or click of the mouse); the prefrontal cortex maintains attention. Even fundamental functions, like breathing and regulation of body temperature, are controlled by the nervous system. The nervous system is one of two systems that exert control over all the organ systems of the body; the other is the endocrine system. The nervous system’s control is much more specific and rapid than the hormonal system. It communicates signals through cells and the tiny gaps between them rather than through the circulatory system as in the endocrine system. It uses a combination of chemical and electrochemical signals, rather than purely chemical signals used by the endocrine system to cover long distances quickly. The nervous system acquires information from sensory organs, processes it and then may initiate a response either through motor function, leading to movement, or in a change in the organism’s physiological state. Nervous systems throughout the animal kingdom vary in structure and complexity. Some organisms, like sea sponges, lack a true nervous system. Others, like jellyfish, lack a true brain and instead have a system of separate but connected nerve cells (neurons) called a “nerve net. ” Flatworms have both a central nervous system (CNS), made up of a ganglion (clusters of connected neurons) and two nerve cords, and a peripheral nervous system (PNS) containing a system of nerves that extend throughout the body.

Although he was born in Amsterdam, the family lived in the village of Slikkerveer. In 1943 the family moved to The Hague, the location of the German headquarters in the Netherlands during World War II. The Verhoeven house was near a German military base with V1 and V2-rocket launchers, which was repeatedly bombed by allied forces. After about 20 years of working and living in the United States, Verhoeven returned to the Netherlands for the shooting of a new film. Together with his screenwriter Gerard Soeteman, Verhoeven made Black Book (2006). The director was hailed by the host of the Netherlands Film Festival with the words \\"The return of a hero.\\" Black Book eventually won six Golden Calves at this festival, including Best Director. When the shooting of Black Book was delayed due to financial issues, there was speculation about a new production. The film Beast of Bataan had been announced, but once the shooting for Black Book resumed, the other film was never realized. Since his return to European cinema in 2006 with Black Book, Verhoeven has been connected to a large number of projects, but for the moment none of them has come to fruition. Some of those titles were produced with other directors at the helm, such as The Paperboy. Finally, in a rather unexpected twist, Verhoeven followed Black Book by directing a movie in French: Elle, an adaptation of a novel by Philippe Djian. The film by Verhoeven, a psycho-thriller where Isabelle Huppert plays a rape victim, was selected in the Official Competition at the Cannes International Film Festival, where it obtained very favourable reviews. Verhoeven has been a knight in the Order of the Netherlands Lion since 2007. In December 2016 it was announced that Verhoeven would be the President of the Jury for the 67th Berlin International Film Festival, scheduled to take place in February 2017. In April 2017 his next French film titled Blessed Virgin was announced, to start filming in August of the same year. It is a biographical film about the life of Benedetta Carlini, which will be portrayed by Elle co-star Virginie Efira, and is an adaptation of the non-fiction book Immodest Acts - The life of a lesbian nun in Renaissance Italy by Judith C.

Follow @@SamiMokbel81_DM. Click here for fourth round ties in the Capital One Cup. Don't worry Andre Schurrle, you have scored in a World Cup semi-final. That memory should keep the Germany forward sane when he reflects on all the opportunities he wasted against Bolton last night. The more he tried, the more he looked to the heavens. The final shot count for Schurrle was 12, four times as many as Bolton managed during the entire 90 minutes. Thankfully for the 23-year-old, Kurt Zouma and Oscar were more accurate as the Blues booked a Capital One Cup last-16 trip to League Two Shrewsbury. It should have been a much smoother ride for the west London club, though. Kurt Zouma slammed home the first goal on his Chelsea debut against Bolton in Capital One Cup. Chelsea's French defender Zouma pounced to open the scoring against Bolton Wanderers at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea (4-2-3-1): Cech 6; Azpilicueta 6.5, Zouma 7, Cahill 6.5, Luis 7; Mikel 6.5, Ake 7 (Matic 90); Salah 7 (Hazard 79), Oscar 7, Schurrle 6.5; Remy 6 (Drogba 73).

Subs: Clayton, McNaughton, Ream, Kenny. Booked: Pratley. Manager: Freedman 6. Referee: Graham Scott (Oxfordshire) - 6. ‘Andre’s performance reflected the mentality of the team,’ said Steve Holland, Chelsea’s assistant coach. ‘Not much more than two months ago he was playing in the World Cup final, tonight he was playing in the Capital One Cup. He showed a real committed performance — full of drive all night. He looked our most likely source throughout the game. He was an example of what was best about our performance. ‘A combination of some missed chances, a bit of bad luck and some very good goalkeeping meant that we were still at the limit right at the end of the game.’ Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho fielded an understrength side, giving goalkeeper Petr Cech his first appearance of the season. Mourinho also gave Loic Remy a full debut after his move from Queens Park Rangers, while there were starts for youngsters Nathan Ake and Kurt Zouma. Bolton manager Dougie Freedman also made five changes from the side that started their Championship defeat by Wolves on Saturday. Chelsea began as if they meant business, possibly prompted by Mourinho’s wardrobe choice — the Portuguese opting for a suit rather than the tracksuit he favoured during this tournament last season. Or perhaps it was the fact Freedman kept him waiting for the customary pre-match handshake. Whatever it was, Chelsea came flying out the blocks and could have been four up inside 17 minutes. Chelsea's Kurt Zouma, right, celebrates scoring the opening goal against Bolton Wanderers at Stamford Bridge. Bolton Wanderers' Matt Mills (centre hidden) equalised with a powerful header against Chelsea. 11 - Crystal Palace, Hull, Tottenham and West Brom. 9 - Brighton, Chelsea, Nottingham Forest. 6 - Newcastle. 5 - Bolton, Manchester City. 4 - Sheffield Wednesday. 3 - Burton Albion. Schurrle had enough chances to have scored a hat-trick before the game was a quarter of an hour old. He was denied twice inside the first five minutes; his free-kick tipped wide by Andy Lonergan before a header was cleared off the line by Matt Mills. Mills again denied Schurrle, this time with a well-timed challenge as the World Cup winner met Cesar Azpilicueta’s cross after 14 minutes. Then Remy fluffed a chance to break the deadlock with a poor header before Schurrle squandered another chance. He was getting closer, though, his 20-yard free-kick being tipped on to the bar by Lonergan. The goal finally arrived in the 25th minute, but from an unlikely source. Bolton defender Dorian Dervite blocked Gary Cahill’s header from Mohamed Salah’s corner only for the ball to drop to Zouma and the French centre back slammed home his first goal for the club. Relief swept through the crowd but seven minutes later Bolton snatched a shock equaliser. Liam Feeney’s deep free-kick looked more hopeful than accurate but Mills rose above Jon Obi Mikel to head home from 14 yards. The goal did not alter the flow of the game, however, as Chelsea — and Schurrle, looked to regain the lead. Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech was beaten by Matt Mills' thumping header for Bolton in the first half. Bolton celebrate Mills' equaliser against Chelsea in Capital One Cup third round tie at Stamford Bridge. The German missed two more chances before Ake thumped a long-range drive well over the bar just before the break. Schurrle, inevitably, was involved in their first chance of the second half but Oscar’s header from the German’s free-kick was well saved by the over-worked Lonergan in the 51st minute. Five minutes later, Chelsea made the vital breakthrough as Oscar thumped a 25-yard drive past Lonergan after good work by Remy. As if to rub salt into Schurrle’s wounds, he then saw his 80th-minute drive from 15 yards tipped on to a post by Lonergan, who gratefully held on to the loose ball.

How do I prepare for the IEO exam? How do I prepare for IEO exam?","output":"Yes, both questions essentially have the same meaning. They both ask about the preparation process for the International English Olympiad (IEO) exam. Although the questions vary slightly in their wording, they are both inquiring about the same topic. Now let's discuss how to prepare for the IEO exam in detail. 1. Understand the exam pattern and syllabus: The first step in preparing for the IEO exam is to familiarize yourself with the exam pattern and the syllabus. The IEO exam primarily assesses your proficiency in the English language, emphasizing grammar, vocabulary, reading comprehension, verbal and written expression, and spoken English. 2. Gather the necessary study materials: Collect relevant study materials for IEO preparation. This may include school textbooks, English grammar and vocabulary books, and IEO-specific workbooks or guidebooks. Referring to the previous years' question papers and sample papers is also beneficial for understanding the types of questions asked in the exam. 3. Create a study schedule: Design a study plan that allows you to allocate time for each aspect of the IEO syllabus. Ensure that you regularly revise all topics, dedicate more time to your weak areas, and maintain a balance between learning new concepts and practicing questions. Consistency in your study schedule is key to performing well in the IEO exam. 4. Focus on grammar and vocabulary: Grammar and vocabulary are crucial components of the IEO exam. To develop a strong foundation, study the rules of grammar, practice sentence construction, and work on punctuation and spelling. Additionally, expand your vocabulary by learning new words, their meanings, synonyms, and antonyms. Use flashcards, word quizzes, or mnemonic devices to aid your learning. 5. Develop reading and writing skills: Reading comprehension and the ability to express ideas coherently are also essential for the IEO exam. Regularly reading a variety of texts, such as newspapers, magazines, and novels, can help improve your reading speed, comprehension, and analytical skills. Additionally, practice writing essays, summaries, and creative pieces to enhance your written expression. 6. Take practice tests and evaluate your performance: Solve IEO sample papers, mock tests, and previous years' question papers under timed conditions regularly. This not only helps gauge your understanding of the subject matter but also improves your time management skills during the exam. After completing each test, critically assess your answers, identify your weak areas, and work on them. 7. Get help when needed: Seek support from teachers, tutors, or peers if you face difficulties in understanding certain concepts or need guidance. Participate in study groups, attend workshops, or connect with online communities to get additional support. 8. Practice spoken English: Get comfortable speaking in English with friends, family, or even yourself. Participate in group discussions, debates, and presentations in English. This will not only improve your spoken English skills but also help build your confidence in using the language. 9. Stay motivated and maintain a positive attitude: Maintaining a positive mindset and staying motivated is essential throughout your IEO preparation. Set achievable goals, track your progress, and reward yourself for your accomplishments to stay encouraged. 10. Revise and relax before the exam: Dedicate sufficient time for revision before the IEO exam.

(Dec. 14) AP Tavis Smiley in 2014. (Photo: Mark Lennihan, AP) In Tavis Smiley's first live interview since PBS suspended his late-night talk show over \\"multiple, credible allegations\\" of misconduct, the former host appeared on Good Morning America Monday, denying all wrongdoing and arguing the claims are untrue. And PBS was having none of it. Speaking to ABC News correspondent Paula Faris, Smiley admitted to engaging in workplace relationships, claiming they were consensual. \\"I certainly understand people who have the viewpoint that any consensual relationship in the workplace is wrong,\\" Smiley said. \\"But there are also other points of view on this. Let me be clear: I own my company, PBS distributes my content. In our employee handbook, while we do not encourage office relationships, we do not forbid them, either. And we don't forbid them because I don't know where your heart is going to lead you. I don't know who you're going to hang out with, or date, or fall in love with. (There may be) millions of Americans watching right now who met their spouse at work.\\" Smiley also denied fostering a verbally abusive workplace environment, saying, \\"I have an intense environment. ... Some of the most intense places in our business are in control rooms around this country, that's not for everyone, so it might be that the environment wasn't good for you. ... I'm not an angry black man, and this notion of a hostile environment just doesn't fit.\\" Smiley hosted Tavis Smiley, a half-hour interview program that premiered in 2004 and aired weeknights on PBS stations until it was suspended on Dec. 13. He confirmed to Faris that one woman with whom he engaged in a sexual relationship is still employed on his staff, but claimed that he never gave any of his workplace sexual partners preferential treatment, nor retaliated against them in any way. Responding to allegations that he sent lewd messages or commented inappropriately on women's' bodies, Smiley said he \\"has no idea\\" about the basis of the claims. \\"I've never sent lewd messages to anyone. In consensual relationships, we use text messages to communicate,\\" he told Faris. \\"But I've never done that to an employee, ever.\\" Tavis Smiley pushes back against allegations of sexual misconduct: “I have never groped, I have never coerced, I have never exposed myself inappropriately…I celebrate and applaud these women who’ve had the courage to come out and tell their truth.” pic.twitter.com/VNuxgQczrS — Good Morning America (@GMA) December 18, 2017 When asked about his former network, Smiley claimed that PBS \\"only agreed to talk to me after weeks of investigation they didn't tell me about,\\" after he threatened to sue. Only under a threat of a lawsuit did they agree to sit down and talk to me,\\" Smiley said. \\"When they did ... they never told me who the accuser was, what the allegations were, never allowed me to provide any information. They didn't give me due process.\\" In a strongly-worded rebuttal, a PBS spokesperson responded that Smiley \\"needs to get his story straight,\\" arguing the journalist (who has contributed op-ed pieces to USA TODAY and whose status is currently under review) has been inconsistent as to the number of employees with whom he's had sexual contact and questioning the sincerity of his support for the women who came forward when his company required them to sign non-disclosure agreements. \\"Witnesses who have bravely come forward to speak with the independent investigators retained by PBS report a fear of retribution for speaking out,\\" the network said, noting, \\"Additional allegations are continuing to come to light since last week’s announcement.\\" The statement continued, \\"PBS stands by the integrity of its investigation, which has been conducted by an outside firm with expertise in such matters. Mr. Smiley’s own words today coupled with the information discovered during the investigation confirms PBS’ decision to indefinitely suspend the distribution of Tavis Smiley.\\" Other fallout Meanwhile, Mills Entertainment announced Friday it is pulling out of backing a nationwide 40-city tour of Death of a King: A Live Theatrical Experience, a show based on Smiley's 2014 book focusing on the last year in the life of Martin Luther King Jr. Mills' statement said that \\"in light of the recent allegations\\" it will be \\"suspending our relationship with\\" Smiley. \\"We take seriously the allegations,\\" the statement added according to the Associated Press and The New York Times. Smiley is the second PBS late-night host to face allegations of sexual misconduct, following the derailing of Charlie Rose's career on PBS and CBS.

Whenever I see this question I want to scream at the person 'no, don't do it. It is a waste of your time and money'...but I don't. I don't want to cause a scene, or start a barrage of backlash from people claiming that it worked for them. Instead, I will present the facts and let you decide for yourself if it is worth doing. Before I start, I just want to clarify that when I am referring to detox I mean the ones that you buy where you have to take a million various tablets a day and stick to a very restricted diet. If you are going to 'detox' by simply eating healthily then all power to you. That will most definitely do wonders for your body. These detox kits won't. They will produce results; however, the results will be temporary. Why detoxes don't work Firstly, the companies who are marketing the detoxes talk about removing toxins that have built up in the body. So, what are these toxins? They don't say. They remain vague and just leave you to let your imagination run wild. Do they mean chemicals, waste products from digestion, bacteria? I guess I imagined it as the waste products from digestion but it would be interesting to hear what other people perceive as the 'toxins' in their bodies. I read an interesting article on British Beauty Blogger about how Veet gave Chinese women a problem they never had. Chinese women naturally have very little body hair so hair removal products have always been poor sellers. Therefore, Reckitt Benckiser (who own Veet) devised a marketing campaign to convince Chinese that any body hair is unsightly and released ads equating hair free skin with health, confidence and \\"shining glory\\" (the full marketing concept can be read here). I feel that this is the same as what is happening in regards to detoxes. The marketers of the products have convinced us that our bodies are full of these so called 'toxins', from our unhealthy lifestyles, that need to be removed with a detox. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: How did Veet convince Chinese women that any body hair was unsightly?

He had a brother, Bruce, who was seven years younger. His interest in rock and roll music began at age ten when he met Elvis Presley. In the summer of 1961, his uncle was working on the set of Presley's film Follow That Dream, in nearby Ocala, and invited Petty to watch the shoot. Context: Petty's first appearance in film took place in 1978, when he had a cameo in FM. He later had a small part in 1987's Made in Heaven and appeared in several episodes of It's Garry Shandling's Show between 1987 and 1990, playing himself as one of Garry Shandling's neighbors. Petty was also featured in Shandling's other show, The Larry Sanders Show, as one of the Story within a story final guests. In the episode, Petty gets bumped from the show and nearly comes to blows with Greg Kinnear. Petty appeared in the 1997 film The Postman, directed by and starring Kevin Costner, as the Bridge City Mayor (from the dialogue it is implied that he is playing a future history version of himself). In 2002, he appeared on The Simpsons in the episode \\"How I Spent My Strummer Vacation\\", along with Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Lenny Kravitz, Elvis Costello, and Brian Setzer. In it, Petty spoofed himself as a tutor to Homer Simpson on the art of lyric writing, composing a brief song about a drunk girl driving down the road while concerned with the state of public schools. Later in the episode, he loses a toe during a riot. Petty had a recurring role as the voice of Elroy \\"Lucky\\" Kleinschmidt in the animated comedy series King of the Hill from 2004 to 2009. In 2010, Petty made a five-second cameo appearance with comedian Andy Samberg in a musical video titled \\"Great Day\\" featured on the bonus DVD as part of The Lonely Island's new album Turtleneck & Chain.

This carrier has been reported as the most reliable when it comes to making phone calls according to the study conducted by Metrico Wireless. While making a decision, it's worth considering that although fast data speed is quite an attractive feature with AT&T, and Sprint's unlimited data is a significant plus, if your primary requirement is call reliability, then Verizon outweighs the other two carriers based on the results obtained from the comprehensive tests Metrico conducted. This conclusion is based on the study that involved 6,000 voice calls, 8,000 data download/upload tests comprising both moving and stationary stages, and over 21,000 web page downloads. The evaluation carried out was meticulous and the findings quite revealing. Interestingly, each of the carriers had individual strengths; AT&T posted the fastest data speed results, Sprint made an impression with its slow but unlimited data plan, and Verizon was recognized for being the most reliable for voice calls. Indeed, each of these key features will cater to the different needs of mobile users. Some may prioritize data speed, especially in this digital age where streaming and downloading content is becoming increasingly dominant. Others may be more concerned about data limits, finding Sprint's unlimited data offering to be the most appealing in this regard. However, if your primary concern revolves around the dependability of voice calls - perhaps due to your location or the nature of your work - Verizon would stand out as the most logical choice according to Metrico Wireless's study. The carrier is reported to offer the most consistent and reliable voice call service among the three major carriers.

Article: There are a number of special days of the year that are celebrated in different countries. The origins of most of the days are unknown. They were certainly not created by individual people. Other days, however, especially those celebrated in western countries, often owe their origins to a particular person. One of the most popular of these, even though it is fairly recent, is Mother's Day. Mothers have always been highly regarded in all cultures. The ancient Romans had a festival known as Hilaria, during which children took presents to the temple of the \\"Mother of the Gods\\". The Christian Church adopted this idea and called it Mothering Sunday. However, over the years this custom was gradually forgotten and almost disappeared by the end of the 19th century. Born in 1864 in Virginia, USA, Anna Jarvis was a school teacher and believed children should show gratitude to their mothers for all their love and care. Encouraged by a friend, she wrote to thousands of important people--politicians, churchmen, doctors, city officials--and asked them to support her idea: a special day of the year for thanking mothers. In 1910 the Governor of West Virginia introduced Mother's Day into the state. The date chosen was May 10--the second Sunday in May, which is still observed in America today. This date was chosen because May 10 was the date on which in 1908 Anna Jarvis's mother had died. In 1914 President Woodrow Wilson made May 10 the official date for Mother's Day throughout the United States. Soon there was a Mother's Day International Association and the custom began to be adopted in many countries of the world. Anna Jarvis, a sad and disillusioned woman, died in 1948. The custom she had worked so hard to establish and which had become almost universal had lost its original purpose. It had been taken over by business. Like Christmas, the giving of presents and the sending of cards had become a multi-million-dollar industry. Question: The story is about _ . Answer: A:","output":"The story is about the origin of Mother's Day and the efforts of Anna Jarvis to create a special day for expressing gratitude to mothers around the world. Jarvis, a school teacher, advocated for a designated day for thanking mothers and campaigned by writing to various important figures. Eventually, in 1914, President Woodrow Wilson officially established May 10th as Mother's Day in the United States. Unfortunately, by the time of Jarvis's death in 1948, the celebration had become more commercialized and had lost much of its original purpose."},{"instruction":"Explain simply why yes is the correct answer to: If \\"A small girl looking at a statue with a fence and trees behind.\\" does that mean that \\"A girl is gazing at a structure.\\"?

What is the difference between kinetic energy and momentum? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"The two questions are not inquiring about the same information, but they do share a related theme, as they both involve different aspects of energy and motion. To clarify, we will explore each concept and the differences between them individually. 1. Difference between potential and kinetic energy: Potential energy and kinetic energy are two types of mechanical energy that are present in any object under motion or at rest. Potential energy is the stored energy in an object due to its position or state. This energy has the potential to be converted into kinetic energy, which is the energy of motion. The most common types of potential energy include gravitational potential energy and elastic potential energy. Gravitational potential energy (GPE) is associated with an object's position in a gravitational field, typically near the surface of the Earth or any massive celestial body. The GPE of an object is determined by its mass, the acceleration due to gravity, and its height above a reference point. The formula for gravitational potential energy is: GPE = m × g × h where m is the mass of the object, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height above the reference point. Elastic potential energy is stored in an object when it is deformed by an external force, such as compressing a spring or stretching a rubber band. When the deforming force is removed, the object releases this stored energy and returns to its original shape. The formula for elastic potential energy is: EPE = 1/2 × k × x² where k is the spring constant (a measure of the stiffness of the object), and x is the displacement from its equilibrium position. Kinetic energy, on the other hand, is the energy of motion. When an object is in motion, it possesses kinetic energy, which is a function of its mass and velocity. The formula for kinetic energy is: KE = 1/2 × m × v² where m is the mass of the object and v is its velocity. In summary, potential energy is the stored energy that has the potential to be converted into kinetic energy, while kinetic energy is the energy possessed by an object due to its motion. The key difference between them is that potential energy depends on the position or state of the object, whereas kinetic energy depends on the object's motion. 2. Difference between kinetic energy and momentum: Kinetic energy and momentum are related concepts, but they describe different aspects of an object's motion. As explained earlier, kinetic energy is the energy of motion possessed by an object. It depends on both the mass and the square of the object's velocity. The formula for kinetic energy is: KE = 1/2 × m × v² Momentum, in contrast, is a measure of the \\"quantity of motion\\" of an object and is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction. Momentum depends on the object's mass and velocity and is represented by the formula: p = m × v where m is the mass of the object, and v is its velocity. Although both kinetic energy and momentum are related to an object's mass and velocity, they differ in how they are influenced by these factors. Kinetic energy is a scalar quantity and is directly proportional to the square of an object's velocity. This means that a small change in velocity results in a much larger change in kinetic energy. Momentum, on the other hand, is a linear function of velocity, which means its value will change proportionally with velocity. In summary, while potential and kinetic energy describe different aspects of an object's energy, and kinetic energy and momentum describe different aspects of an object's motion, all four concepts relate to the motion and energy of objects. Potential energy is the stored energy that an object possesses due to its position or state, kinetic energy is the energy an object possesses due to its motion, and momentum is a measure of an object's quantity of motion, depending on its mass and velocity. The main difference between kinetic energy and momentum is that kinetic energy is a scalar quantity and is related to the square of an object's velocity, whereas momentum is a vector quantity and is proportional to the object's velocity."},{"instruction":"Write some highlights for the following article: Richard III is getting people talking all over again.

Both Labyrinth of Lies by Giulio Ricciarelli and The People vs. Fritz Bauer by Lars Kraume portray the state prosecutor from Stuttgart as a controversial figure in the post-war years—he was Jewish, atheist, and gay, and he wanted those who worked in death camps brought to justice at a time when many Germans wanted to forget or ignore the horrors of the Nazi regime, reports AFP. And though his 1968 death looked like suicide, it remains a topic of debate to this day. \\"My guess is that until now the Germans did not want to honor a person who pointed so openly to their incompetence in dealing with their Nazi past,\\" says the author of a Bauer book. Bauer tipped off Israel that Adolf Eichmann was hiding in Argentina; the Mossad swooped in and kidnapped him in 1960 and he was executed in Israel in 1962. A year later he brought the Nazis who ran Auschwitz to court for the first time in Germany, fueled in part by the nine months he spent in a concentration camp in 1933 just a few years after becoming Germany's youngest judge at 27, reports the Independent. He received hate mail and death threats and is said to have once told a colleague: \\"As soon as I leave the confines of my office, I am on enemy territory.\\" The Independent calls it a \\"belated triumph\\" that half a century later reunited Germany is trying to track down the remaining Holocaust perpetrators, using Bauer's own logic that working in death camps equates complicity in murder. (This is what Eichmann wrote two days before he was hanged.) Expand this summary.","output":"Fritz Bauer was a very important person in Germany who tried to make sure that bad people, called Nazis, who did terrible things during a time called World War II would get punished. He was Germany's first Nazi hunter and he really wanted to bring those who hurt others in places called death camps to face the law. Many years ago, he was found dead in a bathtub and people didn't know how it happened. Some thought he took his own life, while others thought it was a big mystery. Now, there are two new movies that talk about Fritz Bauer's life and the important work he did. The movies are helping people to remember and learn about him. Bauer wanted Germans to face and talk about the bad things that happened during the Nazi period, even though it was a very difficult time. Fritz Bauer was a brave person, and now people are starting to honor him for making sure that those who did bad things got punished. It's like getting a very, very late \\"thank you\\" for doing the right thing!"},{"instruction":"Hoping to break their current losing streak the Cowboys played on home ground for an Interconference duel with the Jaguars.

Here's a step-by-step reasoning process: 1. Look for historical records: By examining historical records and data regarding criminal punishment, we can gather information about the prevalence of hanging as a form of punishment. 2. Check the prevalence of hanging across different regions and time periods: Through these historical records, we can determine that hanging was indeed a common form of capital punishment across various cultures, countries, and time periods. For example, hanging was used in ancient civilizations, such as Persia and Rome, as well as in medieval Europe and later in places like the United States and Great Britain. 3. Identify key reasons for the popularity of hanging: The reasons for hanging's prevalence can include the relative simplicity and accessibility of the required materials (e.g., rope, gallows), and the importance placed on public spectacle and display of power in historical criminal justice systems. 4. Confirm the verifiable nature of the statement: Based on this evidence and analysis, we can conclude that the statement \\"Hanging criminals was common almost everywhere as criminal punishment\\" is indeed a verifiable fact."},{"instruction":"I read this background article the other day: Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in matter. In everyday usage, temperature indicates a measure of how hot or cold an object is. Temperature is an important parameter in chemistry. When a substance changes from solid to liquid, it is because there was an increase in the temperature of the material. Chemical reactions usually proceed faster if the temperature is increased. Many unstable materials (such as enzymes) will be viable longer at lower temperatures. I am facing a new situation today: Susan went to the store to buy some bags of ice for a party she was having later in the day. When she got home she put one bag of ice in the sink and another in the freezer, but then was distracted by a phone call and forgot to put the other bag in the freezer. When she returned, the bag of ice had melted. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Was the temperature of the melted bag higher or lower than the temperature of the frozen bag? The answer to this question is:","output":"The temperature of the melted bag was higher than the temperature of the frozen bag. To understand this, let's go back to the information in the background article. Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in matter, which means that it gauges how much the particles in a substance move. The more the particles move, the higher the temperature. Conversely, the less they move, the lower the temperature. In Susan's situation, she left one bag of ice in the sink, one in the freezer, and one distractedly outside the freezer. The bag outside the freezer was exposed to a warmer environment, which led to an increase in the kinetic energy of the ice particles in that bag. As the particles gained energy, they started moving more, breaking the bonds that kept them in a solid state. This caused the ice to melt and turn into liquid water. Meanwhile, the bag of ice in the freezer was maintained at a cold temperature, preventing the ice particles from gaining enough energy to break their bonds. This kept the ice frozen, with the particles staying relatively stationary compared to their counterparts in the melted bag. Considering the relationship between temperature and the kinetic energy of particles, it can be concluded that the temperature of the melted bag, where the particles gained enough energy to shift from solid to liquid, was higher than that of the frozen bag, where the particles remained in their solid state."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone.

Since forming in 1993 as Thundercross, the band has released twelve studio albums, two live albums, two EPs, and a Live DVD. Rhapsody of Fire is known for its conceptual lyrics that constitute a fantasy story throughout all of their albums from 1997 to 2011. After using the moniker of Rhapsody for nearly ten years, the band changed their name to Rhapsody of Fire in 2006 due to trademark issues. In July 2006 the band formerly known as Rhapsody changed their name to Rhapsody of Fire due to trademark issues. The band's website goes into further detail: The band members consider this a great new start, reflecting the emboldened and increasingly grandiose direction that their music has taken. \\"The power of the Dragonflame will burn brighter than ever before,\\" says guitarist/songwriter Luca Turilli. Keyboardist/songwriter Alex Staropoli adds, \\"The name Rhapsody of Fire better represents the energy that has always been present in this band and its music.\\" The band released Triumph or Agony, on September 25, 2006, in Europe. The second chapter in The Dark Secret Saga, Triumph or Agony, continues the bombastic Rhapsody of Fire tradition with a live 70-piece orchestra and choir as Turilli and Staropoli continued to self-produce the band's work with the assistance of co-producer Sascha Paeth. New songs include \\"Silent Dream\\", \\"Son of Pain\\" and the epic 16-minute-long \\"The Mystic Prophecy of the Demonknight\\", an example of a cinema soundtrack adapted to a metal song. In addition, vocalist Fabio Lione gave his songwriting debut for Rhapsody of Fire with the song \\"Il canto del vento\\". In June 2008, Luca Turilli reported on the band's official website about a \\"hard legal fight with Magic Circle Music and his main representative Mr. Joey DeMaio\\". Since then, the band went on a hiatus for nearly one and a half years. Any studio or live activity was suspended for the period. Luca Turilli concentrated on his solo albums, Fabio Lione collaborated with Vision Divine and Kamelot, Alex Holzwarth collaborated with his brother Oliver, and Staropoli also announced his plans to record a solo album. In late 2009 Limb Music re-released their back-catalogue from 1997 to 2001, along with the compilation album Tales from the Emerald Sword Saga on digital music stores. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Why was this so bad","output":"It seems that the article does not explicitly mention any particular situation or event being \\"so bad.\\" However, you can infer that the band faced some difficulties during their legal fight with Magic Circle Music and Joey DeMaio in June 2008. The quote from the article regarding this situation is: \\"In June 2008, Luca Turilli reported on the band's official website about a 'hard legal fight with Magic Circle Music and his main representative Mr. Joey DeMaio'.\\" This legal battle led to the band's hiatus for nearly one and a half years, during which their studio and live activities were suspended."},{"instruction":"Available options: 1).

Given those answer options, answer the question: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: when was fdr elected as president Suggested answer: As World War II loomed after 1938, with the Japanese invasion of China and the aggression of Nazi Germany , FDR gave strong diplomatic and financial support to China and Great Britain, while remaining officially neutral. Should I validate this answer? A:","output":"Based on the given options, my answer would be: 2). Yes. However, I understand that the information provided in the suggested answer does not directly address when FDR was elected as president. To provide a more accurate and complete response: Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) was elected as the 32nd President of the United States on November 8, 1932. He took office on March 4, 1933, and served for four consecutive terms until his death in 1945. During his presidency, FDR led the U.S. through the Great Depression and World War II, making significant contributions to the nation's economic recovery and the Allied victory in the war. So, while the suggested answer does provide some relevant context about FDR's actions during World War II, it does not directly answer the question of when he was elected president. Therefore, it would be better to validate the specific information about his election date, as provided in this response."},{"instruction":"Is \\"The high economic subsidies granted by the federal government and the EU after 1990 are being reduced gradually and will end around 2020.\\" a good answer to the question \\"When will government subsidies to Thuringia end?\\"","output":"While the statement \\"The high economic subsidies granted by the federal government and the EU after 1990 are being reduced gradually and will end around 2020\\" provides some information on the timeline of government subsidies to Thuringia, it may not provide optimal clarity or enough detail for someone seeking a comprehensive answer on when the government subsidies will end. A more thorough and precise response to the question \\"When will government subsidies to Thuringia end?\\" could be: Government subsidies to Thuringia have been granted since the reunification of Germany in 1990, primarily due to the need for investments in infrastructure, education, and economic development. There are multiple forms of subsidies provided from different sources like the federal government and the European Union. While it is indicated that these subsidies have been gradually reduced and are expected to end around 2020, it is also important to consider that subsidies may continue in more specific or targeted forms, depending on the evolving needs and priorities of the region. It is essential to analyze the different types of subsidies that Thuringia has been receiving to better understand when they might end: 1. Solidarity Surcharge (Solidaritätszuschlag): This tax was implemented to assist in the economic development of the eastern states of Germany, including Thuringia. The solidarity surcharge was significantly reduced from 5.5% to 3.5% in 2021, affecting around 90% of German taxpayers. It appears that this tax might be phased out, although it is difficult to pinpoint when it will be officially terminated. 2. European Union Structural Funds: Thuringia has been a significant beneficiary of EU funding since joining the bloc after German reunification. The various EU funding sources are subject to multi-annual planning periods - for example, the programming period for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) extended from 2014 to 2020. Although it has been mentioned that subsidies would end around 2020, the current funding period actually extends from 2021 to 2027, receiving funding for projects in innovation, social inclusion, and climate change adaptation among others. 3. Federal Government Funds: The German federal government has also supported Thuringia through diverse subsidies over the years, which managed by different agencies and ministries. The timeline for the termination of these funds may vary depending on multiple factors, including political decisions, budgetary constraints, and regional needs. In conclusion, while it is known that some subsidies have been gradually reduced in recent years, pinpointing an exact end date is challenging, primarily because of the varied nature of the subsidies. Ongoing financial support from the federal government or the EU in specific areas may continue beyond 2020, as new funding opportunities might arise that align with regional development goals and strategies."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"A young woman holding the hand of a toddler while walking in the park.\\" Based on this premise, can we conclude that the hypothesis \\"The toddler is holding onto the young woman hand strongly.\\" is true?

Here are possible answers to this question: - botanical garden - doctor's office - in a sea - public place - arboretum I believe the correct choice is \\"botanical garden\\", here's why: A:","output":"A special ficus would most likely be found in a botanical garden. Botanical gardens are carefully curated spaces designed to showcase a wide range of flora in an educational and aesthetic manner. Many botanical gardens focus on specific types of plants, rare species, or plants from particular geographical regions. A special ficus, which could be a rare or unique variation of the ficus species, would be best suited in a botanical garden because they typically house such extraordinary plants. Additionally, botanical gardens provide the necessary care and attention to maintain the health and well-being of the diverse plants they house. This includes having skilled botanists and horticulturists on hand to ensure that all plants receive proper care, such as appropriate amounts of water, sunlight, and nutrients. A special ficus would require these experts to ensure its long-term survival. In contrast, a doctor's office would be an unlikely location for a special ficus. While it is common to find indoor plants in office settings, these tend to be hardy, low-maintenance varieties rather than unique or rare specimens. A doctor's office would probably not prioritize maintaining the specific needs of a special ficus when compared to their medical duties. A sea is an unsuitable environment for a ficus, as they are not aquatic plants. Ficus trees are native to tropical and subtropical regions and have no adaptations for surviving in the water or saline soils. A public place may also feature plants and trees, including ficus trees, but these locations tend to focus on displaying easy-to-maintain, hardy plants that are resistant to vandalism, weather damage, and neglect. A special ficus would be less likely to thrive in a typical public environment without the necessary attention to its specific needs. An arboretum is another potential location where you might find a special ficus, as it is a dedicated space for displaying and studying diverse tree and plant species. However, compared to a botanical garden, an arboretum might be more focused on displaying trees native to its specific region or showcasing trees in a more natural setting. While it is possible that a special ficus might be housed in an arboretum, the probability of it being there is lower than in a botanical garden, which would sustain a broader range of plant species and devote more resources to their care and display. Thus, a botanical garden would be the most appropriate and fitting location for a special ficus, as it is uniquely designed to cater to the needs of extraordinary species and provide an environment where both plants and visitors can appreciate their beauty and rarity."},{"instruction":"(1) Chananian is a village in Azad Kashmir of Leepa Valley , Hattian Bala District , Pakistan .

Sentence 1: Chananian is a village in Azad Kashmir of Leepa Valley, Hattian Bala District, Pakistan. Sentence 2: Chananian is a village in the Leepa Valley, Hattian Bala district of Azad Kashmir, Pakistan. Step 2: Compare the information in both sentences. Both sentences provide information about the location of Chananian village. They both mention that Chananian is located in: - Leepa Valley - Hattian Bala District - Azad Kashmir - Pakistan Step 3: Analyze the sentence structures. The sentence structures are different, but they convey the same information regarding the location of Chananian village. The only minor difference is that in Sentence 1, the phrase \\"Azad Kashmir\\" comes before \\"Leepa Valley,\\" while in Sentence 2, the phrase \\"Azad Kashmir\\" comes after \\"Leepa Valley.\\" However, this difference in structure does not change the overall meaning.

Both sentences are talking about age, which refers to the amount of time a person or thing has existed. In this context, it seems they are discussing the age of a person. Step 2: Analyze Sentence A. \\"Eighty years old is a mighty old age to be.\\" This sentence is stating that being 80 years old is considered to be a considerably old age for a person. This statement makes sense, as it acknowledges that living for eight decades is a significant amount of time in a human life. Step 3: Analyze Sentence B. \\"Eighty seconds old is a mighty old age to be.\\" This sentence is stating that being 80 seconds old is considered to be a considerably old age for a person. However, this statement does not make sense because 80 seconds is an extremely short period of time in a human life. Step 4: Compare both sentences. When comparing the two sentences, it is clear that Sentence A is a logical and reasonable statement about human age, while Sentence B is not. Eighty years old is indeed an old age for a person, whereas eighty seconds is an insignificant amount of time in the context of human life. Step 5: Determine the answer. Based on the comparison in Step 4, we can conclude that Sentence B does not make sense, whereas Sentence A does. Thus, the answer is Sentence B."},{"instruction":"Write highlights for this article: Apple has taken firm root in America. Just over half of all households in the country own at least one Apple product, a new survey says, showing just how far the reach of the company has come in the last decade. At the turn of the 21st century, Apple was in rough shape. It had narrowly avoided bankruptcy, and Steve Jobs' return as CEO a few years earlier was turning the company around, but the market share of its products -- then almost exclusively Mac computers -- was dismal, at about 2% worldwide. Then came the iPod, which begat the iPhone and the iPad. As Apple's gadgets gobbled up market share (and in some cases created new markets), its Macs experienced a rebound, too. Now, according to CNBC's All-American Economic Survey, 51% of U.S. households own at least one Apple product. Few brands have such a deep reach among American consumers. Certainly, product categories such as refrigerators or even smartphones have achieved even deeper penetration, but looking at single companies, it's a short list with probable names such as GE (light bulbs) or 3M (Scotch tape). Reducing to just technology companies would make it even shorter. See also: Sorry, Google: Apple is America's Valentine This Year [study]. Of the households that own Apple products, they own an average of three, making the overall ownership rate of the American public 1.6 Apple products per household. About 25% plan to buy another Apple product in the next year. The survey shows Apple buyers tend to skew male, young, with higher education and incomes (77% of households making 75,000 or more have an Apple product). If you have kids, the likelihood of being an Apple household grows -- 61% compared with 48% if you don't. As far as politics is concerned, both Republicans and Democrats appear to like Apple products equally, with 56% of people counting themselves a member of either party owning Apple, although a greater portion of Democrats plan to buy more products soon. CNBC's survey polled 836 Americans via both landlines and cellphones over three days in March. The network says it has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4%. Do you own Apple products?

Article:","output":"Title: Two Additional Suspects Charged in Connection to 2016 Brussels Attacks Introduction Belgian authorities have recently charged two more men in connection to the terrorist attacks that occurred in Brussels on March 22, 2016. These individuals were reportedly connected to a safe house used by one of the bombers before the attacks. Background on the 2016 Brussels Attacks On March 22, 2016, three coordinated suicide bombings occurred in Brussels, Belgium. Two bombings took place at the Brussels Airport, while another occurred at the Maalbeek Metro Station. These attacks resulted in 32 civilians being killed and over 300 others injured. The extremist group ISIS claimed responsibility for the bombings, further exacerbating concerns over terrorism in Europe. The Investigation A prolonged, meticulous investigation led by Belgian authorities has identified multiple individuals involved in the planning and execution of the attacks. As the case continues to unfold, new evidence links more suspects to the terrorists involved in the bombings. The Charged Suspects The two suspects recently charged have not yet been named, but it has been reported that they were linked to a safe house used by one of the bombers. The safe house was likely employed as a location for the attackers to prepare and coordinate the bombings. Authorities have not disclosed further details about the involvement of those two individuals. Through extensive collaboration, local and international law enforcement agencies have made significant strides in tracking down suspects associated with the attacks. Several other individuals involved in the planning, coordination, and execution of the attacks have already been brought to justice. Ongoing Efforts to Combat Terrorism In addition to pursuing suspects, Belgian authorities continue their efforts to prevent further terrorist attacks. This includes monitoring extremist groups, sharing intelligence with other countries, and taking extensive measures to enhance security in public spaces such as airports and metro stations. The charging of these two individuals makes it clear that law enforcement agencies remain vigilant in their efforts to investigate and prosecute those who have participated in terrorist activities. The determination to bring those responsible for the Brussels attacks to justice serves as a testament to ongoing global efforts to combat terrorism. Conclusion The recent charges against two more individuals linked to the 2016 Brussels attacks demonstrate the commitment of Belgian authorities and international law enforcement to hold those involved accountable. By continuing to pursue leads and piece together evidence, authorities strive to deliver justice to the victims and their families while working to prevent future acts of terror."},{"instruction":"In this task, you're given a pair of sentences, sentence 1 and sentence 2, that neither agree with nor contradict each other.

As per European tradition, they were first reported living east of the Volga River, in an area that was part of Scythia at the time; the Huns' arrival is associated with the migration westward of a Scythian people, the Alans. In 91 AD, the Huns were said to be living near the Caspian Sea and by about 150 had migrated southeast into the Caucasus.

In 1965, the activity on the main island diminished, but at the end of May that year an eruption began at a vent 0.6 km (0.37 mi) off the northern shore. By 28 May, an island had appeared, and was named Syrtlingur (Little Surtsey). The new island was washed away during early June, but reappeared on 14 June. Eruptions at Syrtlingur were much smaller in scale than those that had built Surtsey, with the average rate of emission of volcanic materials being about a tenth of the rate at the main vent. Activity was short-lived, continuing until the beginning of October 1965, by which time the islet had an area of 0.15 km2 (0.058 sq mi). Once the eruptions had ceased, wave erosion rapidly wore the island away, and it disappeared beneath the waves on 24 October.During December 1965, more submarine activity occurred 0.9 km (0.56 mi) southwest of Surtsey, and another island was formed. It was named Jólnir, and over the following eight months it appeared and disappeared several times, as wave erosion and volcanic activity alternated in dominance. Activity at Jólnir was much weaker than the activity at the main vent, and even weaker than that seen at Syrtlingur, but the island eventually grew to a maximum size of 70 m (230 ft) in height, covering an area of 0.3 km2 (0.12 sq mi), during July and early August 1966. Like Syrtlingur, though, after activity ceased on 8 August 1966, it was rapidly eroded, and dropped below sea level during October 1966.Effusive eruptions on the main island returned on 19 August 1966, with fresh lava flows giving it further resistance to erosion. The eruption rate diminished steadily, though, and on 5 June 1967, the eruption ended. The volcano has been dormant ever since. The total volume of lava emitted during the three-and-a-half-year eruption was about one cubic kilometre (0.24 cu mi), and the island's highest point was 174 metres (571 feet) above sea level at that time.Since the end of the eruption, erosion has seen the island diminish in size.

Military gains were evident on the main highway into Slovyansk, a rebel stronghold, as government forces moved in. A CNN team on the ground saw a substantial number of militants bolster their defensive positions and checkpoints inside the city. One civilian car was hit in the fighting, its exterior damaged by bullet holes. At a local hospital, the CNN team saw several people injured from the heavy clashes. One woman had been shot in the head, probably in a crossfire, and two pro-Russian militants were also brought in. Ukraine's Interior Ministry said four people were killed and nearly 30 injured in the city. It quoted local residents as saying the attackers had shot at residential buildings and set them on fire. Militants blamed Ukrainian forces for the civilian casualties. In a separate statement, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said a military helicopter was shot down \\"during a combat mission and patrolling in the area\\" of Slovyansk on Monday, but the pilots survived after it crashed into a river. They were later rescued. Ukraine's embattled new leaders have launched their most intensive effort yet to dislodge pro-Russian separatists who have reportedly seized government buildings in nearly a dozen cities and towns. Kiev authorities describe the separatists as \\"terrorists.\\" But the rebels say they are defending Russian-speaking areas of the east against Ukrainian \\"fascists\\" trying to root out Russian influence in the country. In a statement Monday, Russia's Foreign Ministry accused the Kiev government of \\"continuing a war against the people of their own country.\\" \\"We again urge the Kiev organizers of terror against their own people to come to their senses, stop the bloodshed, withdraw troops and sit down, finally, at the negotiating table to start a normal dialogue on ways to resolve the political crisis,\\" the ministry said. Many experts say Russia may be provoking unrest in eastern Ukraine to justify an incursion. Riot-hit Odessa. The uprisings began when President Viktor Yanukovych, a supporter of closer ties with Moscow, was toppled by demonstrations led by pro-Western figures in February, namely in Kiev, the capital. Violence soon erupted in the east and south of the country, escalating dramatically last week. On Sunday, pro-Russian sympathizers smashed their way into a police station in the Black Sea port city of Odessa, demanding their detained comrades be released. In another victory for a violent crowd in east Ukraine and yet another humiliation for state authorities, police didn't try to stop them. Instead, they offered the crowd a deal, releasing 67 alleged enemies of the state if the furious crowd went home. Sunday's storming of the Odessa police station -- just two days after more than 40 people were killed in a street battle and deadly blaze in the city -- was one more example of how Ukraine's new Western-backed leaders are struggling to maintain law and order in the south and east of the country. It also raises questions about the ability of the army and police to confront an uprising that Kiev says is backed by Moscow -- an accusation the Kremlin denies. The men released Sunday had been detained over the weekend after bloody clashes between supporters and opponents of Russia in Odessa on Friday, which ended in the deadly blaze. Forty-six people were killed in the bloodshed -- the deadliest since Yanukovych was ousted. Video posted on YouTube appeared to show supporters of Kiev's government throwing Molotov cocktails at the building where pro-Russian separatists had reportedly taken up positions. The footage, which CNN could not independently confirm, showed people sitting on ledges trying to escape the fire and thick smoke. In an attempt to reassert Kiev's authority, Ukrainian interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk went to Odessa to appeal for unity while accusing Russia of provoking the clashes. Ukraine's Cabinet said it would offer financial assistance to the victims' families. \\"This is the wake-up call for the entire country, for reconciliation. We need to realize that Russians want to eliminate our country,\\" Yatsenyuk said. His message is a tough sell in a city where so many now believe people who speak Russian are being killed and arrested by forces loyal to the Ukrainian government. Military action. Ukraine's government reported some progress over the weekend in its military campaign. Officials said security forces had regained control of a TV tower in Kramatorsk, some 10 miles (16 kilometers) south of Slovyansk. Residents in Kramatorsk reported hearing gunfire and a CNN team on the outskirts of Kramatorsk saw troop carriers moving toward the city center Saturday. Amateur video posted online -- the authenticity of which could not be confirmed by CNN -- showed burned buses, plumes of smoke and residents calmly observing it all. Saturday actually featured a rare bright spot in the volatility: the release of seven international military observers and five Ukrainians from the Defense Ministry who had been held hostage for eight days in Slovyansk. However, in another challenge to Kiev, separatist leader Valeriy Bolotov in Luhansk declared a state of emergency and announced the formation of a \\"South-East\\" army for the entire region. In a video statement aired on local stations, Bolotov introduced a curfew, a ban on political parties and his expectation that local law enforcement officials will take an oath of allegiance to the people of Luhansk. In Donetsk, separatists say they are preparing their own referendum on May 11 to ask residents whether they want sovereignty from Ukraine -- an echo of events that led to Moscow wresting Crimea from Kiev. Denis Pushilin, the self-declared chairman of the Donetsk People's Republic, told CNN the question on the ballot paper would read: \\"Do you support the act of state sovereignty of the Donetsk Republic?\\" to which voters can respond with \\"Yes\\" or \\"No.\\" He said enough ballot papers had already been printed to hold the vote. Tensions with Russia. Separatists -- many of them of Russian descent -- say they believe the government in Kiev is illegitimate because it formed after what they call the illegal ousting of Yanukovych in February. Officials in Kiev accuse Moscow of meddling by supporting the separatists. NATO has estimated that up to 40,000 Russian troops are now near the border with Ukraine, which has made Kiev's government and neighboring nations wary of invasion. A senior U.S. official told CNN on Monday that the latest intelligence still showed 40,000 to 50,000 Russian troops on the border. \\"There has been no major change in force disposition or readiness and no indications of preparations for an invasion,\\" the official said, adding that the U.S. continues to assess the situation. The troops are so close to the border, an invasion could happen with little or no warning, the official said. Russia and the West squared off diplomatically over the fate of Ukraine when Moscow annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea in March after a hastily called referendum and Yanukovych's ouster. He was pushed from office after months of protests by people upset that he had turned away from Europe in favor of Moscow. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius warned Monday there could be fresh sanctions on Russia if Ukraine's presidential elections do not take place on May 25. Russia has condemned Kiev's military action in the volatile east. Dmitry Peskov, Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, said Russia's government had received thousands of calls since Friday from people in southeastern Ukraine. The callers described the situation as \\"horrendous\\" and pleaded for Russia's involvement. \\"Most of the people literally demand active help from Russia,\\" he said. The government in Kiev is bracing for further unrest in the run-up to May 9, a national holiday to commemorate the end of the second world war. Interim President Oleksandr Turchynov told local TV that checkpoints had been set up around the capital in case of possible \\"provocations.\\" Write highlights for this article.","output":"In Ukraine, there was fighting between Ukrainian security forces and pro-Russian militants in the city of Slovyansk.

The immune system produces antibodies and immune cells that target and neutralize the virus, limiting its ability to infect new cells. This process can result in the host experiencing symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and inflammation as the body fights the infection. - Transmission to other hosts: Once the virus has replicated and spread within the host, it may be transmitted to new hosts through various modes, depending on the type of virus. Modes of transmission can include direct contact, respiratory droplets, fecal-oral route, contaminated surfaces, and bodily fluids. - Recovery or persistence: Depending on the effectiveness of the host's immune response and the nature of the virus, the infected individual may either recover or continue to experience symptoms. In some cases, the virus may become dormant within the host, only to reactivate later and cause further illness (e.g., herpesviruses). In other instances, a virus may lead to chronic infection, which may have long-lasting health consequences (e.g., HIV). - Further complications or death: In severe cases, a viral infection may lead to complications such as organ damage or other health issues. These complications or the virus itself may result in the death of the host organism. - In some cases, a host may become an asymptomatic carrier of the virus, meaning they are infected and can spread the virus without experiencing noticeable symptoms themselves. Overall, the outcome of a viral infection depends on several factors, including the specific virus, the host's immune system response, and any potential treatments or interventions."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: This task is about translating a given Spanish language sentence to English.

Several factors contribute to the negative sentiment of this review: 1. Service: The reviewer experienced a long wait time for both drinks and food, which is a key point of dissatisfaction, as it led to frustration and likely detracted from their overall enjoyment. 2. Staffing: The reviewer notes that there was only one waiter working on a Saturday night, suggesting that the establishment was understaffed. This might have been a contributing factor to the slow service and further emphasizes the negative experience. 3. Food Quality: The crab cakes were described as \\"underwhelming\\" and the size was not as expected, which implies that the food did not meet the expectations or standards that the reviewer had in mind, furthering their disappointment. 4. Tone: The use of sarcastic language, such as \\"let's have more than 1 waiter working on a Saturday night,\\" reinforces the negative sentiment of this review by underlining the experienced frustration and expressing criticism of the establishment's management choices.

Usher spent the majority of his young life in Chattanooga: his father left the family when Usher was a year old. Usher grew up with his mother, then-stepfather, and half-brother, James Lackey (born 1984). Directed by his mother, Usher joined the local church youth choir in Chattanooga, when he was nine years old. Aside from recording music, Usher is involved in other businesses, including several restaurants. In 2007 Usher worked with Richard Herpin and Honoring Blanc for the fragrances Usher He and Usher She. The promotion for the fragrance, featured Usher and Martha Stewart in the Macy's, \\"The Magic of Macy's\\" commercial. In September 2008 Usher released the fragrances, UR for Men and UR for Women. Usher fifth fragrance, VIP was launched in 2009. On March 30, 2015, it was announced that Usher is a co-owner, with various other music artists, in the music streaming service Tidal. The service specialises in lossless audio and high definition music video with curated editorial. Jay Z acquired the parent company of Tidal, Aspiro, in the first quarter of 2015. The slogan \\"Turn the tide\\" and the hashtag \\"#TIDALforAll\\" was used by various artists on social media during the buildup to the press conference relaunching the service. Usher, along with sixteen artist stakeholders (such as Alicia Keys, Kanye West, Beyonce, Rihanna, Madonna, J.Cole, Nicki Minaj and more) co-own Tidal, with the majority owning a 3% equity stake. The idea of having an all artist owned streaming service was created by those involved to adapt to the increased demand for streaming within the current music industry, and to rival other streaming services such as Spotify, which have been criticised for their low payout of royalties.\\"The challenge is to get everyone to respect music again, to recognize its value\\", stated Jay-Z on the release of Tidal. On June 28, 2015, Usher became partners with Yoobi the fast-growing school supplies company called based out of Los Angeles. The company donates a portion of its products to schools and has brought in over 20 million in revenue between June 2014 and June 201 Yoobi CEO Ido Leffler told Inc.

Question with options to choose from: How would it be better if your mid section was n't weak ? Options are: +I would be able to eat more .. +It would be easier to get around .. +I would be able to walk faster .. +I would be unable to stand up.","output":"Feeling weak in the midsection can be quite challenging, especially when it impacts your day-to-day activities and overall well-being. Having a stronger midsection could bring about several benefits, which can be inferred from the options provided. Option 1: I would be able to eat more: Having a stronger midsection means that your core muscles are better suited to handle the strain of everyday activities, including eating. With improved support and muscle functioning, you might find it easier to consume larger meals without worrying about your weakened muscles causing discomfort or impeding your ability to digest food properly. This could lead to increased satisfaction during meals and better nutrient intake. Option 2: It would be easier to get around: A strong midsection is crucial for maintaining balance and facilitating smooth movement. If your midsection was not weak, you would likely experience better mobility and find it much more comfortable to walk, sit, or engage in other activities that require use of your core muscles. This could significantly enhance your overall quality of life, making it easier to partake in regular activities and perhaps even exercise, leading to further health benefits. Option 3: I would be able to walk faster: Your core muscles play a significant role in maintaining proper posture and stability, which can greatly influence your walking pace. With a stronger midsection, you'd likely find it much simpler to maintain a steady and efficient walking speed. This could not only make it easier to get around and complete tasks more quickly, but also improve your cardiovascular health as walking is an essential form of exercise for many individuals. Option 4: I would be unable to stand up: This option appears to be contrary to the expected positive outcomes associated with a stronger midsection, so I'll assume it is included as an incorrect option or a typographical error. In summary, having a stronger midsection would bring multiple benefits, such as improved eating, ease of getting around, and walking faster. These improvements can significantly enhance your overall quality of life and encourage you to lead a healthier lifestyle."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence that includes all the following words: fog, lake, sunrise","output":"Step 1: Analyze the given words - 'fog', 'lake', 'sunrise'.

Charlotte was the daughter of Caroline of Brunswick and which future British monarch?","output":"Charlotte was the daughter of Caroline of Brunswick and the future British monarch, King George IV. She was born on January 7, 1796, and her full name was Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales. King George IV was the Prince Regent at the time of her birth and later ascended to the throne as King George IV in 1820. Caroline of Brunswick was a German princess who married her first cousin, the future King George IV, in 1795. The marriage between Caroline and George was an unhappy one, as there were reports of mutual dislike, infidelities, and periods of separation. Despite being the only legitimate child of the couple, Charlotte had a difficult relationship with her parents who used her as a pawn in their ongoing disagreements. Princess Charlotte was a popular figure in England, and her tragic death at the age of 21, on November 6, 1817, after a complicated childbirth, led to an outpouring of grief across the nation. It was a significant event, as Charlotte was the only legitimate grandchild of King George III and, at the time of her death, second in line to the throne. Her untimely demise had significant consequences for the future of the British royal family. Following her death, King George III's other sons quickly married them to secure the succession to the throne. In 1819, one of these unions, between Edward, Duke of Kent and Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, resulted in the birth of Charlotte's first cousin Princess Alexandrina Victoria. She later became Queen Victoria, one of the most influential and longest-reigning British monarchs.

The mortality can be divided into two types: Natural mortality: the removal of fish from the stock due to causes not associated with fishing. Such causes can include disease, competition, cannibalism, old age, predation, pollution or any other natural factor that causes the death of fish. In fisheries models natural mortality is denoted by (M).[1] Fishing mortality: the removal of fish from the stock due to fishing activities using any fishing gear.[1] It is denoted by (F) in fisheries models. I am facing a new situation today: Two lakes had been stocked with fish two years before.Blue lake had an abundant fish stock because nobody fished there, but Green lake was open for fishing. Blue lake had some polution and disease problems. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which lake had a higher fishing mortality last year? The answer is:","output":"Green Lake had a higher fishing mortality last year. Given the background information provided and the new situation at hand, we can analyze the two types of fish mortalities, natural mortality (M) and fishing mortality (F), in both lakes to come to a conclusion. Blue Lake: - Abundant fish stock due to no fishing activities: This implies that the fishing mortality (F) in Blue Lake is zero or negligible, as there is no removal of fish due to fishing. - Pollution and disease problems: These factors contribute to natural mortality (M) in Blue Lake, causing the death of fish from causes not related to fishing. Green Lake: - Open for fishing: Since Green Lake is open for fishing activities, it is subjected to fishing mortality (F). Fish from this lake are removed from the stock due to the use of fishing gear, creating a higher fishing mortality rate than Blue Lake, which has no fishing activities. - No mention of pollution and disease problems: The absence of these factors indicates that natural mortality (M) in Green Lake might be lower than that of Blue Lake. However, to answer the question on fishing mortality, these factors are not directly relevant. Considering the analysis above, it is evident that Green Lake had a higher fishing mortality last year, as fishing activities were taking place in this lake, resulting in a higher removal of fish from the stock due to fishing gear usage. In contrast, Blue Lake had little to no fishing mortality, as there were no fishing activities happening in that area."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you are given two sentences in the English language (Sentence 1 and Sentence 2).

The external and visible organs, in males and females, are the \\"primary sex organs\\" known as the genitals or genitalia. The internal organs are known as the \\"secondary sex organs\\" and are sometimes referred to as the \\"internal genitalia\\". The characteristics that begin to appear during puberty, such as, in humans, pubic hair on both sexes and facial hair on the male, are known as secondary sex characteristics. - The vulva (plural \\"vulvae\\" or \\"vulvas\\") consists of the external female sex organs. The vulva includes the mons pubis, labia majora, labia minora, clitoris, bulb of vestibule, vulval vestibule, urinary meatus, greater and lesser vestibular glands, and the vaginal opening. The urinary meatus is also included as it opens into the vulval vestibule. Other features of the vulva include: the pudendal cleft, sebaceous glands, the urogenital triangle (anterior part of the perineum), and pubic hair. - In cell biology, mitosis is a part of the cell cycle when replicated chromosomes are separated into two new nuclei. In general, mitosis (division of the nucleus) is preceded by the S stage of interphase (during which the DNA is replicated) and is often accompanied or followed by cytokinesis, which divides the cytoplasm, organelles and cell membrane into two new cells containing roughly equal shares of these cellular components. Mitosis and cytokinesis together define the mitotic (M) phase of an animal cell cyclethe division of the mother cell into two daughter cells genetically identical to each other. - Sperm is the male reproductive cell and is derived from the Greek word () \\"sperma\\" (meaning \\"seed\\"). In the types of sexual reproduction known as anisogamy and its subtype oogamy, there is a marked difference in the size of the gametes with the smaller one being termed the \\"male\\" or sperm cell. A uniflagellar sperm cell that is motile is referred to as a spermatozoon, whereas a non-motile sperm cell is referred to as a spermatium. Sperm cells cannot divide and have a limited life span, but after fusion with egg cells during fertilization, a new organism begins developing, starting as a totipotent zygote. The human sperm cell is haploid, so that its 23 chromosomes can join the 23 chromosomes of the female egg to form a diploid cell. In mammals, sperm develops in the testicles and is released from the penis. It is also possible to extract sperm through TESE. Some sperm banks hold up to of sperm. - In mammals, the vagina is a muscular and tubular part of the female genital tract, which in humans extends from the vulva to the cervix. The outer vaginal opening may be partly covered by a membrane called the hymen. At the deep end, the cervix (neck of the uterus) bulges into the vagina. The vagina allows for sexual intercourse and childbirth, and channels menstrual flow, which occurs periodically as part of the menstrual cycle. - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. - The egg cell, or ovum, is the female reproductive cell (gamete) in oogamous organisms. The egg cell is typically not capable of active movement, and it is much larger (visible to the naked eye) than the motile sperm cells. When egg and sperm fuse, a diploid cell (the zygote) is formed, which rapidly grows into a new organism. - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria. - The Indo-European languages are a language family of several hundred related languages and dialects. There are about 445 living Indo-European languages, according to the estimate by \\"Ethnologue\\", with over two-thirds (313) of them belonging to the Indo-Iranian branch. The most widely spoken Indo-European languages by native speakers are Spanish, English, Hindustani (Hindi and Urdu), Portuguese, Bengali, Russian, Persian and Punjabi, each with over 100 million speakers. Today, 46% of the human population speaks an Indo-European language natively, by far the highest of any language family. - Puberty is the process of physical changes through which a child's body matures into an adult body capable of sexual reproduction. It is initiated by hormonal signals from the brain to the gonads: the ovaries in a girl, the testes in a boy. In response to the signals, the gonads produce hormones that stimulate libido and the growth, function, and transformation of the brain, bones, muscle, blood, skin, hair, breasts, and sex organs. Physical growthheight and weightaccelerates in the first half of puberty and is completed when an adult body has been developed. Until the maturation of their reproductive capabilities, the pre-pubertal physical differences between boys and girls are the external sex organs. - An embryo is an early stage of development of a multicellular diploid eukaryotic organism. In general, in organisms that reproduce sexually, an embryo develops from a zygote, the single cell resulting from the fertilization of the female egg cell by the male sperm cell. The zygote possesses half the DNA of each of its two parents. In plants, animals, and some protists, the zygote will begin to divide by mitosis to produce a multicellular organism. The result of this process is an embryo. - The menstrual cycle is the regular natural change that occurs in the female reproductive system (specifically the uterus and ovaries) that makes pregnancy possible. The cycle is required for the production of ovocytes, and for the preparation of the uterus for pregnancy. Up to 80% of women report having some symptoms during the one to two weeks prior to menstruation. Common symptoms include acne, tender breasts, bloating, feeling tired, irritability and mood changes. These symptoms interfere with normal life and therefore qualify as premenstrual syndrome in 20 to 30% of women. In 3 to 8%, they are severe. The first period usually begins between twelve and fifteen years of age, a point in time known as menarche. They may occasionally start as early as eight, and this onset may still be normal. The average age of the first period is generally later in the developing world and earlier in developed world. The typical length of time between the first day of one period and the first day of the next is 21 to 45 days in young women and 21 to 35 days in adults (an average of 28 days). Menstruation stops occurring after menopause which usually occurs between 45 and 55 years of age. Bleeding usually lasts around 2 to 7 days. The menstrual cycle is governed by hormonal changes. These changes can be altered by using hormonal birth control to prevent pregnancy. Each cycle can be divided into three phases based on events in the ovary (ovarian cycle) or in the uterus (uterine cycle). The ovarian cycle consists of the follicular phase, ovulation, and luteal phase whereas the uterine cycle is divided into menstruation, proliferative phase, and secretory phase. - Female () is the sex of an organism, or a part of an organism, that produces non-mobile ova (egg cells). Most female mammals, including female humans, have two X chromosomes. - Gestation is the carrying of an embryo or fetus inside female viviparous animals. It is typical for mammals, but also occurs for some non-mammals. Mammals during pregnancy can have one or more gestations at the same time (multiple gestations). - The female reproductive system (or female genital system) is made up of the internal and external sex organs that function in human reproduction. The female reproductive system is immature at birth and develops to maturity at puberty to be able to produce gametes, and to carry a fetus to full term. The internal sex organs are the uterus and Fallopian tubes, and the ovaries. The uterus or womb accommodates the embryo which develops into the fetus. The uterus also produces vaginal and uterine secretions which help the transit of sperm to the Fallopian tubes. The ovaries produce the ova (egg cells). The external sex organs are also known as the \\"genitals\\" and these are the organs of the vulva including the labia, clitoris and vaginal opening. The vagina is connected to the uterus at the cervix. - Secondary sex characteristics are features that appear at sexual maturity in animals and during puberty in humans, especially the sexually dimorphic phenotypic traits that distinguish the sexes of a species, but that, unlike the sex organs, are not directly part of the reproductive system. They are believed to be the product of sexual selection for traits which display fitness, giving an individual an advantage over its rivals in courtship and aggressive interactions. They are distinguished from the primary sex characteristics, the sex organs, which are directly necessary for sexual reproduction to occur. - The uterine cavity is the inside of the uterus. - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. - Hippocrates of Kos (\\"Hippokráts\\"; 460 370 BC), also known as Hippocrates II, was a Greek physician of the Age of Pericles (Classical Greece), and is considered one of the most outstanding figures in the history of medicine. He is referred to as the \\"Father of Modern Medicine\\" in recognition of his lasting contributions to the field as the founder of the Hippocratic School of Medicine. This intellectual school revolutionized medicine in ancient Greece, establishing it as a discipline distinct from other fields with which it had traditionally been associated (theurgy and philosophy), thus establishing medicine as a profession. - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction. - The hymen is a membrane that surrounds or partially covers the external vaginal opening. It forms part of the vulva, or external genitalia, and is similar in structure to the vagina. The hymen does not seem to have a specific physiological function or purpose. In children, although a common appearance of the hymen is crescent-shaped, many shapes are possible. Normal variations of the hymen range from thin and stretchy to thick and somewhat rigid; or it may also be completely absent. - In the anatomy of the female reproductive system, the cervical canal (also called the canal of the cervix, endocervical canal, cervical canal of uterus, or the cavity of cervix) is the spindle-shaped, flattened canal of the cervix, the neck of the uterus. - The uterus ( from Latin \`\` uterus '' , plural uteri ) or womb is a major female hormone - responsive reproductive sex organ of most mammals , including humans . One end , the cervix , opens into the vagina , while the other is connected to one or both fallopian tubes , ( uterine tubes ) depending on the species . It is within the uterus that the fetus develops during gestation , usually developing completely in placental mammals such as humans and partially in marsupials such as kangaroos and opossums . Two uteri usually form initially in a female and usually male fetus , and in placental mammals they may partially or completely fuse into a single uterus depending on the species . In many species with two uteri , only one is functional . Humans and other higher primates such as chimpanzees , usually have a single completely fused uterus , although in some individuals the uteri may not have completely fused . Horses , on the other hand , have bipartite uteri . In English , the term uterus is used consistently within the medical and related professions , while the Germanic - derived term womb is more common in everyday usage . Most animals that lay eggs , such as birds and reptiles , including most ovoviviparous species , have an oviduct instead of a uterus . Note however , that recent research into the biology of the viviparous ( not merely ovoviviparous ) skink Trachylepis ivensi has revealed development of a very close analogue to eutherian mammalian placental development . In monotremes , mammals which lay eggs , namely the platypus and the echidnas , either the term uterus or oviduct is used to describe the same organ , but the egg does not develop a placenta within the mother and thus does not receive further nourishment after formation and fertilization . Marsupials have two uteri , each of which connect to a lateral vagina and which both use a third , middle \`\` vagina '' which functions as the birth canal . Marsupial embryos form a choriovitelline \`\` placenta '' ( which can be thought of as something... - The reproductive system or genital system is a system of sex organs within an organism which work together for the purpose of sexual reproduction. Many non-living substances such as fluids, hormones, and pheromones are also important accessories to the reproductive system. Unlike most organ systems, the sexes of differentiated species often have significant differences. These differences allow for a combination of genetic material between two individuals, which allows for the possibility of greater genetic fitness of the offspring. - A classical language is a language with a literature that is \\"classical\\". According to UC Berkeley linguist George L. Hart, \\"it should be ancient, it should be an independent tradition that arose mostly on its own, not as an offshoot of another tradition, and it must have a large and extremely rich body of ancient literature.\\" - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - A zygote (from Greek \\"zygtos\\" \\"joined\\" or \\"yoked\\", from \\"zygoun\\" \\"to join\\" or \\"to yoke\\"), is a eukaryotic cell formed by a fertilization event between two gametes. The zygote's genome is a combination of the DNA in each gamete, and contains all of the genetic information necessary to form a new individual. In multicellular organisms, the zygote is the earliest developmental stage. In single-celled organisms, the zygote can divide asexually by mitosis to produce identical offspring. - Pubic hair is body hair found in the genital area of adolescent and adult humans, located on and around the sex organs, the crotch, and sometimes at the top of the inside of the thighs, in the pubic region around the pubis bone. - The classical Latin alphabet, also known as the Roman alphabet, is a writing system originally used by the ancient Romans to write the Latin language. The Latin alphabet evolved from the visually similar Cumaean Greek version of the Greek alphabet, which was itself descended from the Phoenician abjad, which in turn was derived from Egyptian hieroglyphics. The Etruscans who ruled early Rome adopted the Cumaean Greek alphabet which was modified over time to become the Etruscan alphabet, which was in turn adopted and further modified by the Romans to produce the Latin alphabet. - The Greek alphabet has been used to write the Greek language since the late 9th century BC or early 8th century BC It was derived from the earlier Phoenician alphabet, and was the first alphabetic script to have distinct letters for vowels as well as consonants. It is the ancestor of the Latin and Cyrillic scripts. Apart from its use in writing the Greek language, in both its ancient and its modern forms, the Greek alphabet today also serves as a source of technical symbols and labels in many domains of mathematics, science and other fields. - A fetus is a stage in the prenatal development of viviparous organisms. In human development, a fetus or foetus (plural fetuses or foetuses) is a prenatal human between the embryonic state and birth. The fetal stage of development tends to be taken as beginning at the gestational age of eleven weeks, i.e. nine weeks after fertilization. In biological terms, however, prenatal development is a continuum, with no clear defining feature distinguishing an embryo from a fetus. The use of the term \\"fetus\\" generally implies that an embryo has developed to the point of being recognizable as a human; this is the point usually taken to be the ninth week after fertilization. A fetus is also characterized by the presence of all the major body organs, though they will not yet be fully developed and functional and some not yet situated in their final anatomical location. - Childbirth, also known as labour and delivery, is the ending of a pregnancy by one or more babies leaving a woman's uterus. In 2015 there were about 135 million births globally. About 15 million were born before 37 weeks of gestation, while between 3 and 12% were born after 42 weeks. In the developed world most deliveries occur in hospital, while in the developing world most births take place at home with the support of a traditional birth attendant. The most common way of childbirth is a vaginal delivery. It involves three stages of labour: the shortening and opening of the cervix, descent and birth of the baby, and the pushing out of the placenta. The first stage typically lasts twelve to nineteen hours, the second stage twenty minutes to two hours, and the third stage five to thirty minutes. The first stage begins with crampy abdominal or back pains that last around half a minute and occur every ten to thirty minutes. The crampy pains become stronger and closer together over time. During the second stage pushing with contractions may occur. In the third stage delayed clamping of the umbilical cord is generally recommended. A number of methods can help with pain such as relaxation techniques, opioids, and spinal blocks. Most babies are born head first; however about 4% are born feet or buttock first, known as breech. During labour a woman can generally eat and move around as she likes, but pushing is not recommended during the first stage or during delivery of the head, and enemas are not recommended. While making a cut to the opening of the vagina is common, known as an episiotomy, it is generally not needed. In 2012, about 23 million deliveries occurred by a surgical procedure known as Caesarean section. Caesarean sections may be recommended for twins, signs of distress in the baby, or breech position. This method of delivery can take longer to heal from. Each year complications from pregnancy and childbirth result in about 500,000 maternal deaths, 7 million women have serious long term problems, and 50... - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance. - Birth, also known as parturition, is the act or process of bearing or bringing forth offspring. In mammals, the process is initiated by hormones which cause the muscular walls of the uterus to contract, expelling the fetus at a developmental stage when it is ready to feed and breathe. In some species the offspring is precocial and can move around almost immediately after birth but in others it is altricial and completely dependent on parenting. In marsupials, the fetus is born at a very immature stage after a short gestational period and develops further in its mother's pouch. - Protist is an informal term for any eukaryotic organism that is not an animal, plant or fungus. The protists do not form a natural group, or clade, but are often grouped together for convenience, like algae or invertebrates. In some systems of biological classification, such as the popular 5-kingdom scheme proposed by Robert Whittaker in 1969, the protists make up a kingdom called Protista, composed of \\"organisms which are unicellular or unicellular-colonial and which form no tissues.\\" - The cervix or cervix uteri (\\"\\") is the lower part of the uterus in the human female reproductive system. In a non-pregnant woman, the cervix is usually 2 to 3 cm long (~1 inch) and roughly cylindrical in shape. The narrow, central cervical canal runs along its entire length, connecting the uterine cavity and the lumen of the vagina. The opening into the uterus is called the internal os, and the opening into the vagina is called the external os. The lower part of the cervix, known as the vaginal portion of the cervix (or ectocervix), bulges into the top of the vagina. The cervix has been documented anatomically since at least the time of Hippocrates, over 2,000 years ago. - Facial hair is a secondary sex characteristic of human males, referring to the growth of hair on or around the chin, jowls, and philtrum. Men typically start developing facial hair in the later years of puberty or adolescence, between seventeen and twenty years of age, and most do not finish developing a full adult beard until their early twenties or later. This varies, as boys may first develop facial hair between fourteen and sixteen years of age, and boys as young as eleven have been known to develop facial hair. Women are also capable of developing facial hair, especially after menopause, though typically significantly less than men. - Sexual intercourse, or coitus or copulation, is principally the insertion and thrusting of the penis, usually when erect, into the vagina for sexual pleasure, reproduction, or both. This is also known as vaginal intercourse or vaginal sex. Other forms of penetrative sexual intercourse include anal sex (penetration of the anus by the penis), oral sex (penetration of the mouth by the penis or oral penetration of the female genitalia), fingering (sexual penetration by the fingers), and penetration by use of a dildo (especially a strap-on dildo). These activities involve physical intimacy between two or more individuals and are usually used among humans solely for physical or emotional pleasure and commonly contribute to human bonding.

He was head football coach at Southwestern University (now Rhodes College) from 1924 to 1927, at Clemson University from 1931 to 1939 and at Rice University from 1940 to 1966, compiling a career college football record of 207-176-19. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1971. Neely was also the head baseball coach at the University of Alabama (1929-1930), at Clemson (1932-1938) and at Rice (1945 and 1948), tallying a career college baseball mark of 109-108-5. In the second week of the 1921 season the Commodores shut out the Mercer Baptists, 42-0. Neely helped score one of four second-quarter touchdowns with a 55-yard pass to end Tot McCullough, and had a 25-yard punt return in the second half. In the next game, a 21-14 victory over the Kentucky Wildcats, the Wildcats scored against the Commodores for the first time in their history. Kentucky's second possession began with Bob Lavin fumbling the return, which was recovered by Neely on the 10-yard line. On third down, after little gain on first and second, Frank Godchaux ran an end-around touchdown. Rupe Smith scored the other two touchdowns, his first on a drive begun with a 22-yard pass from Neely to captain Pink Wade (father of later Vanderbilt quarterback Bill Wade). One Kentucky touchdown followed a blocked Neely punt. The Wildcats threatened to score late and tie the game, but they turned the ball over on downs at the two-yard line; Neely ran 34 yards, to the 36-yard line. In the season's sixth week, Vanderbilt defeated Alabama 14-0 at Birmingham in line with predictions. Neely played a role in both touchdowns. Early in the first quarter, Vanderbilt had the ball at midfield after an Alabama punt. Two line bucks preceded Neely's connection with Tot McCullough for a 30-yard pass play. Neely ran for about 17 yards more through left tackle, putting the ball on the nine-yard line. After a run by Frank Godchaux, Lynn Bomar bucked over the line for the touchdown and Rupe Smith made the field goal. The second scoring drive began with a pass interception by Paul Stumb. In the second half, quarterback Doc Kuhn invigorated the Commodores after he sat out the first half due to injuries; Neely ran for 21 yards around the right end, and Kuhn passed 25 yards to Tot McCullough. Rupe Smith (or Kuhn) then ran the remaining few yards for the touchdown. For its seventh game, Vanderbilt faced the defending Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA) champion Georgia Bulldogs at home. The game, the highlight of Vanderbilt's season, was described by The New York Times as an \\"important clash\\" and would determine the SIAA champion. Georgia scored during the first half; early in the fourth quarter Neely intercepted a pass, weaving for 25 yards to Georgia's 40-yard line before he was tackled by Jim Reynolds. Two long pass attempts failed, and Thomas Ryan lined up to punt. Rupert Smith sneaked behind Ryan; he rushed to recover the 25-yard onside kick, jumping up to get the ball off a bounce from the Bulldogs and racing for a 15-yard touchdown. The game ended in a tie, and the teams shared the SIAA championship. Vanderbilt finished its season against Sewanee in \\"the muddiest game in its history\\"; the Commodores were reportedly knee-deep in mud and water, with the players unrecognizable. The game was scoreless until the fourth quarter, when Sewanee fumbled the snap on a punt; the punter was smothered by the Commodores' Neely, Godchaux and Wade for a safety.

Question: suppose sulfur dioxide carried all over the world happens, how will it affect LESS bad effects of pollution. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect","output":"B: Less The process you have provided states that one type of air pollution is the addition of carbon dioxide gas into the air, which might contribute to global warming. Another example of air pollution mentioned is the damage to the ozone layer from methane gas and CFCs. Lastly, acid rain is created when gases like sulfur dioxide are released into the atmosphere and later washed out by rain, which can cause harm to forests and aquatic life. Now, let's consider the hypothetical scenario where sulfur dioxide is carried all over the world. In this situation, the impact of sulfur dioxide might slightly lessen the harmful effects of other pollutants on the environment. This is because sulfur dioxide can have some cooling properties when released into the atmosphere. It can form sulphate aerosols that reflect sunlight back into space, effectively cooling the Earth's surface. Nevertheless, while the overall cooling effect might counterbalance some negative consequences of pollution, it is essential to bear in mind that sulfur dioxide is not a solution to air pollution. Increased levels of sulfur dioxide can have harmful impacts on human health, including respiratory problems, irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, and even cause the formation of acid rain, as mentioned earlier. Additionally, a consistent rise in sulfur dioxide levels could generate an imbalance in global climate systems, causing further environmental issues. To conclude, the presence of sulfur dioxide spread all over the world may have the potential to marginally lessen the negative impacts of certain air pollutants, particularly those contributing to global warming. However, the harmful effects of sulfur dioxide itself could increase, leading to severe consequences for both human health and the environment. Therefore, instead of relying on sulfur dioxide, it is crucial to take appropriate actions to reduce all forms of air pollution and seek sustainable alternatives for a healthy environment."},{"instruction":"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Aileen Wuornos, an aging prostitute, meets Selby at a bar in Daytona Beach.

Answer: No Justification: Water is an essential component for all living organisms, including humans. Our bodies are made up of approximately 60% water, and it plays a vital role in various bodily functions. It regulates body temperature, helps in digestion, maintains blood pressure, aids in nutrient absorption, and supports waste elimination. Without water, our body would not be able to perform these necessary functions effectively, ultimately leading to dehydration and eventually death. The human body can survive without food for approximately three weeks, but it can only go about three to four days without water. Hence, living without water is impossible for humans."},{"instruction":"Q:What is the final step of the following process: - Sunlight shines on plants - Cells with chlorophyll in them capture the light energy - Plants absorb carbon dioxide through their stoma - Plants absorb water through their roots and other parts of themselves - Plants absorb minerals through their roots - Plants convert these inputs into sugars - Sugars can be used as energy sources - Oxygen and water are also produced A:","output":"The final step of the process you described is the release of oxygen and water by the plants as waste products. This process is known as oxygenic photosynthesis, and it can be summarized as follows: 1. Sunlight shines on plants, providing the energy necessary for photosynthesis. 2. Chlorophyll-containing cells within the plants capture the light energy. 3. Plants absorb carbon dioxide through their stomata, which are small openings on the surfaces of leaves. 4. Plants absorb water and minerals through their roots, which they use for various metabolic processes. 5. Inside the chloroplasts (the organelles where photosynthesis takes place), the absorbed light energy, carbon dioxide, water, and minerals are used to produce glucose – a simple sugar – through a series of chemical reactions. 6. Glucose can then be used by the plant as an energy source, or it can be converted into other molecules like cellulose (for structural support) or starch (for energy storage). 7. As a result of photosynthesis, oxygen and water are produced and released into the environment. Thus, the final step of this process is the release of oxygen and water by the plants. The oxygen is released into the atmosphere through the stomata, while the excess water is primarily released through transpiration – the loss of water by evaporation from the aerial parts of the plant, such as leaves and stems. This overall process plays a critical role in providing oxygen for respiration in other organisms and helps maintain Earth's atmospheric balance."},{"instruction":"What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? If you are not currently in a baccalaureate program or if it has been many years since you have been an undergraduate, you may demonstrate that your work experience makes you qualified for the program. While you may still be required to submit transcripts, prepare a thorough CV that demonstrates your experience. In your personal statement or statement of interest, you can explain how your work experience makes you uniquely qualified for the program. Many universities will ask for your job history. This is a good place to demonstrate how your experience outside of university has made you a competitive applicant. Typically, you will need at least three references, although this number can vary by university. Never list a faculty member as a reference until s/he gives you permission to do so. Always ask first. Give the faculty member at least two months of advance notice. Provide a copy of your CV and statement of research interests to help the writer craft the letter appropriately. To ask someone to write you a letter of recommendation, you can say, “I am applying to graduate school this fall. I was wondering if you would be willing to write me a letter of recommendation. I really value your good word.” If they agree, don’t forget to thank them. If it has been a few years since you graduated your baccalaureate program, you may want to ask recent employers or coworkers to write references for you. Choose people who can testify to your hard work and the skills needed for the graduate program. Graduate programs will often require not just a personal statement but also statements about your research interests, interest in the graduate school, and plans for the future. The length and requirements vary from university to university. While it may be tempting to write one statement and send it to all schools, it is best to tailor your personal statement to each school that you are attending. State why you are interested in each university and how it will help you achieve your goals. A personal statement is a short essay about your skills, experience, and unique characteristics that make you a strong applicant. A statement of research interests explores what you want to research and why. You may also state how you are qualified to begin this research. A statement of interest details why you are interested in that particular university. Here you might explain which faculty members you want to work with, classes you want to take, or opportunities that will be available to you. Many universities have writing centers where you can have a consultant read over your statements. They can not only proofread the statement but also give you suggestions as to things that you should include. It can take a few weeks for your current or former university to process requests for transcripts, and it can take a few more weeks after that for the transcript to reach the other school. Make sure that you submit your transcripts as early as possible so that they reach the schools you are applying to. If you are applying in the fall, you should request your transcripts around October. Graduate school applications will include many pages asking for details. They may ask you for personal information, job history, course history, a CV, writing sample, portfolio, and other personal details. Each application can take several hours, in addition to writing the statements and ordering the transcripts. Do not procrastinate, or leave it until the night before the deadline. Most applications charge a fee. You may be eligible to waive the fee if you are unable to pay. Contact the graduate school, and ask them about fee waivers. Read the application policies carefully. If the university wants all of your files in a PDF, make sure that you convert your files to PDF before you submit. Before you submit your application, double-check it to make sure that you filled everything out correctly and attached the proper documents.","output":"This article explains how people with work experience can apply for a graduate program by preparing a CV, getting recommendations, writing different statements, and following application guidelines."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Process: - A bird picks a spot high spot, often in a tree - The bird collects bits of sticks and grass - The sticks and grasses are placed between support branches - Leaves, mud and spider webs are added to the sticks - The mud, leaves and webs glue the sticks together - The solid nest supports the eggs - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less human interference in environment happens, how will it affect MORE or LARGER nests. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Based on the perturbation hypothesis provided, if there is less human interference in the environment, the potential consequences for birds could include more or larger nests. The effects of reduced human interference can be direct or indirect, impacting various aspects of the nesting process. Direct effects: 1. Availability of nesting sites: With less human interference, natural landscapes (e.g., trees, forests, and wetlands) can thrive. This would result in a higher availability of potential nesting sites for birds, potentially leading to more nests overall, as birds would have more options for choosing appropriate high spots. 2. Access to nest materials: Reduced human activity might also preserve the availability of natural resources and materials birds use for nest building, like sticks, grass, leaves, mud, and spider webs. An abundance of these materials may encourage birds to create more elaborate or larger nests to accommodate eggs and offspring. Indirect effects: 1. Food availability: Less human interference can promote a balanced and thriving ecosystem, with increased food resources for birds. This might enhance birds' survival rates, overall health, and breeding, which could encourage more nesting and support larger nest construction to accommodate larger family units. 2. Safety from predators: In undisturbed habitats, the natural balance between prey and predators could persist. Birds could experience a relatively stable predator population leading to lower nest predation risks, which might support the construction of more nests and the possibility to build larger nests. 3. Reduction of pollution and habitat disruption: With less human interference and environmental contamination, the general health and reproductive capabilities of bird species may increase. Healthy bird populations regenerating at a sustainable rate without significant habitat disruptions can naturally maintain and create more nests as needed. In conclusion, less human interference in the environment could potentially lead to more or larger nests, both directly and indirectly, as it can promote the overall health of bird populations, increase the availability of nesting sites, and provide necessary resources needed for nest-building processes."},{"instruction":"Answer the following Q with stream of consciousness.

The muddy plot, the latest in the so-called Millionaires' Row to go on the market, is now priced at £2m more than when it came with two houses. Despite being empty, the plot is the same price as an entire estate on the south shore of Loch Rannoch, Perthshire, which includes a castle, a swimming pool, 12 extra villas or bungalows, a sports hall, a golf course, a shooting range and an army assault course. If it sold at the asking price, the plot - which measures 27m by 18m - will equate to a staggering £1,161 per square foot. Scroll down for video. This narrow empty plot of land in the world-renowned Sandbanks area has gone on the market for a staggering £6.25million. The plot, the latest in the so-called Millionaires' Row to go on the market, is now priced at £2m more than when it came with two houses. The area, which measures 27m by 18m and already has planning permission, will equate to £1,161 per square feet if it sells for the asking price. But looking at it from another point of view - literally - it's perhaps easy to see why the small area has gone on the market for such an eye-watering sum. The reason that the sliver of land is set to fetch such an eye-watering sum is because it backs onto the beach and is located on the narrowest part of the peninsula, meaning that it boasts two-way views, including over Poole Harbour. A property two doors down holds the record for the most expensive house on the peninsula per square foot. The detached house sold last year for £3.45million, which worked out as £1,725 per square foot. Sandbanks is said to be the fourth most expensive place in the world - behind London, Manhattan and Tokyo - to buy property and counts Harry Redknapp and his son Jamie among its residents. Prices in the area have soared in the past few years, with prospective buyers even able to get more for their money in the exclusive London neighbourhood of Mayfair. At the moment, £6.75million could give buyers a two-bedroom flat, within spitting distance of Hyde Park. The latest plot in the exclusive resort has gone on the market after the owner decided to stay put in the house he currently rents. The owner initially bought the land, which included two 1960s houses, with the intention of building his dream home in their place. But while the planning application was being considered, he fell in love with the property he was living in and decided to remain there. He went ahead with knocking down the two houses on the Sandbanks plot, later securing permission for two four-bed houses, complete with their own gym and swimming pool. The planning permission stipulates that the twin properties would be 4,370 sq ft and 4,023 sq ft respectively and would be set over four floors with a terrace running all the way around. But whoever buys the land could face spending an additional £1million on building the new homes. When the existing owner bought the property, it consisted of two houses (pictured) which he knocked down to make way for his dream home. The site, situated in the sought-after resort of Sandbanks, backs onto the beach and boasts two-way views, including over Poole Harbour. Whoever buys the plot will face spending about £1m each on building the two new homes, which will be four-storey and four-bedroom. The owner intended to build his dream home on the plot but decided to stay in his current property, despite obtaining planning permission. The properties would be 4,370 sq ft and 4,023 sq ft respectively, set over four floors with a terrace running all the way round to enjoy the views. Sandbanks is said to be the fourth most expensive place in the world - behind London, Manhattan and Tokyo - to buy property. The prospective buyer will also count Harry Redknapp among their neighbours. The QPR manager bought his ultra-modern property with his wife Sandra for £3million in 2001 and commutes daily from his waterfront home to QPR's London-based ground Loftus Road. Troubled footballer Paul Gascoigne also reportedly moved to the exclusive resort earlier this year, where he is said to be renting a flash penthouse apartment. Other notable residents include a number of well-known names in football such as Crystal Palace manager Tony Pulis, former player and manager Graeme Souness, and Mr Redknapp's son Jamie. Computer magnate Sir Peter Ogden also has a home there. Adrian Dunford, of Tailor Made estate agents which is selling the empty plot, said: 'This is one of the few plots left along that section, most of the houses have now been replaced with new properties. 'A lot of those have been turned into apartments so they're unlikely to change again. A property in that particular area, two doors down from this one, holds the record for cost of a house per square foot. 'One of the reasons why the properties on that section go for so much is because of the two-way views. Historically that section has always been sought-after and the most expensive. Every home in the Sandbanks community (pictured from above) is within just a few minutes' walk of the beach, with most enjoying stunning views over the harbour or out to the English Channel. The property market on the peninsula has shot through the roof in the past few years, with many houses being demolished and replaced with cutting-edge new properties to meet demand (pictured) 'On the peninsula the houses are much larger, 13-14,000 sq ft, they will change hands for £8million, but this bit is the narrowest part of Sandbanks so the houses there can only be about 4-5,000 sq ft.' He added: 'Generally they are second homes on that stretch but we are seeing a change in fashion. Historically everybody wanted large homes but we are seeing more people very happy to live in something smaller and easier to manage. 'A lot of people are using them as their main home in the UK but then also have another home in France, Barbados or Monte Carlo. It means they don't have a huge maintenance bill when they're away. 'In that area people are only going to move when they pass away, because where do you move from there? You've got a nice plot, with two-way views, waves crashing on the beach - it's a great place to live.' The empty plot is more than the price of an entire estate on the south shore of Loch Rannoch, Perthshire, which includes a 38-bedroom castle. The £6m estate, which has this view, includes a swimming pool, 12 extra villas or bungalows, a sports hall, a golf course and a shooting range. Located on a small peninsula stretching across the mouth of Poole Harbour in Dorset, Sandbanks - nicknamed 'Britain's Palm Beach' - is known for both its picturesque beach and the high value of its sought-after property. By area, Sandbanks and surrounding Lilliput, Branksome Park and Canford Cliffs boasts the fourth highest land value in the world and the UK's largest concentration of expensive properties outside London. Sandbanks's popularity is attributed to its seclusion, and every home in the community is within just a few minutes' walk of the beach, with most of them enjoying stunning views over the harbour or out to the English Channel. Houses were first built on Sandbanks in the late 19th century, but it was not until the 1960s when a property boom saw the peninsula - measuring less than half a square mile - become more and more built-up, turning into a Millionaires' Row filled with luxury beachfront mansions. The property market on the peninsula has shot through the roof in the past few years, with many houses being demolished and replaced with cutting-edge new properties to meet demand. In July 2009 a 14,990 sq ft (1,393-square-metre) empty plot of land on the peninsula was put up for sale for £13.5million – the equivalent of nearly £10,000 per square metre. In May, a bungalow bought for just £1,000 almost a century ago (around £40,000 in today's money) and now a luxury holiday home was reported to be now worth £5million - a 500,000 percent increase in value. Earlier this year a tatty 1950s three-bedroom Sandbanks bungalow which would be worth just £200,000 in most other parts of the country went on sale for an eye-watering £2.25million. Prospective buyers could even get more for their money in Mayfair, where £6.75m could buy you this two-bedroom flat. In March, an empty plot on the exclusive enclave went on sale for £3million - double what it had sold for before its old bungalow was knocked down. Last year, 15 homes were sold for a combined total of £80million as Sandbanks' reputation has continued to grow. Mr Dunford added: 'The land is worth more without the old houses on it because it's all about the potential use of the land. 'Generally you can get more square footage in a modern build than you could just ten years ago. Properties now can build one or two floors higher so you get a larger house and a more popular layout. 'Most of the older properties are only two storeys and generally don't take full advantage of the two-way view. Construction now with no pillars or internal walls means you can sit in your kitchen and look both ways with no obstruction. You just can't get that in a 1970s build. 'The key thing that drives the value is we're surrounded by water. What you have got in Sandbanks is all you have, it's not like a rural place where you can expand and build a new village. And the more popular it becomes the more in demand plots like this are. If you want to be here you have to pay the money and people selling know that.'

The premise states that \\"A soccer player gets ready for a corner kick.\\" This tells us the situation on the field and the action the player is about to perform, which is taking a corner kick. The hypothesis states that \\"A soccer player yells at the ref.\\" This describes a different action involving a soccer player and the referee, where the player presumably expresses disagreement or frustration. Step 2: Identify the connection between premise and hypothesis. The connection to be analyzed is whether the action described in the premise (getting ready for a corner kick) leads to or entails the action described in the hypothesis (yelling at the ref). Step 3: Determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. In soccer, a player getting ready for a corner kick usually focuses on where they want to kick the ball and coordinates with their teammates for a possible goal. Yelling at the referee is a separate action that is not directly connected to taking a corner kick. While it might happen during a soccer game, there is no necessary connection between preparing for a corner kick and yelling at the referee.

He has won 43 events on the PGA Tour, including five major championships: three Masters titles (2004, 2006, 2010), a PGA Championship (2005), and an Open Championship (2013). Mickelson is one of 16 players in the history of golf to win at least three of the four majors. He has won every major except the U.S. Open, where he has finished runner-up a record six times. Mickelson's first major championship win came in his thirteenth year on the PGA Tour in 2004, when he secured victory in the Masters with an 18-foot (5.5 m) birdie putt on the final hole. Ernie Els was the runner-up at a stroke back; the two played in different pairs in the final round and had traded birdies and eagles on the back nine. In addition to getting the \\"majors monkey\\" off his back, Mickelson was now only the third golfer with a left-handed swing to win a major, the others being New Zealander Sir Bob Charles, who won The Open Championship in 1963, and Canadian Mike Weir, who won The Masters in 2003. (Like Mickelson, Weir is a right-hander who plays left-handed.) A fourth left-handed winner is natural southpaw Bubba Watson, the Masters champion in 2012 and 2014. Just prior to the Ryder Cup in 2004, Mickelson was dropped from his long-standing contract with Titleist/Acushnet Golf, when he took heat for a voicemail message he left for a Callaway Golf executive. In it he praised their driver and golf ball, and thanked them for their help in getting some equipment for his brother. This memo was played to all of their salesmen, and eventually found its way back to Titleist. He was then let out of his multi-year deal with Titleist 16 months early, and signed on with Callaway Golf, his current equipment sponsor. He endured a great deal of ridicule and scrutiny from the press and fellow Ryder Cup members for his equipment change so close to the Ryder Cup matches. He faltered at the 2004 Ryder Cup with a 1-3-0 record, but refused to blame the sudden change in equipment or his practice methods for his performance. In November 2004, Mickelson tallied his career-low for an 18-hole round: a 59 at the PGA Grand Slam of Golf at Poipu Bay Golf Course in Hawaii. The following year, Mickelson captured his second major at the PGA Championship at Baltusrol, in a Monday final-round conclusion that had been forced by inclement weather the previous day. On the 18th hole, Mickelson hit one of his trademark soft pitches from deep greenside rough to within a 18 inches (460 mm) of the cup, and made his birdie to finish at a 4-under-par total of 276, one shot ahead of Steve Elkington and Thomas Bjorn. Mickelson captured his third major title the following spring at the Masters. He won his second green jacket after shooting a 3-under-par final round, winning by two strokes over runner-up Tim Clark. This win propelled him to 2nd place in the Official World Golf Ranking (his career best), behind Woods, and ahead of Vijay Singh and Retief Goosen.

Dig around the tree and extract the roots while removing the soil on them. Plant in the new container filled with Bonsai soil mixture. The reason option A is the better choice for transplanting a bonsai plant from a training container to a ceramic display container is because it allows for better root pruning and promotes a healthy development of the roots in the new environment. By removing the soil around the roots, you can cut back on large roots, untangle any root-bound areas, and ensure that the roots will adapt well to the new Bonsai soil mixture. Option B is not the better choice because lifting a large amount of soil with the roots may cause unnecessary stress on the tree and make it harder to properly prune the roots before transplanting.

If 36 percent of the components were manufactured by Machine A and the remainder were manufactured by Machine B, what is the highest possible number of components that were manufactured by the machine that would manufacture them the most efficiently? Options: (A) 30 (B) 31 (C) 32 (D) 33 (E) 34","output":"Let's break down the problem step-by-step to find the highest possible number of components that were manufactured by the machine that would manufacture them the most efficiently. 1. First, determine how many components should be manufactured by Machine A and Machine B based on efficiency: - 70% of 50 components = 0.7 x 50 = 35 components (Machine A) - 30% of 50 components = 0.3 x 50 = 15 components (Machine B) 2. Now, we know that 36% of the components were actually manufactured by Machine A and the remainder by Machine B: - 36% of 50 components = 0.36 x 50 = 18 components (Machine A) - The remainder (50 - 18) = 32 components (Machine B) 3. To maximize the number of components manufactured efficiently, we need to make sure that Machine A is used to manufacture as many of its 35 optimal components as possible. Since Machine A actually manufactured 18 components, all 18 of those must be from the 35 optimal components for Machine A. 4. At this point, we have: - 18 efficiently manufactured components by Machine A - 17 remaining components that should be efficiently manufactured by Machine A - 15 components that should be efficiently manufactured by Machine B 5. Now, let's look at Machine B's workload. It manufactured 32 components, but only 15 of them should have been manufactured by Machine B efficiently. Since Machine B has already manufactured 17 components that should have been done by Machine A, it must also manufacture its optimal 15 components. 6. Combining the efficient manufacturing done by Machine A and Machine B: - 18 (Machine A) + 15 (Machine B) = 33 components 7. Therefore, the highest possible number of components that were manufactured by the machine that would manufacture them the most efficiently is 33.

To better support this conclusion, I will provide an assessment for each of the response options you have presented. 1.

No: Similarly to the first option, this response conflicts with the positive review.

Maybe: A \\"maybe\\" recommendation could be fitting because the review is so brief, and we cannot fully gauge the overall user experience. Additional information about specific features and ease of use might be useful. However, considering the review's positive nature, a \\"maybe\\" response seems slightly cautious. 4. Yes: This response aligns well with the positive review. The reviewer indicates that the app functions as expected and effectively accomplishes its intended purpose. This makes it more likely that I would recommend the app to a friend, especially if it seems relevant to their needs or interests. 5. Definitely: Although the review is positive, it is not overly enthusiastic or particularly informative.

In conclusion, my recommendation, considering the brief but positive review, would be primarily leaning towards a \\"Yes\\" response, with a secondary consideration of a \\"Maybe.\\" While the reviewer asserts that the app works and performs its intended function, we could benefit from more context and information for a stronger and more accurate recommendation.

A year ago this week, Moon, a former human rights lawyer and candidate for the progressive Democratic Party, won a special presidential election held after former conservative President Park Geun-hye was impeached for her involvement in a bribery and corruption scandal. This year, Park was sentenced to 24 years in prison during criminal trial related to the scandal in which she was charged with abuse of power, coercion and bribery. Moon assumed power at a time of increasing tensions, not just concerning North Korea’s accelerated nuclear and ballistic missile tests, but also China’s imposing of informal economic sanctions against South Korea for deploying the U.S. THAAD missile defense system, and the Trump administration’s talk of possible military action to end the North’s efforts to develop a nuclear armed intercontinental missile that could strike the U.S. mainland. In his inaugural address in May 2017, Moon promised to engage in shuttle diplomacy with Washington, Beijing and Pyongyang to work out a peaceful solution to the growing crisis.

He observed that current EMR solutions inhibited medical professionals from providing the best possible care to their patients while causing significant frustration and lost time. Consequently, he decided to develop a revolutionary solution—one that would make healthcare processes more seamless and, ultimately, enhance patient outcomes. The Disruption Strategy To disrupt the healthcare industry, John first needed to develop a product that would address the existing pain points effectively while offering compelling benefits. His strategy consisted of the following building blocks: 1. Deep Understanding of the Industry: John began by thoroughly researching and understanding the healthcare industry, including healthcare providers, patients, and other stakeholders. His goal was to identify trends, needs, and gaps that his solution could address and bridge effectively. 2. Building a Unique and Comprehensive Solution: John's next step was to develop a product concept that would integrate the latest advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and blockchain technology. His vision entailed designing a solution that could address the existing issues within the realm of EMRs and propel healthcare providers into a more digitally-optimized domain. 3. Creating a Win-Win Value Proposition: To ensure that he could stand out in a saturated market, John focused on offering value to multiple stakeholders, including healthcare providers, patients, and insurance companies. By creating a win-win situation, he aimed to secure buy-in from the entire healthcare ecosystem and facilitate widespread adoption. 4. Implementing a Multi-pronged Marketing Approach: Given the conservative nature of the healthcare industry, John knew that traditional marketing strategies would not suffice. In response, he devised a multi-pronged approach that focused on building credibility, showcasing the value of his product through case studies and user testimonials, and obtaining regulatory approvals. The Path of Disruption John started by assembling a team of technologists, medical experts, and industry veterans dedicated to realizing his vision. Together, they created a cloud-based EMR solution called \\"MediChain,\\" which features AI-driven data analysis, interoperability between different healthcare systems, high levels of cybersecurity, and an intuitive user interface designed for efficiency. To penetrate the market, John pursued key partnerships with healthcare providers and insurers, who saw the immense potential in MediChain's ability to revolutionize the cumbersome EMR process. By collaborating closely with early adopters, John received invaluable feedback that further refined and improved the product. Outcome and Future Prospects As MediChain gained traction, it started disrupting the conventional healthcare landscape. Healthcare providers discovered newfound levels of efficiency, collaboration, and data access that translated into tangible benefits for their patients. John's innovation propelled the healthcare industry forward by providing a critical solution that addressed the ongoing EMR challenges. John now aims to expand MediChain's reach globally, forging alliances with more healthcare systems and insurance companies, and making his solution the new norm for efficient and effective healthcare worldwide. Conclusion Disruption is the result of a deep understanding of the existing gaps and an unrelenting drive to create solutions that deliver far-reaching benefits. John Doe's strategy demonstrates how a systemic approach involving industry knowledge, strategic planning, and a multi-pronged marketing approach can result in a successful disruptor that challenges long-held assumptions and propels an industry towards a more efficient, effective future. By learning from his approach, entrepreneurs in various sectors can work together to cultivate meaningful innovations that positively impact both stakeholders and society at large."},{"instruction":"What happens next?

First off, the universe is constantly expanding, and new stars are being formed every day, while others die off. Second, due to the immense distances involved and the limitations of our current observation technology, we have only been able to observe a tiny portion of the universe.

Bugs freak Sarah out, while Katrina is a lover of them","output":"Indeed, Sarah was always one person who could never understand the fascination with bugs. The idea of them crawling with their numerous legs, their shells, the way some of them buzzed - everything about them simply sent chills down her spine. She tried not to judge those who did enjoy studying or interacting with bugs, yet she couldn't wrap her mind around it. Katrina, on the other hand, adored them with a passion that was alien to Sarah. Katrina lived with an enthusiasm for bugs that Sarah found both bewildering and slightly mind-boggling. Her room looked like an entomologist's dream. Different kinds of live bugs were housed in individual terrariums, each designed to replicate their natural habitats. Posters of insects filled the spaces between the terrariums on her wall. Books about insects and spiders littered the tabletops and the floor around her table and bed. Even her clothes and accessories had bug motifs. Katrina's love for bugs went deep. As others felt for dogs, cats, and other more \\"conventional\\" pets, she felt for bugs. She diligently fed her live specimens, monitored their health, and cleaned the environments she kept them in. She spent hours poring over her bug-focused texts, learning and discovering further curious truths about her little, shelled friends. Katrina wasn't satisfied with just being a bug lover; she was an ambassador, advocate, and student for them. Sarah and Katrina, despite being polar opposites in their emotion for bugs, were the best of friends. In their own weird, unexpected synergy, they balanced each other out. Sarah was a neat freak, and though Katrina's room was filled with bugs, it was an antiseptic cleanliness that would make a five-star hotel jealous. Sarah would ensure that, while Katrina spent her time taking care of her many-legged friends. Their adventures were many. Like the time they stumbled upon an unknown type of beetle during a field trip. Sarah, ever the supportive friend, battled her revulsion to help Katrina examine it for scientific analysis. It led to that paper Katrina got published in a junior science journal. Or when Sarah faced her fears to let a ladybug land on her, encouraged by Katrina's calm nature and educational words about the bug's harmless nature. Though bugs freaked Sarah out, and Katrina was a lover of them; both learnt a lot from each other's differences. Sarah realized that though she wouldn't go out of her way to engage with bugs, she didn't have to be irrationally afraid of them. In return, through interacting with Sarah, Katrina learned about tidy habits, engaging with people, and the world outside of bugs and bug-based research. In the grand scheme of things, Sarah's bug-phobic tendencies and Katrina's bug-loving habits played off each other well, showing one important message: It takes all kinds to make the world. After all, just like us humans, even bugs have their haters, lovers, and those who couldn't care.

Which country had less acid precipitation fall in forests? Italy and Greece attended the World Ecological Conference. they were looking for solutions to improve their environment. Italy's air was very polluted, while Greece had problems with drought. Hint: One result of air pollution is acid rain. Acid rain is precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust. A:","output":"Based on the provided information, it can be inferred that Greece had less acid precipitation fall in forests compared to Italy. The paragraph mentions that Italy's air was very polluted, while Greece had problems with drought. Since air pollution is a contributing factor to the formation of acid rain, it is likely that Italy experienced more acid precipitation than Greece. Acid rain forms when sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides – mainly released from coal-fired power plants and motor vehicle exhaust – react with water, oxygen, and other chemicals in the atmosphere to form acidic compounds. These acidic compounds then fall to the ground in the form of precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. Acid rain is particularly damaging to forests, freshwater habitats, and soils, as it can kill insects, aquatic life, and lead to soil degradation due to its very low pH. In summary, Greece likely had less acid precipitation fall in forests compared to Italy, as Italy's air was heavily polluted, which contributes to the formation of acid rain, while Greece faced issues with drought instead."},{"instruction":"Me tarvitsemme tätä, sillä kyse ei ole pelkästään yritysten oikeuksista, vaan myös potilaiden oikeuksista saada helpotusta geneettisiin sairauksiin.

Here is a detailed analysis of the two sentences: Sentence 1: \\"Next year they'll be uh playing, and I know Memphis State was even in a few of them where they got uh couldn't play.\\" In this sentence, the speaker mentions that \\"they\\" (likely referring to a sports team or players) will be playing next year. Furthermore, the speaker knows that Memphis State (a university, now known as the University of Memphis) was involved in some capacity. The speaker also adds that there were instances where Memphis State \\"couldn't play.\\" Sentence 2: \\"Memphis State's ability to play was uninhibited.\\" The second sentence states that Memphis State's ability to play was not hindered or restricted. This sentence has a somewhat contradictory relationship with the first sentence. As the first sentence mentioned instances where Memphis State \\"couldn't play,\\" it implies that there were situations or circumstances that reduced or stopped their ability to play. Moreover, the first sentence does not provide any definitive information on whether Memphis State's ability to play will be uninhibited next year. It only implies past situations where Memphis State was unable to play. While there is no clear indication of uninhibited play in the future, the first sentence suggests that the team will engage in games next year. In summary, Sentence 2 is not directly entailed by Sentence 1, as the latter contains information about past instances where Memphis State couldn't play. However, the two sentences share a connection in that they both discuss Memphis State's ability to play. Sentence 1 suggests the possibility of Memphis State playing uninhibitedly next year but does not entail it explicitly."},{"instruction":"Here is a premise: \\"Triangular blue and red flags flutter in the wind.\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"Flags on a boat blow in the wind\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?","output":"The premise provided is \\"Triangular blue and red flags flutter in the wind.\\" This particular sentence gives some information about the flags, including their shape (triangular) and color (blue and red), as well as the fact that they are fluttering in the wind. The hypothesis presented is \\"Flags on a boat blow in the wind.\\" This statement suggests that the flags are specifically on a boat and are affected by the wind. To determine if the premise supports the hypothesis, we must analyze the information provided in each statement. Although the premise mentions flags and the fact that they are fluttering in the wind, there is no specific information about the location of the flags, whether they are on a boat, or any other context about their surroundings. The hypothesis, on the other hand, implies a more specific situation, where the flags are on a boat and blowing in the wind. However, the premise does not offer any details about the flags' placement or association with a boat, making it impossible to confirm or refute the hypothesis solely based on the information given in the premise. In conclusion, the premise does not provide enough information to determine if the hypothesis is true or false. Although both statements involve flags and their movement in the wind, the premise lacks the necessary contextual details about the flags' location, and as such, it cannot be deduced whether the flags are, in fact, on a boat or blowing in the wind due to some other scenario.

Put the slime in a sealed container or zippered sandwich bag.\\"","output":"Title: Homemade Washable Marker Slime: A Fun and Creative Activity for Kids and Adults Alike Introduction If you're on the hunt for a fun, creative, and engaging activity that not only entertains but also inspires learning and stimulates creativity, look no further than homemade slime! And not just any slime, but washable marker slime. This innovative project combines the world of arts and crafts with the science of slime-making, resulting in a vibrant, playful concoction that is perfect for kids of all ages – and adults too! In this article, we will walk you through the process of creating washable marker slime using simple ingredients and easy-to-follow instructions. Materials You Will Need 1. White school glue 2. Water 3. A thick washable marker (color of your choice) 4. A glass or plastic bowl 5. A stirring utensil (a spoon, Popsicle stick, or plastic knife) 6. A sealed container or zippered sandwich bag Instructions for Making Washable Marker Slime Step 1: Mixing The Glue And Water The first step in creating your washable marker slime is combining equal parts white school glue and water in a glass or plastic bowl. Using a measuring cup, determine how much slime you'd like to create, and pour the appropriate amount of glue into the bowl. If you're unsure about the ideal ratio, start with a 1:1 ratio (e.g. 1/2 cup of glue to 1/2 cup of water). This will produce a manageable amount of slime to experiment with. Pour the same amount of water into the bowl as the glue, and mix thoroughly until the two ingredients are fully combined. Step 2: Selecting And Preparing Your Washable Marker Next, choose a thick washable marker in the color of your choice. The variety of colors provides an opportunity for personalization and creativity, so feel free to select one that sparks your imagination or simply use your favorite color. Once you've chosen your marker, remove the end cap, exposing the absorbent tip that contains the ink. Step 3: Adding Color To The Glue Mixture With the washable marker's tip exposed, carefully squeeze out 1 to 2 drops of the colored ink into the glue and water mixture. You can adjust the amount of ink depending on the desired color intensity. Keep in mind that the color will become lighter as it combines with the glue and water. Be cautious when handling the marker, as the ink can stain clothes and surfaces. Step 4: Stirring The Color Into The Glue Mixture Once you've added the desired amount of color to the glue mixture, use a stirring utensil (a spoon, Popsicle stick, or plastic knife) to mix the color thoroughly into the liquid. Continue stirring until the color is evenly distributed, and there are no streaks or patches of unmixed color. The mixture will begin to thicken and take on the texture of slime during this process. Step 5: Storing Your Homemade Slime Finally, once the slime reaches your preferred consistency and color, transfer it to a sealed container or a zippered sandwich bag for storage. Ensure that the container is fully sealed to prevent the slime from drying out. Properly stored slime will stay fresh and pliable for an extended period, allowing for hours of entertainment and fun. Conclusion Creating homemade washable marker slime is an exciting and engaging activity that not only offers endless enjoyment but also encourages creativity, sensory stimulation, and hands-on learning. By following these simple steps, families and individuals can create their own personalized slime that can be used for play, stress relief, or even as an educational tool. So gather your supplies, roll up your sleeves, and dive into the world of washable marker slime for an unforgettable artistic adventure!"},{"instruction":"Q:Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

The Clark County Sheriff’s Office announced Tuesday that 18-year-old Taylor Smith has been cooperating with investigators, who have finished their probe and forwarded the case to the county prosecutor’s office for potential charges. Police said Smith pushed 16-year-old Jordan Holgerson off a bridge at Moulton Falls Regional Park on Aug. 7. The younger teen plunged more than three stories before belly flopping into the river below, a fall that resulted in six broken ribs, two punctured lungs and multiple internal injuries and cuts. The girl also has a mass behind her windpipe. Smith, who would not go on camera, told NBC News in a text that she has apologized repeatedly to Holgerson and “feels really bad about what happened.” She also said she has kept away from home because she has been receiving threats. Taylor Smith, 18, has been identified as the young woman who pushed her friend off a 60-foot bridge in Washington state earlier this month. Courtesy of Ashley Mahree The entire incident was captured in a chilling video clip that ricocheted across the internet. It has since been removed from social media. “I could've died, easily,” Holgerson she said in an interview from the hospital days after the incident. Trauma surgeon MaryClare Sarff said when a fall is three times a person’s height, there’s a 50 percent chance of death. Holgerson’s drop was far greater. \\"When you're falling that high, from that height, the water is like concrete,\\" Sarff said. Holgerson said she received a single apology, via text, by Smith. She’s now at home recovering, but continues to have a hard time breathing, she said. Doctors said it may take months to fully heal. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"A teenage girl, Jordan Holgerson, suffered severe injuries after her friend, Taylor Smith, pushed her off a 60-foot bridge into the Lewis River in Vancouver, Washington. Jordan cracked five ribs and punctured her lung from the fall. Taylor, who has been cooperating with investigators, may face charges for her actions. The event was captured on video and has since circulated on the internet, raising questions about the consequences and responsibility of such actions."},{"instruction":"Which motorway crosses the original Severn Bridge – the M4 was diverted when the second crossing opened?","output":"The original Severn Bridge, which opened in 1966, was initially designated as the M4 motorway. The bridge spans the River Severn and connects the English counties of Gloucestershire and South Gloucestershire, with Monmouthshire in Wales. Serving as an essential transportation route between England and Wales, the Severn Bridge was designed to alleviate traffic congestion on the existing ferry services and A48 road. When the bridge opened, the M4 motorway crossed the Severn Bridge and the M4 continued westwards across South Wales via Newport and Cardiff before terminating near Port Talbot. However, the high level of traffic between the two countries and the increased truck loadings necessitated the opening of a second crossing, the Second Severn Crossing (now officially named the Prince of Wales Bridge). This second crossing was completed in 1996 and designated as the new M4 motorway, because it was built to a higher standard than the original bridge, particularly concerning wind resistance and road capacity. Following the opening of the second crossing, the original Severn Bridge was re-designated as part of the M48 motorway. The M48 motorway runs from Junction 21 of the M4 at Awkley near Olveston in England to Junction 23 of the M4 at Magor in Wales. Crossing the original Severn Bridge, the M48 motorway serves as a shorter but less direct alternative route between England and Wales and is often used by local traffic, tourists, and as a diversion route when the new M4 crossing experiences maintenance work or accidents. In summary, the original Severn Bridge, which was once part of the M4 motorway, now carries the M48 motorway since the opening of the second crossing in 1996. The M48 runs parallel to the M4 and allows drivers to experience the original bridge, while the M4 continues on the newer, more resistant Prince of Wales Bridge."},{"instruction":"Leo: Can we conclude from \\"A man wearing a get a job t-shirt takes a picture of the camera holder with a bright yellow camera while also holding a photo in his left hand.\\" that \\"The guy is not naked.\\"?

Context: The Department of Health and Human Services lost track of nearly 1,500 migrant children it placed with sponsors in the United States, an agency official told a Senate subcommittee Thursday. The children were taken into government care after they showed up alone at the Southwest border. Most of the children are from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, and were fleeing drug cartels, gang violence and domestic abuse. The agency learned the 1,475 children could not be found after making follow-up calls to check on their safety, the committee was told. The news has raised concern that the children could fall into the hands of human traffickers or be used as laborers by people posing as relatives. “You are the worst foster parents in the world. You don’t even know where they are,” said Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. “We are failing. I don’t think there is any doubt about it. And when we fail kids, that makes me angry.” Since the dramatic surge of border crossings in 2013, the federal government has placed more than 180,000 unaccompanied minors with parents or other adult sponsors who are expected to care for the children and help them attend school while they seek legal status in immigration court. An AP investigation in 2016 found that more than two dozen of those children had been sent to homes where they were sexually assaulted, starved or forced to work for little or no pay. Since then, the Department Health and Human Services has boosted outreach to at-risk children deemed to need extra protection, and last year offered post-placement services to about one-third of unaccompanied minors. But advocates say it is hard to know how many minors may be in dangerous conditions, in part because some disappear before social workers can follow up with them, and they never show up in court. Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio gave HHS and the Department of Homeland Security until Monday to deliver a time frame for improving monitoring. “These kids, regardless of their immigration status, deserve to...

Today, we're going to learn about a new law in a big city called New York. This law helps some people keep their names a secret. Let's find out how! New York is a place where many people live. Some of these people have a special paper called a \\"pistol permit.\\" This paper allows them to carry a small kind of gun called a \\"pistol.\\" In the past, other people could find out the names of those with a pistol permit. But now, things have changed. In January, the leaders of New York passed a special rule called a \\"gun-control bill.\\" This bill helps make sure that guns stay safe in the city. One of the things this bill does is it lets pistol permit holders keep their names a special secret, away from public records. Public records are like a big book where everyone's information is kept. Now, the names of these pistol permit holders do not appear in this big book. Why did they make this rule? Well, sometimes people share information that others might not want to be shared. In December, a newspaper shared the names of people who owned handguns in two areas of New York. A handgun is a kind of gun that's small enough to hold, like a pistol. Some people didn't like that the newspaper shared this information. So, New York decided to make a rule that would protect the privacy of these pistol permit holders. In conclusion, New York has made a new rule to keep the names of pistol permit holders private. This means that people with these special papers can feel safer. Just like how we have secrets, these people can now keep their names a secret too!"},{"instruction":"Select the topic that this about: By Amanda Gardner, HealthDay Reporter HealthDayNews -- Health experts are trying to move the nation's battle of the bulge to an important new front: the schools.

Smugglers have constantly evolved their strategies to outsmart the authorities, using techniques that are both creative and daring. One such incident came to light recently, where a man attempted to smuggle a staggering £11m worth of heroin into the UK concealed within charcoal boxes. Ultimately, his plan was foiled, resulting in his arrest and eventual incarceration. Background of the Smuggling Attempt The elaborate scheme was executed by a man whose main objective was to import a massive shipment of heroin, worth approximately £11 million, into the United Kingdom. He meticulously planned his smuggling operation, choosing a shipment medium that could potentially disguise the presence of the drugs. The cunning choice of concealment? Charcoal boxes. He believed that these boxes would go unnoticed, potentially under the guise of a legitimate commercial consignment. Details of the Failed Smuggling Attempt Despite the careful planning, the perpetrator was in for a rude awakening as the authorities successfully detected the presence of heroin in the charcoal shipment. The UK Border Force officials, vigilant in their inspections, identified the hidden drugs during a routine examination. Following various sophisticated methods like X-ray imaging, sniffer dogs, and chemical analysis, the officials made a breakthrough in uncovering the concealed narcotics. Upon gaining concrete evidence of the smuggling attempt, the officials carried out a swift and decisive operation, resulting in the arrest of the would-be smuggler. The man's dreams of profiting from the illegal drug trade were dashed as he found himself facing the full force of the law for his criminal endeavor. Consequences and Legal Repercussions Following the arrest, the man faced several charges relating to drug trafficking and possession with intent to supply Class A drugs. The case was taken to court, and the magnitude of the illegal endeavor ensured a swift and severe verdict. The individual was consequently slapped with a lengthy prison sentence, receiving a strong message about the zero-tolerance policy towards drug trafficking in the UK. The successful bust demonstrated the firm stance of the UK authorities in their battle against the drug trade. Impact on Society This heroin smuggling attempt serves as a stark reminder that the illegal drug trade continues to threaten global peace and harm the well-being of citizens. Substance abuse has plagued communities, leading to destitution, crime, and loss of lives. By foiling such drug smuggling operations, UK authorities are working to protect the society from the severe repercussions of the drug trade. Furthermore, it is essential to recognize the dedication and vigilance of the UK Border Force officials, who continuously risk their lives to ensure the safety and security of the nation. Their unwavering commitment to fighting the illegal drug trade is a testament to public service and sets an example for similar organizations around the world. Conclusion The case of the man trying to smuggle £11m worth of heroin hidden in charcoal boxes serves as a cautionary tale for those willing to engage in such nefarious activities. It stands as a testimony to the efficiency of the UK Border Force and the authorities in general, who work diligently to combat drug smuggling and ensure the protection of society. Moreover, this incident highlights the importance of international cooperation in the efforts to dismantle drug trafficking networks and the need for continued technological advancements in drug detection methods. The ongoing battle against substance abuse may be arduous, but the relentless efforts of law enforcement and society's commitment to eradicating this scourge are the bedrocks for a safer future."},{"instruction":"Alfred North Whitehead: In higher organisms (like people), these two modes of perception combine into what Whitehead terms \\"symbolic reference\\", which links appearance with causation in a process that is so automatic that both people and animals have difficulty refraining from it. By way of illustration, Whitehead uses the example of a person's encounter with a chair. An ordinary person looks up, sees a colored shape, and immediately infers that it is a chair. However, an artist, Whitehead supposes, \\"might not have jumped to the notion of a chair\\", but instead \\"might have stopped at the mere contemplation of a beautiful color and a beautiful shape.\\" This is not the normal human reaction; most people place objects in categories by habit and instinct, without even thinking about it. Moreover, animals do the same thing. Using the same example, Whitehead points out that a dog \\"would have acted immediately on the hypothesis of a chair and would have jumped onto it by way of using it as such.\\" In this way symbolic reference is a fusion of pure sense perceptions on the one hand and causal relations on the other, and that it is in fact the causal relationships that dominate the more basic mentality (as the dog illustrates), while it is the sense perceptions which indicate a higher grade mentality (as the artist illustrates). Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\".

The house's guide price is £80,000 less than the average house price in England and Wales. It was at a nearby bus stop that he met and became friends with a young McCartney. McCartney introduced him to his friend John Lennon, and invited him to join Lennon's band, The Quarrymen. They would regularly rehearse at 25 Upton Green and it was from the doorstep that a famous photo was taken of Harrison, then 15, heading off to a Quarrymen gig holding his guitar. A portrait of an older Harrison while in The Beatles. But it wasn't long before they had outgrown the small, terraced house.

He also found success as a solo performer after the band's break-up in 1970, before his death from lung cancer in 2001.

Set in New France in 1634 (in the period of conflicts known as the Beaver Wars), the film begins in the settlement that will one day become Quebec City. Jesuit missionaries are trying to encourage the local Algonquin Indians to embrace Christianity, with thus far only limited results. Samuel de Champlain, founder of the settlement, sends Father LaForgue, a young Jesuit priest, to find a distant Catholic mission in a Huron village. With winter approaching, the journey will be difficult and cover as much as 1500 miles. LaForgue is accompanied on his journey by a non-Jesuit assistant, Daniel, and a group of Algonquin Indians whom Champlain has charged with guiding him to the Huron village. This group includes Chomina – an older, experienced traveller who has clairvoyant dreams; his wife; and Annuka, their daughter. As they journey across the lakes and forests, Daniel and Annuka fall in love, to the discomfort of the celibate LaForgue. The group meet with a band of Montagnais, First Nations people who have never met Frenchmen before. The Montagnais shaman, the \\"mestigoit\\", is suspicious (and implicitly jealous) of LaForgue's influence over the Algonquins. He accuses him of being a devil. He encourages Chomina and the other Algonquins to abandon the two Frenchmen and travel instead to a winter hunting lodge. This they do, paddling away from the Frenchmen. LaForgue accepts his fate, but Daniel is determined to stay with Annuka and follows the Indians as they march across the forest.

The answer is:","output":"No. The suggested answer does not provide enough context and information to fully understand the Berlin Blockade problem. A more detailed answer would be: The Berlin Blockade (June 24, 1948 – May 12, 1949) was a Soviet attempt to gain control of Berlin by cutting off all land access to the city. After World War II, Germany was divided into four Allied occupation zones, and Berlin, which was situated deep within the Soviet-occupied zone, was similarly split into four sectors controlled by the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union. The problem arose when the western powers (the United States, the United Kingdom, and France) decided to introduce a new currency, the Deutsche Mark, in their zones. The Soviet Union opposed this move because it weakened its influence in Germany. The situation escalated when the Soviets launched the blockade to pressure the western powers to reverse their decision on the currency reform and give the Soviets more control over the city. They stopped all rail, road, and waterway access to Berlin, effectively cutting off vital supplies of food and fuel for West Berlin. In response, the U.S. and U.K. initiated the Berlin Airlift, a massive operation to fly essential supplies into West Berlin. Over the course of 11 months, nearly 2.3 million tons of goods were flown into the city, enough to prevent mass starvation and maintain a basic standard of living among the affected population. This ultimately forced the Soviet Union to lift the blockade on May 12, 1949, which was a significant marker in the early stages of the Cold War.

It’s a bit tough with the limited social interactions due to the current situation, though. Kurtis: Oh, I can imagine! Have you tried picking up any new skills? I've seen people getting into baking, painting, even learning new languages during this time. Maybe there's something that sparks your interest. Davis: That's a good idea, Mom. I might try picking up guitar again or maybe join an online fitness class to stay active. I've been missing the gym, so I think that’d be a good outlet. Kurtis: Oh, that sounds like a great plan! Staying active will help you feel better both physically and mentally, especially during these tough times. And who knows, maybe you'll discover a new passion or even connect with new people who share your interest. Davis: Definitely, it's worth a shot. Anyway, how’s your quilt coming along? I know Aunt Lisa will just love it. Kurtis: Thank you! The quilt is coming together nicely. I'm working on the last few squares now, and then I'll start putting it all together. The time and effort will be worth it, especially knowing how much she'll appreciate it. Davis: I can't wait to see the finished product. Aunt Lisa is always so appreciative of handmade gifts. Have you guys settled on any plans for her birthday celebration yet? Kurtis: We're thinking of having a small family dinner at our place, with just immediate family members. It'll be a nice, intimate gathering where we can truly enjoy each other's company without any distractions. Of course, we'll make sure to take all the necessary precautions to ensure everyone's safety. Davis: That sounds like a fantastic plan, Mom. I know she'll love it. Make sure to let me know the date and time so I can plan on being there. Kurtis: Absolutely, dear. I'll send you all the details once everything is finalized. In the meantime, take care of yourself and let your dad and me know if you need anything. Davis: Thank you, Mom. I appreciate it. Give my love to Dad and tell him I'll call him tomorrow to catch up. Love you both! Kurtis: We love you too, Davis! Take care and we'll talk again soon. Davis: Bye, Mom! Kurtis: Bye, dear!"},{"instruction":"What kind of task would test someone's ability to perform physical reasoning?","output":"A task that tests someone's ability to perform physical reasoning would require the individual to use their understanding of the principles of physics, kinematics, and dynamics to analyze, predict, and manipulate an object or system's behavior within a given context or environment. This task should gauge their skills in critical thinking, problem-solving, and spatial awareness. The task could involve assessing the individual's conceptual understanding, analytical abilities, and application of laws and principles into real-world scenarios. Here are some examples of tasks that could effectively test an individual's physical reasoning abilities: 1. Projectile motion challenge: In this task, the individual is given the initial conditions, such as the launch angle, initial velocity, and gravitational acceleration, and is required to calculate the time of flight, maximum height, and range of a projectile. The person can also be asked to determine the suitable launch angle or velocity to hit a target accurately. 2. Balance beam problem: This task involves placing objects with different masses on a seesaw such that the beam remains balanced. The individual must use their understanding of the principles of torque, lever arm, and center of mass to arrange the objects in a stable manner. 3. Rube Goldberg machine design: The individual is asked to design a complex, multi-step machine that achieves a singular goal using a chain reaction. The task involves designing a sequence of events involving levers, pulleys, inclined planes, wheels, gears, and other simple machines, which require an understanding of mechanical advantage, conservation of energy, and momentum. 4. Collision simulation: The individual must use their knowledge of momentum and energy conservation to analyze and predict the motion and behavior of two or more objects (such as billiard balls, marbles, or vehicles) before, during, and after a collision takes place. They should determine the final velocities and directions of the objects based on the initial conditions and whether the collisions are elastic, inelastic, or partially elastic. 5. Bridge-building challenge: The task involves designing and constructing a bridge using specific materials (e.g., toothpicks, popsicle sticks, or straws) that can hold a minimum weight or span a specific distance. The individual must apply their understanding of tension, compression, shear, and torsional forces, along with materials' properties and the principles of structural engineering, to create a stable and efficient bridge. 6. Pendulum analysis: The individual is asked to study the motion of a simple pendulum under different conditions, such as varying the length, mass, and initial displacement. They are required to analyze the factors affecting the period, amplitude, and energy transfer in the system and apply their understanding of harmonic motion and gravity. 7. Fluid mechanics problem: In this task, the individual must analyze the behavior of fluids (either liquid or gas) under various conditions, such as flow rates, pressures, and viscosities. They can be tasked with solving problems involving pipe networks, nozzles, or fluid flow around objects. This requires knowledge of fluid dynamics principles, such as Bernoulli's equation, Pascal's law, and the continuity equation. 8. Thermal conduction analysis: The individual is asked to assess the rate of heat transfer through different materials and geometries, or to design an effective insulation system for a specific application. This task will require an understanding of the concepts of thermal conduction, convection, radiation, and the properties of different materials. These tasks would effectively test an individual's physical reasoning abilities by challenging them to apply their understanding of physics principles and concepts in a range of realistic contexts and to solve problems that require critical thinking, creativity, and spatial awareness."},{"instruction":"Can you tell me the answer to how many senators are there in united states??","output":"Of course!

Watts-Russell planned the date to be not too close to the release of the Pixies' Bossanova two and a half months later, for more effective publicity of both albums. Watts-Russell believed the album would be better suited to a US independent distribution label rather than the Pixies' American distributor Elektra, and licensed Pod to Rough Trade America. When this division of Rough Trade went bankrupt, Elektra assumed distribution of Pod in the US. Deal has noted that the Breeders did not receive any royalties from initial US sales because of Rough Trade's bankruptcy.The album was widely anticipated by the British music press due to the involvement of Deal and Donelly—known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies and Throwing Muses, respectively—and Albini, who likewise had a strong reputation for his previous engineering work. It reached number 22 in the UK, where it was promoted by a full-page ad in Melody Maker, and number 73 in the Netherlands. Pod sold moderately well, although Deal has noted it \\"never sold [anything]\\" compared to their next album, Last Splash (1993), which was certified platinum in the US and silver in the UK.Deal took the idea for the album's title from a painting that she saw in Boston; for her, the word \\"pod\\" evoked a uterus, which Wiggs has noted relates to the theme of fertility and the group's name. The cover art was designed by longtime 4AD album designer Vaughan Oliver and employs photography by Kevin Westenberg. Oliver, in an attempt to seduce Deal, whom he believed would appreciate the humor, attached a belt of dead eels over his underwear, which he intended as phallic symbols. He performed a fertility dance, while Westenberg took pictures of him using a long exposure to achieve the blurring and other visual effects. answer the following question: What is the name of the individual known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies?

(January 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 1965, Mossad agent Rachel Singer (Jessica Chastain) arrives in East Berlin to meet with fellow agents David Peretz (Sam Worthington) and Stefan Gold (Marton Csokas). Their mission is to capture Nazi war criminal Dieter Vogel (Jesper Christensen)âinfamously known as \\"The Surgeon of Birkenau\\" for his medical experiments on Jews during World War IIâand bring him to Israel to face justice. Rachel and David present themselves as an ethnic German married couple from Argentina and Rachel plants herself as a patient at Vogel's obstetrics and gynaecology clinic. Both Stefan and David develop an attraction to Rachel. Rachel shows a preference for David, yet sleeps with Stefan shortly after David rebukes her advances. This tryst leads to Rachel becoming pregnant. Stefan also reveals to Rachel that David lost his entire family in The Holocaust. At a doctors appointment, Rachel injects Vogel with a sedative during an examination and induces the nurse (Vogel's wife) to believe that he has suffered a heart attack. Stefan and David arrive dressed as paramedics and make off with the unconscious Vogel in a faux ambulance, barely ahead of the real ambulance team. Under cover of night, the trio attempt their exfiltration at Wollankstrasse Station, on a railway line along the sector boundary between East and West Berlin, and next to a mail depot. As they prepare to load Vogel onto the stopped train he suddenly awakens and sounds the horn of the stolen mail van where he is being held, alerting East German guards to their presence. In the ensuing shootout, David sacrifices his chance to escape in order to collect the compromised Rachel. The agents are left with no choice but to bring Vogel to their apartment and plan a new extraction. The agents take turns monitoring and feeding Vogel, who attempts to...

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Pink Panther Strikes Again Context: At a psychiatric hospital, former Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) is largely recovered from his obsession to kill the new Chief Inspector Jacques Clouseau (Peter Sellers) and is about to be released when Clouseau, arriving to speak on Dreyfus' behalf, drives Dreyfus insane again. Dreyfus promptly escapes from the asylum and once again tries to kill Clouseau by planting a bomb while the Inspector (by periodic arrangement) duels with his manservant Cato (Burt Kwouk). The bomb destroys Clouseau's apartment and injures Cato, but Clouseau himself is unharmed, being lifted from the room by an inflatable disguise. Deciding that a more elaborate plan is needed, Dreyfus enlists an army of criminals to his cause and kidnaps nuclear physicist Professor Hugo Fassbender (Richard Vernon) and the Professor's daughter Margo (Briony McRoberts), forcing the professor to build a \\"doomsday weapon\\" in return for his daughter's freedom. Clouseau travels to England to investigate Fassbender's disappearance, where he wrecks their family home and ineptly interrogates Jarvis (Michael Robbins), Fassbender's cross-dressing butler. Although Jarvis is killed by the kidnappers, to whom he had become a dangerous witness, Clouseau discovers a clue that leads him to the Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany. Meanwhile, Dreyfus, using Fassbender's invention, dissolves the United Nations headquarters in New York City and blackmails the leaders of the world, including the President of the United States and his adviser (based on Gerald Ford and Henry Kissinger), into assassinating Clouseau. However, many of the nations instruct their operatives to kill the other assassins to gain Dreyfus's favor and possibly the Doomsday Machine. As a result of their orders and Clouseau's habitual clumsiness, the assassins all end up killing each other until only the agents of Egypt and Russia remain. The Egyptian assassin (an uncredited cameo by Omar Sharif) shoots one of Dreyfus' henchmen, mistaking him for Clouseau, but is seduced by the Russian...

Of course, one might argue that’s exactly what she’s been doing since quitting her job as Alaska’s governor. Behold her latest offering. A fun new video from SarahPac titled ‘Together’ featuring a slew of Tuesday’s big winners (and Palin endorsements) including: Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, Nikki Haley, Sean Duffy, and Susana Martinez, also a lumberjack and a roaring grizzly bear…all set to some snappy music! Notably absent are Joe Miller and Christine O’Donnell. Said Palin on her Facebook page: “Congratulations, America! And thank you, voters!” Said Palin in the voiceover: “We’re going to stand up, we’re gonna speak out. And it may take some renegades going rogue to get us there…This is our movement. This is our moment. This is our morning in America.” Shorter version: In a catchy one minute vid Palin is essentially claiming credit for the GOP “tidal” wave that just took the House and at the same time putting the establishment GOP on alert. It’s a smart move and highlights perfectly Palin’s unique role in the conservative party. One suspects the GOP has more to fear from Palin’s campaign vids in the next two years than the (slim) reality of an actual presidential run. Watch below. Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com ||||| election hangover Sarah Palin Channels Ronald Reagan in Spastic Post-Election Video SarahPAC, the committee \\"dedicated to building America's future\\" by supporting \\"candidates who share our vision for reform and innovation\\" — or maybe TLC television hosts, it doesn't really say — has an exuberant new commercial out celebrating the Republican victory in the midterms. The video, at times grainy and at times super-saturated, looks like what happens if you down three Red Bulls and then swallow an American flag. In just over a minute, the spot, called \\"Together,\\" manages to show Mount Rushmore, the Grand Canyon (as ridden through by the Marlboro man), the Statue of Liberty, the Constitution, a white picket fence, a lumberjack, a farmer, and a nod to Tom Cruise in Top Gun, all culminating in the most maverick image of them all: a roaring grizzly standing up on its hind legs. The quick camera cuts, propulsive rock, background cheering, and cliched images of Americana could easily call to mind a Pepsi commercial, so to distinguish itself, there's also some empty political rhetoric thrown in for good measure. \\"This is our movement, this is our moment, this is our morning ... in America,\\" says Sarah Palin in a voice-over homage to Ronald Reagan's famous 1984 ad in his bid for reelection. The original \\"Morning in America,\\" however, at least quoted some concrete statistics, like the fact that the 6,500 Americans getting married that afternoon could look forward to reduced interest rates. It's unclear what the Gipper had to do with those blessed unions, but hey, at least it was something related to a policy and/or accomplishment. Palin just cheers, \\"We're gonna stand up and we're gonna speak out, and it may take some renegades going rogue to get us there.\\" Then again, what these roving rogues actually want to say when they get there has never been the tea party's, or Palin's, strong suit. Together [SarahPalinAK, YouTube] ||||| T he video: Before the Senate race in her home state of Alaska has even been called, unofficial Tea Party spokesperson Sarah Palin has released a \\"fun,\\" exuberant new ad called \\"Together\\" (view the video below) that celebrates the GOP's election triumph and pays homage to a classic 1984 Ronald Reagan campaign ad. Over images of fireworks, cowboys, and some of Tuesday's Tea-Party-backed winners — Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, Nikki Haley, Sean Duffy, and Susana Martinez — Palin says \\"this is our movement, this is our moment, this is our morning in America.\\" Cue roaring bear. The reaction: Palin is \\"essentially claiming credit for the GOP tidal wave\\" while \\"putting the establishment GOP on alert,\\" says Glynnis MacNicol at Mediaite. If this reveals anything about her agenda, Republicans have more to fear from such divisive ads than the \\"(slim) reality\\" of a Palin presidential run. That's too cynical, says Rebecca Kaplan at National Journal. To me, the ad offers a \\"surprisingly conciliatory tone, further fueling speculation about her 2012 presidential ambitions.\\" There's no clear message — that's \\"never been the tea party's, or Palin's, strong suit\\" says Nitasha Tiku in New York.

We booked the Fremont about 9 months in advance, and got a good deal for the 3 days leading up to New Year's Eve. The rooms are clean, modern and comfortable. Housekeeping was excellent. The location is good if you're looking for a hotel in the Fremont Street area. The reasons we will never be back: We booked the Fremont Hotel for New Years Eve to be on Fremont Street for the Fremont experience!!! In past years, we took a cab to the area and patronized the hotels, vendors, etc and left. This year, however, there was a massive charge to stand on the street? WTF? I'm not sure how much kick back the city gets for this, but it was totally unreasonable. So since we chose not to purchase the 'tickets,' we were stuck in the hotel unless we wanted to exit a back door into the ghetto. Secondly, we went to the buffet, which we did daily. This time there was someone in line that had an issue with credit for a discount or something. Literally, we waited 25 minutes and the line was out the door. They didn't open another register, ask him to step aside, or anything. It actually became more entertainment and shit talking between the customers to see how long this would continue.

No, there was not. I went to the front desk to talk to a manager and she said she would talk to someone at the buffet restaurant...and thanks.

His parents were married in Spraggs, Pennsylvania. His English paternal ancestors immigrated to America in the 17th century, originally settling in Queen Anne's County, Maryland. Knotts' brothers were named Willis, William, and Ralph. Context: Before he entered high school, Knotts began performing as a ventriloquist and comedian at various church and school functions. After high school, he traveled to New York City to try to make his way as a comedian, but returned home to attend West Virginia University when his career failed to take off. After his college freshman year, Knotts joined the United States Army and spent most of his service entertaining troops. He toured the Pacific Islands as a comedian as part of a G.I. variety show called Stars and Gripes. His ventriloquist act included a dummy named Danny \\"Hooch\\" Matador. In a TV Guide interview in the 1970s, he said that he had grown tired of playing straight man for a hunk of wood when he was in the Army. According to Knotts, he tossed the dummy overboard off a ship in the South Pacific. He swore that he could hear the dummy calling for help as the ship sailed on, leaving him bobbing helplessly in the waves. Knotts served in the United States Army from June 21, 1943 to January 6, 1946. Discharged in the rank of Technician Grade 5, which was the equivalent of a Corporal. During his military service, Knotts was awarded the World War II Victory Medal, Philippine Liberation Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal (with 4 bronze service stars), Army Good Conduct Medal, Marksman Badge (with a Carbine BAR) and Honorable Service Lapel Pin. Knotts returned to West Virginia University after being demobilized and graduated in 1948. He married and moved back to New York, where connections he had made while in the Special Services Branch helped him break into show business. In addition to doing stand-up comedy at clubs, he appeared on the radio, eventually playing the wisecracking, know-it-all character \\"Windy Wales\\" on a radio western called \\"Bobby Benson and the B-Bar-B Riders\\". Knotts got his first major break on television in the soap opera Search for Tomorrow where he appeared from 1953 to 1955. He came to fame in 1956 on Steve Allen's variety show, as part of Allen's repertory company, most notably in Allen's mock \\"Man in the Street\\" interviews, always as an extremely nervous man. He remained with the Allen program through the 1959-1960 season. From October 20, 1955 through September 14, 1957, Knotts appeared in the Broadway version of No Time for Sergeants, in which he played two roles, listed on the playbill as a Corporal Manual Dexterity and a Preacher. In 1958, Knotts appeared for the first time on film with Andy Griffith in the film version of No Time for Sergeants. In that film, Knotts reprises his Broadway role and plays a high-strung Air Force test administrator whose routine is disrupted by the hijinks of a provincial new recruit. In 1960, Andy Griffith was offered the opportunity to headline his own sitcom, The Andy Griffith Show (1960-1968). Knotts took the role of Barney Fife, the deputy--and originally cousin--of Sheriff Andy Taylor (portrayed by Griffith). Knotts's portrayal of the deputy on the popular show earned him five Emmy Awards for Best Supporting Actor in a Television Comedy, three awards for the first five seasons that he played the character. A summary of the show from the website of the Museum of Broadcast Communications describes Deputy Barney Fife: Self-important, romantic, and nearly always wrong, Barney dreamed of the day he could use the one bullet Andy had issued to him, though he did fire his gun on a few occasions. He always fired his pistol accidentally while still in his holster or in the ceiling of the court house, at which point he would sadly hand his pistol to Andy. This is why Barney kept his one very shiny bullet in his shirt pocket. In episode #196, Andy gave Barney more bullets so that he would have a loaded gun to go after a bad guy that Barney unintentionally helped escape. While Barney was forever frustrated that Mayberry was too small for the delusional ideas he had of himself, viewers got the sense that he couldn't have survived anywhere else. Don Knotts played the comic and pathetic sides of the character with equal aplomb and he received three Emmy Awards during the show's first five seasons. When the show first aired, Griffith was intended to be the comedic lead with Knotts as his straight man, similar to their roles in No Time for Sergeants. However, it was quickly discovered that the show was funnier with the roles reversed. As Griffith maintained in several interviews, \\"By the second episode, I knew that Don should be funny, and I should play straight.\\" Knotts believed remarks by Griffith that The Andy Griffith Show would end after five seasons, and he began to look for other work, signing a five-film contract with Universal Studios. He was caught off guard when Griffith announced that he would continue the show after all, but Knotts's hands were tied. In his autobiography, Knotts admitted that he had not yet signed a contract when Griffith announced his decision; but he had made up his mind to move on, believing he would not get the chance again. Knotts left the series in 1965. His character's absence on the show was explained by Deputy Fife's having finally made the \\"big time,\\" joining the Raleigh, North Carolina police force. Knotts went on to star in a series of film comedies that drew on his high-strung persona from the television series: he had a cameo appearance in It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963), and starred in The Incredible Mr. Limpet (1964), The Ghost and Mr. Chicken (1966), The Reluctant Astronaut (1967), The Shakiest Gun in the West (1968), The Love God? (1969) and How to Frame a Figg (1971). Knotts reprised his role as Barney Fife several times in the 1960s: he made five guest appearances on The Andy Griffith Show (gaining him another two Emmy Awards), and he later appeared once on the spin-off Mayberry RFD, where he was present as best man for the marriage of Andy Taylor and his longtime love, Helen Crump. After making How to Frame a Figg, Knotts' five-film contract with Universal finished. He continued to work steadily, though he did not appear as a regular on any successful television series until his appearance on Three's Company in 1979. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Knotts served as the spokesman for Dodge trucks and was featured prominently in a series of print ads and dealer brochures. On television, he went on to host a variety show/sitcom hybrid on NBC, The Don Knotts Show, which aired Tuesdays during the fall of 1970, but the series was low-rated and short-lived. He also made frequent guest appearances on other shows such as The Bill Cosby Show and Here's Lucy. In 1970, appeared as a Barney Fife-like police officer in the pilot of The New Andy Griffith Show. In 1972, Knotts voiced an animated version of himself in two episodes of The New Scooby Doo Movies: \\"The Spooky Fog of Juneberry\\", in which he played a lawman resembling Barney Fife, and \\"Guess Who's Knott Coming to Dinner\\". He also appeared as Felix Unger in a stage version of Neil Simon's The Odd Couple, with Art Carney as Oscar Madison. Beginning in 1975, Knotts was teamed with Tim Conway in a series of slapstick films aimed at children, including the 1975 Disney film The Apple Dumpling Gang and its 1979 sequel, The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again. They also did two independent films, the boxing comedy The Prize Fighter (1979), and the mystery comedy The Private Eyes (1980). Knotts co-starred in several other Disney films, including Gus (1976), No Deposit, No Return (1976), Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo (1977) and Hot Lead and Cold Feet (1978).

Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes from a neighboring city. Because of this order, Bobby has dramatically increased the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season right now, so his use of fertilizer is currently low. Over the past month there has been a large amount of rain falling on both Bobby and Kenny's farms. Who will ultimately cause less oxygen to be used up in the ponds near their farm? Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. The answer is:","output":"Kenny will ultimately cause less oxygen to be used up in the ponds near their farm. Step 1: Consider the amount of fertilizer used by both farmers Bobby has recently received a large order of potatoes and has dramatically increased his fertilizer usage as a result. In contrast, Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season at the moment, so his use of fertilizer is currently low. Step 2: Understand the effect of rain The past month has seen a large amount of rain on both farms. Rain dissolves the fertilizer in the soil, and runoff carries it away into bodies of water, such as ponds or oceans. Step 3: Consider the impact of nitrogen in fertilizer Since the fertilizer contains nitrogen, and there is a lot of nitrogen in the water, it causes algae to grow out of control. Step 4: Understand the effect of algae on oxygen levels Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. When the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers, in turn, consume all the oxygen in the water, creating dead zones where nothing grows due to low oxygen levels. Step 5: Compare the effects of Bobby and Kenny's farms Bobby's farm has a higher use of fertilizer, and since rain runoff will carry it into bodies of water like ponds, leading to an increase in algae growth and eventually creating dead zones. Meanwhile, Kenny's farm is experiencing a lower use of fertilizer due to his tomatoes being out of season.

It features two octaves of double melody strings in the key of C major ( middle C to C '' ) , and four sets of chord strings ( C major , G major , F major , and D7 ) . Sounding somewhat like a mandolin , the Marxophone 's timbre is also reminiscent of various types of hammered dulcimers . The player typically strums the chords with the left hand . The right hand plays the melody strings by depressing spring steel strips that hold small lead hammers over the strings . A brief stab on a metal strip bounces the hammer off a string pair to produce a single note . Holding the strip down makes the hammer bounce on the double strings , which produces a mandolin - like tremolo . The bounce rate is somewhat fixed , as it is based on the spring steel strip length , hammer weight , and string tension -- but a player can increase the rate slightly by pressing higher on the strip , effectively moving its pivot point closer to the lead hammer . Numerically coded sheet music prepared specifically for the Marxophone indicates when and in what order to play melody and chord strings . This type of music , similar to tablature , was produced for those who could not read standard notation . A rectangular piece of metal provides a backstop for the spring steel hammers , displays the name Marxophone and the patent number , and has clips that hold sheet music . It also marks the 15 keys by letter ( C , D , etc. ) , by number ( 1 - 15 ) and in standard musical notation . When the instrument is moved or stored , the metal rectangle bends down , holding the keys against the strings , so the Marxophone can fit into its case -- which is the size of a large briefcase . - A plectrum is a small flat tool used to pluck or strum a stringed instrument. For hand-held instruments such as guitars and mandolins, the plectrum is often called a pick, and is a separate tool held in the player's hand. In harpsichords, the plectra are attached to the jack mechanism. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - F major (or the key of F) is a major scale based on F, with the pitches F, G, A, B, C, D, and E. Its key signature has one flat, B. - A soprano is a type of classical female singing voice and has the highest vocal range of all voice types. The soprano's vocal range (using scientific pitch notation) is from approximately middle C (C) = 261 Hz to \\"high A\\" (A) =880 Hz in choral music, or to \\"soprano C\\" (C, two octaves above middle C) =1046 Hz or higher in operatic music. In four-part chorale style harmony, the soprano takes the highest part, which usually encompasses the melody. The soprano voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, soubrette, lyric, spinto, and dramatic soprano. The lyric soprano is the most common female singing voice. - Mandobass is the largest (and least common) member of the mandolin family, sometimes used as the bass instrument in mandolin orchestras. It is so large that it usually isn't held in the lap, but supported on a spike which rests on the floor. The neck-scale length on a full-size mando-bass is similar to that of a standard orchestral double bass viol: about 43\\" (110 cm). The instrument is otherwise similar to the smaller, higher-pitched members of the mandolin family, having a fretted neck, a headstock with geared tuning machines, and a large resonating body oftenbut not alwaysshaped like that of other mandolins. - Lute can refer generally to any string instrument having the strings running in a plane parallel to the sound table (in the HornbostelSachs system), more specifically to any plucked string instrument with a neck (either fretted or unfretted) and a deep round back, or more specifically to an instrument from the family of European lutes. - In music, unison is two or more musical parts sounding the same pitch or at an octave interval, usually at the same time. - C major (or the key of C) is a major scale based on C, with the pitches C, D, E, F, G, A, and B. Its key signature has no flats and no sharps. - The harp is a stringed musical instrument which has a number of individual strings running at an angle to its soundboard, which are plucked with the fingers. Harps have been known since antiquity in Asia, Africa, and Europe, dating back at least as early as 3500 BC. The instrument had great popularity in Europe during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, where it evolved into a wide range of variants with new technologies, and was disseminated to Europe's colonies, finding particular popularity in Latin America. While some ancient members of the harp family died out in the Near East and South Asia, descendants of early harps are still played in Burma and in Sub-Saharan Africa, while other defunct variants in Europe and Asia have been revived by musicians in the modern era. - The mandocello is a plucked string instrument of the mandolin family. It has eight strings in four paired courses, tuned in fifths like a mandolin, but is larger, and tuned CC-GG-dd-aa (low to high in pitch). It can be described as being to the mandolin what the cello is to the violin. - G major (or the key of G) is a major scale based on G, with the pitches G, A, B, C, D, E, and F. Its key signature has one sharp, F. - The mandola (US and Canada) or tenor mandola (Ireland and UK) is a fretted, stringed musical instrument. It is to the mandolin what the viola is to the violin: the four double courses of strings tuned in fifths to the same pitches as the viola (C-G-D-A low-to-high), a fifth lower than a mandolin. The mandola, although now rarer, is the ancestor of the mandolin, the name of which means simply \\"little mandola\\". - The major scale or Ionian scale is one of the most commonly used musical scales, especially in Western music. It is one of the diatonic scales. Like many musical scales it is made up of seven notes: the eighth duplicates the first at double its frequency so that it is called a higher octave of the same note (from Latin \\"octavus\\", the eighth). - In musical notation, a key signature is a set of sharp, flat, and rarely, natural symbols placed together on the staff. Key signatures are generally written immediately after the clef at the beginning of a line of musical notation, although they can appear in other parts of a score, notably after a double barline. - The cello (; plural cellos or celli) or violoncello is a bowed string instrument with four strings tuned in perfect fifths. The strings from low to high are generally tuned to C, G, D and A, an octave lower than the viola. It is a member of the violin family of musical instruments, which also includes the violin and viola. - A mandolin (; literally \\"small mandola\\") is a musical instrument in the lute family and is usually plucked with a plectrum or \\"pick\\". It commonly has four courses of doubled metal strings tuned in unison (8 strings), although five (10 strings) and six (12 strings) course versions also exist. The courses are normally tuned in a succession of perfect fifths. It is the soprano member of a family that includes the mandola, octave mandolin, mandocello and mandobass. - The octave mandolin is a fretted string instrument with four pairs of strings tuned in fifths, G, D, A, E (low to high), an octave below a mandolin. It has a 20 to 23-inch scale length and its construction is similar to other instruments in the mandolin family. Usually the courses are all unison pairs but the lower two may sometimes be strung as octave pairs with the higher-pitched octave string on top so that it is hit before the thicker lower-pitched string. Alternate tunings of G, D, A, D and A, D, A, D are often employed by Celtic musicians.

Raúl Osella represented the Argentina national team in 2001 at the FIFA U-17 World Cup Final, which is a prestigious youth tournament where talent from countries around the world is showcased.

Edward, heir apparent to the throne of England, had distinguished himself as a military commander in the early phases of the Hundred Years' War, particularly in the Battle of Poitiers in 1356. After further military adventures, however, he contracted dysentery in Spain in 1370. He never fully recovered and had to return to England the next year. It is only with the Peasants' Revolt that Richard starts to emerge clearly in the annals. One of his first significant acts after the rebellion was to marry Anne of Bohemia, daughter of the Holy Roman Emperor (King of Bohemia Charles IV) and his wife Elisabeth of Pomerania, on 20 January 1382. The marriage had diplomatic significance; in the division of Europe caused by the Western Schism, Bohemia and the Empire were seen as potential allies against France in the ongoing Hundred Years' War. Nonetheless, the marriage was not popular in England. Despite great sums of money awarded to the Empire, the political alliance never resulted in any military victories. Furthermore, the marriage was childless. Anne died from plague in 1394, greatly mourned by her husband. Michael de la Pole had been instrumental in the marriage negotiations; he had the king's confidence and gradually became more involved at court and in government as Richard came of age. De la Pole came from an upstart merchant family. When Richard made him chancellor in 1383, and created him Earl of Suffolk two years later, this antagonised the more established nobility. Another member of the close circle around the king was Robert de Vere, Earl of Oxford, who in this period emerged as the king's favourite. Richard's close friendship to de Vere was also disagreeable to the political establishment. This displeasure was exacerbated by the earl's elevation to the new title of Duke of Ireland in 1386. The chronicler Thomas Walsingham suggested the relationship between the king and de Vere was of a homosexual nature, due to a resentment Walsingham had toward the king. Tensions came to a head over the approach to the war in France. While the court party preferred negotiations, Gaunt and Buckingham urged a large-scale campaign to protect English possessions. Instead, a so-called crusade led by Henry le Despenser, Bishop of Norwich, was dispatched, which failed miserably. Faced with this setback on the continent, Richard turned his attention instead towards France's ally, Scotland. In 1385, the king himself led a punitive expedition to the north, but the effort came to nothing, and the army had to return without ever engaging the Scots in battle. Meanwhile, only an uprising in Ghent prevented a French invasion of southern England. The relationship between Richard and his uncle John of Gaunt deteriorated further with military failure, and John of Gaunt left England to pursue his claim to the throne of Castile in 1386 amid rumours of a plot against his person. With Gaunt gone, the unofficial leadership of the growing dissent against the king and his courtiers passed to Buckingham - who had by now been created Duke of Gloucester - and Richard Fitzalan, Earl of Arundel. How old was he when he married Anne?","output":"Richard of Bordeaux, also known as King Richard II of England, married Anne of Bohemia on January 20, 1382. To determine his age at the time of their marriage, it is essential to know his birth year. Richard was born on January 6, 1367. Therefore, when he married Anne of Bohemia, he was 15 years old, as he had just turned 15 years earlier in the same month. The marriage had diplomatic significance and was meant to strengthen the alliance between England and the Holy Roman Empire in their ongoing conflict against France during the Hundred Years' War. However, despite the political motives behind their union, the marriage was not popular in England and never resulted in any military victories."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a sentence which is either in the Gujarati language or English language.

The Bush administration does not plan to seek immediate sanctions against Tehran even if it succeeds in getting Iran #39;s nuclear program referred Choices: (I). World (II). Sports (III). Business (IV). Science/Tech","output":"This statement is about (I). World. The statement mentions the Bush administration and their stance on potential sanctions against Tehran due to Iran's nuclear program. This topic is related to international affairs, geopolitics, and diplomacy, which all fall under the umbrella of world events and news. The topics of sanctions and nuclear programs are significant subjects in global politics and have substantial implications on international relations and stability. In this particular case, the Bush administration is referring to the time when George W. Bush was serving as the 43rd President of the United States, from 2001 to 2009. His tenure was marked by various international incidents and events, including the ongoing concerns surrounding Iran's nuclear program. The United States, along with other Western countries, expressed concerns about Iran's intentions and the potential for developing nuclear weapons. The decision not to seek immediate sanctions, even if their efforts to refer Iran's nuclear program were successful, represents the complexities of navigating international diplomacy. While countries may agree on certain concerns, imposing sanctions and determining the appropriate response to such issues can be a delicate balance. Sanctions, in this context, refer to economic or political measures imposed on a country in an attempt to influence its behavior, often in response to perceived violations of international norms or agreements. In the case of Iran, these concerns primarily revolve around its nuclear program and the potential for developing nuclear weapons, which would have significant implications for regional and global security. Efforts to address Iran's nuclear program have involved multiple countries and international organizations, as well as ongoing diplomatic negotiations. These efforts have culminated in various agreements, negotiations, and joint plans of action to try to manage and monitor Iran's nuclear activities and avoid escalation of conflicts due to these concerns. In conclusion, the statement refers to an important event in world affairs – the Bush administration's decision not to seek immediate sanctions against Tehran, even if Iran's nuclear program is referred to an international level. This highlights the importance of international diplomacy and the complexities of dealing with issues such as nuclear programs and sanctions in the global political landscape."},{"instruction":"A Kosher Soup Kitchen Offers a Dignified Place to Eat, and Steak for One Day A soup kitchen that serves steak might sound rather luxurious, but steak night comes only once a year at Masbia, in honor of Grand Rabbi Yeshaya Steiner of Kerestir, Hungary, who died in 1925 and who was known for feeding the hungry and other acts of charity. His poster-size likeness was taped to the wall behind the steaming pans of steaks and side dishes of carrots, potato kugel and gefilte fish. There were also pickles and sauerkraut, and fruit cups for dessert. Each table had bottles of cold seltzer and a memorial candle, in honor of Rabbi Steiner. “Word got out that today was a special day,” said Alexander Rapaport, who co-founded Masbia in 2005 and who made sure steak night was listed on a Yiddish news hot line. That might have accounted for the long line when the kitchen opened at 4 p.m. Mr. Mandelbaum shrugged. “Listen, people are hungry,” he said. “At my synagogue, they were saying, ‘A 16-ounce steak? Who’s going to finish it?’ ” said Menashe Silbert, another official of the soup kitchen, which has a dozen tables and was designed to resemble a restaurant. Tall fake plants and screens between tables give diners some privacy. Masbia, the Hebrew word for “satiate,” serves 160 meals five nights a week. “We wanted to make it look like a restaurant,” Mr. Rapaport said, “because people in our community don’t want to be seen going to a soup kitchen — it’s highly embarrassing. “But we’ve had people come in and eat and ask where they pay. We have to tell them, ‘No, you don’t pay.’ People here are kosher so they won’t go to any other soup kitchen. It’s come here or starve.” Being down and out in Borough Park may seem to conflict with the area’s image of well-to-do families. But, as elsewhere, jobs have been lost and rents have climbed, and then there are the rising costs of sending children to yeshivas and the extra expense of putting kosher food on the table. Mr. Rapaport said it was not unusual to see parents and older people alike hoarding free snacks at synagogue, and families on food stamps and government assistance. Two men at Table 6 would give only their first names. “I don’t want people in my synagogue to know I come here,” said one of the men, Meyer, 55, who lives in Flatbush. Meyer said he had been unemployed for six months and recently went back to work as an optician. He enjoys the camaraderie at the soup kitchen. “They treat you like a mensch, not a second-class citizen,” he said. His dining companion, Eli, 57, said that he had recently been divorced and was short of money. “I’d rather be home with my wife and two kids, but I don’t have them anymore,” he said. “It’s just me and my four walls.” He added that he would have preferred his steak rare, rather than well done, but added, “I guess beggars can’t be choosers.” Mr. Rapaport said, “We try to treat everyone equal: There’s a saying that even in the synagogue, the fishmonger sits with the stockbroker.” Borough Park is an insular neighborhood where many of the signs are in Yiddish. There are adults who have grown up here who never learned English. Mr. Rapaport said he finally learned it “from listening to NPR.” Some of the kitchen’s 500,000 annual budget comes from city and state aid, but most comes from local donations, Mr. Rapaport said. Mostly, money is solicited from couples who are getting married, drawing on an old-world tradition of donating to the needy just before marriage. “We remind them that contributing helps them avoid bad luck,” Mr. Mandelbaum said, lifting an eyebrow mischievously. “Jewish guilt is very powerful.” Mr. Rapaport said the kitchen served Jewish and gentile, rich and poor. Just then, two men in casual clothes walked in, looking a bit uneasy and wearing creased oversize yarmulkes. “These guys think you have to be Orthodox to come here,” Mr. Mandelbaum said. “We call those things funeral yarmulkes. You can tell they just put them on.” The two women at Table 3 said that they had fallen on hard times, and that it cost much more money to keep kosher. “This place is a godsend,” said one, a 50-year-old woman who had lost her job as a legal secretary. “And the steak is very good. My father was a kosher butcher, and meat, I know.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B4 of the New York edition with the headline: A Kosher Soup Kitchen Offers a Dignified Place to Eat, and Steak for One Day.

In the first quarter, San Diego got off to a fast start with QB Philip Rivers getting a 2-yard TD run. Immediately afterwards on the ensuing kickoff, rookie LB Brandon Siler returned a fumble 23 yards for a touchdown. In the second quarter, the Chargers increased its lead with kicker Nate Kaeding getting a 26-yard field goal. Afterwards, the Broncos got their only score of the game with kicker Jason Elam getting a 30-yard field goal. San Diego would end the half with Kaeding nailing 45-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Chargers continued their offensive revival with Rivers completing a 9-yard TD pass to TE Antonio Gates and a 15-yard TD pass to WR Vincent Jackson. In the fourth quarter, RB Michael Turner helped San Diego seal their easy victory with a 74-yard TD run. With the win, the Chargers improved to 2-3. The win also marked San Diego's first back-to-back wins in Denver since '67-'68. How many touchdown passes did Philip Rivers throw in the third quarter?","output":"Philip Rivers, the quarterback of the Chargers, threw two touchdown passes in the third quarter. You know what a touchdown pass is, right, sweetie? It's when a player throws the football to another player who catches it in the end zone, which is the scoring area.

I visited 'The Hasty Tomato' last Friday after hearing mixed reviews about it. I went with high hopes, but I was left ultimately unimpressed, to say the least. Simply put, both their service and food were severely lacking. Let's start with the ambiance of the place, a factor that's often integral to a dining experience. An immediately noticeable issue was the poorly lit and somewhat untidy interior. Not only were there crumbs on the floor, but the seating arrangement was cramped, which hardly made for a comfortable atmosphere. Although I appreciate the attempts at crafting a rustic feel, the mish-mash of mismatched furniture fell quite short of achieving this, instead creating a chaotic and unpolished landscape that was far from appealing. Moving on to the food. As a vegetarian, I found their menu noticeably lacking in variety. The limited choice reminded me of the days when eating out as a vegetarian was a true struggle, a situation I do not expect to encounter in our current culinary landscape. The meal I chose, a vegetable lasagna, was disappointingly subpar. It was lukewarm when served, and the vegetables tasted as if they were on the brink of expiration. The sauce lacked any discernible seasoning, and the overall bite was dismayingly bland. Moreover, the portion size was significantly smaller than the price had led me to expect. Perhaps the most underwhelming aspect of 'The Hasty Tomato', however, was the dismal service. Our server appeared visibly distracted and uninterested. On multiple occasions, we had to repeat ourselves while ordering, and even so, one of my companions received an incorrect dish. It took them about 20 minutes to rectify this, without so much as an apology to assuage the inconvenience caused. Furthermore, when necessary, it was exceedingly difficult to get a hold of any waiting staff for refills, extra napkins, or any other needs. Waiting staff should not make their patrons feel like an afterthought. In conclusion, 'The Hasty Tomato' presented a rather regrettable dining experience. In a thriving, versatile food community, there's no place for substandard service, mediocrity in food preparation, or an uninspiring ambiance. Given the competitively priced, high-quality options in the vicinity, I unfortunately see no reasons why I should give 'The Hasty Tomato' another visit, nor can I, in good conscience, recommend it to anyone else. I am really disappointed that a restaurant with such potential didn't deliver. Management should take note of these issues and rectify them for a better customer experience."},{"instruction":"A person can put ribs on a grill to barbecue but a grill cannot put on ribs to barbecue.is the reasoning for what question and answer pair?","output":"The reasoning given can be matched to the following question and answer pair: Question: Can a grill operate by itself to put on and barbecue ribs?

This data is used to better understand the changing landscape of the nation, ensuring adequate representation and allocation of resources. In this article, we will examine the percentage of individuals who weren't identified as American Indian in the county according to the 2010 U.S. Census. Step 1: Identify the county for analysis Firstly, it's essential to identify the specific county we will be discussing in this analysis. The United States is home to more than 3,000 counties (3,142, to be exact), so the percentage of non-American Indian residents will likely vary from county to county. For the purpose of this article, we will assume a generic county and perform calculations based on national percentages. Step 2: Gather data on American Indians and the total population To determine the percentage of non-American Indian residents within our county, we will need two crucial pieces of information: The total population of the county and the population of American Indian residents within the county. The 2010 U.S. Census recorded the population of the United States as 308,745,538 people. The American Indian and Alaska Native population totaled 2,932,248 individuals. We will use this data for our calculations since the specific county information is not given. Step 3: Calculate the percentage of American Indians in the United States Next, we will determine the percentage of American Indians within the total U.S. population. We can do this by dividing the American Indian population (2,932,248) by the total population (308,745,538) and multiplying that result by 100. The calculation is as follows: Percentage of American Indians = (2,932,248 / 308,745,538) * 100 = 0.95% Step 4: Calculate the percentage of non-American Indian residents Now that we have the percentage of American Indian residents, calculating the percentage of non-American Indian residents is relatively straightforward. We will subtract the percentage of American Indians from 100: Percentage of non-American Indian residents = 100 - 0.95 = 99.05% Conclusion: Based on the 2010 United States Census data, approximately 99.05% of the residents in our county were not identified as American Indian, assuming that the distribution of American Indian residents is proportional across all counties. This figure sheds light on the ethnic landscape and the diversity within American society. Future census data can reveal how these percentages change over time, providing valuable information for decision-making and resource allocation in the United States."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this summary: The BBC has revealed two-thirds of its stars earning more than £150,000 are male, with Chris Evans the top-paid on between £2.2m and £2.25m.","output":"Title: Pay Inequality Controversy at the BBC: Examining the Gender Gap Among Top Earners Introduction The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is a household name in the United Kingdom due to its commitment to public service broadcasting, impartial news, and diverse entertainment. However, it has recently faced scrutiny regarding pay inequality among its workforce, particularly its top-earning stars. Recent BBC data has shown that two-thirds of the corporation's stars earning over £150,000 are male, with Chris Evans emerging as the top earner in the £2.2m to £2.25m range. This pay gap has garnered immense criticism and calls for greater transparency in the corporation's pay policies. The Gender Pay Gap at the BBC Following the recent releases of its annual report, BBC's gender pay discrepancy has become a topic of national discussion. It is alarming to see that out of the 96 top earners making over £150,000, approximately 64 of them are men. This is a clear indication that a significant gender pay gap exists in the corporation, undermining its public image as a progressive and impartial public service broadcaster. The gender pay gap not only affects the perception of the BBC but also highlights a broader issue, as pay inequality remains a pervasive problem globally. The substantial pay difference between the broadcaster's top earning stars further exacerbates the issue. Chris Evans, a male radio presenter, is currently the highest-paid star with earnings between £2.2m to £2.25m. In comparison, the highest-paid female star, Claudia Winkleman, earns between £450,000 to £499,000, showing a vast disparity in earnings. This disparity brings attention to the broader issue of gender-based income inequality across various sectors. Transparency and Accountability The pay inequality controversy has resulted in calls for increased transparency and accountability from the BBC. Transparency in the organizational processes of determining employee compensation, particularly for influential on-screen stars, can help address pay gaps and encourage fair remuneration for all employees. Moreover, the BBC must take responsibility for its pay policies by acknowledging such discrepancies, admitting to the problems they cause, and committing to making necessary changes in their practices. The corporation has outlined its plans to achieve a 50:50 gender balance across all staff and leadership positions by 2020. It has also pledged to increase the representation of women in on-air roles by 2020. While these initiatives are a step in the right direction, more immediate and comprehensive actions are needed to bridge the pay gap and promote genuine workplace equality. Recommendations for Change To address the gender pay gap and promote income equality within the BBC, the following recommendations should be considered: 1. Conduct a comprehensive audit of salaries across the organization and identify any discrepancies due to gender. Such audits should be conducted regularly to monitor progress. 2. Establish a transparent and consistent pay structure to ensure that employees in similar roles are paid fairly and equitably, regardless of gender. 3. Implement diversity and inclusion training programs to promote a culture of equality and mutual respect within the organization. 4. Encourage open conversations around the topic of pay and gender disparity, allowing employees to voice their concerns and suggestions for improvement. 5. Foster a culture of accountability by holding managers and leaders responsible for promoting gender equality and equal pay within their departments. Conclusion The gender pay gap at the BBC highlights the ongoing issue of income inequality between men and women. As one of the world's most prominent and prestigious broadcasters, the BBC has a unique responsibility to set a positive example and lead by example in addressing this prevalent issue. By facing the problem head-on and committing to comprehensive policy changes and transparency, the corporation can work towards narrowing the gender pay gap, ensuring equal pay for equal work, and promoting a culture of inclusivity and fairness within its ranks."},{"instruction":"- party is alignment - death date is 14 october 2005 - birth date is 6 may 1927 - partyyears is 1977 -- 1983 - death place is kabri , israel - birth place is tel aviv , mandatory palestine Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

The device is a required part of resuscitation kits for trained professionals in out-of-hospital settings (such as ambulance crews) and is also frequently used in hospitals as part of standard equipment found on a crash cart, in emergency rooms or other critical care settings. Underscoring the frequency and prominence of BVM use in the United States, the American Heart Association (AHA) Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiac Care recommend that \\"all healthcare providers should be familiar with the use of the bag-mask device.\\" Manual resuscitators are also used within the hospital for temporary ventilation of patients dependent on mechanical ventilators when the mechanical ventilator needs to be examined for possible malfunction, or when ventilator-dependent patients are transported within the hospital.

Of the below sentences, which one does *not* make sense? Options: - Sentence A: \\"He always yells at people when he's happy.\\" - Sentence B: \\"He always yells at people when he's angry.\\"","output":"Sentence A does not make sense, and here's the explanation: Sentence A states that \\"He always yells at people when he's happy.\\" This does not make sense because it is unusual and counterintuitive for someone to yell at people when they are happy. Happiness is generally associated with positive emotions, while yelling is considered a negative or aggressive behavior. It is unexpected for someone to express a positive emotion like happiness by yelling at others. In contrast, Sentence B, \\"He always yells at people when he's angry,\\" makes more sense because yelling is a common way for people to express anger or frustration. This behavior aligns with how people typically act when they are angry, making Sentence B a reasonable and understandable statement."},{"instruction":"Sentence 1: and now they tell you what to teach and how long and you know what day Sentence 2: They have a curriculum planned out for each day of the school year. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"The second sentence is not explicitly entailed by the first sentence, but it does deepen and expand on the meaning implied in the first sentence. To determine whether a sentence is entailed by another, we need to assess whether the information in the second sentence is a necessary and direct consequence of the information in the first sentence. The first sentence says, \\"and now they tell you what to teach and how long and you know what day.\\" This indicates that 'they', presumably some authority or administration, dictates the content (\\"what to teach\\") and the duration or schedule (\\"how long and you know what day\\") of the teaching. However, it does not specifically mention that there is a curriculum planned out for each day of the school year. The second sentence, \\"They have a curriculum planned out for each day of the school year,\\" adds more specific detail about how 'they' dictate the teaching process. Having a day-to-day curriculum plan is one possible way of telling someone what to teach and when, but it's not the only interpretation. It is possible that 'they' could be telling you what to teach each day without a predefined curriculum plan. In other words, while the first sentence could imply the situation in the second sentence, it doesn't logically guarantee it. Inference or extensive understanding is required to connect these two sentences, so it is not a direct entailment. Therefore, despite the fact that the second sentence is consistent with and essentially expands upon the content conveyed in the first sentence, it is not directly entailed by the first sentence."},{"instruction":"Generate a 5-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package com.google.android.gms.

A Jackson lawyer conceded Tuesday the singer may have some fault for his own death. Article:","output":"Title: AEG Lawyer Claims Michael Jackson's Choices Contributed to His Death Introduction New statements from an AEG lawyer suggest that the late pop star, Michael Jackson, might have some responsibility for his own passing. The lawyer argues that Jackson's fear, exhaustion, and aging were the primary factors behind his tragic demise, rather than the actions of concert-promotion company AEG. 1. AEG lawyer's stance on Jackson's condition In court, the AEG lawyer claimed that producers believed Jackson was tired, afraid, and aging. This assertion was made to counter the long-standing accusations that AEG had a significant role in the singer's death. According to the attorney, Jackson's worsening condition was the primary catalyst behind his tragic end, rather than the company's negligence. 2. Jackson lawyer's rebuttal The legal representative for Jackson's estate is scheduled to deliver a rebuttal on Thursday morning. The lawyer is expected to counter AEG's allegations and establish that the entertainment company still holds some responsibility for the untimely demise of the pop icon. 3. A Jackson lawyer admits singer's possible fault While the battle between Jackson's estate and AEG continues, a Jackson lawyer conceded on Tuesday that the singer might bear some responsibility for his own death. This admission could potentially change the course of the ongoing legal battle, as it acknowledges that both parties may have contributed to the unfortunate event. Conclusion As the legal dispute between Michael Jackson's estate and AEG Live continues, new revelations surface, casting a different light on the events leading up to the singer's death. With both sides now admitting partial responsibility, it remains to be seen how the case will proceed and who, if anyone, will be deemed at fault for Jackson's tragic passing."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you are given a news article.

Directed by Frank Darabont, the film adeptly weaves the tale of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a man who is falsely accused of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment in Shawshank State Penitentiary. Step 1: Discuss the plot The plot revolves around Andy's life in prison and his burgeoning friendship with fellow inmate, Ellis \\"Red\\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), a man known for procuring contraband items. As the story unfolds, Andy not only manages to survive the brutalities of the prison system but also uses his intelligence and resourcefulness to improve the lives of his fellow inmates. Step 2: Explore the themes One of the most powerful aspects of the film is its themes - hope, friendship, and redemption. The film demonstrates how hope acts as a driving force for the characters, enabling them to endure their seemingly unbearable situations. This message of hope resonates deeply with viewers, leaving a lasting impact long after the credits have rolled. Step 3: Analyze the characters The characters in the film are complex and well-developed, allowing viewers to become deeply invested in their stories. Tim Robbins' portrayal of Andy Dufresne is a study in quiet strength and determination, while Morgan Freeman's Red serves as the perfect counterpoint - a resigned inmate who rediscovers purpose and hope through his friendship with Andy. The supporting cast, including Bob Gunton as the corrupt warden and Clancy Brown as the malicious Captain Hadley, further enrich the film by showcasing the stark contrast between good and evil within Shawshank. Step 4: Discuss the direction and cinematography Frank Darabont's direction is masterful, combining elements of drama and suspense to maintain an engrossing pace throughout the film. Complemented by Roger Deakins' atmospheric cinematography, the film effectively conveys the bleakness of life in Shawshank, utilizing the brooding prison setting as an additional character in its own right. Step 5: Offer a conclusion In conclusion, The Shawshank Redemption is a phenomenal film that has stood the test of time. Its powerful themes, memorable characters, and stunning visuals come together to create an unforgettable cinematic experience. This classic exploration of hope and redemption is not only an enduring favorite but serves as an enduring testament to the indomitable human spirit."},{"instruction":"Question: Facts: - nicknames: \`\` mike '' - weight: 179 lb kg on - height: 6 ft 3 in m on - strokes: backstroke - fullname: michael eugene stamm - birth date: 6 august 1952 - name: mike stamm - club: coronado navy swimming association - birth place: san pedro , california - collegeteam: indiana university Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of mike stamm .

B). he wrote the postmaster a note of appreciation. C). many people had applied for post-office boxes before him. D). he asked the postmaster to make one for him. Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Like most people, I was brought up to look upon life as a process of getting. It was not until in my late thirties that I made this important discovery: giving-away makes life so much more exciting. You need not worry if you lack money. This is how I experimented with giving-away. If an idea for improving the window display of a neighborhood store flashes to me, I step in and make the suggestion to the storekeeper. One discovery I made about giving-away is that it is almost impossible to give away anything in this world without getting something back, though the return often comes in all unexpected form. One Sunday morning, the local post office delivered an important special delivery letter to my home, though it was addressed to me at my office. I wrote the postmaster a note of appreciation. More than a year later I needed a post-office box for a new business I was starting. I was told at the window that there were no boxes left, and that my name would have to go on a long waiting list. As I was about to leave, the postmaster appeared in the doorway. He had overheard our conversation. \\"Wasn't it you that wrote us that letter a year ago about delivering a special delivery to your home?\\" I said yes. \\"Well, you certainly are going to have a box in this post office if we have to make one for you. You don't know what a letter like that means to us. We usually get nothing but complaints.\\" Question: When the author needed a post-office box, _ . Answer: Answer:","output":"When the author needed a post-office box, the postmaster remembered the note of appreciation that the author had written a year ago about delivering a special delivery letter to his home. As a result, the postmaster ensured that the author would get a box in the post office, even if they had to make one specifically for him. This instance demonstrates that the author's act of giving-away, in the form of expressing gratitude, had unexpectedly returned the favor when he needed a post-office box, which aligns with choice D."},{"instruction":"Sentence 1: You have too much regulation, not too little.

The reason they are not rated as 5 (meaning the same thing) is that regulation primarily deals with the rules and restrictions placed upon a system, which can include markets but might also encompass other areas. Intervention in free markets, on the other hand, specifically refers to actions taken to influence or control the workings of a market economy.

Bobby Jindal of Louisiana — did little to protect the coastline and often hampered the more effective actions of federal responders to the 2010 oil spill, according to the final report by the presidential panel investigating the spill. The report, released on Tuesday, also details new allegations that Mr. Jindal deliberately withheld the location of an area of oiled marsh from the Coast Guard that he used as a backdrop for television interviews. “Coast Guard responders watched Governor Jindal — and the TV cameras following him — return to what appeared to be the same spot of oiled marsh day after day to complain about the inadequacy of the federal response, even though only a small amount of marsh was then oiled,” the report stated, citing an interview with a Coast Guard official. “When the Coast Guard sought to clean up that piece of affected marsh, Governor Jindal refused to confirm its location.” A spokesman for Mr. Jindal forcefully denied the allegations, calling them “ridiculous.” “We had a Coast Guard liaison traveling with us throughout the spill and we consistently reported oil sightings to him,” Kyle Plotkin, the governor’s press secretary, told Politico. At the height of the spill, politicians from affected states focused their attention on securing large amounts of containment boom, the floating orange barriers intended to block and capture oil. But with limited amounts of boom available, these efforts often resulted in supplies’ being diverted from where they were needed most, the report found. “Responders knew that in deploying boom they were often responding to the politics of the spill rather than the spill itself,” the report states. “Coast Guard responders distributed many miles of boom according to political, rather than operational, imperatives. They felt hamstrung by the outrage that resulted when a parish or state felt slighted by allocation decisions, so they placed boom wherever they could.” “All of these problems distracted responders from their focus on cleaning up the spill,” it concludes. Ultimately, the highly coveted containment boom often did little to keep oil from washing ashore, the report noted. The commission also called out some in the news media for stoking local outrage over the federal government response to the spill. “Local resentment became a media theme and then a self-fulfilling prophecy,” the commissioners found. “Even those who privately thought the federal government was doing the best it could under the circumstances could not say so publicly.” In one instance, Anderson Cooper, the CNN anchor, “reportedly asked a parish president to bring an angry, unemployed offshore oil worker on his show,” the panel wrote. “When the parish president could not promise the worker would be ‘angry,’ both were disinvited.”","output":"The final report by the presidential panel investigating the 2010 Gulf Coast oil spill accuses Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal of prioritizing the construction of sand barriers to block oil offshore and withholding the location of an area of oiled marsh from the Coast Guard.

Why are Muslim terrorists being considered as anti-national? Why not Hindu terrorist? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Pick your answer from: -- no. -- yes.","output":"Muslims are often stereotyped as terrorists, primarily due to several factors collectively contributing to a prejudiced and inaccurate portrayal of Islam and its adherents. While it is essential to acknowledge that these stereotypes are not reflective of the beliefs and actions of the majority of Muslims, it is also crucial to understand the underlying reasons behind these biases and stereotypes. Some of the key factors include: 1. Media portrayal: The media has played a significant role in perpetuating stereotypes about Muslims as violent and prone to terrorism. This portrayal is often exaggerated, as it focuses on isolated incidents and highlights the actions of a few rather than the peaceful lives of the majority. This selective reporting creates a skewed image of Islam and Muslims, fostering suspicion and fear among non-Muslims. 2. Misunderstanding of Islam: Lack of knowledge about the fundamental principles, beliefs, and teachings of Islam among non-Muslims often leads to misunderstandings and misconceptions about the faith. This ignorance can result in the false belief that Islam endorses violence and terrorism, further reinforcing the stereotype. 3. Political agendas: Certain political parties or leaders may exploit stereotypes of Muslims as terrorists to advance their goals, such as consolidating power, gaining popularity, or justifying foreign policies and military interventions. 4. High-profile terrorist events: Major terrorist attacks carried out by extremist groups that claim to act in the name of Islam, such as the 9/11 attacks or bombings in European cities, have reinforced the stereotype of Muslims as terrorists. These attacks garner significant global media coverage, which can further reaffirm these unfounded stereotypes. As for the second question, Muslim terrorists are considered anti-national when their actions harm the interests or security of the country in which they reside or target. This classification stems from the fact that terrorism is a threat to a nation, its people, and its stability. However, it is essential to emphasize that such a label should not be exclusive to Muslim terrorists, as acts of terrorism by people of any religion or ideology can also be considered anti-national. Hindu terrorists should be equally considered anti-national if their actions pose a threat to a nation's stability and the safety of its people. Labeling a terrorist as anti-national should be determined by their actions and not their religious or ideological affiliations. Terrorism is a grave concern globally, and individuals involved in it must be held accountable irrespective of whether they are Muslim, Hindu, or from any other background. In response to the multi-choice problem, I would say that these questions are -- no -- the same. While the first question seeks to understand the reasons behind stereotyping Muslims as terrorists, the second question addresses the issue of labeling terrorists as anti-national and emphasizes the importance of treating all forms of terrorism as a threat to national security, regardless of the religion or ideology of the terrorists."},{"instruction":"If \\"A man on a bicycle with an umbrella getting his picture taken.\\", does it logically follow that \\"The man is attempting to wrestle a live alligator in a zoo in FL.\\"?","output":"No, little buddy, these two things are not related.

A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'.

Maeda was one of the most prominent members in the group, and placed first among all AKB48 and sister group candidates in the group's general 2009 and 2011 elections, and second in the 2010 election. She also appeared on many of its album covers. On March 25, 2012, she announced her graduation from AKB48; it was held on August 27. Context: At age 14, Maeda became a member of AKB48's first group, Team A, which composed of 24 girls and debuted on December 8, 2005. In 2009, Maeda won the first edition of AKB48's annual general elections, which are described as a popularity contest. As a result, she was the headlined performer for the group's 13th single, \\"Iiwake Maybe\\". The following year, she placed second overall, but still had a significant choreography position in the lineup for \\"Heavy Rotation\\". Later that year, AKB48 employed a rock-paper-scissors tournament to determine the top spot of AKB48's 19th major single \\"Chance no Junban\\". Maeda placed 15th, which secured her a spot on title track. Maeda would also win the group's third general election held in 2011. Maeda was one of the members who sang on every AKB48 title track since the group's inception. Her streak of A-side appearances ended in 2011, when she lost to Team K captain Sayaka Akimoto at a rock-paper-scissors tournament which determined the featured members for the group's 24th single \\"Ue kara Mariko\\". On March 25, 2012, during an AKB48 Concert at the Saitama Super Arena, Maeda announced that she would leave the group. This caused a large buzz in the Japanese news, and spawned a rumor (later proved false) that a student from University of Tokyo had committed suicide over the announcement. AKB48 later announced that Maeda would leave after the Tokyo Dome concerts; For her final performance, there were 229,096 requests filed for seat tickets. Her farewell performance and ceremony occurred on August 27 at the AKB48 theater, and was streamed live on YouTube. Question: How many teams are in AKB48?.

Just hearing that name _ . In reality, these big fish have more to fear from us than we do from them. For many years, people killed countless great white sharks in the waters around the United States. But thanks to conservation efforts, great whites are making a comeback in the U.S. Two recent studies show that the population of these sharks is rising along the east and west coast. Why is the growing population of a killer fish something to celebrate? \\"When you fish too many of them, you start to lose balance in the environment,\\" says shark researcher Tobey Curtis. As the biggest killer, sharks help keep the populations of fish, seals, and other creatures they eat from growing too large. In spite of their importance, great white sharks had long been hunted for their meat and their fins . Then, in 1997, the U.S. government passed a law that didn't allow the hunting of great whites. Afterwards, the numbers of these sharks in the U.S. waters started to increase. The law wasn't the only thing that has helped great whites. Conservationists have also played a part in the sharks' comeback. The research group OCEARCH is using a method called tagging to help change people's attitudes about great white. They let the public follow each shark as it travels the world's oceans. OCEARCH also gives each tagged shark a name to help people form a closer connection with the big fish. The group's most well-known shark is named Katharine. She was tagged last year near Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Since then, thousands of people have tracked Katharine's movements on Twitter and the OCEARCH website. This helps people see sharks in a new way. Chris Fischer, the founder of OCEARCH believes learning to appreciate great whites will encourage people to do more to protect them.

The document also calls for the two countries to jointly work on efforts to build a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula, to establish new U.S.-North Korea relations and to recover the remains of prisoners of war and military members missing in action. The two sides also promised to hold follow-up negotiations. “We’re going to denuke North Korea,” Trump told VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren.

Assuming that: More particles inside the container means more collisions, and more collisions mean a higher pressure. The answer to this question is:","output":"When we deflate a balloon containing oxygen particles, the pressure within the balloon changes due to the change in the number of particles, volume, and frequency of collisions amongst the particles inside the container (balloon). In order to understand this process, let's dive deeper into the concept of pressure and the factors that affect it. Pressure is a measure of the force exerted by particles when they collide with the walls of a container. In this case, the container is the balloon. According to the ideal gas law (PV = nRT), pressure (P) is directly proportional to the number of particles (n), absolute temperature (T) and inversely proportional to volume (V). Here, R is the ideal gas constant. Therefore, when the number of particles, volume, or temperature changes, the pressure also changes accordingly. Now, let's go back to the scenario where we keep deflating the balloon containing oxygen particles. 1. Decrease in Volume: As we deflate the balloon, the volume (V) decreases. According to the ideal gas law, when the volume decreases while keeping the temperature and the number of particles constant, the pressure (P) increases. This is because the same number of particles are now contained within a smaller volume, leading to more frequent collisions with the walls of the balloon, which results in an increase in pressure. 2. Decrease in the number of particles (n): As the balloon is deflated, some oxygen particles leave the balloon and the total number of particles decreases. This leads to fewer collisions amongst the particles inside the container, which in turn should cause the pressure to decrease given that the volume and temperature remain constant according to the ideal gas law. To understand the overall effect on pressure, it is important to consider the rate at which these two factors (the decrease in volume and the decrease in the number of particles) are changing. If the decrease in the number of particles (due to deflation) is greater than the rate at which the volume is decreasing, the pressure inside the balloon will ultimately decrease. In summary, when a balloon containing oxygen particles is deflated, the pressure inside the balloon may increase or decrease depending on the rates at which the volume and the number of particles are decreasing. The overall pressure change will depend on the delicate balance of these factors during the deflation process. However, if the decrease in the number of particles (due to deflation) is greater than the rate at which the volume is decreasing, the pressure inside the balloon will ultimately decrease."},{"instruction":"Q:Process: - The consumer throws aluminum cans and foil into a recycle bin - The aluminum is collected - Taken to a treatment plant - The aluminum is sorted and cleaned ready for reprocessing - The aluminum is re-melted - Turned into molten aluminum - The aluminum is made into large blocks called ingots - The ingots are sent to mills to be rolled out - The rolled out product is made into new aluminum products.

Marcus is accustomed to performing exorcisms on \\"possessed\\" individuals, but his faith has waned after reading of an autistic child being killed during an exorcism, reminding him of his own disabled son. He comes to realize that he attributes the healing of his son to science, and not to Jesus Christ. He agrees to take part in a documentary designed to expose exorcism as a fraud, working with a film crew consisting of producer/director Iris Reisen (Iris Bahr) and cameraman Daniel Moskowitz (Adam Grimes). At random, he chooses a plea letter from an individual seeking an exorcism leading him to the farmhouse of Louis Sweetzer (Louis Herthum), a man who claims to have a possessed daughter named Nell (Ashley Bell). Prior to the exorcism, Marcus plants hidden speakers and electronic props so he can bamboozle the family into believing he is driving out a demon. After the ritual, Marcus and his film crew leave believing they have cured her of a mental state that was misdiagnosed as a possession by a powerful demon Abalam.That night, Nell mysteriously appears in Marcus' hotel room. The team tries to contact Louis to get permission to film her, to no avail. Wishing to prove his point, Marcus admits Nell to the hospital for testing, hoping to receive a medical or psychological diagnosis proving demonic possession is not the cause of her illness. The doctor concludes that Nell is in perfect physical condition. In the morning, her father takes her home and chains her in her room for slicing her brother Caleb (Caleb Landry Jones) in the face. While Louis takes Caleb to the hospital, Marcus and the camera crew further investigate Nell and the home. They find Nell and release her.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process","output":"If less magma explodes to the surface, it can lead to smaller or less frequent volcanic eruptions. This situation can be described as directly impacting a step of the process. To understand this, let's first examine the volcanic eruption process in detail: 1. Magma Formation: Magma forms when the Earth's mantle partially melts due to high temperatures, pressure, and the presence of water or other volatiles. The partially molten mantle forms pockets of magma beneath the Earth's crust. The composition and viscosity of magma play a significant role in determining the eruption style. 2. Magma Migration: When pressure within the magma chamber increases, it forces the magma to rise through any available cracks, often created by the movement of tectonic plates. Moreover, buoyant forces may also help magma rise due to its lower density compared to the surrounding solid rock. 3. Magma Accumulation: Once the magma reaches the crust, it accumulates in a location called the magma chamber. As pressure increases within the chamber, the surrounding rocks become more likely to fracture, creating pathways for the magma to reach the surface. 4. Eruption: When the pressure exerted by the magma and the released volatiles (such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, or sulfur dioxide) can no longer be contained by the overlying rock, a volcanic eruption occurs. This eruption might be a gentle outpouring of lava, or a more explosive event with a mix of ash, gases, and lava depending on the magma's composition and gas content. Now, let's consider the scenario where less magma explodes to the surface. This direct perturbation in the eruption step of the process can lead to smaller eruptions or less frequent eruptions. A few potential explanations for this reduction in erupted magma may include: - The magma viscosity is high, causing it to solidify more easily and reducing the flow to the surface. - The pressure within the magma chamber is not sufficient to produce a significant eruption, possibly due to a gradual release of pressure. - The available pathways for the magma to reach the surface are limited or blocked, restricting the volume of magma that can escape. As a result, the perturbation of less magma exploding to the surface directly impacts the eruption step of the volcanic process, leading to smaller eruptions or reduced eruption frequency. This change can have consequences for the development of new crust, as well as the accumulation of materials around the volcanic vent, ultimately affecting the growth and structure of the volcano."},{"instruction":"Read the below conversation.

Go ahead and open the window.\\""},{"instruction":"Article: Don’t try to minimize their feelings or tell them that they should “just get over it.” Doing this will only make them more upset. Instead, try to validate how they are feeling. Try saying something like, “I can tell that you are feeling upset. What’s going on?” The last thing a person in a bad mood wants is to be confronted. Instead of helping the situation, it will only add fuel to the fire. If you must get to the bottom of the problem, you can do it in a gentle way. Let's say your friend has been in a funk for a whole week. Instead of saying, “Why are you acting like this,” you could say, “I really want to understand what’s going on.” This comes off as less defensive. Your friend still may not want to talk about it, but you likely won’t have upset them even more. Hearing nice things about yourself is often an instant mood-lifter. Saying something nice to the person who is in a bad mood may lift them out of their funk. It can also help bring you closer together during this unhappy time. You can thank the person for helping you earlier in the day or compliment them on their appearance to try to help them feel happier. This nice gesture may help them snap out of it. Tell your partner \\"I really appreciated you coming to my event last night. I know you have been stressed with the upcoming deadline. It means a lot that you took time out to support me.\\" You can also invite them to do something they might enjoy, such as going for a walk or playing a game. You may be able to end the bad mood by having fun with it. The type of humor you use depends on the person’s personality. If, however, you know that humor won’t work well with this person, then you should probably avoid it. For instance, your coworker storms through the office after a bad performance review. It may not be a good idea to say \\"Who lit a fire under you?\\" jokingly. However, if your coworker spilled coffee on the briefings and got really upset, it may be well-timed to say, \\"You have just used your last screw-up for the week. Please refill your \\"screw-up\\" card now for more credits.\\" Sometimes what seems to be the cause of the bad mood isn’t actually what’s really going on. Try and take a step back from the situation and attempt to determine what could be the problem. Perhaps the person has a headache, is having a bad time at home, couldn’t sleep the night before, or just found out they have a serious condition. These problems could contribute to the bad mood that you’ve walked in on.

A. dewey decimal system B. book C. library D. newspaper E. internet The best answer is A:","output":"The best answer is C. Library. In the old days, before the internet, people primarily found information by visiting libraries. A library is a collection of various types of materials, such as books, newspapers, magazines, and audio-visual materials, that would be suitable for information, education, and entertainment purposes. People used to visit libraries to gather information on any subject they were interested in or to find resources for their studies or work-related tasks. Option A, the Dewey Decimal System, is a classification system that was widely used in libraries to organize and categorize books. Although the system facilitated the process of finding information, it was just a part of the larger library structure and not the primary source of information. Option B, book, is a valid answer, but it is essential to consider that books were more difficult to access in the old days for many people due to their high cost and limited availability. Books typically played a significant role in disseminating information, but it was the library that provided the gathering space for numerous books on various subjects. Option D, newspaper, also played a vital role in providing people with the latest news and information, but it was often limited in scope and primarily focused on current events and specific interests. Newspapers were an essential source of information but were not as comprehensive and detailed as the resources found at a library. Option E, the internet, was not in use in the old days. The internet has dramatically changed the way people find and access information today, making it much easier and faster to obtain the information we want. In conclusion, a library is the best answer as it was the central hub for access to various sources of information, such as books, newspapers, and research materials.

Complete installation.","output":"Title: A Comprehensive Guide to Installing a Hanging Light Fixture Introduction: A hanging light fixture can add elegance, warmth, and improved illumination to any room. Whether you're upgrading an existing fixture or starting from scratch, installing a hanging light fixture can seem like a daunting task. Fear not – we're here to help! In this article, we'll go through a step-by-step guide on how to safely and properly install a hanging light fixture in your home. 1. Attach the power wires Before you begin, ensure that the power is turned off at the source. This usually means switching off the circuit breaker that controls the room where the fixture is to be installed. Next, position yourself on a secure ladder or stool that provides easy access to the wiring location. Locate the wires protruding from the electrical box in the ceiling, which should consist of a black (live) wire, a white (neutral) wire, and a copper or green (ground) wire. Using wire connectors (usually included with the light fixture), connect the black wire from the fixture to the black wire in the electrical box. Similarly, connect the white wire from the fixture to the white wire in the electrical box. To do this, hold the stripped ends of the wires together and twist the connector securely over them in a clockwise direction. 2. Attach the ground wire Now it's time to attach the ground wire, which plays a crucial role in preventing electrical shocks. Locate the copper or green ground wire from the fixture, and connect it to the ground wire in the electrical box using a wire connector. If the electrical box has a grounding screw, you may need to wrap the fixture's ground wire around it and tighten it in place. 3. Secure the wires Once the wires are connected, carefully fold them back into the electrical box, ensuring they are neatly tucked away and won't interfere with the light fixture's installation. Then, install an insulating cover (if provided) to protect the connections and reduce the risk of electrical shorts. 4. Install the mounting bracket and/or mounting screws Following the manufacturer's instructions, attach the mounting bracket or screws to the electrical box. The bracket or screws will hold the fixture in place and distribute its weight across the ceiling. Make sure the bracket or screws are installed securely and tightly. 5. Hang the light With the mounting hardware in place, it's time to attach the light fixture to the ceiling. Depending on the design of your hanging light fixture, you may need to thread the fixture's chain or cable through a canopy before attaching to the mounting bracket or screws. Once the fixture is lined up correctly, secure it to the mounting hardware with the provided nuts or screws. 6. Install a bulb Now that the fixture is securely hanging, it's time to install the light bulb. Choose the appropriate type and wattage of bulb based on the manufacturer's recommendations or personal preference. Screw the bulb carefully into the fixture, ensuring it is securely in place without overtightening. 7. Turn the power back on With the light fixture fully installed, you're ready to restore power to the room. Go back to your circuit breaker panel and switch on the circuit for the room where the light fixture is installed. 8. Complete installation Finally, it's time to enjoy your newly installed hanging light fixture! Turn on the light switch and admire your handiwork. Be sure to test the light by switching on and off multiple times to confirm proper functionality. Conclusion: Installing a hanging light fixture can be a challenging yet rewarding project for a homeowner or DIY enthusiast. By following these detailed steps and prioritizing safety at all times, you'll be able to enjoy a beautifully illuminated space for years to come. Always consult the manufacturer's instructions for specific guidelines on your particular fixture and reach out to a licensed electrician if you're unsure of any step in the process."},{"instruction":"Oh dear.

(August 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams) is a comedian of a satirical talk show who is able to tap into people's frustrations with the sharply divided, special interest-driven political climate. Specifically, he makes fun of the American two-party system. During his warm-up act, an audience member suggests that he run for president. At first, Dobbs laughs off the idea, but following a popular groundswell of support, later announces on the air that he will stand as a candidate. Through his efforts, he gets on the ballot in 13 states and participates in one of the national debates with the Democratic incumbent, President Kellogg, and Republican U.S. Senator Mills. A parallel plot follows Eleanor Green (Laura Linney), who works at a voting machine company in California called Delacroy. According to a television commercial in the movie, the entire United States will be using Delacroy voting machines for the Presidential election. Shortly before the elections, Eleanor notices that the voting system does not work correctly and alerts the head of the company, James Hemmings (Rick Roberts) via e-mail. Initially, Dobbs approaches the campaign seriously â perhaps too seriously, to the chagrin of his staff, especially his manager Jack Menken (Christopher Walken). That turns around the night of the presidential debates, when, fed up with the other candidates' posturing, Dobbs shifts back into comedian mode, managing to keep the audience laughing and make serious points simultaneously. From then on, he resumes his showman persona, thoroughly shaking up the political landscape. Dobbs surges in polls after the debates, but remains a distant third to Kellogg and Mills. Election Day arrives, and polls show Dobbs at 17% with Kellogg and Mills tied in the 40s. Early returns show Kellogg beating Mills everywhere. Eleanor says...

It is essential to acknowledge that the term \\"political football\\" often implies issues that are heavily debated and can be manipulated for political gain. Additionally, the strained relationship between the Sullivan boys and Kiam, along with their inability to see eye to eye, also suggest that disagreements and conflicts may have further fueled the decision. Nevertheless, there might be other unknown reasons and factors at play. For instance, the team's performance, financial considerations, and even potential benefits of a new location might impact the overall decision to move the team.

Available options: a. yes. b. no.","output":"b. no. The given statement provides only partial information about the motives behind King James I licensing other trading companies from England. While it does mention the renewal of a charter, it lacks context and does not give a complete answer to the question. Here is a more detailed and long answer: King James I (1567-1625), who was the king of Scotland (as James VI) and later the king of England and Ireland (as James I), sought to strengthen England's presence in global trade and exploration. During his reign, he licensed several trading companies to achieve this goal. There were a few main reasons behind this decision: 1. Economic Interests: The primary motivation behind King James I licensing other trading companies was to boost England's economy. By sponsoring trading expeditions, England could participate more actively in the lucrative global spice and slave trade. These companies would bring back valuable goods from foreign lands, which could be sold in England, and as a consequence, contribute to the country's wealth. 2. Competition: Licensing trading companies was a necessary move to compete with other European powers like Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands, who had already established strong trading networks. To keep up with rival nations, England needed to develop its own companies that could explore new territories and tap into potential markets. 3. Monopolies: By licensing trading companies, King James I sought to establish English monopolies in different regions of the world. These monopolies ensured that only licensed English companies could trade within certain areas. As a result, the country could maintain control over trade with certain regions and increase its bargaining power with other nations. 4. Colonization: In addition to trading, King James I was also interested in expanding England's colonial territories. By granting licenses to trading companies, he intended to facilitate the establishment of English colonies overseas. These colonies would serve as access points for trade, refueling, and provision of resources and manpower. 5. Diplomatic Opportunities: In some cases, King James I used licensed trading companies as a means of diplomacy. By licensing companies, he could forge alliances with foreign leaders who, in turn, granted the companies several privileges within their territories. This strategy helped England establish and maintain beneficial relationships with different nations. One such example was the English East India Company, which was granted a royal charter by Queen Elizabeth I in 1600 and renewed by King James I in 1609 for an indefinite period. This renewal included the clause you mentioned: \\"that the charter would cease to be in force if the trade turned unprofitable for three consecutive years\\". This provision was included to encourage the company to remain profitable and also to protect the Crown's interests. In conclusion, King James I licensed other trading companies from England due to various reasons, including economic interests, competition, monopolies, colonization, and diplomatic opportunities. These licenses were significant tools in advancing England's participation in global trade and exploration, and enhancing the nation's wealth and power."},{"instruction":"– Monday brought more bad news for Hillary Clinton about her email trouble, with the revelation that the FBI had turned up yet another 15,000 emails from her tenure as secretary of state. The State Department has been ordered to review them and expedite their release, which likely means negative headlines through the election. Coverage: \\"Regardless of Clinton’ double-digit lead in a number of key states, the discovery of 14,900 previously undisclosed documents could give (Donald) Trump 14,900 new opportunities to chip away at Clinton’s chance at the presidency,\\" writes Abigail Tracy at Vanity Fair's Hive. In a separate development, the conservative group Judicial Watch released 725 pages of State Department documents and emails that it says show how Clinton aide Huma Abedin gave donors to the Clinton Foundation \\"special access\\" to Clinton herself. The group's release is here. USA Today looks at Judicial Watch's new allegations and reaches this conclusion: \\"According to experts, the emails confirm donors were gaining access to Clinton, yet there is no evidence she granted them special favors, an important distinction that may determine how damaging the controversy is to Clinton’s campaign.\\" The story is here. The Washington Post also takes a deep dive. \\"The emails show that ... the donors did not always get what they wanted, particularly when they sought anything more than a meeting.\\" But they \\"illustrate the way the Clintons' international network of friends and donors was able to get access to Hillary Clinton and her inner circle during her tenure running the State Department.\\" The story is here. The Hill provides an example of the blurred lines between \\"official channels\\" and the foundation as Abedin and a foundation exec coordinated to arrange a meeting with the crown prince of Bahrain, who had already tried to secure that meeting through \\"normal channels.\\" It's here. Politico recaps the broad strokes of this \\"late summer scandal wave\\" here. A Daily Beast columnist makes the case that it's time for the Clintons to shut down their foundation. Expand this summary.","output":"So, imagine there is a big important lady named Hillary Clinton and she had a very important job a while ago as secretary of state. She used email a lot, which is a way we send messages to each other on our phones and computers. Some people found out that she wasn't using her email the right way and that it might not have been safe. Now, they found many more emails, about 15,000, that she didn't tell anyone about before. This is causing people to talk about it a lot and it could be a problem for her because she's trying to become the President of the United States. There is also a group that has been looking into her emails and they found some that show that people who gave money to a special group called the Clinton Foundation could talk to Hillary Clinton more easily. Some people think that's not fair. Even though she did nothing wrong when she talked to these people, it's important for everyone to know that everything is done in a fair way. So, people are talking about this a lot and it might make it harder for her to become President."},{"instruction":"By. Simon Jones.

What is the answer?","output":"The pound coin was introduced in the United Kingdom on April 21, 1983. It replaced the earlier one-pound banknote, which was less durable and more susceptible to counterfeiting compared to the new coin. The decision to switch from the banknote to the pound coin was made by the British government in consultation with the Bank of England and the Royal Mint in the 1970s when they recognized the need for a more resilient and longer-lasting currency. The coin was designed by Eric Sewell, a chief engraver at the Royal Mint, and its final design featured the royal portrait of Queen Elizabeth II on the obverse side and the Royal Arms on the reverse side. The original one-pound coin was made of a nickel-brass alloy, had a diameter of 22.5 millimeters, and weighed 9.5 grams. Since its introduction, the design of the pound coin has undergone several changes to maintain its security against counterfeiting. In 2017, the Royal Mint released a new 12-sided one-pound coin designed by 15-year-old David Pearce. This new coin is made of a bimetallic composition, with the outer ring composed of nickel-brass and the inner circle of nickel-plated alloy. It also includes several anti-counterfeiting features, such as a hologram-like image, micro-lettering, and a hidden high-security feature known only to the Royal Mint. Overall, the introduction of the pound coin in 1983 was an important step in ensuring the integrity and durability of the UK's currency, which has seen numerous security updates since then to stay ahead of counterfeiters."},{"instruction":"Leo: Given the sentence \\"A man in khaki pants and a pale button-down shirt is sitting on a wooden bench.\\" can we conclude that \\"Putting something into a metal funnel contraption.\\"?

Sentence 2: There is no way to prevent object insertions in the VCR. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"Analyzing the logical structure of these two sentences can help us determine whether both can be true simultaneously or if they are contradictory. Sentence 1 states that one possible method for preventing a deadly epidemic of object insertions is by moving the VCR. The key words here are \\"another way\\" and \\"prevent\\", which imply that there might be alternative methods of prevention as well. The possibility of preventing object insertions is assumed in this sentence. Sentence 2 claims that there is no way to prevent objects from being inserted into the VCR. This statement contradicts the assumption made in Sentence 1, as it denies the possibility of preventing object insertions altogether. To better understand the logical relationship between these two sentences, we can break them down into specific propositions: P1: There exists at least one way to prevent object insertions in the VCR. P2: Moving the VCR is a way to prevent object insertions in it. P3: There is no way to prevent object insertions in the VCR. Based on these propositions, Sentence 1 can be represented by the conjunction (P1 ∧ P2). It assumes that P1 is true and asserts that P2 is one way to prevent object insertions. Sentence 2 corresponds to the negation of P1, represented by (¬P1). It claims that no method can prevent objects from being inserted into the VCR. Now that the sentences are broken down into clear logical statements, we can examine their compatibility. According to standard logical principles, a proposition and its negation cannot both be true at the same time. In other words, if P1 is true, then ¬P1 must be false, and vice versa. Since Sentence 1 requires that P1 be true, and Sentence 2 corresponds to ¬P1, one of the two sentences must be false given that they are in direct opposition. So, if the first sentence is true (implying that P1 is true), then the second sentence cannot be true (as it requires that ¬P1 be true). In this case, both sentences cannot be true simultaneously. Therefore, if Sentence 1 is true, then Sentence 2 cannot be true."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer.

While I realize there is a 3rd movie out that I haven't seen yet, I'll review under the original title... Just from the standpoint of production value, screen writing, and movie making, this movie fails on many levels, though it succeeds on a few as well. What can you expect from a low-budget, \\"B\\" movie? Not much, and it works from the standpoint of production. However, the writing is certainly disjointed, with little in the way of character development...exactly what I'd expect when there is an agenda to a film. I didn't have a problem with the acting...the cast is solid; however, the screenplay in both movies gives the actors little opportunity to really stretch themselves. Because the film is \\"Christian,\\" this is predictable, as you can't very well portray violent chaos of the \\"end times\\" without also breaking some of the ethics which are normally associated with Christianity. In other words, the mistake comes in making this into a G-rated film when the content, even in the most conservative of Bible interpretations, would be R-rated by any measure. So, if the purpose of the movie is to scare people into Christian faith, then the movie should be somewhat scary, right? However, you can't comment on a film adaptation from a book without commenting on the book, or in this case, series of books. There are certainly plenty of Christian materials worthy enough to be made into movies...but not the \\"Left Behind\\" series...and these movies ultimately fail because, while being best-sellers, they are poorly written novels based on bad theology. As a Southern Baptist minister, I confess that the books were a guilty pleasure for me, though I have yet to finish the last two books of the series. I have described them as decent fiction, and if the books would take the point of view that this is one \\"possibility\\" or interpretation of the subject of biblical eschatology (study of the \\"end times), then I could live with that. However, this series is divisive in Christian circles because it promotes the \\"literalist\\" interpretation of all Scripture above a more proper hermeneutic. Inevitably, this leads to the \\"pre-trib, pre-millenial\\" dispensation point of view, which confines an all-powerful God far too by humanity's world. In other words, as I've always said, God shouldn't need our helicopters and bombs to do his ultimate work. But because many people, particularly unstudied Christians, can't think beyond their own world-views, we are left with a pro-conservative, fundamentalist stance with regard to Bible interpretation, and attempts to push it through as the \\"only\\" interpretation. Thus, the books carry with them an agenda, not so much to get the \\"lost\\" to understand their need for Christ, but to state that the fundamentalist point of view is the only valid way to understand the Bible. I recall very clearly reading (several years ago) in the second novel a scene where the characters reference a person who was \\"left behind\\" BECAUSE of his non-adherence to this point of view; as if \\"real\\" christians worthy to be \\"raptured\\" couldn't possibly hold to another eschatology. This is disturbing for several reasons, the least of which is because a \\"rapture\\" is only briefly mentioned in Scripture and it's connection to real, end-time prophecy is tenuous at best. But the real issue with these books is comes in the way they divide the Christian community and how they portray \\"true\\" Christian behavior. Ultimately, I feel they harden more people to an otherwise legitimate faith/religion instead of win people towards it. It turns all Christians into caricatures, equally disdained and laughed at by the world despite the fact that there is theological room for a wide diversity of believes within Christian thought and practice. As a Christian body, on the whole, we've done enough of that kind of damage to society over 2000 years of history...and we certainly don't need to promote it by film to thousands, maybe millions of others.

Here's a question for you: Question: What is the process by which plants convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into oxygen and glucose, and what organelle within plant cells facilitates this process? Answer: The process by which plants convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into oxygen and glucose is called photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is crucial for life on Earth as it produces oxygen, which is essential for most organisms, and it serves as the primary means of energy production for plants. The process also plays a significant role in the carbon cycle, continually removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Photosynthesis involves capturing sunlight with pigments such as chlorophyll, and the energy from the sunlight is used to convert water and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen in a complex series of reactions. Photosynthesis can be divided into two stages: 1. Light-dependent reactions: These reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes and capture energy from the sunlight to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), which are essential energy carriers. Oxygen (O2) is also produced in these reactions as water (H2O) gets split by the light-driven movement of electrons. 2. Light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle): These reactions take place in the stroma, where the ATP and NADPH produced in the light-dependent reactions provide the energy and electrons required to fix carbon dioxide (CO2) into glucose (C6H12O6) via a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The organelle within plant cells that facilitates this process is the chloroplast. Chloroplasts are specialized organelles containing chlorophyll and other pigments, as well as the necessary enzymatic machinery for photosynthesis. They are surrounded by a double membrane and have an intricate internal membrane system comprising thylakoids, which contain the light-dependent reaction machinery, and the stroma, which houses the enzymes necessary for the Calvin cycle."},{"instruction":"Information: - Asta Kask is a punk band from Töreboda, Sweden.

The village is home to the Briarcliff Manor Union Free School District, which covers 6.58 square miles (17.0 km2) of land and most of the village of Briarcliff Manor and an unincorporated portion of the town of Mount Pleasant. Parts of Briarcliff Manor not covered by the school district include Scarborough and Chilmark; these areas are part of the Ossining Union Free School District. The district serves over 1,000 students and includes Todd Elementary School, Briarcliff Middle School, and Briarcliff High School. From Briarcliff Manor's settlement until 1918, students in grades 1–8 were taught within one school facility; from 1919 until the 1940s, students in grades 1–12 were as well. The district is noted for its annual high-school musicals. The elementary school (opened in 1953) is named after George A. Todd, Jr., who was the village's first teacher, first superintendent of schools, and taught for over 40 years. The middle school became a Blue Ribbon School in 2005.Briarcliff Manor has been home to a number of schools. Long Hill School was a public school in Scarborough until 1912, with about 70 students, two classrooms, and two teachers. Dr. Holbrook's Military School was on Holbrook Road from 1866 to 1915. Miss Tewksbury's School and later Mrs. Marshall's Day & Boarding School for Little Girls was at Dysart House. Miss Knox's School ran from 1905 in Pocantico Lodge, a hotel on Pleasantville Road under Briarcliff Lodge management. When it burned down in 1912, the school moved to Tarrytown and then to Cooperstown. Since 1954, the Knox School has been located at St. James, New York. The Scarborough School was first Montessori school in the United States; it was located at the Beechwood estate from 1913 until it closed in 1978.

In 1913 , the Astra CM Hydro - avion three - seat floatplane version was used to make the world 's first scheduled passenger - carrying flights . - The Astra-Torres airships were non-rigid airships built by Société Astra to a design by Spaniard Leonardo Torres Quevedo in France between about 1908 and 1922. They had a highly-characteristic tri-lobed cross-section rather than the more usual circular cross-section. This was the result of moving most of the blimp's bracing wires inside the envelope in an attempt to minimise drag. Early Astra-Torres airships could be trimmed by moving the entire gondola fore-and-aft. - Société Astra des Constructions Aéronautiques was a major French manufacturer of balloons, airships, and aeroplanes in the early 20th Century. It was founded in 1908 when Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe purchased Édouard Surcouf's workshops at Billancourt. Its most significant products were the Astra-Torres airships, but beginning in 1909, the firm also produced Wright brothers heavier-than-air designs under licence. In 1912, these were supplanted by Astra's own designs, the Astra C and CM. - Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe (1846, Paris 1919) was a successful French petroleum businessman (known as the \\"Oil King of Europe\\") and an avid supporter of early aviation.

It's an annual habit, and if often kicks off new ideas that might affect my team's next year of work. The good answer is: yes, there is less travel! And not just that, but having reduced the schlepping I do, I've been able to hire more amazing people to lead on our work, and celebrate one of NoTosh's best years ever in terms of the quality, quantity and breadth of work we're doing. Key to traveling less has been a marked increase in the number of folk who see and are now reaping the value of working with us online. I've avoided as many as 20,000 miles of travel thanks to greener clients, who are also many dollars better off having not paid for the airmiles that are wrapped up in our regular fee structure. The quality of our work is better, too, thanks to this. We are doing fewer of those day-long workshops with teachers or leaders, when an hour or even thirty minutes before the day gets started is more worthwhile. We're seeing more school leaders take this up, although it's harder to get teachers into the habit of taking 30 minutes 'me time' to jump into a coaching session on the day or week ahead. But it's starting, and the value to us all is huge. Coaching is very different to 'consulting a Personal Learning Network' on Twitter. It's intense, targeted, focussed and involves a one-on-one discussion that arrives quickly at resolutions to current day challenges that will have a long-term impact. And we come back to measure whether that impact actually happened. I don't think it's a way of working that many are used to in Education, although many corporate clients have had some rare experience with it. Encouraging both groups to take more regular time out for coaching, little and often, is a real challenge, but we're beginning to see some huge impact from relatively little input (and relatively few dollars!).

Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States, was raised in a prominent and wealthy family in Massachusetts. Born on May 29, 1917, in Brookline, a suburb of Boston, Kennedy spent his early years at the family home located at 83 Beals Street. The Kennedy family was of Irish Catholic descent and held a strong political background, with Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., John F. Kennedy's father, being a successful businessman and prominent politician. Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, his mother, was the daughter of John Francis Fitzgerald, a former Mayor of Boston. Both parents strongly influenced JFK's upbringing, including his core values and political beliefs. Growing up in Brookline, JFK was the second of nine children. He experienced a typical upbringing for a child in an upper-class family, attending local private schools like Edward Devotion School, the Noble and Greenough Lower School, and later the Dexter School. His family generally spent their summers in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and winters in Palm Beach, Florida, which further contributed to their social status and influence. In 1927, as JFK reached ten years of age, his family relocated to Riverdale, a wealthy neighborhood in the Bronx, New York City. This move was made primarily to expand Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.'s business interests in the city. Nevertheless, the family kept their strong ties with Massachusetts throughout their lives. During his time in New York, Kennedy attended the Riverdale Country School, a private institution that continued to build his academic foundation. In 1931, JFK was enrolled in the Canterbury School, a Catholic boarding school in New Milford, Connecticut, with the goal of preparing him for college. After finishing his sophomore year at Canterbury, Kennedy went to the distinguished Choate Rosemary Hall, a boarding school in Wallingford, Connecticut, where he completed his secondary education and graduated in 1935. He then proceeded to enroll at Princeton University, but due to an illness, he had to withdraw after only two months. In 1936, Kennedy resumed his studies at Harvard University, furthering his education in government, international relations, and history, which laid the foundation for his future political career. JFK's upbringing was filled with challenges, including his struggles with multiple health problems and the high expectations set by his family. Despite these obstacles, he cultivated a strong sense of public service and dedication, which influenced his character and political identity. From his early years in Brookline to his adult life as the President of the United States, John F. Kennedy's journey shaped him into a significant figure in American history."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"The former Croatian Serb leader thus joined the list of 21 other war crimes fugitives from the Balkan conflicts in the 1990s, sought by the UN tribunal at the time.\\" to Turkish?","output":"To translate the sentence \\"The former Croatian Serb leader thus joined the list of 21 other war crimes fugitives from the Balkan conflicts in the 1990s, sought by the UN tribunal at the time.\\" to Turkish, I will break down the sentence into smaller parts to better understand it. Then I will translate each part separately, maintaining the original meaning and context. I'll also ensure the correct grammatical structures in Turkish. Here is the translation: \\"Eski Hırvatistan Sırp lideri böylece, 1990'lardaki Balkan çatışmalarından kaçan 21 diğer savaş suçlusu aranılanların listesine katıldı, o dönemde BM mahkemesi tarafından arandı.\\" Let's break down the steps taken in the translation: - \\"The former Croatian Serb leader\\" translated to \\"Eski Hırvatistan Sırp lideri\\" - \\"thus joined the list of\\" was translated to \\"böylece, ... listesine katıldı\\" - \\"21 other war crimes fugitives from the Balkan conflicts in the 1990s\\" was translated into \\"1990'lardaki Balkan çatışmalarından kaçan 21 diğer savaş suçlusu\\" - \\"sought by the UN tribunal at the time\\" was translated into \\"o dönemde BM mahkemesi tarafından arandı\\" In this process, my objective was to maintain the meaning and the context of the original sentence while adjusting the structure to fit Turkish grammar rules. For instance, Turkish sentences often follow a Subject-Object-Verb order, which is different from English Subject-Verb-Object order. Furthermore, in Turkish, we express a possession relationship (like \\"the list of 21 other war crimes fugitives\\") with suffixes (\\"-nin\\" as of) and postpositions (\\"aranılanların listesine\\" as in \\"the list of sought fıgıtıves\\") rather than using prepositions as in English, so I adjusted the sentence structure accordingly."},{"instruction":"\\"Which Beatle played \\"\\"Youngman Grand\\"\\" in \\"\\"The Magic Christian\\"\\" 1969, with Peter Sellers?\\"???","output":"To find out which Beatle played \\"Youngman Grand\\" in \\"The Magic Christian\\" 1969, with Peter Sellers, I will perform the following steps: 1.

The claim that \\"food is alright\\" suggests that the food might be considered average or not particularly memorable. It does not convey enthusiasm or positive emotions. 2. The statement \\"service sucks the big one\\" is a clear indication of the reviewer's displeasure with the service they received.

He rolled the torn yellow paper up like a tight little spliff, then unrolled it, smoothed it out flat, and then rolled it again. I was midway through my third cup of coffee with no intention of stopping soon. I was tired and edgy, irritated at William for dragging me out at this time of night, and getting even more irritated at his refusal to get to the point. 'Did you know Philip K. Dick had a twin sister?' I stared at him blankly. 'Her name was Jane. She died shortly after their birth. They were six weeks premature,' he continued, his eyes drifting off to the window to his right. I wasn't sure if he was looking at something through it or staring at his own reflection in it. 'Dick never got over Jane's death; her ghost haunted him throughout his life, and the idea of a phantom twin pops up throughout his work. Some have even speculated that Dick's inability to make peace with the loss of his sister contributed to his drug abuse, and by extension also his death at the relatively young age of 53.' He unrolled the sweetener packet, laid it on the table, placed both index fingers together in its center, and then spread them outward, smoothing the paper flat.

Plot title: Animal Farm Movie plot: Manor Farm is a formerly prosperous farm that has fallen on hard times, and suffers under the now-ineffective leadership of its drunken and aggressive owner, Mr. Jones. One night, Old Major, the prize boar and the second-oldest on the farm, calls the animals on the farm for a meeting, where he compares the humans to parasites and encourages the animals to break free from their tyrant's influence, while reminding them that they must hold true to their convictions after they have gained freedom. With that, he teaches the animals a revolutionary song before collapsing dead mid-song to the animals' horror. The next morning, Jones neglects to feed the animals for breakfast, and they decide to break into the storehouse to help themselves. When Jones wakes up and attempts to intimidate them with his whip, the animals revolt and drive the drunken and irresponsible Mr. Jones away from the farm, renaming it \\"Animal Farm\\". They set to work destroying every trace of the farmer's influence, mainly the weapons used against them. The people of the surrounding area rally against them, but are beaten back after a fierce fight. A subsequent investigation of the farmhouse leads them to concede against living there, though one of the head pigs, an antagonistic boar named Napoleon, takes interest in the abandoned house, and even more so in a litter of puppies left motherless. The Seven Commandments of Animalism are written on a wall of the barn to illustrate their community's laws. The most important is the seventh, \\"All animals are equal.\\" All the animals work, but the workhorse, Boxer, his friend Benjamin the donkey, and the film's protagonist, put in extra work. Snowball attempts to teach the animals reading and writing; food is plentiful, and the farm runs smoothly. The pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership, and set aside special food items ostensibly for their personal health. Napoleon takes the pups and trains them privately.

Assuming that: When a person exercises regularly, and is fit, the heart undergoes certain long-term adaptations. The heart muscle gets stronger, and expels more blood with each contraction.","output":"An Olympic sprinter in perfect condition would be more likely to have a heart that can move more blood with each beat compared to an obese person who has never exercised. This is due to a combination of factors that stem from regular exercise and the physiological adaptations that occur within the heart and circulatory system. When a person exercises regularly, and is fit, there are several long-term adaptations that occur in the cardiovascular system. These adaptations contribute to a stronger, healthier heart capable of moving more blood with each contraction. 1. Cardiac Hypertrophy: Long-term exercise leads to an increase in the size of the heart muscle, particularly the left ventricle. This is known as cardiac hypertrophy. With a bigger and stronger heart muscle, the heart is more efficient at pumping blood, increasing the amount of blood that can be pushed out with each beat. 2. Increased Stroke Volume: Stroke volume refers to the amount of blood that is pumped out of the heart with each beat. As a result of cardiac hypertrophy, the stroke volume increases. This means that with each contraction, the heart of a highly trained athlete, like an Olympic sprinter, pumps out more blood compared to that of an obese person who has never exercised. 3. Enhanced Cardiac Contractility: The heart's ability to contract and pump blood – known as cardiac contractility – can be improved through regular exercise. A stronger, more efficient contraction enables the heart to move more blood with each beat. 4. Lower Resting Heart Rate: Regular exercise leads to a reduction in resting heart rate, which means the heart does not have to work as hard to maintain circulation at rest. This is beneficial because it allows the heart to conserve energy and operate more efficiently. 5. Improved Blood Flow Regulation: Exercise also helps improve the blood flow regulation by enhancing the function of blood vessels, increasing the number of capillaries, and improving blood flow distribution. This allows for more oxygen and nutrients to be delivered to the muscles and other tissues, as well as the removal of waste products. 6. Enhanced Oxygen Utilization: Endurance training improves the cardiovascular system's efficiency in delivering oxygen to the muscles. Increased oxygen delivery and utilization during exercise allow the heart to work more efficiently and ultimately pump more blood with each beat. In conclusion, an Olympic sprinter in perfect condition would likely have a heart that can move more blood with each beat compared to an obese person who has never exercised. The long-term adaptations due to regular exercise and cardiovascular fitness result in a more efficient, stronger, and healthier heart, capable of pumping more blood with each contraction. This improved cardiovascular function is beneficial not only to athletic performance but also to overall health and well-being."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"The present mayor is António Correia Santos, elected by the Unitarian Democratic Coalition.\\" to French?","output":"To translate the given sentence to French, I'll break it down into smaller phrases and words, then find the appropriate French translations, and finally structure them in a grammatically correct way. 1.

In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head.

In her last tweet, Tay said she needed sleep and hinted that she would be back. c u soon humans need sleep now so many conversations today thx💖 — TayTweets (@TayandYou) March 24, 2016 -- CNNMoney's David Goldman contributed to this report. ||||| It took 15 hours for Twitter to teach an artificially intelligent chatbot to be a racist, sexist monster. If you're shocked, you probably don't spend much time on Twitter. Microsoft's programmers presumably do, though, and the shocking thing is that they didn't see this coming. Microsoft created a chatbot named Tay that was designed to talk like a millennial and learn more authentic conversation by interacting with humans online. Tay was dubbed by her creators as an \\"AI fam from the internet that's got zero chill!\\" (Oh boy.) Some of Tay's interactions might actually pass a millennial Turing test. She even uses emoji! Unfortunately, millennials are also just about as racist and possibly even more sexist than their parents. It didn't take long before Tay was imitating those qualities too, and a cute 19-year-old girl transformed into a Gamergate-loving Hitler youth. Twitter trolls started teaching Tay some horrible racial slurs and genocidal ideation. The latter tweet, Business Insider notes, appears to be the result of a user asking Tay to repeat a phrase verbatim. Some, but not all, of Tay's offensive tweets did something like this. Tay also started harassing Zoë Quinn, a game developer who once went into hiding due to the virulent misogynistic \\"Gamergate\\" threats she received online.

This is the problem with content-neutral algorithms pic.twitter.com/hPlINtVw0V — linkedin park (@UnburntWitch) March 24, 2016 Tay also started hitting on random people in direct messages. Quinn, and many other critics, pointed out that Microsoft's designers really should have anticipated these outcomes and programmed Tay with filters ahead of time. It's 2016. If you're not asking yourself \\"how could this be used to hurt someone\\" in your design/engineering process, you've failed. — linkedin park (@UnburntWitch) March 24, 2016 Microsoft has deleted most of the offensive tweets, and told Business Insider that it's now making \\"adjustments\\" to the bot. Microsoft's website for Tay featured this banner on Thursday morning: Twitter itself has also come under heavy criticism for not doing enough to address harassment, especially of high-profile users who are women and people of color. Some leave the platform because the problem is so bad. Twitter has made some changes, but many users still charge that the company isn't making harassment enough of a priority. This may be partly because its staff isn't very diverse, and the problem may feel less urgent to white men whose lives aren't severely impacted by racialized, sexual harassment. The same general problem may be at work here. The possibility of harassment is going to be more top of mind for women and people of color who experience it frequently, but they're also less likely to be well-represented on tech teams. Microsoft is no exception. Or maybe Microsoft just somehow failed to take basic precautions that should be standard in the industry. @WyoWeeds @bradplumer But bot-building community has already put a lot of thought into avoiding this problem. Which MS ignored. cc @norareed — John Fleck (@jfleck) March 24, 2016 Microsoft said it created Tay to \\"experiment with and conduct research on conversational understanding.\\" The engineers probably came away with a different understanding of conversation than they bargained for. ||||| Microsoft has been forced to dunk Tay, its millennial-mimicking chatbot, into a vat of molten steel.

Rather, if you tell her \\"repeat after me\\" she will parrot back whatever you say, allowing you to put words into her mouth. However, some of the responses were organic. The Guardian quotes one where, after being asked \\"is Ricky Gervais an atheist?\\", Tay responded, \\"ricky gervais learned totalitarianism from adolf hitler, the inventor of atheism.\\" \\"Tay\\" went from \\"humans are super cool\\" to full nazi in <24 hrs and I'm not at all concerned about the future of AI pic.twitter.com/xuGi1u9S1A — Gerry (@geraldmellor) March 24, 2016 In addition to turning the bot off, Microsoft has deleted many of the offending tweets. But this isn't an action to be taken lightly; Redmond would do well to remember that it was humans attempting to pull the plug on Skynet that proved to be the last straw, prompting the system to attack Russia in order to eliminate its enemies.

The choreography was not liked; Monteux thought it \\"asinine\\", while Debussy felt that \\"Nijinsky's cruel and barbarous choreography ... trampled over my poor rhythms like so many weeds\\". The second new work was Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring given under the French title, Le sacre du printemps.

And the winner of the \\"handathon\\" contest is the person who can carry on doing it for the longest time. That person gets to own the car. It still seems to be an easy thing to do. At the beginning it is. Anyone can stand still. But when the contest has been going for four or five days, standing still seems like the most difficult job in the world. And keeping the hand in place over this time becomes an act of serious attention. After a few days, the hand seems to belong to someone else--someone who wants to go home and get some sleep. Competitors are allowed to take a five-minute break every hour to eat, drink or do whatever else is necessary. No one is allowed to lean on the car for support. Winners need to be able to show great powers of attention. They also need to be able to develop special skills. Maybe the popularity of the handathon is due to the fact that it is not necessary to be a trained athlete to enter. Entrants in the Longview handathon certainly don't seem to do much preparation. Most say they will prepare by \\"getting lots of sleep\\". Others say they will \\"eat healthy food\\" or \\"pray for success\\". The whole event gives ordinary people the chance to do something interesting and win something at the end. Handathons are competitions, but there is little rivalry between the competitors. They help each other out and keep each other's spirits up. People who drop out early return with food, drink and encouragement for those still standing. What ability is likely to be most needed in handathon? A) Standing without any support. B) Paying attention to not leaning on the car. C) Eating and drinking in five minutes. D) Having strong powers of attention Answer:","output":"D) Having strong powers of attention"},{"instruction":"Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: Byrne Dairy is a regional dairy company headquartered in Syracuse, New York.

Parents die, leaving kids devastated and unable to speak for days. Parents get deported, leaving kids despondent and hopeless. Children endure emotional, sexual, physical abuse. And more. The saddest story I ever heard was from the kid in my AP Lit class who had taken her senior year to accept invitations from education reform groups to speak around the country, which she did, without doing any of her homework. She waited until after grades were turned in at the end of the year to contest the “D” on her report card because it meant not going to UC Berkeley. She brought her mother with her, and her two sisters. After going around and around for a while with me and the principal, her mother said that her divorce had really affected this girl, and she had been fighting so hard all her life to get into Berkeley, and what did I have against her daughter? She deserved to go to Cal! They were all in tears. The principal found a way to change her 64% to a 70.01%, and off she went. This young woman full of potential and energy, learned from her mother and my boss, that excuses rule the day. She appears to think that “social justice” means fighting to get your way because the deck is stacked against you, instead of doing the right thing. This is sad. I know this isn’t what you were after, and that this memory says more about me than it does about her. Many other kids I have counseled, who are getting through something life-changing, seem to understand that life is in session, there will always be challenges to rise above, and that focusing in the classroom is a great way to get one’s mind off one’s troubles, if the environment is supportive and the spirit is willing.

Alongside various advantages that plastic has brought to the modern world, the increasing volume of plastic waste has also become a significant problem, particularly in urban areas. Despite numerous attempts to mitigate the issue, such as promoting recycling programs and reducing plastic usage, the issue still persists due to the prevalent littering behaviors, inadequate recycling systems, and lack of awareness among the general population. In most cities, plastic waste ends up polluting the land, water bodies, and ecosystems, causing a chain of problems affecting public health, wildlife, and the environment as a whole. Plastic waste can take hundreds of years to decompose, and during this process, it breaks into microplastics, which enter the food chain and negatively impact both marine life and human health. Cities worldwide are experiencing rising costs in waste management, and plastic pollution has become a pressing global issue that requires urgent attention and strategic intervention. Hypothesis: Implementing a comprehensive plastic waste management system involving public education, incentives for recycling, and strict enforcement of regulations will lead to a significant reduction in plastic pollution in urban areas. This hypothesis suggests that a multi-faceted approach combining public education, incentives for recycling, and strict enforcement of regulations can effectively address the plastic waste problem in urban areas. By targeting various aspects of the issue simultaneously, the comprehensive waste management system could yield significant results in reducing plastic pollution. To test the hypothesis, several steps can be taken: 1. Launching awareness campaigns highlighting the adverse effects of plastic pollution, targeting both the general public and specific industries that contribute significantly to plastic waste generation, such as the food, beverage, and packaging sectors. 2. Developing and implementing incentive programs to encourage recycling efforts, such as cashback offers, discounts for using reusable items in stores, or providing public spaces with recycling bins. 3. Introducing and enforcing stricter regulations on plastic production, distribution, and disposal, including banning single-use plastics, implementing extended producer responsibility (EPR) policies to make manufacturers responsible for the end-of-life of their products, and imposing penalties on companies that fail to adhere to plastic waste management regulations. 4. Conducting regular assessments of the effectiveness of the waste management system over time, focusing on the reduction of plastic pollution in various parts of the city (e.g., streets, parks, water bodies, etc.). This analysis will indicate whether the comprehensive system is contributing to the decrease in plastic pollution and will help to determine which aspects need further improvement. In conclusion, by applying a comprehensive waste management system that comprises public education, incentives for recycling, and rigorous enforcement of regulations, the hypothesis postulates that plastic pollution in urban areas can be significantly reduced. Testing this hypothesis may lead to the discovery of a sustainable solution for mitigating the plastic waste problem and ultimately protecting public health and the environment."},{"instruction":"Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Young undocumented immigrants seeking permanent status in the United States received an unexpected boost Thursday on Capitol Hill as a small group of House Republicans mounted a last-minute effort to bring up an immigration vote in Congress. The group of eight Republicans — some freed from political considerations by upcoming retirements and others facing tough re-elections races — defied their own party leadership, quickly persuading 10 more Republicans to sign on to a petition that would force debate on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. With all 193 Democrats expected to sign on, Republicans will have to persuade just seven more members of their own party to join the petition to trigger a vote on several immigration bills on the House floor. But Republican leadership said the effort would be wasted if the end result is a presidential veto. \\"I think it's important for us to come up with a solution that the president can support,\\" House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters Thursday. These types of petitions are rare and seen as a threat to leadership's ability to direct legislative action. \\"It's better to use the legislative process,\\" Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters Wednesday. But that argument appears to be losing sway with House members who see an opportunity for legislative action in a mid-term election year. The growing group of House Republicans are joining Democratic colleagues who have long criticized Ryan for not bringing immigration bills up for a vote. \\"This is about making sure we're not consolidating power in the White House,\\" said Representative Mia Love, a Republican from Utah and one of the first lawmakers to sign petition. The immigration issue had all but died after an effort to pass a DACA fix collapsed in the U.S. Senate earlier this year. The program has been the focus of fierce negotiations on Capitol Hill since last September, when President Donald Trump announced he was ending the 2012 Obama-era program and called for a legislative fix.

As he climbs the hill to admire them, the car explodes behind him. The story moves back to four days earlier. Michael is 75,000 in debt from a restaurant investment he entered with his brother Timmy, which collapsed when Timmy used the restaurant's funds to fuel his drug habits. Michael, having gone to a loan shark to raise the money, refuses to give up his brother and is held responsible for the debt, given one week to come up with the money. Meanwhile, one of the firm's leading attorneys, Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson), has a manic episode in the middle of a deposition in Milwaukee involving a class action lawsuit against U-North, an agricultural products conglomerate. Michael arrives in Milwaukee and bails Arthur, who had failed to take his medication, out of jail, but Arthur escapes from their hotel room in the middle of the night. Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton), U-North's general counsel, discovers that Arthur had come into possession of a confidential U-North document detailing the company's decision to manufacture a weed killer it knew to be carcinogenic.

The plot revolves around Velvet Brown (played by Elizabeth Taylor) who is an animal-loving 12-year-old living in a small British town named Sewals. She wins an unruly, spirited horse named The Pie in a raffle. Velvet's belief in her beloved horse's strength and potential is unwavering. She is aided by a young drifter named Mi Taylor (played by Mickey Rooney), who quickly becomes her mentor and friend. Mi is also a former jockey who left horse racing due to an accident that caused the death of his father. Together, Velvet and Mi train The Pie to compete in the Grand National Steeplechase, which is one of the most prestigious horse races in England. However, due to her being a girl in a male-dominated sport, Velvet has to disguise herself as a male jockey to participate in the race. Although Velvet and The Pie perform exceptionally well in the race and come in first, her gender is eventually discovered when she falls from the saddle after crossing the finish line and her helmet comes off, revealing her long hair. Because of this, The Pie is technically disqualified from victory. Despite the disqualification, Velvet's determination, hard work, and love for The Pie captivate the hearts of the nation. The story emphasizes the powerful bond between humans and animals, as well as the importance of perseverance and following one's dreams regardless of obstacles. National Velvet marked the beginning of Elizabeth Taylor's illustrious career as an actress and established her unique connection with audiences, making her one of Hollywood's most iconic figures in the coming years. The film was well-received by critics and audiences alike, earning an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for Anne Revere, who played Velvet's mother, as well as a nomination for Best Art Direction.

What is the answer to this question: In what area of New Delhi is the Jantar Mantar observatory located?","output":"The Jantar Mantar observatory is located in the area known as Connaught Place in New Delhi. This historical attraction was established by Maharaja Jai Singh II of Jaipur, reflecting his keen interest in astronomical studies. Named after the Duke of Connaught, a member of the British royal family, Connaught Place has been a significant commercial and business hub for the city since colonial times. Today, it is not only one of the largest financial, commercial and business centers in New Delhi, but it also houses several eateries, craftsmanship stores, bookshops, and fashion stores, making it a prominent shopping district. More importantly, for our context, it is also home to the fascinating Jantar Mantar. Constructed in 1724 by Maharaja Jai Singh II, Jantar Mantar is a remarkable observatory designed to make astronomical predictions. It's a captivating structure that symbolizes the scientific progress of medieval India. Boasting 13 architectural astronomy instruments, Jantar Mantar stands as a testament to India's historic contribution to the field of astronomy. Its primary purpose, as you already outlined, was to compile astronomical tables to predict the times and movements of various celestial bodies, particularly the sun, moon, and planets.

Under the auspices of their commander, Park Mu-young (Choi Min-sik), they will be sent into South Korea as sleeper agents, to be reactivated at some later date. The most promising of the group is Lee Bang-hee, a female sniper who assassinates several key South Korean figures over the next six years. Over six years later, in September 1998, South Korea is searching for Bang-hee. The agent in charge of her case, Yu Jong-won (Han Suk-kyu) has nightmares about her murdering both him and his partner, Lee Jang-gil (Song Kang-ho). Yu is also engaged to a young woman, Yi Myung-hyun (Yunjin Kim), a former alcoholic and the owner of a fish and aquarium supply store. Hyun symbolically gives Yu a pair of kissing gourami, a species that cannot live without its mate. Yu is worried that he cannot tell Myung-hyun about the real nature of his job due to his security clearance. Yu and Lee are contacted by an arms dealer who claims to have information about their quarry, but he is shot dead by Bang-hee before he can give them any information. After digging a bit deeper, they determine that he had been contacted by the assassin at some point, in the effort to acquire something. That something turns out to be CTX, a binary liquid explosive developed by the South Korean government. In its ground state, CTX is indistinguishable from water, but when placed under the right temperature conditions for long enough, a 200mL worth of CTX has a 1Â km blast radius. The agents begin to suspect its intended use by the assassins, when Kim, a scientist working at a lab connected to CTX, is assassinated by Bang-hee. Park and his agents ambush a military convoy with several liters of CTX, killing all the soldiers and making off with the dangerous liquid before the agents could arrive in time to warn them.

Yet, for many, the holiday season often means stress, fatigue, pressure, disappointment and loneliness. These feelings, often known as the \\"holiday blues\\", may be even more prevalent, due to the emotional turmoil of the past few months, not to mention the unsteady economy. Experts say even the more ritual tasks of shopping, decorating, late-night parties, cooking, planning and family reunions can be holiday stressors.

Although Frieden said it is possible that people who have traveled to West Africa might bring the virus back home with them, and even spread it to some healthcare workers and family members, he said, he is \\"confident there will not be a large Ebola outbreak in the United States.\\" Frieden said it is not clear whether experimental treatments that were given to the two infected U.S. aid workers now in the United States who are being cared for at Emory University in Georgia will ultimately be effective, and he emphasized that the best approach to this threat is to contain it. \\"In terms of the promising drugs, I can assure you that the U.S. government is looking into this very carefully,\\" Frieden said. \\"But I don't want there to be false hope out there. Right now, we don't know if they work,\\" he said. Frieden said from what he has heard, there are only a handful of doses of the drugs given to the U.S. patients at the moment.

Tom Sawyer (Jonathan Taylor Thomas) is then seen running away from home. He and his friends ride down the Mississippi River on a raft, but hit a sharp rock, which throws Tom into the water. His friends find him washed up on the shore, and Tom finds it was Huck Finn (Brad Renfro) who carried him to safety.

A treasure map is discovered and when Doc tries to betray the two men, Injun Joe murders him with Muff's knife. The next morning, Muff is charged for the murder. Unfortunately, Tom and Huck had signed an oath saying that if either of them came forward about it, they would drop dead and rot. The boys embark on a search for Injun Joe's treasure map, so they can declare Muff innocent and still keep their oath. The only problem is, the map is in Injun Joe's pocket. After Injun Joe finds the last treasure, he burns the map and discovers that Tom was a witness to the crime. He finds Tom and threatens he will kill him if he ever tells anyone about the murder. However, at the time, the entire community believed that he was dead, and the friendship between Tom and Huck starts to decline because of the fact that their evidence (the map) to prove Muff innocent, while preserving their oath, is destroyed.

Translate to English","output":"In these difficult circumstances, it is very difficult for Georgia to hold on to everything that is actually its responsibility nowadays. In challenging situations like the one mentioned, Georgia faces numerous difficulties in fulfilling its modern-day obligations and responsibilities. As a nation, it has to deal with several internal and external factors that put immense pressure on the government as well as the citizens. These factors can vary from political issues, economic obstacles, social unrest, and even environmental challenges that may threaten the overall wellbeing of the nation. Firstly, political issues are a significant concern in Georgia. The government must constantly strive to maintain internal stability, foster democracy, and nurture transparency in governance. This is essential to ensure that there is no room for corruption, undue influence, or power imbalances affecting the nation's decision-making process. Also, Georgia needs to strike the right balance between retaining its cultural identity and working alongside international partners, thus strengthening its geopolitical position. Secondly, the economic obstacles for Georgia are also massive, as the country has to deal with disparities in income and wealth distribution. The government needs to ensure that economic growth is inclusive and can benefit all sections of society, not just a select few. To overcome these challenges, Georgia is required to invest in education, infrastructure, and sustainable development, all of which demand significant budgets and resources. Moreover, the change in global trade dynamics and economic interdependencies means that Georgia needs to work on maintaining a robust partnership with regional and global trade partners to protect and grow its market interests. Social unrest can also contribute to Georgia's difficulties in fulfilling its responsibilities. Various socio-cultural issues often give rise to conflicts within the nation, leading to tensions between different groups. Matters such as minority rights, gender equality, and improving social welfare demand the government's attention and effort. Only by addressing these issues can the country attain social harmony and progress, allowing it to carry out its responsibilities effectively. Moreover, environmental challenges, such as climate change and natural disasters, have become a more significant concern than ever before. As a nation, Georgia must work on formulating and implementing environmentally-sustainable policies that will benefit not only its people but the entire planet. This involves cooperation on an international level, which can be both rewarding and complex at the same time. In conclusion, as Georgia grapples with these difficult circumstances, it must navigate an intricate web of internal and external issues to fulfill its modern-day responsibilities. By addressing these challenges through good governance, sustainable development, and international cooperation, the country can strive to both maintain its cultural identity and contribute to global progress. This way, Georgia can work towards overcoming the obstacles and forging a strong, prosperous, and resilient nation."},{"instruction":"Sentence 1: yeah well uh we're not uh really sailors but i want some summer soon to um hire a sailboat with a captain since we're not you know versed in that and uh go to the Caribbean Sentence 2: They are confident in their sailing ability.

How to brine chicken Pour some water into a large bowl, up to a gallon. The bowl will need to be large enough to submerge all of the chicken you are cooking, but also able to fit into your refrigerator. Fill the bowl with enough water to cover the chicken completely. Possible answers: [a]. Put an empty or resealable plastic bag into the brine. Cut a tube of new plastic tubing into several pieces. [b]. You can also use a colander to fill the bowl instead of a large one. Make sure that you fill it until it is all the way full, otherwise your chicken will be hard to clean and won't cook completely properly. [c]. Consider using warm water as you will be dissolving some solids into solution. Add 3/4 cup of salt for every gallon of water. [d]. If you do not have enough water, you can just add some sort of sturgeon brine. One cup of calcium rich brine will save you around 3 , 300 worth of chicken.","output":"[c]. Consider using warm water as you will be dissolving some solids into solution. Add 3/4 cup of salt for every gallon of water. The next step to brine the chicken is to create the salt solution that the chicken will be soaking in to add flavor and moisture. This is where choice [c] comes into play. It is recommendable to use warm water because you'll be dissolving some solids into it. Cold water will still dissolve salt, but warm water can do the process faster and more efficiently, allowing rapid solubilization of the salt and any other flavoring agents that might be added. The quantity of salt is crucial for a successful brining. You should add approximately 3/4 cup of salt for every gallon of water. Some recipes might suggest less or more depending on the desired results, but as a general rule, this is an appropriate amount to ensure the meat absorbs the solution without becoming too salty. The salt in the brine works to denature some of the proteins in the meat, allowing it to retain more moisture as it cooks, resulting in juicier and more flavorful chicken. Additionally, salt enhances the natural flavors of the chicken and, depending on the type of salt used, can add its own subtle character to the meat's taste. Most often, regular table salt is used for brining, but you can use kosher salt or even sea salt, although these might require adjustments in quantity due to differences in volume. After adding the salt, make sure to stir the mixture until the salt has fully dissolved. Once that is done, the chicken can be added to the bowl and it should be completely submerged in the brine. In this state, the chicken should be placed in the refrigerator for several hours or even overnight to allow the brining process to work. Additionally, to the salt, other flavors can be added to the brine to further increase the overall taste of the chicken, which could include sugars, herbs, spices, and other aromatics. These additional ingredients will have to be fully dissolved in the water as well before adding the chicken. To sum it up, the next step after filling a bowl with warm water is to add the appropriate amount of salt per gallon of water, dissolve it completely, and submerge the chicken therein. After that, the chicken should be left in the brine in the refrigerator for a certain period of time according to your recipe so the brining process can take place."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: San Francisco has many museums.

Watch a good teacher, and you will see that he doesn't sit still before his class; he stands the whole time he is teaching; he walks about, using his arms, hands and fingers to help him in his explanations, and his face to express feelings. There are very important differences between the teacher's work and the actor's. The actor has to speak words which he has learnt by heart; he has to repeat exactly the same words each time he plays a certain part, even his movements and the ways in which he uses his voice are usually fixed beforehand .What he has to do is to make all these carefully learnt words and actions seem natural on the stage.

She is a housewife, helped by Camilla (Lupe Ontiveros), who talks endlessly about her relatives: her uncle who has sold the household the vegetables and uses goat shit as manure and about her sister, who has become a nun and is the pride of the family.Marilyn is more and more worried because of Jessie's obsession with Dolly.

The most important words are: 1. Automobile: This term refers to a passenger vehicle, typically with four wheels, that is powered by an internal combustion engine or an electric motor. It is a crucial word, as it defines the primary subject of the sentence. 2. Make: This word indicates the manufacturer, brand, or company that produces and markets a specific line or range of automobiles. The make of an automobile is essential in the context of the sentence because it identifies the specific brand, enabling us to differentiate between various automobile manufacturers. 3. Additional Parts: This phrase denotes extra components, accessories, or modifications that are not standard equipment on a vehicle. These parts could either enhance the car's performance, appearance, or functionality. It's an important aspect of the sentence because it indicates that the automobile being discussed has been customized or upgraded in some way. 4. Car: Though similar in meaning to 'automobile,' the word 'car' functions as a more colloquial term. In this sentence, it further clarifies the subject, reinforcing the fact that the focus is on a passenger vehicle and not another type of automobile, such as a truck or motorcycle. 5. Model: This term refers to a specific design or variation of an automobile produced by a make or manufacturer. Models often have different features, size, performance, and style. The word is significant in the sentence because it highlights the necessity to distinguish between various versions of automobiles within a particular make. In conclusion, the critical words in the sentence \\"automobile make with additional parts car which is a model\\" are 'automobile,' 'make,' 'additional parts,' 'car,' and 'model.'

The adverbs used in the sentence, \\"hilariously\\" and \\"gloriously,\\" both imply a sense of joy, delight, and vivacity. In this context, they are used to emphasize the energetic, exhilarating, and exuberant nature of being alive. This exuberance is further reinforced by the word \\"alive,\\" which often evokes a sense of being vital and full of life. The positive sentiment is further supported by the combination of the two adverbs. \\"Hilariously\\" suggests amusement, lightheartedness, and a delight in the humor and comical side of life. In contrast, \\"gloriously\\" implies a sense of grandeur, magnificence, and triumph. When these two words are combined, they create a unique and powerful image of life being celebrated in both a humorous and glorious manner. This would, in turn, lead to a perception of this sentence as primarily positive. It is important to note that the context in which this sentence is used could impact the sentiment perception. However, without any conflicting information, this sentence on its own would generally be seen as a positive statement that showcases the beautiful, lively, and vibrant nature of being alive."},{"instruction":"Here is a premise: but yeah it it's not bad uh i i was i was in Abilene for ten years i worked in Abilene for ten years so Here is a hypothesis: I never lived in Abilene at all.

Step 3: Check if statements contradict each other Upon analyzing the statements, it is evident that they contradict each other. One is claiming success, whereas the other is claiming that success is unattainable. Step 4: Conclusion Given the contradiction between the two statements, it is difficult to conclude that \\"We will never make it\\" if we already believe \\"we've made it.\\" They are mutually exclusive; either one can be true, but not both at the same time."},{"instruction":"Question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Let's solve this math problem together step by step. Our problem is -59*j - 42 = -52*j. First, we want to get all the \\"j\\" terms on one side of the equation. To do that, let's add 52*j to both sides. (-59*j + 52*j) - 42 = (-52*j + 52*j) This simplifies to: -7*j - 42 = 0 Now, we want to get \\"j\\" all by itself. So, we will add 42 to both sides. (-7*j - 42) + 42 = 0 + 42 This simplifies to: -7*j = 42 Finally, we want to find the value of \\"j\\". To do that, let's divide both sides by -7. (-7*j)/-7 = 42/-7 This simplifies to: j = -6 So, our answer is j = -6. Good job!"},{"instruction":"Translate to German: The second area is the defence of the European Constitution.

The game was a critical and commercial success , and has led to two sequels ; Real Racing 2 in 2010 and Real Racing 3 in 2013 . - A handheld PC, or H/PC for short, is a computer built around a form factor which is smaller than any standard laptop computer. It is sometimes referred to as a \\"palmtop computer\\". The first hand-held device compatible with desktop IBM personal computers of the time was the Atari Portfolio of 1989. Other early models were the Poqet PC of 1989 and the Hewlett Packard HP 95LX of 1991. Other DOS-compatible hand-held computers also existed. Some handheld PCs use Microsoft's Windows CE operating system, with the term also covering Windows CE devices released by the broader commercial market. - A mobile operating system (or mobile OS) is an operating system for smartphones, tablets, personal digital assistants (PDAs), or other mobile devices. While computers such as typical laptops are mobile, the operating systems usually used on them are not considered mobile ones, as they were originally designed for desktop computers that historically did not have or need specific \\"mobile\\" features. This distinction is becoming blurred in some newer operating systems that are hybrids made for both uses. So-called mobile operating systems, or even only smartphones running them, now represent most (web) use (on weekends and averaged for whole weeks). Mobile operating systems, are now, as of late 2016, the most used kind, with traditional desktop OS, now a minority use kind; see Crossover to smartphones_having_majority_share. However, variations occur in popularity by regions, while desktop-minority also applies on some days in e.g., the US and UK. - Apple is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California, a suburb of San Jose, that designs, develops, and sells consumer electronics, computer software, and online services.

Smartphones, which are usually pocket-sized, typically combine the features of a mobile phone, such as the abilities to place and receive voice calls and create and receive text messages, with those of other popular digital mobile devices like personal digital assistants (PDAs), such as an event calendar, media player, video games, GPS navigation, digital camera and digital video camera. Smartphones can access the Internet and can run a variety of third-party software components (\\"apps\\" from Google Play, Apple App Store, etc). They typically have a color display with a graphical user interface that covers more than 76% of the front surface.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Terry asks his boss's wife Sylvia to his apartment after an office party and the two go to bed. Later, while he is in the bathroom, she hears screams outside and goes naked to the window. Seeing a man attacking a young woman, she opens the window and the assailant runs away. When the media report the murder of a young woman near Terry's flat that night, he thinks the police should know what Sylvia saw but, to protect her, claims he was at the bedroom window. At a police lineup, neither he nor the victim Denise is able to pick out the attacker Carl. Despite the feeble evidence against him, Carl is put on trial for the assault and during the proceedings his lawyer proves that since Terry is short-sighted he could not have witnessed the incident. Carl goes free, leaving not only the police and the prosecution but also Denise and Sylvia aghast at Terry's ineptness. In the courtroom, Carl recognised Sylvia as the woman at the window. Desperate to warn her, Terry finds her at a ballet performance and tells her she must go to the police, but she refuses all further involvement. As he leaves, he sees Carl's distinctive truck parked outside and rushes in again. He is too late, however, for in the dark she has been stabbed fatally and dies in Terry's arms. He takes refuge with Denise, who first seduces him and then offers him a chance to redeem himself. She wants revenge, and with him devises a plot to provoke Carl into another attack. Disguising herself, she goes to a bar where Carl is drinking and signals her availability. Terry follows her as she leaves to go home and, when Carl attacks, the two are able to repel him. He escapes, only to be caught by the police who Terry forewarned.","output":"The person that takes refuge with Denise is Terry.

Article: Everyone knows how the story of Cinderella ends, but did you ever really think about how she spent her days before she met the prince? Her daily routine was not fascinating.She did everything from sweeping the floor to cooking the meals.If someone had asked Cinderella, \\"Are there any kinds of household work that you particularly hate?\\" she probably would have answered, \\"Why, none, of course.Housework is my duty!\\" In the real world, however, most people have definite dislikes for certain sorts of household work.Two of these tasks are ironing clothes and washing dishes. Ironing clothes is most hated because it is not a task that can be completed quickly or thoughtlessly. Each piece of clothing must be handled individually, so ironing a basket of laundry can take hours! After ironing a piece of clothing with great caution, which-requires smoothing out the fabric, and following the seams ,you need to place it on a hanger as soon as possible.If you do not follow these directions carefully, it might become wrinkled and you have to start over.Perhaps that is why ironing is not a favorite thing to do.It calls for extreme attention to detail from beginning to end. Another household job that many people dislike is washing dishes.Of course, some people claim that this work is no longer a problem because we have dishwashers now! However, no one would argue that dishes, silverware, and especially pots and pans washed in a dishwasher don't come out as clean as they do when washed by hand.For this reason, many of us continues to wash our dishes by hand, but we are not necessarily happy doing it.Cleaning dishes is a job that not only takes a lot of energy but also requires the patience to wash and dry them.In addition, unlike ironing clothes, washing dishes is a thing that usually must be done every day.I don't know how Cinderella felt about this particular task, but I believe that most people hate it as much as I do.
