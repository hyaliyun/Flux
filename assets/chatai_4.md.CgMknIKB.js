A: A:","output":"Tadpoles play a vital role in their aquatic ecosystem by clearing out excess organic matter, primarily algae, detritus, and other microscopic plant debris, from waterways. Algae are microscopic plants that grow in the water and can be detrimental to the aquatic life if left uncontrolled. As tadpoles consume algae, they help maintain a balanced ecosystem, prevent algal blooms, and improve water quality. Algal blooms, when left unchecked, can lead to oxygen depletion, blocking sunlight penetration, and even producing toxins that can negatively affect other organisms and the aquatic environment. Detritus is decaying organic material, such as leaves, twigs, and dead organisms, present in water bodies. Tadpoles can feed on detritus directly or indirectly by consuming the microorganisms (such as bacteria and fungi) that break down these materials. By doing so, tadpoles contribute to the process of decomposition, recycling nutrients, and preventing the accumulation of organic waste in waterways, which otherwise could lead to eutrophication and oxygen depletion. In summary, tadpoles clear out waterways by feeding on excess algae, detritus, and other organic matter, contributing to the well-being of aquatic ecosystems and maintaining water quality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Question 1: Hinduism is considered different than other religions because it has many unique beliefs and practices, just like other religions have their own unique beliefs and practices. Hinduism has ideas like karma, which means that good actions lead to good outcomes, and bad actions lead to bad outcomes. This belief helps people to make good choices in their lives.  Hinduism also believes in an afterlife, which means that when people die, they go to a different place or are born again as a different person or animal. Sometimes, Hindus practice animal sacrifice as a way to show respect or gratitude to the gods, but this isn't something that all Hindus do. Hinduism also has many superstitions, just like other religions and cultures do. These beliefs make Hinduism special and different from other religions, but that doesn't mean it is better or worse, just different. Question 2: When it comes to dating girls of a different caste or religion while being a Hindu, it is important to remember that everyone is unique and special in their own way. It can be a good thing to learn about and understand different people, which can help us grow and become better people. As long as you treat everyone with kindness and respect, it can be okay to date someone from a different caste or religion. This decision depends on your personal beliefs and values, as well as the feelings and opinions of the other person involved.

During this meeting / confrontation, she told me, in no uncertain terms, just what she didn’t like about some recent decisions I had made. I listened to her speak for about 30 minutes. She, quite methodically, tore me apart. Initially, I had planned to hear her out, make a few vague remarks, and send her on her way, thinking that maybe she just needed to be heard. But about 20 minutes into her harangue, I had a change of heart. I decided that, if she asked for a response for me, if she asked my advice, I was going to tell her exactly what I thought. She did, in fact, ask me for a response. I asked her if she was a happy person, and said that I suspected that she was not, as she came across as a bully and was acting like a horrible person. She sat and looked at me, then burst into tears. I waited. Looking up, she said, “Yes, you are correct. I am a horrible person. And I am miserable.

Please answer the following question: Think outside the box, whilst inside the box (studio): As this studio is about working with constraints, I thought i’d google ‘constraints in filmmaking’ and see what comes up. One of the first links was to a journal article by Heidi Philipsen entitled ‘Constraints in Film Making Processes Offer an Exercise to the Imagination’. Interestingly enough the first sentence of her article states: “I would like filmmakers interested in thinking “outside the box” to recognize that they can benefit from being placed “inside a box.” I wonder if Paul had contemplated this whilst choosing the name for this studio. Throughout her article Philipsen challenges the notion that creativity is an intangible innate quality, existing within the mind of one source, but rather creativity arises from a multitude of sources. Alike all things shared she suggests that creativity is easier to enhance by changing environmental conditions, rather than encouraging people to ‘think more creatively’. Perceiving creativity in this way allows you to see it as an organisationally influenced phenomenon, rather than a psychological  and individual phenomenon. Which enables you to have more control over creativity and to encourage creativity once being aware of how it can be environmentally enhanced. As Csikzentmihalyi (1996) states “a genuinely creative accomplishment is almost never the result of a sudden insight, a lightbulb flashing on in the dark, but comes after years of hard work”. Constraints, as Philipsen suggests is one such way to manipulate the environment to enhance creativity. Students who attended The Film School in Denmark, who were forced into working with constraints for their  projects eventually considered constraints to be both useful and inspirational. Such constraints included: making a scene with a specific theme, within a specific deadline and with other specific conditions concerning the use of camera, sound, actors etc. Students stated that these constraints ultimately made them feel secure, inspired and focused and... After this passage, the writer probably  A. thought about it  B. researched more about it  C. wrote more  D. not enough information A:","output":"The writer likely proceeded to research more about it and write more on the topic. The author seems to be in an exploratory phase of the subject, researching and analyzing various sources related to constraints in filmmaking. This is evident in how they started by searching for 'constraints in filmmaking' online, then delving into the article by Heidi Philipsen. They critically examined Philipsen's views and linked it with other sources such as Csikzentmihalyi, pointing out the correlation between the environment and creativity. The author seems intrigued by the idea of constraints positively influencing creativity by suggesting that it provides a sense of security, inspiration, and focus to those who are given a specific set of conditions to work within. The author's detailed discussion and analysis indicates they are planning to delve further into the subject. They also briefly mentioned the example of students at The Film School in Denmark, indicating a possible exploration of real-life instances or case studies where these theories are applied. Therefore, it can be inferred that the author might have researched more about the impact of constraints on creativity, especially in the context of filmmaking, before proceeding to write more about it. The author also seems to enjoy the idea of 'the box' acting as a creative enhancer rather than a restrictor. This is a potent metaphor the author could continue to explore in their writing. As the author mentioned, they were surprised by the correlation in the naming of the studio and the idea of enhancing creativity within constraints - 'inside the box'. This indicates a possible exploration of the studio environment itself as a case study or example in their writing or further research.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which one would most likely be located in a power plant, gen A or tran B? The answer to this question is:","output":"Gen A would most likely be located in a power plant. To elaborate, the primary function of a power plant is to generate electricity by converting various energy sources, such as fossil fuels, nuclear energy, or renewable sources like wind and solar power. A generator, like Gen A, is an essential component in this process, as it converts the mechanical energy produced by turbines into electrical energy. Generators typically consist of an engine, an alternator, a voltage regulator, and other necessary operating components. On the other hand, transformers, like Tran B, are typically found in electrical substations, rather than inside the power plant itself. Transformers play a crucial role in transmitting the generated electricity to homes, businesses, and other establishments by regulating the voltage levels to match the needs of the electrical grid. They can either step up the voltage levels for long-distance transmission or step down the voltage levels for safe distribution to end-users. Given the fact that Bob checks Gen A on Mondays and Tran B on Tuesdays, it can be inferred that these devices are separate components of the power distribution system. The difference in their scheduling indicates that the two are not directly related and are likely serving different functions in the electricity generation and distribution process. In conclusion, based on the information provided, Gen A is more likely to be located in a power plant because it plays a vital role in generating electricity from various energy sources.

Read the article and select the best answer. Article: St James's Palace has announced that while Miss Middleton will wear a wedding ring. Prince William has chosen not to.  Rings are typically exchanged by couples during their wedding to represent commitment  to each other. Does it matter if husbands don't wear a wedding ring? Prince William's father wears one, his grandfather doesn't and their decisions weren't seen as strange. But reactions to Prince William's decision show that wedding rings for husbands are now the norm. One young man, who spoke to the BBC, thinks William is setting a bad example, saying: \\"I think it's disgraceful  . It's a tradition. You have to wear a ring really. And for someone of the royal family to do that, it's not right. \\" Broadly speaking, modem husbands tend to wear their wedding rings as a symbol of loyalty and faithfulness. So not wearing one can seem unusual or even dishonest to some, although men haven't always worn them.  The wearing of wedding rings has been the done thing for centuries among wives but only became common practice among husbands during World War II. Men fighting overseas usually wore them as a reminder of wives and families back home.  Wearing rings is a safety issue  for men in certain manual jobs. But how does William explain his decision? A royal officer has said he \\"isn't one for jewelry\\". Question: What is the author's attitude towards Prince William's decision? Options: A: Subjective. B: Objective. C: Approving.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Can you tell me the answer to where did the phrase have your cake and eat it too come from??","output":"The phrase \\"have your cake and eat it too\\" is an English proverb that dates back to the 16th century. It essentially means that someone wants to have two desirable but incompatible options at the same time. It highlights the difficulty or impossibility of maintaining such a scenario where one retains the desired thing as well as its consumption. The origin and development of this phrase provide insights into its meaning and how it has evolved over time. The earliest known written instance of this phrase can be traced back to a letter by Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, in 1538, where he writes, \\"A man can not have his cake and eat his cake.\\" Although the wording varies slightly from the present form, the core meaning remains intact. The phrasing continued to evolve over time. A version appeared in John Heywood's 1546 collection of proverbs, titled \\"A dialogue Conteinyng the nomber in effect of all the Prouerbes in the Englishe tongue.\\" Here, Heywood writes, \\"Wolde ye both eate your cake, and haue your cake?\\" This publication makes it clear that by the mid-16th century, the proverb was well-known in English literature and gaining widespread usage. From the 16th to the 18th century, the phrase underwent many variations, such as \\"You cannot eat your cake and have it\\" and \\"You cannot eat your cake and keep it.\\" These variations reflect how the English language evolved, with the core meaning and essence of the idiom remaining intact. By the early 20th century, the present version of the phrase \\"have your cake and eat it too\\" began to gain prominence. It is believed that the rearrangement of the phrasing in this current form is intended to put emphasis on the idea that one cannot retain the cake after eating it. This alteration might have been made in response to the growing use of the phrase in negative contexts. The proverb's origin and development in the English language demonstrate a drive to convey the impossibility of having or maintaining two contradictory or incompatible things simultaneously. This saying has been commonly used in several areas of life, including relationships, career choices, politics, and personal decisions, emphasizing the inevitability of making a choice between two options. In conclusion, the phrase \\"have your cake and eat it too\\" is an English proverb that has deep historical roots dating back to the 16th century. Though it has undergone several transformations in wording over the centuries, the core meaning has remained consistent, emphasizing the impossibility of possessing two incompatible outcomes simultaneously. The development of the phrase reflects how the English language, society, and culture have evolved over time, while still retaining the wisdom embedded in this timeless adage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:What is the name of the work Hindemith's attempted period reconstruction of, was followed in 1955 by an edition from August Wenzinger?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  After the publication of the L'Orfeo score in 1609, the same publisher (Ricciardo Amadino of Venice) brought it out again in 1615. Facsimiles of these editions were printed in 1927 and 1972 respectively. Since Eitner's first \\"modern\\" edition of L'Orfeo in 1884, and d'Indy's performing edition 20 years later—both of which were abridged and adapted versions of the 1609 score—there have been many attempts to edit and present the work, not all of them published. Most of the editions that followed d'Indy up to the time of the Second World War were arrangements, usually heavily truncated, that provided a basis for performances in the modern opera idiom. Many of these were the work of composers, including Carl Orff (1923 and 1939) and Ottorino Respighi in 1935. Orff's 1923 score, using a German text, included some period instrumentation, an experiment he abandoned when producing his later version.In the post-war period, editions have moved increasingly to reflect the performance conventions of Monteverdi's day. This tendency was initiated by two earlier editions, that of Jack Westrup used in the 1925 Oxford performances, and Gian Francesco Malipiero's 1930 complete edition which sticks closely to Monteverdi's 1609 original. After the war, Hindemith's attempted period reconstruction of the work was followed in 1955 by an edition from August Wenzinger that remained in use for many years. The next 30 years saw numerous editions, mostly prepared by scholar-performers rather than by composers, generally aiming towards authenticity if not always the complete re-creation of the original instrumentation. These included versions by Raymond Leppard (1965), Denis Stevens (1967), Nikolaus Harnoncourt (1969), Jane Glover (1975), Roger Norrington (1976) and John Eliot Gardiner. Only the composers Valentino Bucchi (1967), Bruno Maderna (1967) and Luciano Berio (1984) produced editions based on the convention of a large modern orchestra.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. If you beat a dog in Schuylkill County, you'll probably get a 100 fine. If you repeatedly beat a woman, you'll probably get the same fine. In 2001, county judges heard 98 Protection From Abuse cases, finding the defendant guilty in 48 percent of those cases, either after a hearing or through a technical violation or plea. Of those found guilty, the majority were ordered to pay court costs, plus a 100 fine. No defendants were ordered to pay more than a 250 fine for violating the court order. In 27 percent of the cases, the charges were dismissed or the defendant was found not guilty. In the rest of the cases, charges were withdrawn or the matter is not yet resolved. Sarah T. Casey, executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis, finds it disturbing that in most cases, the fine for violating a PFA is little more than the fine someone would get for cruelty and abuse toward an animal. \\"In most of the counties surrounding Schuylkill County, the penalties given for indirect criminal contempt are much stiffer than those in Schuylkill County,\\" Casey said. \\"What kind of message are we sending those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuse orders? That it's OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County, because you'll only get a slap on the wrist?\\" Under state law, the minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is 100; the maximum fine is 1,000 and up to six months in jail. Like others who are familiar with how the county's legal system does and doesn't work for victims of domestic violence, Casey believes some changes are in order. Valerie West, a manager/attorney with Mid-Penn Legal Services, with offices in Pottsville and Reading, regularly handles domestic violence cases. She finds fault with the local requirement that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed. West said she feels a custody order should be allowed to stand for the full term of the PFA - up to 18 months - as it does in many other counties in the state. \\"It places an undue burden on the plaintiff, in terms of cost, finding legal representation and facing their abuser - not to mention a further burden on the system to provide those services,\\" West said. \\"It may be difficult for the parties to reach an agreement so soon after violence has occurred.  Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"The plaintiff\\" correctly answer the question \\"What executive director of the Women in Crises center believes changes to the legal system would benefit victims of domestic abuse?\\"? Options are:  1). no.  2). yes.","output":"1). no. The correct answer should be Sarah T. Casey, not \\"The plaintiff.\\" Sarah T. Casey is the executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis, and she finds it disturbing that the penalties for violating a Protection From Abuse order are often not much more than those given for animal cruelty and abuse.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: A key part of healthy eating is to read the nutrition information for every food you buy. Look on the label for how much trans fat is in a product. Ideally, you should be eating a product with zero trans fat. You can find trans fat listed underneath fat and saturated fat. Manufacturers now are required to list trans fat content on their labels. Look for the phrases \\"partially hydrogenated,\\" \\"hydrogenated,\\" or \\"shortening.\\" These types of ingredients contain trans fat. If a product says 0 grams (0.0 oz) of trans fat, it might not be zero. Look for the word \\"hydrogenated\\" in the ingredients. This means the food contains trans fat. The FDA allows food manufacturers to list trans fat as 0 grams (0.0 oz) if it contains less than 0.5 grams (0.02 oz) of trans fat. Multiple servings of foods with hydrogenated oils, even if it says zero grams of trans fat, can negatively affect your health. When eating out, ask the server what oil is used to prepare your food. If possible, request a healthier oil. Another option is to skip the deep fried foods and opt instead for grilled, steamed, sauteed, or baked.  Steamed and grilled items are the least likely to contain trans fats. Be careful with added items such as salad dressing and condiments, which can contain trans fats. A condiment made with olive oil is a good choice. Summary:","output":"When you eat, it's important to check the labels on your food to see if it has any bad fat called trans fat.

It is located in the English Channel, about 4 miles (6 km) off the coast of Hampshire, separated by the Solent. The island has resorts that have been holiday destinations since Victorian times, and is known for its mild climate, coastal scenery, and verdant landscape of fields, downland and chines.  - Augustine of Canterbury (first third of the 6th century  probably 26 May 604) was a Benedictine monk who became the first Archbishop of Canterbury in the year 597. He is considered the \\"Apostle to the English\\" and a founder of the English Church.  - The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840. This transition included going from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, improved efficiency of water power, the increasing use of steam power, the development of machine tools and the rise of the factory system. Textiles were the dominant industry of the Industrial Revolution in terms of employment, value of output and capital invested; the textile industry was also the first to use modern production methods. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain and most of the important technological innovations were British. The social, economic and political changes in the previous centuries in Great Britain contributed. Whereas absolutism stayed the normal form of power execution through most parts of Europe, institutions ensured property rights and political safety to the people in the UK after the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Aided by these legal and cultural foundations, an entrepreneurial spirit and consumer revolution drove industrialisation in Britain, which would be emulated in countries around the world. A change in marrying patterns to getting married later made people able to accumulate more human capital during their youth, thereby encouraging economic development.  - The Province of York is one of two ecclesiastical provinces making up the Church of England and consists of 12 dioceses which cover the northern third of England and the Isle of Man.

The sweet taste of cold and wood smoke hung in the air. Marlin rode low in the saddle, his shoulders curled against the hungry wind. His hat was pulled down tight and his eyes didn't move as he passed the crude shacks at the edge of town. He tied his horse in front of the saloon, unwinding his long body as if a sudden movement might snap it. He turned down the collar of his greatcoat and checked to make sure his big Army Colt was loose in its holster. The saloon door was a single chunk of white pine, still oozing sap, and he had to put his shoulder to it to force it open. The long room inside was quiet, and not much warmer than the street. Clusters of people sat nursing coffee and drinks, talking quietly if they talked at all. Marlin spotted a few farmers the railroad had brought in from Europe: rounded hats, nervous eyes, skin as red as blood. At the far end of the room a half-dozen cowboys turned over cards with patient boredom. Marlin walked up to the bar. \\"Whiskey,\\" he said, and when the drink came he tossed it straight down and felt it pull his lips into a grimace. He nodded for a refill. When he turned to face the room they were all watching him. \\"I'm looking for a man named Kraamer,\\" Marlin said. \\"Anybody here know of him?\\" One of the cowboys turned casually and rang the spittoon with a stream of tobacco juice.

Movie title: The Dentist Movie plot: Dr. Alan Feinstone is a successful dentist. However, everything changes on the day of his wedding anniversary, when he discovers his wife Brooke is cheating on him with the poolman, Matt. After they finish, Alan retrieves his pistol and follows Matt in his car. He is led to Paula Roberts's house, a friend of Brooke's. Alan invents a story about a surprise party for Brooke and watches Paula invite Matt inside. Paula's dog attacks Alan, and he shoots it in self-defense. After returning to his car, he drives to work. At his dental practice, Alan's first appointment goes poorly when he hallucinates a child has rotten teeth and accidentally stabs him. As Detective Gibbs investigates the death of Paula's dog, Alan sees his second patient, April Reign, a beauty queen. Alan hallucinates she is his wife, and, while she is unconscious, takes off her pantyhose and fondles her before choking her. As she wakes, Alan snaps out of it and hides her pantyhose. Alan tells his manager, Steve Landers, she is still dizzy from nitrous oxide. When Steve realizes what really happened, he returns, punches Alan, and threatens a lawsuit. Alan ends the day early and sends his staff and patients home, including Sarah, a teenager who wants to have her braces removed. Later that night, Brooke meets Alan at a new opera-themed room at his practice. After sedating her under the premise of cleaning her teeth, he pulls out her teeth and cuts off her tongue. Detective Gibbs and his partner Detective Sunshine arrive at Alan's house the next morning to ask him questions. After the policemen leave, Matt discovers Brooke, who is still alive but sedated. Alan stabs Matt to death. Sarah and Paula are waiting for Alan at his practice. Alan sees Paula first, much to Sarah's disappointment. When Paula's conversation turns to how good a job Matt does for her, Alan overly-aggressively drills into her tooth, destroying it.

Animation is little better than some saturday American-made cartoons. Is the review positive or negative? A:","output":"The review provided is negative in nature. The reviewer has expressed multiple unfavorable opinions about the video, suggesting that it is not a good purchase. Firstly, the review states that the video is \\"definitely not for kids,\\" indicating that the content may be inappropriate for younger audiences. This point would likely dissuade potential buyers who are looking for family-friendly content. Secondly, the reviewer claims that the video is \\"hardly a sequel of Ninja Scroll,\\" signaling disappointment with the lack of connection to a well-known title. By introducing the context of a desirable predecessor, the review implies that the video falls short of expectations that may have been set by fans of the original Ninja Scroll. Moreover, the reviewer advises others not to waste their money on this video, reinforcing the negative tone of the review. This strong statement serves to further dissuade potential buyers from investing in the video, as it implies that there is little value in the content. Lastly, the review comments on the lackluster animation quality, comparing it to \\"some Saturday American-made cartoons.\\" This comparison suggests that the video has an underwhelming visual aesthetic, as opposed to the high-quality animation that may be expected from a well-done sequel to Ninja Scroll. By criticizing this aspect of the video, the reviewer is pointing out another con that deters potential buyers from purchasing it. In conclusion, the review exhibits a negative sentiment towards the video as it highlights several disappointing elements, such as unsuitable content for children, weak connection to a well-known title, poor value for money, and subpar animation quality. These factors collectively paint a disapproving picture of the video, discouraging potential buyers from considering it as a viable entertainment option."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Whereas in the First Great Awakening, Methodist and Baptist preachers had opposed slavery and urged manumission, over the decades they made more of an accommodation with the institution. They worked with slaveholders in the South to urge a paternalistic institution. Both denominations made direct appeals to slaves and free blacks for conversion. The Baptists particularly allowed them active roles in congregations. By the mid-19th century, northern Baptists tended to oppose slavery. As tensions increased, in 1844 the Home Mission Society refused to appoint a slaveholder as a missionary who had been proposed by Georgia. It noted that missionaries could not take servants with them, and also that the Board did not want to appear to condone slavery. Please answer a question about this article.

What was urged by Baptists working with slaveholders in the North?","output":"The article does not specifically mention what was urged by Baptists working with slaveholders in the North.

It is ideal for complimenting friends, family members, or acquaintances.

You may choose to use synonyms for \\"beautiful\\" to enhance your language skills and express your admiration with precision and authenticity.

(CNN) -- Declaring 2010 \\"The best year in safety performance in our company's history,\\" Transocean Ltd., owner of the Gulf of Mexico oil rig that exploded, killing 11 workers, has awarded its top executives hefty bonuses and raises, according to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That includes a 200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from 900,000 to 1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was 374,062, the report states. Newman also has a 5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states.

Which leaves you with the walking. And boy, does this film do walking! If Mr Piano had his way, this would probably be an uninterrupted three hours of hardcore walking through the Wisconsin countryside, but every 40 minutes or so these pesky Martians pop up for a few seconds to interrupt him before he goes for another bit of a ramble. You've never seen so much walking in a movie. If this really had a 20m budget, most of it must have gone on Mr Piano's shoes, because he had to get through plenty of pairs with all the walking he does. Which explains why there's no money left for decent effects, a decent video camera or proper actors. Honestly, it's like watching some bizarre fetish video for people with a thing about going for long walks in period costumes. Even on fast-forward, this is a looonnnggg walk.

Write some highlights for the following article: Republican opponents of White House-backed legislation that would rein in NSA surveillance programs narrowly blocked the Senate from taking up the bill Tuesday after warning it could help terrorists escape detection. On a tally of 58 to 42, a procedural vote failed to get the supermajority 60 votes it needed to advance. Supporters of the USA Freedom Act, a rare mix of liberal Democrats and libertarian Republicans, hoped public outrage over the secret mass collection of phone and Internet records -- revealed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden -- would lead to passage of the reforms.  But many opponents argued the changes would hamper the National Security Agency's ability to track nimble and elusive terrorists. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell led the charge against the bill, saying the new rules would prevent the United States from capturing the terrorists who killed Peter Kassig, a U.S. citizen doing aid work in Syria. Kassig was executed over the weekend. \\"Many of these fighters are familiar with America's intelligence capabilities, and many are savvy with communications. These are terrorists who know how to use encryption, and they how to change devices quickly,\\" he said. \\"This is the worst time to be tying our hands behind our backs.\\" \\"It basically takes us back to a pre-9/11 lack of capacity to identify terrorists making telephone calls in the United States, said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking Senate Republican.  \\"I think that sort of unilateral disarmament would be bad for the country.\\" McConnell also argued the measure should be debated and voted on in the new Congress next year, not by lawmakers in a lame duck session who are leaving Washington. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, the bill's principal author, disputed the critics saying that while it puts checks on the NSA's powerful capabilities, it \\"does so responsibly.\\" \\"The bill contains key reforms to safeguard Americans' privacy by prohibiting the indiscriminate collection of their data.  It also provides for greater accountability and transparency of the government's surveillance programs,\\" he said.  \\"The bill also ensures that the intelligence community has the tools it needs to keep our country safe.\\" Under the bill, the government could no longer store massive amounts of call information in its databases, a practice President Barack Obama said he wanted to end.  That job would fall to the large telecommunication companies.  But the government could get permission from a secret surveillance court to review specific call information if it could show it might be linked to terrorists. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, said this arrangement \\"solves\\" a \\"very practical problem\\" raised by those who are uncomfortable with the government storing calling records of Americans. But Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said the public's privacy would be better protected by strict federal government safeguards of that information than by the thousands of employees at private phone companies. In a statement Monday, the White House urged passage of the bill. \\"This legislation will help strengthen Americans' confidence in the government's use of these important national security authorities.  Without passage of this bill, critical authorities that are appropriately reformed in this legislation could expire next summer.  The administration urges Congress to take action on this legislation now, since delay may subject these important national security authorities to brinksmanship and uncertainty.\\" The bill is supported by a coalition of technology companies, including Google, Apple, AOL, Microsoft and Yahoo, who have deep concerns that their customers' privacy is being violated by the current NSA techniques. Supporters suffered a setback last week when Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, who had favored the measure, announced he would not back it.  However, other like-minded Republicans such as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah voted to advance the bill.","output":"1.

The correct answer is Jessica Logan's 19-year-old boyfriend because the story is talking about a situation where someone's naked photos were spread, and Jessica Logan is the only person mentioned in the options who is not a company or organization.  The other options are wrong because they do not make sense. CNN, CosmoGirl.com, High School Musical, Internet, National Campaign, Prevent Teen & Unplanned Pregnancy are not people, they cannot have a boyfriend. Vanessa Hudgens is a person, but the story said she already apologized for her own photos. Phillip Alpert is also a person, but the story said he already got in trouble for sending a photo of his girlfriend, so he cannot be dating a 19-year-old boy. Marissa Miller and MaryJo are not mentioned in the story, so we don't know if they are related to this situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person whose death could not be determined to be accident or suicide?, using the article: In September 1930 Heseltine moved with Barbara Peache into a basement flat at 12a Tite Street in Chelsea. With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \\"Bethlehem Down\\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in..., what would be the answer ? A:","output":"The answer to the question \\"What is the last name of the person whose death could not be determined to be an accident or suicide?\\" is Heseltine, as mentioned in the article.

(CNN) -- Facebook just purchased a service for sharing your location with friends, according to a CNNMoney report. UPDATE 2:30 p.m. ET: Gowalla has confirmed in a blog post that its service will wind down by the end of January. So what does that mean to those of us who use Facebook or Gowalla? If you're a Gowalla user and love the service the way it is, it's almost certainly bad news. When Facebook acquires a company, it rarely keeps the original product intact. Instead, it voraciously devours these smaller startups to get to the talented developers housed within. Beluga, a recent acquisition, is in the process of shutting down while Facebook works instead on Facebook Messages, a similar service. The initial report suggests this will be the case with Gowalla: Some of the Austin-based team will move to Palo Alto, California, to work at Facebook, while a few will stay behind in Austin. I'd bet against","output":"Gowalla remaining as a standalone service in the long run. Rather, it seems more likely that Facebook will integrate Gowalla's location-sharing features into its own platform, further enhancing its social networking capabilities. This would align with Facebook's strategy to acquire talent and innovative features while maintaining its dominance in the market. So, for Gowalla users, it may be time to start exploring alternative location-sharing services, as the future of Gowalla appears uncertain at best."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: The Hatters led after just five minutes when Luke Gambin's clipped pass was controlled by Danny Hylton and he fired in his 18th of an impressive season. Alan Sheehan was denied by goalkeeper Joe Fryer before the home side doubled their advantage after just 10 minutes, Gambin driving into the area and finding the bottom corner to score his first Luton goal. It took Pools 30 minutes to register an attempt of note, defender Scott Harrison heading narrowly wide from a corner. In the second half, Hartlepool winger Nathan Thomas fired wildly off target for the visitors, while Hylton should have doubled his tally only to fire wastefully over the top. Isaac Vassell was denied by a good low stop from Fryer, before Pools almost had one back, Michael Woods firing inches over. Town wrapped up the points late on as Ollie Palmer came off the bench and when the ball ricocheted back into his path, he beat Fryer to open his account for the Hatters.

It contains the westernmost islands of the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. The largest island is Hirta, whose sea cliffs are the highest in the United Kingdom.  Three other islands (Dùn, Soay and Boreray) were also used for grazing and seabird hunting. The islands are administratively a part of the Comhairle nan Eilean Siar local authority area.The origin of the name St Kilda is a matter of conjecture. The islands' human heritage includes numerous unique architectural features from the historic and prehistoric periods, although the earliest written records of island life date from the Late Middle Ages. The medieval village on Hirta was rebuilt in the 19th century, but illnesses brought by increased external contacts through tourism, and the upheaval of the First World War contributed to the island's evacuation in 1930. The story of St Kilda has attracted artistic interpretations, including Michael Powell's film The Edge of the World and an opera.Permanent habitation on the islands possibly extends back at least two millennia, the population probably never exceeding 180 (and certainly no more than 100 after 1851). The entire remaining population was evacuated from Hirta (the only inhabited island) in 1930. The islands house a unique form of stone structure known as cleitean. A cleit is a stone storage hut or bothy; whilst many are still to be found, they are slowly falling into disrepair. There are known to be 1,260 cleitean on Hirta and a further 170 on the other group islands. Currently, the only year-round residents are military personnel; a variety of conservation workers, volunteers and scientists spend time there in the summer months.The entire archipelago is owned by the National Trust for Scotland. It became one of Scotland's six World Heritage Sites in 1986, and is one of the few in the world to hold mixed status for both its natural and cultural qualities....  Guess a valid title for it!

Multi-instrumentalists who play closely related instruments, a practice known as doubling are common in orchestra (e.g., flute players who double on piccolo and percussion players, who play snare drum, cymbals, bass drum, etc.), in jazz (e.g., saxophone players who double on clarinet or flute; or double bass players who also play electric bass); in music theatre pit orchestras (e.g., reed players who are required to play numerous reed instruments); and in other areas of classical music (e.g., church piano players are often expected to play the church's pipe organ or Hammond organ as well). Popular music composers and songwriters are often multi-instrumentalists. In pop and rock, it is more common than in classical or jazz for performers to be multi-instrumentalists on instruments that are not from the same family: it is common for pop and rock musicians to play both guitar and keyboards. Many bluegrass musicians are multi-instrumentalists. Some musicians' unions or associations specify a higher rate of pay for musicians who double on two or more instruments for a performance or recording.  - A songwriter is an individual who writes the lyrics, melodies and chord progressions for songs, typically for a popular music genre such as rock or country music. A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers  songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers.  - RBD was a Mexican musical group that gained popularity from Televisa's teen series \\"Rebelde\\", and found international success from 2004 until their separation in 2009.

When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students. Question: After this story is over the author probably: Options:  A. Will continue to do self portraits in the classes they teach.  B. Will teach more English Language Learners  C.

Here is a goal: garlic press Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of obtaining a garlic press, there are various ways to go about it. These methods are dependent on factors such as your budget, available utilities and resources, and how urgently you need the garlic press. Below are three different approaches that make sense for acquiring a garlic press: 1. Purchasing a Garlic Press: The most straightforward and efficient approach is to buy a garlic press from a store or online marketplace. Here are the steps for going about it:   a. Research: Start by gathering information on the best garlic presses available in the market. Look for reviews and compare prices to ensure you get the best value for your money. Consider factors such as material, easy cleaning, durability, and ease of use.   b. Select a Platform: Once you have gathered sufficient information, choose whether to buy from a physical store or an online marketplace. Online marketplaces tend to offer a wider variety of products and allow you to read reviews from previous buyers. Physical stores, on the other hand, enable you to examine the product in person before purchasing.   c. Make a Purchase: Place your order or buy the garlic press in-store, and pay for it using your preferred payment method.   d. Use the Garlic Press: After receiving the product, follow the manufacturer's guidelines to clean and use the garlic press effectively. 2. Borrowing a Garlic Press: If you only require the garlic press for a short while or on a one-time basis, borrowing from a friend or family member may be the most practical solution. Here are the steps to follow:   a. Identify Contacts: Get in touch with friends, family, or neighbors who may have a garlic press that they are willing to lend.   b. Borrow the Garlic Press: Arrange to pick up the garlic press at a time that works for both parties. Be sure to express your gratitude and clarify the duration for which you will need the press.   c. Clean and Use the Press: Before using the borrowed garlic press, clean it thoroughly, then follow the necessary guidelines while cooking.   d. Return the Press: After using the garlic press, clean it again, and return it to the owner within the agreed time frame, preferably sooner than expected to show your appreciation. 3. DIY Garlic Press: If you are unable to purchase or borrow a garlic press, you may consider creating a makeshift garlic press using readily available materials. Here are some ideas:   a. Fork and Cutting Board: Place the unpeeled garlic cloves on a cutting board and use the back of a fork to press down on them. Then, scrape the crushed garlic from the fork and use it as required.   b. Chef's Knife: You can also use the side of a wide blade chef's knife to crush individual garlic cloves. Place the clove on a cutting board, lay the knife blade flat on it, and using the heel of your hand, press down on the blade until the garlic is crushed. Be sure to exercise caution while handling the knife. Each of these methods has its advantages and drawbacks. Purchasing a garlic press is straightforward but may incur an additional expense; borrowing is cost-effective but relies on the availability of a lender; and DIY solutions may be resourceful but not as effective or convenient as using an actual garlic press. Choose the method that best aligns with your needs and circumstances to accomplish your goal of obtaining a garlic press."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Scientists think that the earliest flowers attracted insects and other animals, which spread pollen from flower to flower. This greatly increased the efficiency of fertilization over wind-spread pollen, which might or might not actually land on another flower. To take better advantage of this “animal labor,” plants evolved traits such as brightly colored petals to attract pollinators. In exchange for pollination, flowers gave the pollinators nectar.  I am facing a new situation today: Joy had a field full of flowering plants , that he used for medicinal and honey making purposes. Her friend Jill also had a piece of land where she cultivated plants that fertilize over wind spread pollen.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which friend had a field that attracted fewer insects? Answer:","output":"Based on the background article you provided, Jill's field attracted fewer insects compared to Joy's field. This is due to the fact that Jill cultivated plants that primarily relied on wind for pollination, rather than attracting insects and other animals.

Глобализация несет в себе множество вызовов, и одним из них является то, что она подпитывает все более широкие расслоения между своими участниками. Например, если сравнить Колумбию и Афганистан или Чили и Судан, становится очевидно, что разрыв между этими странами основан на многих и разных факторах. Разнообразие в уровне экономического развития, политической стабильности и культурных особенностей этих стран создают ряд проблем для интеграции и взаимодействия на мировой арене. Одним из следствий глобализации является увеличение числа стран, которые активно участвуют в мировой экономической и политической жизни. Однако большое количество участников в современной мировой системе на самом деле может затруднять превращение численного превосходства в конкретное и влиятельное действие. Для преодоления этого разрыва и установления согласованных отношений между странами требуется тесное сотрудничество и кооперация на многих уровнях – начиная с более эффективной системы международной торговли и заканчивая углубленными двусторонними переговорами о взаимовыгодных проектах. К сожалению, на нашем пути к согласованному влиянию ряд препятствий. Во-первых, экономические различия между развитыми и развивающимися странами могут привести к проблемам, таким как социальное неравенство, миграции и конфликты. Во-вторых, политические разногласия между странами может затруднить установление конструктивного диалога и принятие коллективных решений в области решения международных проблем. Наконец, культурные различия и непонимание между нациями могут порождать стереотипы, предубеждения и даже враждебность, что, в свою очередь, вредит налаживанию взаимовыгодного и крепкого сотрудничества. В заключение можно сказать, что глобализация ставит перед мировым сообществом сложные задачи, требующие принятия согласованных усилий, и только факт наличия большого количества стран-участников мирового сообщества не гарантирует превращение этой связи в сильное международное влияние. Важной задачей для каждого участника глобализации является создание путей для тесного сотрудничества, учет разнообразия интересов и обеспечение равных возможностей для участия в мировом развитии и решении проблем, стоящих перед нашей планетой."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: At the end of the 16th century, England and the Netherlands began to challenge Portugal's monopoly of trade with Asia, forming private joint-stock companies to finance the voyages—the English, later British, East India Company and the Dutch East India Company, chartered in 1600 and 1602 respectively. The primary aim of these companies was to tap into the lucrative spice trade, an effort focused mainly on two regions; the East Indies archipelago, and an important hub in the trade network, India. There, they competed for trade supremacy with Portugal and with each other. Although England ultimately eclipsed the Netherlands as a colonial power, in the short term the Netherlands' more advanced financial system and the three Anglo-Dutch Wars of the 17th century left it with a stronger position in Asia. Hostilities ceased after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 when the Dutch William of Orange ascended the English throne, bringing peace between the Netherlands and England. A deal between the two nations left the spice trade of the East Indies archipelago to the Netherlands and the textiles industry of India to England, but textiles soon overtook spices in terms of profitability, and by 1720, in terms of sales, the British company had overtaken the Dutch.

How is the theory of plate tectonics different from a hypothesis regarding a certain aspect of plate movement?","output":"The theory of plate tectonics and a hypothesis regarding a certain aspect of plate movement are fundamentally different in terms of their scope, scientific acceptance, validation, and the extent of evidence supporting them. In order to better understand the differences, let's first define the terms and then explore the disparities in detail. 1. Definition: a. Theory of Plate Tectonics: The theory of plate tectonics is a comprehensive and widely accepted scientific theory that explains the large-scale movements of Earth's lithosphere. It describes how the Earth's outer shell, known as the lithosphere, is divided into a number of large, rigid plates that move over the partially molten and ductile asthenosphere. These plates interact with each other at their boundaries, resulting in various geological processes, such as the creation of mountains, earthquakes, and volcanic activity. b. Hypothesis Regarding a Certain Aspect of Plate Movement: A hypothesis is a proposed explanation for a specific phenomenon or observation, which can be tested through experiments, observations, or other investigative means. A hypothesis regarding a certain aspect of plate movement would be a provisional explanation of a specific feature or process related to the movement or interaction of tectonic plates. 2. Scope and Focus: a. The theory of plate tectonics is comprehensive and provides a general framework for understanding various aspects of Earth's geological processes and history. It encompasses the movement, interaction, and behavior of tectonic plates, and covers a wide range of geological phenomena. b. A hypothesis regarding a certain aspect of plate movement is focused on an individual feature or process, and its predictions and implications are limited to the specific aspect of plate tectonics being studied. This hypothesis aims to provide a detailed explanation or prediction for a particular observation related to plate movement. 3. Scientific Acceptance: a. The theory of plate tectonics is well-established and widely accepted by the scientific community. Developed over several decades, it incorporates evidence from multiple disciplines such as geology, geophysics, and paleontology, and is now considered the unifying theory of Earth sciences. b. A hypothesis regarding a certain aspect of plate movement, on the other hand, is a proposed explanation that has not yet been proven or disproven. It must undergo rigorous testing, and only after accumulating substantial evidence and withstanding critical assessment by the scientific community, may a hypothesis advance to the status of an accepted theory or become part of a larger theory. 4. Validation and Evidence: a. A significant amount of evidence supports the theory of plate tectonics, including the global distribution of earthquakes and volcanoes, the age and distribution of the oceanic and continental crust, and paleomagnetic data from ancient rocks. Multiple lines of converging evidence from various scientific fields reinforce and validate this theory. b. A hypothesis for a certain aspect of plate movement needs to provide specific predictions that can be tested and validated. The available evidence for a hypothesis may be limited at the outset, and it might require additional data collection and experimental results to confirm or refute the proposed explanation. In conclusion, the theory of plate tectonics represents a widely accepted, comprehensive framework explaining the large-scale movement and interaction of the Earth's lithosphere, with a substantial body of evidence to support it, whereas a hypothesis regarding a certain aspect of plate movement is a focused, provisional explanation for a specific observation that requires further testing and validation before being integrated into the broader scientific understanding of plate tectonics."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Life-long learning is the concept that \\"It's never too soon or too late for learning.\\" -- a philosophy that has taken root in a larger number of different organizations. Life-long learning is an attitude -- learners believe that one can and should be open to new ideas, decisions, skills or behaviors. Life-long learning throws the well-known rule \\"You can't teach an old dog new tricks\\" out of the door. Life-long learning provides the general public with learning opportunities at all ages and in different ways: at work, at home and through leisure activities, not just through formal channels such as school and higher education. Life-long education is often achieved through distance learning or e-learning, continuing education, home schooling, etc. It also includes training programs for those who want to improve their qualifications, bring their skills up to date or retrain for a new line of work. In later life, especially in retirement, continued learning takes various forms, crossing traditional academic limits. One of the reasons why life-long education has become so important is the rapid progress of modern science and technology. Although the period of primary, secondary and university education is increased, the knowledge and skills gained there are usually not _ for a professional career spanning  three or four decades.

The movie is set in 1985, in the fictional town of Quatssack, New Hampshire. Quatssack seems like a nice, ordinary town, but it harbors a dark and deadly secret: it is the home of the Children of the Yeti, an evil cult that worships a yeti that lives in the woods. The yeti was captured in the Himalayas and brought to the town as an old man′s sideshow, but had escaped, and is reportedly the last of its kind. Each night, Debra, one of its members, lures young men to the cult with the intention of offering it up to the yeti as a means of keeping it sexually sated. The movie opens up with such an example, with Debra and Raymond, the cult′s leader, looking on while laughing sadistically. Five college students—fraternity brothers Adam and Dick, their girlfriends Sally and Emily, and a fifth member named Joe—are coming to Quatssack on a camping trip, unaware of the town′s secrets. On their first night, Joe is killed while going to the bathroom in the woods, and since he was the one who had the car keys, the remaining four cannot leave town. The old man, who now owns a hideous-looking creature called \\"Tentacle Boy\\" and displays it as a sideshow, informs them of the yeti that he used to own now living somewhere in the woods. Emily goes into a nearby church to pray for Joe′s safety, and while she is in there, she is discovered by a priest as a \\"Chosen One\\" that was prophesied to take down the Children of the Yeti. She accepts her destiny, and the priest gives her supplies for her mission. Meanwhile, Adam, Dick, and Sally, who are waiting for Emily outside, are ambushed by a redneck demanding the whereabouts of the Chosen One. Emily emerges from the church and shoots the redneck with a crossbow, and despite his seemingly near-fatal wound, demands that the redneck take them to the cult′s location. Only Adam and Emily follow the redneck; Sally is sent back to their campsite, while Dick had left earlier, having met Debra. Answer:","output":"Emily is discovered by a priest as a \\"Chosen One\\" that was prophesied to take down the Children of the Yeti."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I only have good memories of summer - Christmas time, six weeks holidays when in school then three months off whilst at uni. In my eyes, there is not one bad thing about summer. That is why I hate the First of March. Yes, it is still hot. Yes, my summer fruits are still in season and I can still wear my skimpy clothes, but, in my mind, it means that winter is near. The weather is only going to get colder and my favourite time of the year is official over. In an attempt to lift my end of Summer blues I decided to give myself a bright, cheerful manicure. The colour I choose was a luscious purple cream from butter LONDON called Molly-Coddled. It was just about opaque after one coat, just ever so slightly streaky. Two coats, completely opaque and streak free. If you haven't previously heard of butter LONDON, it is a nail polish brand with a massive range of high fashion colours and it's products are formulated without the use of the harmful ingredients like Formaldehyde, Toluene, DBP or Parabens. butter LONDON was the first company to sell 3 Free nail lacquer in the United States. Formaldehyde is one of the biggest nasties that I make a real effort to avoid. I did my PhD in Forensics and spent a lot of time watching autopsies.

Under the draft proposal, the president would be able to serve up to two additional five-year terms, officials who saw the draft told Reuters. The president would have sweeping power and would not need to consult his parliament on most executive matters. ISRAEL APPOINTS FIRST AMBASSADOR TO TURKEY SINCE GAZA SPAT The report said the party was looking to hold a referendum next spring and was searching for support to win approval. Any constitutional change would need at least 367 out of 500 deputies in the assembly to give the OK, Reuters added. “We will continue to seek a base for consensus with the other parties,” Prime Minister Binali Yildirim told a conference of AKP provincial heads in Ankara. “After that, the decision lies with the people.” SYRIAN PRESIDENT ASSAD CLAIMS TRUMP COULD BE A 'NATURAL ALLY' The report said Erdogan has benefited from nationalist support after the failed military coup in July, and has cracked down on dissent in big ways. Close to 37,000 people have been arrested, more than 100,000 people dismissed or suspended from government jobs, and 170 media outlets and scores of businesses and associations have been shut down over alleged ties to a movement led by Fethullah Gulen, the Pennsylvania-based Muslim cleric whom Turkey accuses of masterminding the coup attempt. Turkish police detained the chief editor and at least 11 senior staff of Turkey's opposition Cumhuriyet newspaper last week. The detentions involving Cumhuriyet — one of Turkey's oldest newspapers — come amid accusations by opposition parties and human rights groups that Turkey's government is using the state of emergency imposed following a failed military coup to clamp down not only on alleged coup plotters, but on all government critics. The Associated Press contributed to this report.","output":"Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan could remain in power until 2029 under a proposal by the country's ruling AK Party to allow him to serve up to two additional five-year terms, according to a draft seen by unnamed officials.

Brad did some blood tests and found out he has very high cholesterol levels, while his partner Dale had normal cholesterol levels, and was very healthy. Brad got scared and started worrying.  Which friend was more at risk for heart disease? Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, Brad seems to be at a higher risk for heart disease due to his elevated cholesterol levels compared to Dale's normal cholesterol levels. Cholesterol is an essential substance that the body needs to function properly. However, having too much cholesterol in the blood, particularly low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or \\"bad\\" cholesterol, can lead to the buildup of fatty deposits, also known as plaques, in the arteries. This condition is known as atherosclerosis. Over time, atherosclerosis can cause narrowing of the arteries, which reduces blood flow to vital organs, including the heart.  When blood flow to the heart is restricted, it can cause chest pain (angina) or ultimately result in a heart attack (myocardial infarction) if the blood supply to a part of the heart muscle is blocked. High cholesterol levels often don't cause any signs or symptoms, which is why regular check-ups and blood tests, as Brad and Dale did, are essential for identifying potential cardiovascular risks. It is important to note that high cholesterol is only one of many risk factors for heart disease. Other factors include age, gender, family history of heart disease, hypertension (high blood pressure), smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, diabetes, and an unhealthy diet. It's crucial to consider one's overall risk profile rather than solely focusing on cholesterol levels. Although Dale has normal cholesterol levels, it doesn't mean he is immune to heart disease, as other risk factors may still play a role in his overall risk. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, which includes exercising regularly, eating a balanced diet, not smoking, and controlling blood pressure and blood sugar levels, is essential for both Brad and Dale to minimize their chances of developing heart disease. In conclusion, based on the information provided, Brad is at a higher risk for heart disease due to his elevated cholesterol levels.

Both Alabama and Florida boast great wetlands. The State of Alabama has experienced extensive drainage system due to expansion of farmlands. Their neighboring state Florida had similar system. But recently Florida had dismantled many of their drainage systems, mostly because of pressure from different environmental groups.  Hint: Ecologically, the expansion of drainage systems has had tremendous negative effects. Hundreds of thousands of wetland species experienced significant population declines as their habitat was increasingly fragmented and destroyed. Although market hunting within the Central Flyway was a contributing factor in the decline of many waterfowl species' numbers in the early decades of the twentieth century, loss of breeding habitat to agricultural expansion is certainly the most significant. Early maps of midwestern states depict many lakes and marshes that are either nonexistent or significantly reduced in area today.

HERTA MULLER'S third novel begins in a women's university dormitory in Nicolae Ceausescu's Romania, where Lola, a poor girl from the provinces, has come to study Russian. In a Communist country short on consumer goods, Lola and her roommates dream of ''whisper-thin'' nylon stockings while making do with what they have: ''Under the pillows in the beds were six pots of mascara. Six girls spat into the pots and stirred the soot with toothpicks until the black paste grew sticky. Then they opened their eyes wide. The toothpicks scraped against their eyelids, their lashes grew black and thick. But an hour later gray gaps began to crack open in the eyelashes. The saliva dried up and the soot crumbled onto their cheeks.'' Lola, unprepared for city life by her village childhood, has brutal sexual encounters, hangs herself with a belt and is posthumously expelled from the Communist Party. The narrator of the novel is one of her roommates, soon herself an object of political suspicion, so that when she finally leaves the university, packing her pot of mascara, she finds an unpleasant surprise in her bed: ''When I picked up the blanket to pull off the cover, I found a pig's ear in the middle of the sheet. That was the girls' way of saying farewell. I shook the sheet but the ear didn't move, it was sewn on in the middle like a button.'' ''The Land of Green Plums'' is a novel of graphically observed detail in which the author seeks to create a sort of poetry out of the spiritual and material ugliness of life in Communist Romania. The book was not, however, written in Romanian. Herta Muller is a German writer who lived in Romania as part of that country's German minority; in 1987, she left Romania for Germany, where her novels have been published and acclaimed. In the 18th century, the Hapsburg rulers in Vienna encouraged German settlers to pioneer the Hungarian lands that had recently been regained from the Ottoman Empire. Some of these lands, with their descendant German communities, passed to Romania after World War I, and the German minority there, receiving special protection during Romania's alliance with Hitler, maintained its distinctive national character into the era of Communist rule. Ceausescu, seeking to mobilize Romanian nationalism around his dictatorship, perpetrated the general harassment of the German minority, which Ms. Muller experienced as a young woman in the 70's and 80's, and which she has worked into fiction in this novel about relentless persecution in a police state. ''My mother tongue is German,'' Ms. Muller said in a 1989 interview with Amnesty International. Like Kafka writing German in Prague, Ms. Muller in Romania found in her mother tongue the painfully direct expression of profound alienation. Michael Hofmann has produced a powerful English translation, though since an important purpose of the novel is to represent cultural survival through the German language, any translation necessarily obscures some of the work's significance. Furthermore, the issue of Germanness in the novel is very much attuned to the national sensitivities of German readers today. The narrator and her friends, persecuted as dissidents in Romania, must also confront their own family histories of sentimental loyalty to Hitler. ''My father was a member of the SS; I know what I'm talking about,'' Ms. Muller commented in the 1989 interview. In the novel, the narrator feels inevitably awkward in relation to Romania's Jewish survivors: ''It was Herr Feyerabend. He was shuffling his feet and pulled a white handkerchief out of his pocket. I withdrew my head, as if the white handkerchief could feel that someone like myself was staring at a Jew.'' While the narrator may look away from the handkerchief, Ms. Muller unflinchingly confronts the complexity of the 20th century in Eastern Europe, with its terrible permutations of persecution from generation to generation. The narrator watches the Romanian police guards in the streets of the city as they greedily pocket green plums. She herself had been warned as a child, by her father, that it was dangerous to eat green plums, but the guards do not hesitate: ''They knew where the plum trees were in every precinct they policed. . . . The plumsuckers were peasants. The green plums made them stupid. They ate themselves away from their duty. They reverted to childhood, stealing plums from village trees.'' Ms. Muller's vision of a police state manned by plum thieves reads like a kind of fairy tale on the mingled evils of gluttony, stupidity and brutality. The narrator watches the guards as they grab at young women in the streets. It might have been one of these men who followed Lola and mauled her, with ''the greedy desire of a starved dog.'' As the narrator ponders Lola's pathetic fate, the novel encompasses not only the political persecution of dissidents and the harassment of a national minority but also the particular kinds of oppression and vulnerability that women experience under a regime of policemen. Most of the literary accounts of Communist Eastern Europe have come from male writers, and it is especially interesting to have from Ms. Muller this work composed in a woman's voice. In the end, the narrator decides not to kill herself, as Lola did, but to immigrate to Germany, as most of Romania's Germans have done, both before and since the fall of Ceausescu in 1989. This marks the end of many communities that had survived from the 18th-century reign of the Empress Maria Theresa into our own less enlightened century. Ms. Muller conveys a certain sadness over the historical implications of emigration, the impending doom of her own native culture and society. She also offers a potent and repellent depiction of the world she left behind in Romania. A friend of the narrator works as an engineer in a slaughterhouse: ''Kurt told me every week about the slaughterhouse. The workers drank warm blood when they slaughtered the animals. They stole organ meats and brains. . . . Their wives and children are accomplices, Kurt said. The wives use the stiff cow tails for bottle brushes, and the children get the supple ones to play with.'' ''The Land of Green Plums'' addresses issues of vampirish complicity in the bloody rituals of an oppressive regime, whose hungry subjects, whether stealing fresh offal or green plums, ingest political poisons with historically protracted, corrosive consequences. What was this article about?","output":"This article is a review of Herta Muller's third novel, \\"The Land of Green Plums,\\" which is set in Nicolae Ceausescu's Romania and begins in a women's university dormitory.

Those who were more regular with weigh-ins had an easier time maintaining their weight and could maintain it long-term..  (B). Measuring yourself every day or two on a regular basis is perfectly fine. That is to say, for each week that you weigh yourself, stick to a reasonable weight..  (C). You should do regular, consistent weigh ups (ipt) twice each week. Consider putting a scale on your chest instead of your stomach to get an idea of how much weight you need to lose..  (D). Spend 30 to 60 minutes weighing yourself each day and then consider consulting a registered dietitian. This can help your weight change gradually rather than indefinitely..","output":"(A). Many studies have shown that getting on the scale at least once a week is important for weight maintenance long-term. Those who were more regular with weigh-ins had an easier time maintaining their weight and could maintain it long-term. In addition to weighing yourself, it's crucial to track your progress and adjust your habits if you see any fluctuations in your weight.  First, it's essential to maintain a well-balanced, nutritious diet. Consistently consuming wholesome foods, including lean proteins, whole grains, healthy fats, and plenty of fruits and vegetables, can help you preserve that lean physique. Furthermore, practicing mindful eating habits, such as eating slowly, chewing thoroughly, and paying attention to hunger cues, can also contribute to managing your weight effectively. Second, make regular physical activity a part of your lifestyle. Combining cardiovascular exercise with strength training can help build and maintain lean muscle mass, which contributes to a higher metabolic rate, ultimately helping in weight maintenance. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week, along with strength training exercises for all major muscle groups at least two days per week. Getting enough rest and recovery is another critical factor to maintaining a lean physique. Sleep plays a vital role in weight management, as it affects your appetite-regulating hormones, ghrelin, and leptin. Strive for at least 7 to 8 hours of quality sleep each night to keep your hormones in check and prevent overeating or making poor food choices. Addressing stress management is also integral. High stress levels can lead to emotional eating and a disrupted hormonal balance, causing weight gain. Incorporating stress-reducing activities such as meditation, yoga, or engaging in relaxing hobbies can help you handle stress effectively and keep your weight in check. Lastly, accountability and support are crucial for maintaining a lean physique. Connect with friends, family, or online communities to share experiences, seek advice, and ultimately stay accountable for your actions. In conclusion, maintaining a lean physique involves a holistic approach that includes regular weigh-ins, a balanced diet, consistent exercise, adequate sleep, stress management, and social support. By incorporating these strategies, you'll be well-equipped to sustain a healthy, lean body in the long run."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

No, they waited until it was time to pay, and not only charged me for that, but they charged me all kinds of extra fees that I didn't even ask for!  I had also informed the girl that my toenail was loose and needed gluing.  While I was looking at my phone, all of a sudden I felt this sensation, and she RIPPED OFF MY TOENAIL!!!!  Without even asking me!!!!!!  So then she had another girl come and put acrylic on there since the nail underneath was only 1/2 grown.  Again, they didn't tell me how much this would be, or even ask my permission, they just charged me at the end.    The added stone 'massage' was barely a massage!  She rubbed the stones up my lower legs a couple times, and that was it.  It lasted about 30 seconds.   And when I asked for a design, I'm used to getting a board with a bunch of designs to choose from.  She didn't even ask me what I wanted, she just painted a few lines on my two toes and then charge me 5 MORE dollars for that!   Ugh, I don't care HOW ugly my toes look next time, I will NEVER go anywhere else besides Bella Nails again, they ROCK!!!!!!!  This place was appalling.  I didn't want to make a scene, so I just paid the money, but I will NEVER go back!!!!!!! Is this review positive or negative? Select from the following.

Although she wrote \\"went off very well\\" in her diary, Ferrier was disappointed with her performance, and concluded that she needed further voice training. She approached the distinguished baritone Roy Henderson with whom, a week previously, she had sung in Mendelssohn's Elijah. Henderson agreed to teach her, and was her regular voice coach for the remainder of her life. He later explained that her \\"warm and spacious tone\\" was in part due to the size of the cavity at the back of her throat: \\"one could have shot a fair-sized apple right to the back of the throat without obstruction\\". However, this natural physical advantage was not in itself enough to ensure the quality of her voice; this was due, Henderson says, to \\"her hard work, artistry, sincerity, personality and above all her character\\". Ferrier's performances in the Glyndebourne run, which began on 12 July 1946, earned her favourable reviews, although the opera itself was less well received. On the provincial tour which followed the festival it failed to attract the public and incurred heavy financial losses. By contrast, when the opera reached Amsterdam it was greeted warmly by the Dutch audiences who showed particular enthusiasm for Ferrier's performance. This was Ferrier's first trip abroad, and she wrote an excited letter to her family: \\"The cleanest houses and windows you ever did see, and flowers in the fields all the way!\\" Following her success as Lucretia she agreed to return to Glyndebourne in 1947, to sing Orfeo in Gluck's opera Orfeo ed Euridice. She had often sung Orfeo's aria Che farò (\\"What is life\\") as a concert piece, and had recently recorded it with Decca.

The greater advances of the Soviet space program at the time allowed their space program to achieve other significant firsts, including the first EVA \\"spacewalk\\" and the first mission performed by a crew in shirt-sleeves. Gemini took a year longer than planned to accomplish its first flight, allowing the Soviets to achieve another first, launching Voskhod 1 on October 12, 1964, the first spacecraft with a three-cosmonaut crew. The USSR touted another technological achievement during this mission: it was the first space flight during which cosmonauts performed in a shirt-sleeve-environment. However, flying without spacesuits was not due to safety improvements in the Soviet spacecraft's environmental systems; rather this innovation was accomplished because the craft's limited cabin space did not allow for spacesuits. Flying without spacesuits exposed the cosmonauts to significant risk in the event of potentially fatal cabin depressurization. This feat would not be repeated until the US Apollo Command Module flew in 1968; this later mission was designed from the outset to safely transport three astronauts in a shirt-sleeve environment while in space.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Steven Norman Carlton (born December 22, 1944), nicknamed \\"Lefty\\", is a former Major League Baseball left-handed pitcher. He pitched from 1965 to 1988 for six different teams in his career, but it is his time with the Philadelphia Phillies where he received his greatest acclaim as a professional and won four Cy Young Awards. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1994. Carlton has the second-most lifetime strikeouts of any left-handed pitcher (4th overall), and the second-most lifetime wins of any left-handed pitcher (11th overall). Carlton slumped in 1973, losing 20 games. The media's questioning of his unusual training techniques led to an acrimonious relationship between them and Carlton. In 1976, upon the advice of his lawyer Edward L. Wolf, decided to sever all ties with the media, and refused to answer press questions for the rest of his career with the Phillies. This reached a point where, in 1981, while the Mexican rookie Fernando Valenzuela was achieving stardom with the Los Angeles Dodgers, a reporter remarked, \\"The two best pitchers in the National League don't speak English: Fernando Valenzuela and Steve Carlton.\\"  Media charges of bigotry and anti-Semitism  In 1994 he agreed to an interview with writer Pat Jordan at his home in Durango, Colorado. The result was the story \\"Thin Mountain Air\\" in the April 1994 issue of Philadelphia magazine. This article was noted by the New York Times as being the source of numerous claims about Steve Carlton's political and social beliefs: \\"According to Pat Jordan, the writer of the article, Carlton alternately said that the world is ruled or controlled by the Russian and United States Governments, which 'fill the air with low-frequency sound waves,' the Elders of Zion, British intelligence agencies, '12 Jewish bankers meeting in Switzerland' and 'a committee of 300 which meets at a roundtable in Rome.' Not only that, but Carlton also charges, according to Jordan, that President Clinton has 'a black son' he won't acknowledge and that the AIDS virus was created at a secret Maryland biological warfare laboratory to get rid of gays and blacks.'\\" This same New York Times article notes that teammate Tim McCarver defended Carlton against charges of being a bigot and an anti-Semite, though he acknowledged \\"If he's guilty of anything, it's believing some of the material he reads. Does he become confused with his reading about radical things? Yes. I've told him that. Does that translate into him being anti-Semitic? No.\\" what was he view on the media","output":"Steven Norman Carlton, widely known as \\"Lefty,\\" and celebrated as a former Major League Baseball left-handed pitcher, held a complicated relationship with the media. His relationship with the press was marked by contention and resistance, especially after 1973. Carlton’s performance deteriorated notably in that year, during which he lost 20 matches. The press seized the opportunity to scrutinize his unorthodox training techniques, leading to friction-filled interactions between Carlton and the media. Consequently, he sought legal counsel from his lawyer, Edward L. Wolf, who advised him to break away from all engagements with the media. Heeding this advice, Carlton stopped responding to press questions for the remainder of his career with the Philadelphia Phillies. This decision apparently created an intense situation to the extent that in 1981, a reporter commented about him and fellow pitcher Fernando Valenzuela, \\"The two best pitchers in the National League don't speak English: Fernando Valenzuela and Steve Carlton.\\" A decisive shift in Carlton’s view on the media seemed to occur in 1994. He agreed to participate in an interview with writer Pat Jordan at his home in Durango, Colorado. The discussion unfolded into the feature story \\"Thin Mountain Air\\" in the April 1994 issue of Philadelphia magazine. The narrative would soon earn a mention in The New York Times for the controversial insights it offered into Carlton's social and political beliefs. These claims, disputable in nature, generated a backlash and led to allegations of bigotry and anti-Semitism against Carlton. Notwithstanding these charges, former teammate, Tim McCarver, stoutly defended Carlton, asserting that the accusations against him were baseless. In McCarver's view, Carlton's flaw lay in his gullibility towards radical thoughts and ideas, which often led to confusion, but that did not translate into him being anti-Semitic. In summary, Carlton demonstrated a complex perspective regarding the media. His dealings with the press evolved from initial resistance and avoidance to a brief period of détente before being marred by controversy following the revealing 1994 interview. Despite these ups and downs, his reputation as one of the greatest left-handed pitchers in Major League Baseball has remained intact."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Solution 2: You find a little bush with tiny branches that are not very high from the ground. The branches don't seem very strong, and they could break if you hang the big swing on them.

A transsexual who had a £10,000 sex change on the NHS to become a woman now wants the taxpayer to foot the bill for a further £14,000 of surgery so she can become a man again. Chelsea Attonley, 30, who was born a boy and called Matthew, said she now finds being a woman 'exhausting', is tired of putting on make-up and wearing heels, and now accepts that she should always have stayed a man. Chelsea said she had struggled with her identity while growing up in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, and as a child she would dress up in women's clothes. In her twenties she became a drag queen known as Miss Malibu, drawing on glamour model Katie Price's look for inspiration. Scroll down for video. Chelsea Attonley, 30, who was born a boy and called Matthew, had a £10,000 sex change on the NHS to become a woman. She now wants the taxpayer to foot the bill for a further £14,000 of surgery so she can become a man again. An initial bid for a sex change to become a woman was turned down by a doctor, sending Chelsea into a spiral of depression, she said. But then the former drag queen, who copied Jordan's style by wearing a blonde wig, mini skirts and stilettos, had a chance meeting with her idol in a nightclub in 2007. The glamour model told her to 'go for it' and her words inspired Chelsea to return to her GP and push once again for the gender reassignment surgery, costing £10,000. But now, seven years after surgery to become a woman, Chelsea wants to go back to being a man - and wants the taxpayer to foot the bill. Chelsea, who lives on welfare benefits, told a magazine yesterday she finds dressing and acting as a girl 'exhausting' and feels she has never been fully accepted as a real woman. She is aiming to have a breast reduction on the NHS and painful gender reassignment surgery to give her back a penis at a total cost of £14,000. Chelsea, who changed her name by deed poll from Matthew in 2008 after a £5,000 boob job in Thailand partly funded by benefit money, says she gradually began having doubts about the sex change. Chelsea, now living in London, said: 'I have always longed to be a woman, but no amount of surgery can give me an actual female body and I feel like I am living a lie. 'It is exhausting putting on make-up and wearing heels all the time. Even then I don't feel I look like a proper woman. 'I suffered from depression and anxiety as a result of the hormones too. 'I have realised it would be easier to stop fighting the way I look naturally and accept that I was born a man physically.' Chelsea, who spoke on ITV's This Morning earlier this year about Katie Price's encouragement, says she does not feel guilty about asking the taxpayer to pay for her reversion. 'Now I have decided I want to live as Matthew, I am desperate to have my FF-cup boobs removed,' she said. 'I can't afford to have them done privately, so I am hoping to have the op on the NHS. 'I can't work at the moment because I am too upset after what I have been through. 'I am considering having penis reconstruction too. I don't feel bad about the NHS paying for the surgery as I don't consider it a choice. 'I need to have these operations for the sake of my mental health. I am lucky enough to live in a country where there is free health care.' Chelsea, who changed her name by deed poll from Matthew in 2008 after a £5,000 boob job in Thailand partly funded by benefit money, says she gradually began having doubts about the sex change. She said: 'I thought the surgery would make me feel complete, but it didn't. 'I knew deep down that, even though I had had surgery, I had still been born a man. 'But I tried my best to block out my feelings.' Chelsea said living as a woman is exhausting. 'No matter how much make-up I put on or how I dressed, I knew people would not know me as a real woman. Chelsea, now living in London, said: 'I have always longed to be a woman, but no amount of surgery can give me an actual female body and I feel like I am living a lie' 'It was draining to constantly think about how to walk and speak like a girl. 'I was fighting a losing battle. When people found out about my past, they treated me like a liar and a fake. I suffered from anxiety and depression.' She said she lost the support of her mother when she died from a heart attack. She said : 'I could not keep up the act of pretending to be a woman any more. It was making me miserable. 'I had to go back to living as Matthew.' She said she had always struggled with her identity while growing up in Chesterfield, Derbyshire. As a child she would dress up in women's clothes, and in her twenties she became a drag queen known as Miss Malibu. Chelsea has already had testosterone injections to begin her transition to becoming a man again. She has also had testosterone injections to stimulate hair growth and has cut his hair. She added: 'If people criticise me for wanting treatment on the NHS, it does not bother me. 'I know I need these changes to make me happy and no one should deny me that.' The TaxPayers' Alliance yesterday insisted the NHS should not be expected to pay out again. Research director Alex Wild said: 'The NHS must prioritise crucial frontline services over ridiculous vanity operations. 'This whole saga has simply cost far too much. If the Health Service is to be properly funded, this sort of waste must be cut out.'

She aims to have a breast reduction and painful gender reassignment surgery on the NHS to give her back a penis, at a total cost of £14,000. Chelsea, who is living on welfare benefits, does not feel guilty about asking taxpayers to pay for the reversion, stating she needs the operations for the sake of her mental health. She believes she is lucky enough to live in a country with free healthcare. Nevertheless, the TaxPayers' Alliance insists that the NHS should not be expected to pay out again, with research director, Alex Wild, stating that the NHS must prioritize crucial frontline services over what he calls \\"ridiculous vanity operations.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bakelants, who rides for the AG2R-La Mondiale team and won a stage in the 2013 race, made his comments when asked in an interview in last Wednesday's Het Laastse Nieuws about sexual abstention during the three-week Tour. AG2R-La Mondiale apologised for the comments, saying they were in \\"very bad taste\\". The Tour organisers ASO also demanded an apology from Bakelants for the \\"sexist\\" remarks. Bakelants, 31, and married with a young daughter, took to Twitter to say sorry. \\"My sincerest apologies to all those offended by my words in a so called humouristic itw (sic).

If you don't have the perfect pair, take a trip to the thrift shop! Jeans, khakis, chinos, slacks -- all types will work. If the pants are too big, you'll need to rip up the side seam, cut out the unnecessary fabric, and sew it back together to match your waistline. Make sure it lies flat; you don't want any material bunching or bubbling -- it should naturally lie flush to the table.  If your cut isn't perfectly straight, that's fine! As long as it's a clean line, it doesn't matter what angle it's at. In fact, a steeper angle can give your skirt a more refined, less patched-together look. If you want to use the legs for the rest of your skirt (right now it's too short), don't throw them away just yet! You probably want another six inches (in width) or so of fabric, if not more.

If you're using your old jeans, you may need to rip out the seam that meets the skirt -- otherwise that's a lot of thread going on in one place. And because of the cut of the jean, make sure the fabric lines up (width-wise) front and back. Using your 1/2\\" seam allowance, pin your fabric to the edge of the skirt, leaving the extra on the inside, rendering it invisible. Flip the skirt inside out and begin either hand stitching or blazing through with a sewing machine.  If your fabric requires it, create a seam on the bottom edge, too. Just don't make it too short! If your fabric is giving you any guff, iron it flat. It'll be much easier to work with then. Your skirt's done!

'well, good luck' and i headed back to my desk. 2:05pm: i got through the last 2 hours, keeping my head down, just waiting for them to get access to the camera system.  they never got access to it and seemed to have given up.  also people had started to make funny names for the culprit: midnight bomber, phantom pooper, and lucky logger are some of the names.  everyone was trying to figure out who laid a steamer on the toilet seat.  finally the day was over and i left the office...what a hectic, 'shitty' day.  next few days: the next few days people in the office were still referencing the shit.  'who do you think was the midnight bomber?'  hr had added a sign to both bathrooms stating to please clean up after yourself, no standing on the toilets, and no soiling the toilet seats.  fast forward two weeks and the cto fires rod miller.  i don't know why he was fired, but i wanted to stay as far away as possible.  this happened 4 years ago, and to this day i've only told some close friends.  they love this story and make me tell it all the time.  at work people still make references to the midnight bomber and the phantom pooper...little do they know i am still amongst them.      edit: some people asking what it looked like.  i found one on ebay that looks similar: http://www.ebay.com/itm/realistic-fake-human-turd-poop-gross-gag-gift-prank-joke-crap-toilet-trick-/111384263608 Student:","output":"\\"Steve\\", under a pseudonym, caused a hilarious situation at his workplace by placing a realistic-looking fake poop on a toilet seat, triggering an office-wide investigation, including examination of security footage and building access logs, which ended with a colleague being unfairly suspected and later dismissed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the following statement correct based on the text are all sides the same length on a parallelogram","output":"Based on the text provided, it is not correct to say that all sides of a parallelogram have the same length. The text states that a parallelogram is a quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides. It also mentions that the opposite or facing sides of a parallelogram are of equal length. This information implies that while the opposite sides have the same length, the adjacent sides can have different lengths. To clarify, let's consider a parallelogram with sides AB, BC, CD, and DA. In this case, side AB must be parallel to side CD, and side BC must be parallel to side DA. The lengths of the opposite sides are equal, so AB = CD and BC = DA, but the lengths of AB and BC (or any adjacent sides) may not be equal. In a special case, when all four sides of the parallelogram have the same length, the parallelogram is called a square or a rhombus. In these specific types of parallelograms, it is correct to say that all sides are the same length.

Here is a question about this article: The roots of hard rock can be traced back to the 1950s, particularly electric blues, which laid the foundations for key elements such as a rough declamatory vocal style, heavy guitar riffs, string-bending blues-scale guitar solos, strong beat, thick riff-laden texture, and posturing performances. Electric blues guitarists began experimenting with hard rock elements such as driving rhythms, distorted guitar solos and power chords in the 1950s, evident in the work of Memphis blues guitarists such as Joe Hill Louis, Willie Johnson, and particularly Pat Hare, who captured a \\"grittier, nastier, more ferocious electric guitar sound\\" on records such as James Cotton's \\"Cotton Crop Blues\\" (1954). Other antecedents include Link Wray's instrumental \\"Rumble\\" in 1958, and the surf rock instrumentals of Dick Dale, such as \\"Let's Go Trippin'\\" (1961) and \\"Misirlou\\" (1962). What is the answer to this question: Who recorded \\"Rumble\\"?","output":"\\"Rumble\\" is an instrumental rock song recorded by Link Wray in 1958.

We have considered various alternatives: A joint committee on the old model of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy is one. A single committee in each house of Congress, combining authorizing and appropriating authorities, is another. The new committee or committees should conduct continuing studies of the activities of the intelligence agencies and report problems relating to the development and use of intelligence to all members of the House and Senate. We have already recommended that the total level of funding for intelligence be made public, and that the national intelligence program be appropriated to the National Intelligence Director, not to the secretary of defense. We also recommend that the intelligence committee should have a subcommittee specifically dedicated to oversight, freed from the consuming responsibility of working on the budget. The resolution creating the new intelligence committee structure should grant subpoena authority to the committee or committees. The majority party's representation on this committee should never exceed the minority's representation by more than one. Four of the members appointed to this committee or committees should be a member who also serves on each of the following additional committees: Armed Services, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, and the Defense Appropriations subcommittee. In this way the other major congressional interests can be brought together in the new committee's work. Members should serve indefinitely on the intelligence committees, without set terms, thereby letting them accumulate expertise. The committees should be smaller-perhaps seven or nine members in each house-so that each member feels a greater sense of responsibility, and accountability, for the quality of the committee's work. The leaders of the Department of Homeland Security now appear before 88 committees and subcommittees of Congress. One expert witness (not a member of the administration) told us that this is perhaps the single largest obstacle impeding the department's successful development. The one attempt to consolidate such committee authority, the House Select Committee on Homeland Security, may be eliminated. The Senate does not have even this. Congress needs to establish for the Department of Homeland Security the kind of clear authority and responsibility that exist to enable the Justice Department to deal with crime and the Defense Department to deal with threats to national security.  Question: \\"In what ways is it recommended that the new committee could be more transparent?\\" Response: \\"Give back money to the tax payers\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","output":"No, the response to the question is not factually correct based on the paragraph.

The townspeople offer a monthly sacrifice to the beast and stay away from the woods but Lucy ventured there after discovering that Valerie had been promised in engagement to Henry, whom Lucy loved.Adrian, Henry, Peter, Cesaire, and the other men venture out into the woods to a mountain cave hunt the Wolf. Against Henry's protest, the group splits into two groups and Henry and his father are attacked. The others manage to behead the wolf, but it kills Adrian in the process. The men bring back the head of a common gray wolf, thinking it is the one that has been terrorizing the village.Valerie sees Suzette crying over Adrian's body and confronts her. Suzette admits that she and Adrian once had an affair and that Lucy is actually his daughter as well as Henry's half-sister. This is the reason why she could not be offered to him. Valerie also learns that Cesaire is seemingly unaware of this.The townspeople decide to celebrate the death of the wolf, but their preparations are interrupted by the arrival of famous witch hunter Father Solomon (Gary Oldman), who reveals that the townspeople did not slaughter the real Wolf because it would have changed back into its human form if they did.

Many glaciers from temperate, alpine and seasonal polar climates store water as ice during the colder seasons and release it later in the form of meltwater as warmer summer temperatures cause the glacier to melt, creating a water source that is especially important for plants, animals and human uses when other sources may be scant. Within high altitude and Antarctic environments, the seasonal temperature difference is often not sufficient to release meltwater.

David Hogg, one of the most outspoken survivors of the Valentine’s Day bloodshed which left 17 dead, first gained headlines after it emerged he interviewed class mates while the massacre was taking place.      The teenager has since become a prominent voice in the debate around gun control and addressed a crowd of thousands at the Washington DC March For Our Lives rally last month. He welcomed demonstrators to the “revolution” for stricter gun laws and called for politicians who are supported by the National Rifle Association to get their “resumes ready”.      Stallone, an actor who is the younger brother of Sylvester Stallone, has provoked a ferocious backlash for his remarks about Mr Hogg.      \\"This David Hogg p***y is getting a little big for his britches.

He's the worst rep for today's youth headline grabbing punk”.      Stallone also lashed out at Emma Gonzalez - a fellow gun activist and student survivor from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.      ”Emma Gonzalez is another headline grabbing clown.

Q:I read this background article the other day: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).  I am facing a new situation today: Two brothers loved geology. Bob studied sedimentary rocks while Dan studied about earthquakes and their location.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which brother studied more about how rocks usually move several centimeters? A:","output":"Based on the background article and the new situation, the brother who studied more about how rocks usually move several centimeters would be Dan.

I was eight years old at the time with a severe heart problem and I needed heart surgery. My Mom did not have the money, and without the surgery there was a real good chance I would not live to be thirteen years old. After contacting several organizations Dr. Vincent was able to get financial help for me through United Way, a Crippled Children's Organization. Dr. Vincent was a handsome man; he was also very gentle and caring. I remember being in the hospital for an Angiogram test, and during the procedure I was crying terribly, so the medical staff called in Dr. Vincent to calm me down, and he was able to comfort me when no one else could. Then the time came for me to have heart surgery; there was a fifty- percent chance that I would not make it through the surgery because it was experimental. At the time I was only the second or third person to have this procedure done. I was absolutely terrified, and again Dr. Vincent reassured me he would see to it that everything would be all right. I had a lot of confidence and trust in Dr. Vincent; He came to see me after the surgery, which was extremely painful but very successful, and brought me a stuffed animal. I was so surprised to get this gift from Dr. Vincent; I gave him a hug. I guess Dr. Vincent must have known I was feeling very lonely and scared. You see, I had no family or friends visit me while I was in the hospital except for my Mom, and I am not sure why. I do know one thing; I had a wonderful doctor who took the time to help a scared little girl who felt all alone.

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: United States has varied geographical characteristics. Take for example, the Mississippi Delta. The delta has vast wetland that gets inundated every year. On the contrary, farther west, the Mojave Desert in Nevada sees very little precipitation or floodwater. Both places are beautiful in their own right, and attract many tourists every year.  But I can use this background: When soil is flooded, hypoxia develops, as soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma.  What is an answer for this question: Would Mojave Desert be less or more prone to hypoxia than Mississippi Delta? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Understand the context of the two geographical areas mentioned - the Mississippi Delta and the Mojave Desert. Step 2: Recall the background information provided: hypoxia develops in flooded soils as microorganisms consume oxygen faster than it can be replaced. Wetlands like the Mississippi Delta tend to have hypoxic conditions. Step 3: Consider the Mojave Desert's characteristics - it receives very little precipitation and is not prone to flooding.

Realising that Henry III had been right and that there was no prospect of a Protestant king succeeding in resolutely Catholic Paris, Henry agreed to convert, reputedly stating \\"Paris vaut bien une messe\\" . He was formally received into the Catholic Church in 1593, and was crowned at Chartres in 1594 as League members maintained control of the Cathedral of Rheims, and, sceptical of Henry's sincerity, continued to oppose him. He was finally received into Paris in March 1594, and 120 League members in the city who refused to submit were banished from the capital. Paris' capitulation encouraged the same of many other towns, while others returned to support the crown after Pope Clement VIII absolved Henry, revoking his excommunication in return for the publishing of the Tridentine Decrees, the restoration of Catholicism in Béarn, and appointing only Catholics to high office. Evidently Henry's conversion worried Protestant nobles, many of whom had, until then, hoped to win not just concessions but a complete reformation of the French Church, and their acceptance of Henry was by no means a foregone conclusion.

Born in Scotland on 15 June 1792, he was son of John Mitchell of Carron Works and was brought up from childhood by his uncle, Thomas Livingstone of Parkhall, Stirlingshire. On the death of his uncle, he joined the British army in Portugal as a volunteer, at the age of sixteen. On 24 June 1811, at the age of nineteen, he received his first commission as 2nd Lieutenant in the 1st Battalion 95th Rifles (later the Rifle Brigade / Royal Green Jackets). Utilising his skills as a draughtsman of outstanding ability, he was occasionally employed in the Quartermaster-General's department under Sir George Murray. Mitchell's fourth expedition was into Queensland in 1845-46. He was convinced that a significant river must flow north-west into the Gulf of Carpentaria, this being the main thrust of the endeavour.  On 15 December 1845 Mitchell started from Boree (Buree in Mitchell's journal) with a large party including Edmund Kennedy as second in command (later speared to death at Escape River near Cape York). He struck the Darling River above Fort Bourke then continued to the Narran River, the Balonne, and the Culgoa. On 12 April 1846 he came to a natural bridge of rocks on the main branch of the Balonne which he called St.George Bridge, now the site of the town of St George. Kennedy was left in charge of the main body here, and was instructed to follow on slowly while Mitchell pushed ahead with a few men. Mitchell followed the Balonne to the Maranoa, and the Cogoon (now called Muckadilla Creek, near Roma). This rivulet led him to a magnificent pastoral district in the midst of which stood a solitary hill that he named Mount Abundance. He then crossed a low watershed to the Maranoa and awaited Kennedy's arrival. Kennedy rejoined Mitchell on 1 June 1846.  Leaving Kennedy for a second time, he set out on an extensive excursion of more than four months. Mitchell traversed the country at the head of the Maranoa and discovered the Warrago River. Keeping north over the watershed, he traversed the Claude and Nogoa rivers, then reached the Belyando River, an upper reach of the Burdekin River. This had already been discovered by Ludwig Leichhardt on his expedition to Port Essington on 2 April 1845. Intensely mortified to find that he was on a tributary of the Burdekin River, and approaching the ground already trodden by Leichhardt, he returned to the head of the Nogoa and struck west, after dividing his party and forming a stationary camp. He continued west, making a new discovery which he was certain was the fabled north-west river. In honour of the sovereign of the time he decided to call it Victoria River. Having run out of time, he turned back towards the main party. It was here that Mitchell first noticed the well known grass that bears his name. On the homeward journey he trekked along the Maranoa River to St.George Bridge, arriving in Sydney 20 January 1847. Later that year, Kennedy proved beyond doubt that the Victoria did not continue north-west, but turned south-west and joined Cooper Creek. He renamed the watercourse the Barcoo River from a name mentioned by local Aborigines.

The air is crisp, the leaves are turning, and everyone's getting ready for Halloween. One of the most important traditions during this festive season is choosing the perfect pumpkin to bring home and adorn your doorstep. However, selecting the ideal pumpkin goes beyond just finding the right size and shape - you also want it to last throughout the season without rotting or fading. In this article, we'll cover a step-by-step process to ensure your pumpkin stays fresh and vibrant from day one. Step 1: Selecting a Pumpkin with a Long Stem The first step in preserving your pumpkin starts with the selection process. Look for a pumpkin with a long stem, as this can be indicative of a healthier and fresher pumpkin. Additionally, a longer stem can help reduce moisture loss and maintain the pumpkin's overall longevity. Step 2: Cleaning the Pumpkin with Soap and Water Once you've selected your pumpkin, it's essential to give it a thorough cleaning to remove any dirt, bacteria, or fungi that could accelerate decay. Using a mild soap and warm water, gently wash the entire surface of the pumpkin, taking special care around the stem area. Step 3: Wiping the Pumpkin Dry After ensuring your pumpkin is clean, use a soft cloth or paper towel to pat the entire surface dry. Be sure to completely dry the stem area, as any remaining moisture could promote rot and shorten the pumpkin's lifespan. Step 4: Spraying the Pumpkin with Rubbing Alcohol To further protect your pumpkin from early decay, apply a coat of rubbing alcohol to the surface. The rubbing alcohol acts as an antimicrobial agent, killing any remaining bacteria or fungi and reducing the chances of your pumpkin rotting. Step 5: Drying the Pumpkin Out over Several Weeks Before sealing the surface, it's critical to allow your pumpkin to air out and reach an ideal level of dryness. Place your pumpkin in a cool, dry area away from direct sunlight, and allow it to sit for at least two weeks or until it feels lighter in weight. This process will help draw out excess moisture and slow down the decay process. Step 6: Sealing the Surface of the Pumpkin Finally, to ensure your pumpkin remains fresh and vibrant, apply a sealant to the surface of the pumpkin. You can use a commercial pumpkin sealant or create a homemade solution using a mixture of white glue and water. Apply a thin, even layer to the entire surface, ensuring the stem area is also covered. This will lock in the moisture that remains, preventing your pumpkin from drying out too much or becoming susceptible to decay. Conclusion: By following these simple steps, you'll be well on your way to preserving your perfect pumpkin throughout the Halloween season. Remember, selecting a pumpkin with a long stem and properly cleaning, drying, and sealing it will allow you and your family to enjoy the festive spirit without worrying about your pumpkin rotting away before the big night. Happy pumpkin picking!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The dermis is the inner layer of skin. The dermis has blood vessels and nerve endings. The nerve endings explain why your skin is sensitive. You can sense pain, pressure, and temperature. You cut your finger and it starts to bleed. What has happened? If your skin bleeds, it means you have cut the dermis layer and damaged blood vessels. The cut really hurts. It hurts because of the nerve endings in this skin layer. The dermis also contains hair follicles and two types of glands. Hair follicles are structures where hairs originate. Each hair grows out of a follicle. Hair passes up through the epidermis. It then extends above the skin surface. Oil glands produce an oily substance. The oil is secreted into hair follicles.  Question: \\"Why do I bleed when I cut myself?\\" Response: \\"The dermis contains blood vessels that you damage when you cut yourself\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"Yes, the response correctly answers the question. When there is an incision or cut to the skin, if it's deep enough to penetrate through the epidermis (the outer layer of skin), it gets to the dermis, the second layer of skin, which contains blood vessels. These blood vessels are damaged by the cut, and so blood leaks out of them, causing the observed bleeding. In addition, your skin is sensitive and can sense pain due to the nerve endings present in the dermis layer. Hence, any cut or damage to this part of the skin will also be painful. The process of bleeding and the subsequent clotting forms part of the body's protective mechanism to prevent further injury as well as the invasion of harmful bacteria. Furthermore, the dermis contains other structures such as hair follicles and sebaceous (oil) glands. Hair follicles are the structures from which hair grows. The hair passes through the epidermis and goes beyond the skin surface. On the other hand, oil glands secrete an oily substance into the hair follicles. This oil not only moisturizes the skin and hair but also provides a layer of protection against harmful substances and microorganisms.  However, it's critical to take necessary precautions to avoid deep cuts and, in case they happen, to deal with them appropriately. Caring for a deep cut often involves cleaning the wound, applying an antibiotic ointment, and covering it with a clean bandage. It's also important to watch for signs of infection such as increased pain, redness, or pus. In some cases, medical attention may be necessary, for instance, when the cut is too deep (it may require stitches to help it heal), when it's caused by a rusty or dirty object (there could be a risk of tetanus), or when it doesn't stop bleeding after applying pressure for about 10 to 15 minutes. Therefore, understanding the structure of the skin, particularly the dermis, and how it reacts to injuries helps us take better care of our health."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

With the gold rush largely over by 1860, Melbourne continued to grow on the back of continuing gold mining, as the major port for exporting the agricultural products of Victoria, especially wool, and a developing manufacturing sector protected by high tariffs. An extensive radial railway network centred on Melbourne and spreading out across the suburbs and into the countryside was established from the late 1850s. Further major public buildings were begun in the 1860s and 1870s such as the Supreme Court, Government House, and the Queen Victoria Market. The central city filled up with shops and offices, workshops, and warehouses. Large banks and hotels faced the main streets, with fine townhouses in the east end of Collins Street, contrasting with tiny cottages down laneways within the blocks.

Back in the mid 1990s when I worked in Southern California, I was returning from lunch one day with a coworker when we noticed two pickup trucks driving erratically. This was on Valley View Blvd in Cerritos which is a large roadway divided (by a large, planted median strip) with 3 lanes on either side. One truck seemed to be chasing the other when suddenly the lead truck made a quick U-turn and was followed by the second truck. But the second truck came to stop just after making the turn. This was when the driver of that truck got out, walked to the front of his vehicle, raised his arm holding a semi-automatic handgun, paused, and then fired a single shot. At this point, I was parallel with the shooter’s truck and only about 50–60 feet from where he was standing. I remember my coworker exclaiming, “Oh sh*t! Did he just shoot at the something?!” I floored my accelerator and sped off to my workplace which was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd. I parked and my coworker and I got into the building as quickly as we could. While he started telling our other coworkers about what we had just witnessed, I ran to my desk, called 911, and reported the shooting. The dispatcher kept me on the line after my initial report and then transferred me to a detective in order to take down my information. As it turns out, my information and the fact that I called 911 immediately resulted in the arrest of the shooter. I was later asked to testify in court which resulted in the shooters conviction. I lived in Southern California for 10 years and now I drive a commercial truck several days a week so I have PLENTY of other “road rage stories”, but this is still the craziest one.

Alexander married twice: Roxana, daughter of the Bactrian nobleman Oxyartes, out of love; and Stateira II, a Persian princess and daughter of Darius III of Persia, for political reasons. He apparently had two sons, Alexander IV of Macedon of Roxana and, possibly, Heracles of Macedon from his mistress Barsine. He lost another child when Roxana miscarried at Babylon. Alexander also had a close relationship with his friend, general, and bodyguard Hephaestion, the son of a Macedonian noble. Hephaestion's death devastated Alexander. This event may have contributed to Alexander's failing health and detached mental state during his final months. Alexander's sexuality has been the subject of speculation and controversy. No ancient sources stated that Alexander had homosexual relationships, or that Alexander's relationship with Hephaestion was sexual. Aelian, however, writes of Alexander's visit to Troy where \\"Alexander garlanded the tomb of Achilles and Hephaestion that of Patroclus, the latter riddling that he was a beloved of Alexander, in just the same way as Patroclus was of Achilles\\". Noting that the word eromenos (ancient Greek for beloved) does not necessarily bear sexual meaning, Alexander may have been bisexual, which in his time was not controversial. Green argues that there is little evidence in ancient sources that Alexander had much carnal interest in women; he did not produce an heir until the very end of his life. However, he was relatively young when he died, and Ogden suggests that Alexander's matrimonial record is more impressive than his father's at the same age. Apart from wives, Alexander had many more female companions. Alexander accumulated a harem in the style of Persian kings, but he used it rather sparingly; showing great self-control in \\"pleasures of the body\\". Nevertheless, Plutarch described how Alexander was infatuated by Roxana while complimenting him on not forcing himself on her. Green suggested that, in the context of the period, Alexander formed quite strong friendships with women, including Ada of Caria, who adopted him, and even Darius's mother Sisygambis, who supposedly died from grief upon hearing of Alexander's death.

Kayla tried to stop Emily's nose bleed even though she was afraid of blood.","output":"Kayla tried her best to stop Emily's nose bleed even though she was deeply afraid of blood, a phobia she had struggled with since childhood. The sight of blood had always caused her pulse to race and her stomach to churn, and sometimes she would even experience light-headedness or nausea, making the situation even more difficult for her to handle. Nevertheless, in this crucial moment, Kayla's overwhelming concern for her friend's well-being enabled her to push past her own fears and focus solely on providing aid to Emily. As Emily's nose continued to bleed, Kayla quickly scanned her surroundings for any helpful items, her hands trembling slightly from the anxiety she felt. As luck would have it, she spotted a first-aid kit nearby, and without a moment's hesitation, she retrieved it and opened it to find the necessary supplies. Grabbing a handful of clean gauze, she approached Emily, her heart pounding in her chest, making it difficult to breathe. She knew that she needed to stay calm in order to properly care for her friend, so Kayla took a few deep breaths, reminding herself that Emily was relying on her. With her thoughts focused on the task at hand, she felt slightly more at ease as she approached Emily and began to gently apply pressure to her friend's nostrils using the gauze. Recalling the first-aid techniques she had learned in her health class, she instructed Emily to lean forward slightly to help prevent blood from flowing into her throat. Kayla made sure to keep her voice steady, as she didn't want Emily to sense her fear. After a few minutes, she noticed the flow of blood starting to slow down, and her anxiety lessened as a result. Sensing that her friend was experiencing a sense of discomfort, Kayla spoke soothingly to Emily, distracting her from the pain and guiding her through breathing exercises that would help reduce her blood pressure. She urged Emily to gently blow her nose once to clear out any clotted blood, then had her pinch her nostrils together while breathing through her mouth for several minutes. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the bleeding stopped, and Emily was able to remove the gauze. Kayla was filled with relief, but she knew her responsibility as a caretaker wasn't over yet. She took the time to check if Emily felt lightheaded or too weak before advising her to keep her head elevated for a while and drink some water to prevent dehydration. In the end, Kayla had conquered her fear of blood, at least this once, in order to help her friend during a moment of crisis. The experience had taught her just how strong she could be when someone she cared about needed her, and it gave her a newfound sense of confidence in handling emergency situations. Kayla realized that her phobia, while still very real and scary, could be overcome when the situation demanded it.

His family feels he should be grateful for a tedious job as an office clerk, and when he announces that he wants to become an engineer, they react with outrage. He leaves home to find work on any sort of project, but unskilled labor is plentiful and it's hard for him to find a job. Wandering and sinking into poverty, he accidentally becomes caught up in a robbery and is sentenced to ten years on a brutal Southern chain gang. He escapes and makes his way to Chicago, where he becomes a success in the construction business. He becomes involved with the proprietor of his boardinghouse, Marie Woods (Glenda Farrell), who discovers his secret and blackmails him into an unhappy marriage. He then meets and falls in love with Helen (Helen Vinson). When he asks his wife for a divorce, she betrays him to the authorities.

Why do we remember Jawahar Lal Nehru for the defeat against China, but not for the victory against Portugal, for police action in the state of Hyderabad and Junagadh or for saving 3/4th of Kashmir with India? What is Article 370 of the Constitution of India? Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"To answer these questions, I will first gather information about Jawahar Lal Nehru's role in the mentioned events, as well as Article 370 of the Constitution of India. Then, I will analyze the reasons why some of Nehru's actions are remembered differently. Finally, I will evaluate whether these questions are the same or not.  Step 1: Gather Information Jawahar Lal Nehru served as the first Prime Minister of independent India from 1947 to 1964. During his tenure, he faced various challenges, including the issues with China, Portugal, Hyderabad, Junagadh, and Kashmir. 1. Defeat against China: India faced a humiliating defeat in the 1962 Sino-Indian War under Nehru's leadership. This has left a lasting impression, and many Indians blame Nehru for India's unpreparedness and lack of military strategy. 2. Victory against Portugal: In 1961, India successfully annexed Goa, Daman and Diu, ending Portuguese colonial rule in the region. Nehru played a significant role in this event. 3. Police action in Hyderabad and Junagadh: Following India's independence, both Hyderabad and Junagadh acceded to India in 1948 after military intervention, often referred to as \\"police action.\\" This intervention led to the integration of these territories within the Indian Union. Nehru played a crucial role in these decisions. 4. Saving 3/4th of Kashmir: In 1947, when Pakistan-backed forces attempted to take control of Kashmir, Nehru took a timely decision to send Indian troops into the region, saving a significant portion of Kashmir from being occupied by Pakistan. Thus, a large part of Kashmir remained with India. 5. Article 370: It is a constitutional provision that granted special autonomy to Jammu and Kashmir, allowing the state to have its own constitution, flag, and control over various administrative matters. The article was designed to respect the unique conditions and history of the region. It was abrogated in 2019. Step 2: Analyze Reasons for Differences in Remembrance 1. The defeat against China had a higher impact on the psyche of the Indian population than the other events. Losing a war to a neighboring nation, especially a growing superpower like China, tends to be remembered more prominently in public memory. 2. Successes such as the victory against Portugal or the police action in Hyderabad and Junagadh are sometimes overshadowed by failures. Portugal was a relatively weaker opponent compared to China, and integrating princely states into the Indian Union was a relatively smooth process compared to the territorial disputes with a major power like China. 3. The India-China conflict remains an ongoing issue, while the issues with Portugal, Hyderabad, and Junagadh have been resolved. This means that the 1962 defeat still resonates in the current political climate. Step 3: Evaluate if Questions are the Same These questions are not the same as they address different aspects of Jawahar Lal Nehru's political career and decisions. The first question is about the public perception of Nehru's actions in various territorial conflicts, while the second question asks about the specifics of Article 370 of the Indian Constitution. However, both questions are related in that they pertain to different aspects of the history of modern India and the political decisions made during Nehru's tenure."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I found the following answer on Google: The tar coating is applied in one or more coats as a hot liquid, heated in a tar kettle , or as sheets of tar impregnated 'paper' glued down and sealed together at joints by hot tar - once it has cooled, the gravel is spread evenly over it. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"No, the answer provided does not directly address the question on the lifespan of a flat membrane roof. To answer your original question, the lifespan of a flat membrane roof varies depending on the type of membrane material used, installation quality, and maintenance. There are different types of membrane materials commonly used for flat roofs, including: 1. TPO (Thermoplastic Olefin) - These roofs typically last around 22-30 years. 2. PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) - PVC roofs have an estimated lifespan of 20-25 years. 3. EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) - EPDM rubber roofing systems can last around 20-25 years, with some lasting up to 30 years with proper maintenance. The longevity of a flat membrane roof depends on regular maintenance, inspections, and timely repairs. Additionally, various external factors, such as weather conditions, uv exposure, and mechanical damage, can impact the lifespan. To summarize, a flat membrane roof can last anywhere between 20-30 years, depending on the type of membrane material, installation quality, and maintenance practices. The answer you initially found discussed the installation process of a built-up roofing system (using tar and gravel), which is different from a single-ply membrane roofing system."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Facts:     - birth date: 7 june 1942    - name: elizabeth counsell    - birth place: windsor , berkshire , england    - occupation: stage , film and television actress   Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of elizabeth counsell .

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person that the band that released an album in 1983 did not choose to use for the cover design?  In 1982, Waters suggested a new musical project with the working title Spare Bricks, originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall. With the onset of the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire. Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album. With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure. Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself. Released in March 1983, The Final Cut went straight to number one in the UK and number six in the US. Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the music on the album. Gilmour did not have any material ready for the album and asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused. Gilmour later commented: \\"I'm certainly guilty at times of being lazy ... but he wasn't right about wanting to put some duff tracks on The Final Cut.\\" Rolling Stone magazine gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder calling it \\"a superlative achievement ... art rock's crowning...

Blues rock acts that pioneered the sound included Cream, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, and The Jeff Beck Group. Cream, in songs like \\"I Feel Free\\" (1966) combined blues rock with pop and psychedelia, particularly in the riffs and guitar solos of Eric Clapton. Jimi Hendrix produced a form of blues-influenced psychedelic rock, which combined elements of jazz, blues and rock and roll. From 1967 Jeff Beck brought lead guitar to new heights of technical virtuosity and moved blues rock in the direction of heavy rock with his band, The Jeff Beck Group. Dave Davies of The Kinks, Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones, Pete Townshend of The Who, Hendrix, Clapton and Beck all pioneered the use of new guitar effects like phasing, feedback and distortion.

All is going as planned until Connie's sister, Kate, her investment broker husband, Roman Craig, and their twin daughters, Mara and Cara, crash the vacation. Ghost stories at the family BBQ include one of a man-eating grizzly bear that Chet met face-to-face when he was younger. Chet says that while he and Connie were honeymooning at the same lake, he was attacked by a giant grizzly bear. When he fired at it with a shotgun, the buckshot shaved the hair off the top of the bear's head and from that day on, it was known as the \\"Bald-Headed Bear\\" of Claire County.

And the answer is...","output":"To solve the equation 28*n + 88 - 148 - 108 = 0 for n, we will follow these steps: 1. Simplify the equation:    Combine all the constants on the left side of the equation.    28*n + (88 - 148 - 108) = 0 2. Calculate the sum of the constants:    88 - 148 - 108 = -60 - 108 = -168 3. Rewrite the equation with the simplified constants:    28*n - 168 = 0 4. Isolate the variable n by moving the constant to the other side of the equation:    28*n = 168 5. Divide both sides of the equation by 28 to solve for n:    n = 168 / 28 6. Simplify the division:    n = 6 So the solution to the equation 28*n + 88 - 148 - 108 = 0 is n = 6."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I can use this background: One of the most adverse impacts of poor waste management, especially municipal waste, is the incidence and prevalence of diseases such as malaria and respiratory problems, as well as other illnesses through the contamination of ground water. Biomedical wastes pose great danger in Bangladesh too as a report estimated that 20% of the biomedical waste is \\"highly infectious\\" and is a hazard since it is often disposed of into the sewage system or drains.[6]  Such poor sanitation has serious consequences for the health of the residents and a report suggests that \\"most of the child mortality could be related with this problem\\".[7]  With regards to the living standards, solid waste leads to blockage in the drainage system which leads to flooding in the streets. Consequently, mosquitoes and bad odour are among the negative impacts resulted.[7]  Now, I have a new situation: Town A disposed of the biomedical waste from their hospital conventionally in a regular dump site for 10 years because it was more convenient, while town B took them to an ecological site where they wouldn't affect ground water and spread disease.

And the answer is?","output":"Sir John Sholto Douglas, the 8th Marquess of Queensberry, is most famously connected with the sport of boxing. Born on July 20, 1844, in Florence, Italy, Douglas had a long and varied career in British politics and sports. However, his most impactful and lasting contributions were in the realm of boxing, which made him an influential figure in the popularization and standardization of the sport. Douglas is best known for his role in the development of the Marquess of Queensberry Rules, which were first published in 1867 and are still used to govern modern boxing today. The rules, named after him, brought numerous significant changes and advancements to the sport, transforming it from a rather brutal and disorganized fighting style into a legitimate and structured sport. The Marquess of Queensberry Rules are a set of twelve guidelines that detail various aspects of boxing conduct, including the ring's dimensions, the proper use of gloves, the length of rounds, and what constituted a legal punch. These rules were instrumental in creating a safer and more standardized sport, eliminating some of the more hazardous and unsavory practices that had previously been associated with boxing. Some of the key components of the Marquess of Queensberry Rules are as follows: 1. The use of gloves: The rules required boxers to wear padded gloves to protect their hands and soften blows, reducing the risk of severe injury. 2. Three-minute rounds: Each round would last three minutes, with one-minute breaks between rounds. 3. Knockdowns: A fighter who was knocked down had ten seconds to regain their feet. Failure to do so resulted in a loss. 4. Fouls: The rules established what constituted a foul, such as striking below the belt, headbutting, or using elbows. Committing a foul could lead to disqualification. 5. No wrestling or grappling: Unlike earlier bare-knuckle fights, the Marquess of Queensberry Rules stated that boxing should be focused on striking, not wrestling or grappling. 6. Referee supervision: The rules established the role of a referee to enforce the regulations, ensure fair play and sportsmanship, and make decisions regarding fouls or other disputes that might arise during a match. In summary, Sir John Sholto Douglas, the 8th Marquess of Queensberry, is indelibly connected with the sport of boxing. Through his patronage and promotion of the Marquess of Queensberry Rules, he played a pivotal role in transforming boxing into the organized and regulated sport it is today. His legacy within the sport is a testament to his lasting impact on boxing's continued growth and success."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

There are no special celebrations for these birthdays, but each is a time when a person can do new things to mark their transition  into adulthood. After turning sixteen a person can work, get a driver's license and leave home. Many high school students learn to drive and get part-time jobs soon after celebrating their sixteenth birthday. At the age of eighteen a person in the United States can vote and smoke, but they are prohibited from going into nightclubs, buying wine or gambling  until they are twenty-one. In many Latin  cultures, a young woman's fifteenth birthday is important. At this age, she is regarded as an adult. To mark this special day, families with teenage daughters have a celebration called a Quinceanera. The day begins with the young woman and her family going to church. Later, there is a party and many guests are invited. In Japan, young people became adults at twenty. At this age, they can legally  vote, drink wine and smoke. The second Monday in January is a national holiday called \\"Coming of Age Day\\". On this day, twenty-year-old celebrates by first going to church to pray with their families. Later, they listen to speeches given by city and school leaders. Afterward, they may celebrate with family or friends late into the night. In some countries, birthday celebrations continue through adulthood. Some people celebrate their fortieth and fiftieth birthdays, or their retirement  year, with a huge party. In the United States, age sixteen marks the time when you can    _   . A) vote and drive B) drive and get a job C) drink wine and smoke D) go into nightclubs A:","output":"In the United States, age sixteen marks the time when you can drive and get a job (option B). Turning sixteen is often seen as a significant milestone in a person's life because it is associated with several new privileges and responsibilities. At this age, teenagers can legally apply for a driver's license, allowing them to operate a motor vehicle, giving them a newfound sense of independence and freedom. This can be very exciting for many teenagers since it means they no longer need to rely on their parents or public transportation to go to school, work, or social events. Additionally, at the age of sixteen, young people can start working and earning money in many states. This also adds to their sense of independence, as it allows them to contribute to their expenses, save money, or buy things that interest them. They can get part-time jobs, which can provide valuable work experience and help them develop a strong work ethic. Of course, the specific rules and regulations regarding employment may vary depending on the state they are in, but generally, sixteen-year-olds can engage in some form of legal employment. On the other hand, the other activities mentioned in the question (voting, drinking, smoking, and entering nightclubs) are reserved for older individuals. At the age of eighteen, a person gains the right to vote and smoke, while consuming alcohol and entering nightclubs are typically permitted only once they turn twenty-one. In summary, turning sixteen in the United States is associated with the ability to drive and get a job. This marks an important transitional period as young individuals start gaining independence and responsibility, setting the stage for their growth into adulthood."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Great MP3, When it Works Review: I've had this MP3 since Xmas 05. It gave me trouble initially then the problem went away. Since July it hasn't worked for more than a few hours, despite Cowon's several attempts to fix it. This is the third, or maybe now it's the 4th?, time that the sound on my 20 GB iAudio X5 has cut out. Cowon just returned it to me again a couple of weeks or so ago. The screen shows that the song is playing - it's just that no sound comes out. Besides this problem it also has an annoying problem of repeating songs when the setting is set not to repeat. This is a quibble, however, that one can live with. Given the problems I'm having with it I considered rating it a 1 star except that when the sound does work it is really good.

A: Answer:","output":"d). mosses. A: Bryophyta is the formal taxonomic name for the phylum that consists solely of mosses. Mosses are small, non-vascular plants that belong to the division Bryophyta within the plant kingdom. These plants are characterized by their lack of roots, stems, and leaves, as well as their preference for damp, shady habitats. It is important to note that the term \\"Bryophyte\\" is often used informally to include not just mosses, but also liverworts (division Marchantiophyta) and hornworts (division Anthocerotophyta). However, in a formal taxonomic sense, Bryophyta refers only to mosses. There are approximately 12,000 species of mosses found worldwide, and they play a significant role in the ecology of various ecosystems. Mosses are primary producers, meaning they create their own food through photosynthesis, and they also serve as a source of water, shelter, and food for other organisms in their environment. Mosses reproduce both sexually and asexually, and they exhibit a two-phased life cycle called alternation of generations. The dominant, recognizable form of a moss is the gametophyte stage, which bears the reproductive structures called gametangia. The sporophyte stage, which produces spores through meiosis, is physically dependent on the gametophyte and is less conspicuous in most moss species. Some common examples of mosses include the peat moss (Sphagnum spp.), which plays a vital role in the formation of peat bogs and has important applications for humans, such as fuel, horticulture, and water filtration; and the haircap moss (Polytrichum spp.), which forms dense colonies on the ground in a variety of habitats. In summary, the formal taxonomic name for the phylum consisting solely of mosses is Bryophyta. These small, non-vascular plants are significant ecologically and can be found across the globe in various environments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: I have another guest post for you today. This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin.  After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. Question: How long does a mud mask or facial mask probably have to be applied? Options: - for a few hours   - for a few minutes   - not enough information   - for a few days === The correct answer is Answer:","output":"for a few minutes"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Process:  - Water in the clouds becomes very cold - The cold water forms ice crystals - The ice crystals grow by absorbing surrounding water droplets - Form snowflakes - The snowflakes fall to the ground.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose it is night happens, how will it affect more water in the clouds freezes.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"To evaluate the perturbation hypothesis, we need to consider the effects of the \\"night\\" condition on the process of snowflake formation. Let's go step-by-step: 1. Water in the clouds becomes very cold: The temperature at higher altitudes (where clouds form) primarily depends on factors such as altitude itself, geographical location, and weather patterns, rather than the day-night cycle alone. However, night conditions may cause slightly lower temperatures compared to daytime, which could contribute to the water in the clouds becoming colder. 2. The cold water forms ice crystals: As the water in the clouds becomes colder, it is more likely for ice crystals to form. As stated in step 1, night conditions could contribute to slightly lower temperatures, potentially leading to a higher likelihood of ice crystal formation. 3. The ice crystals grow by absorbing surrounding water droplets: This process depends on the availability of water droplets and the temperature conditions in the cloud. If there are sufficient water droplets and the temperature is low enough, the ice crystals will continue to grow. Night conditions, with the potential for slightly lower temperatures, might influence this step somewhat indirectly, but the primary factors remain the overall atmospheric conditions in the cloud. 4. Ice crystals form snowflakes: The growth of ice crystals leads to the formation of snowflakes. The direct relation between night conditions and this process is minimal, as it is primarily influenced by the temperature and crystal growth conditions in the cloud, regardless of the time of day. 5. Snowflakes fall to the ground: The falling of snowflakes is influenced by factors such as the weight of the snowflakes, air currents, and temperature variations between the cloud and ground levels. Night conditions do not have a direct influence on this process, as the primary driving factors are based on the overall atmospheric conditions, rather than the time of day. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of \\"night\\" conditions may have a minimal indirect effect on the snowflake formation process, primarily due to the potential for slightly lower temperatures at night, which can contribute to water in the clouds becoming colder and promote the formation of ice crystals. However, it is important to note that the process of snowflake formation relies heavily on the overall atmospheric conditions, so the night conditions alone do not determine the outcome of this process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Open carry of a handgun in public had long been illegal in Texas, except when the carrier was on property he/she owned or had lawful control over, was legally hunting, or was participating in some gun-related public event such as a gun show. However, the 2015 Texas Legislature passed a bill to allow concealed handgun permit holders to begin carrying handguns openly.

A License to Carry (LTC) is still required to carry a handgun openly or concealed in public.","output":"Yes, based on the text provided, it is true that you can carry a gun in Texas without a license under certain circumstances and conditions. However, there are specific rules and limitations regarding both the type of firearm and the manner in which it is carried. Firstly, the text explains that there is no legal statute prohibiting the carry of a firearm other than a handgun. This means that carrying firearms like pre-1899 black powder weapons and their replicas are not considered illegal in Texas, as they are not categorized as firearms under Texas law. However, there are some restrictions when carrying firearms in public. If a firearm is displayed in a manner that is \\"calculated to cause alarm,\\" this would be considered \\"disorderly conduct\\" and is not allowed. Regarding open carry of handguns in public, Texas law has undergone changes in recent years. Historically, it was illegal to have an openly carried handgun in public except for when the carrier was on property they owned or had legal control over, they were legally hunting, or they were participating in certain gun-related public events such as gun shows.  In 2015, the Texas Legislature passed a bill allowing concealed handgun permit holders to carry handguns openly. The bill was signed into law on June 13, 2015, and came into effect on January 1, 2016. However, it is important to note that a License to Carry (LTC) is still required to carry a handgun openly or concealed in public in Texas. This means that, despite the changes in the law, a license is still necessary for carrying a handgun in public, whether it is carried openly or concealed. In summary, based on the provided text, it is true that you can carry certain firearms in Texas without a license, but there are specific limitations depending on the type of firearm and the manner in which it is carried.

Plot title: Corso: The Last Beat Movie plot: The Beat Generationâs Gregory Corso became one of four in the inner circle of the Beats, along with Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs. Corso grew up in foster homes, on the streets of Little Italy and Greenwich Village. Corso was sentenced to Clinton State Prison for stealing a 50 suit to go on a date; there, protected by Mafia inmates, Corso read his way through a three-year sentence and ended up at Harvard. He eventually met Allen Ginsberg at a dyke bar in the West Village. After Allen Ginsbergâs death, Corso goes \\"On the Road\\" to rediscover his creative Muse. From Paris to Venice, Rome to Athens, Mount Parnassus to Jim Morrisonâs grave, Corso reflects on the early days of \\"Beats.\\" In high humor he reveals how \\"The Beats\\" emerged in Europe, and paved the way for youth culture, the sexual revolution and even hip-hop. Corso interrupts his tour to revisit Clinton State Prison and inspire young inmates. Returning to Italy, Corso muses on his lost mother, who he believes is dead and buried in Italy. In a stunning discovery, filmmaker Gustave Reininger finds Corso's mother not dead in Italy, but alive in Trenton, N.J. Corso meets his mother on film and discovers she is the Muse he has been seeking. He also discovers that his mother left him to escape the violence and sexual abuse of his father, who lied saying she had returned to Italy. Healing from a life of abandonment, emotional deprivation and abuse, Corso finishes his road trip on the Acropolis in Greece.A revitalized Corso returns to Greenwich Village, only to discover he is dying.

Guttermouth is an American punk rock band formed in 1988 in Huntington Beach, California and currently recording for Rude Records/Bird Attack Records. They have released nine full-length studio albums and two live albums and have toured extensively, including performances on the Vans Warped Tour. They are infamous for their outrageous lyrics and behavior which are deliberately explicit, offensive and intended to shock, though usually in a humorous and sarcastic manner. This behavior has sometimes resulted in high-profile problems for the band, such as being banned from performing in Canada for eighteen months and leaving the 2004 Warped Tour amidst controversy over their political views and attitudes towards other performers. The following year found the band returning home to California and experiencing a lineup change. Clint Weinrich married in the spring of 1995, and to fill in for him on a European tour the band recruited Steve \\"Stever\\" Rapp, a college friend of Nunn's who was playing in a band called The Grabbers. Things worked out well with Rapp on this tour and he soon became the band's permanent bass player. The new lineup entered the studio and recorded their third album Teri Yakimoto. By all accounts the recording process was plagued with problems, and at one point most of the recordings were scrapped and re-recorded with a new producer. The result was an album that continued the fast and sarcastic Guttermouth tradition but was more melodic and pop-influenced than their previous albums. The band continued to tour and expand their fan base, and filmed a music video for the song \\"Whiskey.\\" With their popularity growing Nitro Records re-released Full Length in CD format with bonus tracks under the title The Album Formerly Known as Full Length LP.  In 1997 the band recorded Musical Monkey, an album which captured their chaotic energy and sharp sense of humor. It is considered by many to be the best representation of their \\"classic\\" sound, and songs such as \\"Lucky the Donkey,\\" \\"Do the Hustle,\\" \\"Lipstick\\" and \\"Perfect World\\" became staples in their live set. The following year they released Live From the Pharmacy, a recording of a live show from 1994 that also included four new songs engineered by Vandals guitarist Warren Fitzgerald and liner notes written by Nunn recounting the band's history. In 1998 Guttermouth was banned from performing in Canada for one year on charges of public indecency after Adkins exposed himself onstage in Saskatoon. According to Adkins: \\"oh, I was guilty [...] What I would do is grab two young girls out of the audience and I would have them hold up this sheet in front of me, and Jamie, the drummer at the time, would say this magical incantation, if you will, and I would be standing there stark naked.\\" Combined with a drunk driving charge from the United States, the incident led Adkins to be arrested on immigration charges, detained for five days, and then deported, though Guttermouth would return to Canada a few years later. After obtaining a full pardon from the Canadian judicial system known as the crown. No record remains on file.  Rapp left the band in 1999, at which point Nunn moved from drums to bass and new drummer William \\"Ty\\" Smith was brought in. That year the band recorded and released Gorgeous, their most aggressive album to date and their final album for Nitro. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What was this albums problem","output":"The question refers to Guttermouth's third album, Teri Yakimoto. According to the information provided, the album's recording process was plagued with problems.

Write an article with the title: \\"World Cup turns sour for African teams, vuvuzelas prove unpopular\\"","output":"Step 1: Begin with an engaging introduction that provides context about the World Cup and African teams' performance in it, and introduces the unpopularity of vuvuzelas. Title: World Cup Turns Sour for African Teams, Vuvuzelas Prove Unpopular Introduction: The FIFA World Cup represents a festivity of diverse cultures and a celebration of the beautiful game of football across the globe. However, the dream for African teams to shine on the international stage has turned into a bitter disappointment at this year's tournament. With traditionally strong African contenders like Nigeria and Cameroon already knocked out, their fans are left to rue their misfortunes. Amidst this disappointment, even the highly-anticipated and culturally iconic vuvuzelas have lost their charm among football enthusiasts.  Step 2: Discuss the performance of African teams in the tournament, including their strengths and weaknesses. African Teams' Performance: The hopes of African teams had been high prior to the tournament, with young and talented players emerging and experienced veterans forming the backbone of the squads. Yet, despite their potentials, a series of unfavorable results, underwhelming performances, and sometimes controversial decisions have conspired against their success. Ivory Coast, for example, saw their chances shattered by a last-minute penalty awarded to their opponents, while Senegal missed out on the knockout stage due to FIFA's fair-play rule. Collectively, these incidents not only mark a setback for African football, but also cast a shadow over the prospects of future World Cups. Step 3: Address the decline in popularity of vuvuzelas and give reasons for the discontent. Vuvuzelas Lose their Appeal: For many, the distinct buzzing sound of the vuvuzela had once been synonymous with passionate African football fandom. However, the instrument has now become an irritant to fans and players alike. Several factors appear to be contributing to this decline in popularity, one of which is simply the annoyance caused by their continuous noise. Complaints amongst fans indicate that the sound produced by vuvuzelas tends to drown out chants, songs, and conversations that would typically enrich the stadium atmosphere. Additionally, medical experts have highlighted the possible harm these horns can inflict on individuals' hearing. The prolonged exposure to the high-intensity noise generated by vuvuzelas can result in temporary and even permanent hearing loss. This revelation has led to a decline in their usage, as the once vibrant symbol of African football slowly fades into memory. Step 4: Conclude the article by emphasizing the current situation and future expectations for African football and the fate of vuvuzelas. Conclusion: As the World Cup continues without the presence of fan-favorite African teams, their supporters are left with a sense of dismay and dejection. This, coupled with the growing unpopularity of the once-celebrated vuvuzelas, only adds to the cumulative sense of disappointment surrounding this year's tournament. However, the resilience and spirit of African football offers hope that both the teams and their fans will learn from this adversity and return stronger in future World Cup campaigns. It remains to be seen whether the same can be said for the vuvuzelas, or if their decline signifies the end of an era for this once ubiquitous symbol of African football."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As workers at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant continue to fight off a nuclear meltdown, G-7 countries have united to help stave off economic disaster. The group of seven industrialized countries agreed to intervene in currency markets for the first time in more than a decade to prevent the yen from rising further after it hit a record high earlier this week. In a statement released by the European Central Bank, the G-7 said its actions were \\"at the request of the Japanese authorities,\\" adding that \\" .\\" Japan's central bank has pledged to adopt strategies for \\"powerful monetary easing.\\" Exporters benefited from the decline in the yen. Lower yen valuations increase the amount companies earn selling merchandise abroad, since they end up with more yen once they repatriate profits.

Translate to English","output":"Can investment be a useful component of the \\"Aid for Trade\\" program? Investment can undoubtedly be a useful component of the \\"Aid for Trade\\" program. Aid for Trade is an initiative launched by the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2005, aimed at helping developing countries better integrate into the global trading system, build trade capacity, and support economic growth. As such, investment can play a crucial role in achieving these objectives and contribute to the success of the Aid for Trade program. Below are some reasons why investment is essential for this program: 1. Infrastructure development: A critical aspect of increasing trade capacity and competitiveness in developing countries is improving their infrastructure. Investment in transportation, communication, and energy sectors can significantly enhance a country's ability to integrate with global markets, reduce trade costs, and increase exports. These improvements can result from investments made by both the private and public sectors, including foreign direct investments (FDI) and public-private partnerships (PPP). 2. Access to finance: Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are crucial players in developing countries' trade and economic growth. However, they often face difficulties accessing affordable finance to expand their businesses or penetrate foreign markets. Investment funds or concessional loans from development banks or institutions can increase their access to finance and boost trade activities. 3. Technology transfer and innovation: Investment can facilitate the transfer of technology and know-how between developed and developing countries. This technology transfer can lead to the adoption of new production methods, increased productivity, and the ability to produce higher-value goods and services. Investing in innovation and research and development (R&D) programs can also support the creation of new products or the improvement of existing ones, increasing a country's competitiveness on the global stage. 4. Employment generation and skills development: Investment can foster job creation and contribute to poverty reduction, especially when it is directed toward sectors with high labor-intensity. Moreover, indirect employment effects of investment can lead to positive spillovers in the local economy. Investing in education and skills development can enhance the human capital of developing countries, improve employability in higher-value sectors, and support sustainable development. 5. Attraction of additional resources: Investment can act as a catalyst to mobilize additional financial resources and attract further investments. By demonstrating their commitment to developing countries through Aid for Trade investments, donor countries can encourage other international actors and the private sector to get involved and contribute to the development process. In turn, this can increase support and funding for a wide range of trade-related projects and initiatives. In summary, investment is undoubtedly a useful component of the \\"Aid for Trade\\" program, as it can contribute to infrastructure development, better access to finance, technology transfer and innovation, employment generation, and skills development. By carefully targeting and coordinating investments, Aid for Trade can maximize its impact and help developing countries better integrate into the global trading system and promote sustainable economic growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively.

There are several reasons for this conclusion: 1. Incorrect product shipped: The reviewer clearly states that they received the wrong product (a Motorola Rocker BT50 cell phone battery) instead of the Jabra BT8010 Bluetooth Mono/Stereo Headset with the attachable speaker. This indicates a lack of quality control or possible errors in the shipping process, which would be a concern for any potential buyer. 2. Inaccurate product description and image: The reviewer mentions that the product description on the page is incorrect, and the image shows the battery that they received instead of the headset. This casts doubt on the accuracy of the information provided for the product and makes it difficult for potential buyers to trust the listing. 3.

Hotels: a Much Higher Minimum Wage Nine months into a minimum wage hike at some Los Angeles hotels, city leaders and other backers of the move are claiming victory, saying doomsday forecasts from hoteliers have proven unfounded. Confined to about 15 of the city’s largest non-union hotels and accounting for more than a fifth of all its hotel rooms, the increase was aimed at the segment of the service economy that city leaders saw as best equipped to absorb the extra cost. Hoteliers say full data are not yet in and some layoffs have taken place, but champions of the raise say that the naysayers’ concerns appear to have been overblown. “There have not been the wholesale layoffs or cutbacks that we were told would occur,” said Los Angeles City Councilman Curren Price, who co-authored the wage hike ordinance. The pay rise for a small slice of an industry gives an early if limited glimpse into the drive for a 15 minimum wage, gathering pace in states from New York to the West Coast. The federal minimum wage has been stuck at 7.25/hour since 2009. A phased statewide raise to 15, ultimately affecting 5.6 million workers, was approved by the California legislature last week and Governor Jerry Brown, a Democrat, is expected to sign it into law on Monday. Oregon Passes a Law Giving It the Nation’s Highest Minimum Wage Pushing wages to just over 15 from as low as 9 an hour for an estimated 3,000 hotel workers began last summer as the first phase of a hike for the second-largest U.S. city, largely run by Democrats. It affects about 8,000 rooms, or half of Los Angeles’ large-hotel room inventory. Hotel operators had warned the hike would force them to cut staff and services, put the brakes on new hotel projects and would drive away customers. Because of the increase, Julie Robey, a general manager at the Holiday Inn IHG Los Angeles Gateway, south of downtown, said she had to lay off seven employees, cutting her staff to 95 full and part-time workers. Robert Amano, executive director of the Hotel Association of Los Angeles, which opposed the increase, said the hike has led to some job cuts, but that an overall tally is not available. Many hotels have chosen to absorb the increase by upping restaurant food prices by 15 to 30%, he said. And he warned that smaller hotels, which do not have the same profit cushion, could face bigger challenges when they have to implement the increase this summer. For more on hotels, watch our video: Raising the minimum wage is a key issue for contenders in the November U.S. presidential election, addressing a movement led by labor unions to provide better living standards for the working poor. Democratic hopefuls Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are avid supporters. Republican front-runner and businessman Donald Trump, who owns hotels, has said U.S. wages in general are too low—but also that it is not necessarily bad to have a low minimum wage in order to compete in a global marketplace. L.A. city leaders appear to have picked the right moment for their experiment. An improving economy has helped buoy L.A. hotel occupancy rates to an all-time high, blunting the effect of the wage rise on the bottom line, hotel industry officials said. “When demand is high and you’re running busy, you don’t want to cut staff,” Amano said. More than two dozen new hotel projects are in the works, the biggest hotel development boom in Los Angeles since the 1980s, said Bruce Baltin, senior vice president at PKF Consulting, which provides analysis to the hotel industry. “Fortunately, the industry in Los Angeles is very healthy right now,” Baltin said.

We are surrounded by mixed messages about mistakes: we're told we earn by making them, but we work hard to avoid them. So the result is that most of us know that we are going to make mistakes, but deep down, we feel we shouldn't. Experiments with schoolchildren who did well on a given test show that those who were praised for being smart and then offered a more challenging or less challenging task afterward usually chose the easier one. On the other hand, children praised for trying hard-rather than being smart-far more often selected the more difficult task. If we try hard to avoid mistakes, we aren't open to getting the information we need in order to do better. In a writing study, experiments showed that those who are so scared to make mistakes perform worse in writing tasks than those who aren't as worried about being perfect. They fear receiving any kind of negative feedback, so they don't learn where they went wrong and how to get better. We don't just learn more when we're open to mistakes, we learn deeper. Research tells us that if we're only concerned about getting the right answer, we don't always learn the underlying concepts that help us truly understand whatever we're trying to figure out. Mistakes need to be seen not as a failure to learn, but as a guide to what still needs to be learned.

Context: I saw one last night on an episode of Designated Survivor. To qualify this, I’m not normally bothered by product placements. Sometimes they can even add to the scene. But this one was bad, really bad. Agent is busy hunting for baddies. Finishes questioning one naughty person who climbs in his Ford F150 and speeds off. So far, so good - it is the sort of vehicle a country-living billionaire bad-guy would drive. The agent then pulls out her phone and… Move to close up of phone screen showing Ford app already loaded (and screen unlocked!). Agent slowly moves finger to app. Does something. Pause as app does fancy graphics. Cut to car interior. Shot of dash, showing Ford logo on steering wheel. It’s bright blue - are they not normally grey or more subtle? Pause for a second… Zoom in on dash. Dash light up. Car starts. Show pretty dash lights for a second or so. Cut to agent Agent walks to car, gets in drives off. Lingering shot of rear of car. It was just so clumsy. Massive halt to the flow of the scene to show it. In most films you never see anyone starting cars, putting on seatbelts or similar unless this is part of the plot because it’s unnecessary and not interesting to watch. I sort of expected the remote start function to have some sort of relevance later… but no, it was totally ignored. Added to that: There was no password or security on her phone - and this is an agent investigating super secret stuff. If you don’t show her unlocking the phone, why show her lovingly prodding the app? They are as relevant. She unlocked and started the car while she was 20–30 paces away, on the grounds of a suspect ranch. Someone could easily have jumped in the car. Not very security conscious. Question: Why did the dash light up and the pretty dash lights showed for a second or so? Options:  A. because there was no password  B. because the agent walked to the car  C. because the car started  D. not enough information The answer is:","output":"C. because the car started The dash light and the pretty dash lights showed for a second or so because the car started. In the context provided, it was described that after the agent manipulated the Ford app on her phone, there was a cut to the car's interior where the dash lights lit up. Typically in vehicles, when the car engine is started, the dashboard lights up as part of its system check and to provide relevant information to the driver. This includes details about the vehicle's speed, fuel level, engine temperature and functionalities of other car systems. In this scene, the dashboard illumination was used as a visual cue to indicate that the car's engine was started remotely using the Ford app by the agent. This entire sequence is heavily suggestive of product placement for Ford, particularly showcasing the Ford app's remote start feature. However, it doesn't seem to contribute much to the plot of the episode, as per the provided context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A man accused of beheading a Topeka resident with a guitar string has pleaded innocent to premeditated first-degree murder. Police say 29-year-old James Paul Harris practiced voodoo and kept the head of 49-year-old James Gerety to talk to after the March or April 2011 killing. The Topeka Capital-Journal reports that Gerety's partial remains were found a year later in Carbondale, 18 miles south of Topeka. Decapitation charge: James Paul Harris, left, is escorted from the Osage County Courthouse in Lyndon, Kansas last month for a court appearance after being accused of beheading James Gerety with a guitar string three years ago. Harris' former girlfriend testified in March that he told her he used a guitar string to sever Gerety's head. She said he disposed of the body but kept the head in a bag. A Topeka police officer said the ex-girlfriend told him Harris practiced voodoo and that he liked to talk to the head. A judge on Monday set Harris' trial for June 23. Thomas Henderson, an attorney who handled Gerety's Social Security. payments, testified at the March hearing that he reported Gerety missing. in April 2011 after he failed to pick up his payments. Henderson said. Gerety planned to live with Harris in Carbondale, 18 miles south of. Topeka. Dressed in a bright orange jumpsuit, Harris appeared in court under heavy guard for the 30 minute hearing - six Osage County sheriff deputies watched him sat with his two attorneys. He is charged with the premeditated first-degree murder of James Gerety, who authorities believe was killed between March 3, 2011 and April 20, 2011. On March 14 in a pre-trial hearing, former girlfriend, Bobbie Williams testified that Harris told her he killed Gerety using a guitar string, disposed of the body, but kept the head in a bag for himself. Murdered: Harris is charged with the premeditated first-degree murder in the death of James Gerety, (pictured) who died in March or April of 2011. Another witness at that hearing, Topeka police Detective Brian Hill said that during questioning after his arrest, Harris told him that he kept the victim's head in a canvas bag with a draw string. Hill testified that Harris spoke to the head, and had an active interest in voodoo and practiced it. According to Harris' former girlfriend, Harris told her that he had shot the victim in the stomach and then tortured him for two days at their Topeka house. After he had finished with his brutal treatment of Gerety, Harris then decapitated him with the string, according to Williams' testimony. Then, Harris is said to have put Gerety's torso, arms and legs in a barrel and burried it on land owned by his father, Jeff Harris in Osage County. Harris' girlfriend testified in March that he said he severed Gerety's head with a guitar string. A Topeka police officer testified that he was told Harris kept the head so he could talk to it as part of a voodoo ritual. Williams testified in court that she saw Gerety's head once, but then claimed later on that she was mistaken. She did tell the court that Harris kept a voodoo doll named 'Jimbo', 'Bob on the Hill' and 'Poor Jimbo Bolinsky'. The doll hung from the ceiling in their apartment. Gerety's skull was recovered on March 24, 2012, at Jeff Harris' home by his girlfriend, Shirley Johnson. She had been on the hunt for mushrooms when she found a ball barely buried and brought it inside to show Harris' father, who promptly called the police and his son was arrested. Harris was in federal custody on unrelated charges when a warrant was. issued in October 2013 and he was placed on hold for Kansas authorities. In January, Harris filed a request to have the hold resolved and he was. booked into the Osage County jail in March for court proceedings.

First, let's combine the terms with 'w' on both sides of the equation. On the left side, we have two terms with 'w': 262w and -136w. Combining them, we get: 262w - 136w = 126w So the equation becomes: 126w - 10 = 128w 2. Now, we want to get all the terms with 'w' on one side of the equation and the constant terms on the other side. To do this, we can subtract 126w from both sides of the equation: 128w - 126w = 10 Simplifying this expression, we get: 2w = 10 3. Finally, to solve for 'w', we need to isolate it by dividing both sides of the equation by 2: 2w / 2 = 10 / 2 w = 5 So, the solution to this math problem is w = 5. When w = 5, the equation 262w - 136w - 10 = 128w holds true."},{"instruction":"Given the question: What key details about harold a. ackerman  can be extracted from the following bio?

These devices had a low operating speed and were eventually superseded by much faster all-electric computers, originally using vacuum tubes. The Z2, created by German engineer Konrad Zuse in 1939, was one of the earliest examples of an electromechanical relay computer. Question: Who created the relay computer, the Z2?","output":"The Z2, one of the earliest examples of an electromechanical relay computer, was created by German engineer Konrad Zuse in 1939. Konrad Zuse was a visionary inventor who played an essential role in the development of early computers. Born on June 22, 1910, in Berlin, Germany, Zuse studied civil engineering at the Technical University of Berlin-Charlottenburg and later became a pioneer in the field of computer engineering. The Z2 was Zuse's second attempt at developing a computing machine, following the Z1, which he built in his parents’ living room from 1936 to 1938. As an electromechanical device, the Z2 used electric switches and mechanical relays to process calculations. Although these machines had relatively low operating speeds, they laid the foundation for the development of more advanced computing technology. The Z2 specifically served as a prototype for Zuse's later inventions, such as the Z3 and Z4. Electromechanical relay computers, including the Z2, were eventually replaced by faster all-electric devices that initially used vacuum tubes, and later, transistors. The transition to all-electric computing began in the mid-20th century, and this evolution enabled the production of modern electronic computers that could perform calculations at much higher speeds. Notable examples of this shift in technology include the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), developed in the United States during World War II, and the Colossus, a codebreaking machine created by British engineer Tommy Flowers. In summary, German engineer Konrad Zuse created the electromechanical relay computer, the Z2, in 1939. This invention was influential in the early development of computer technology and served as a prototype for more advanced machines. Although the Z2 had a low operating speed, it was a crucial stepping stone towards the creation of all-electric computers that now form the basis of modern computing systems."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Sherry Swanson (Maggie Gyllenhall) arrives at the Genesis House, a way station for women who have recently been paroled from prison. A recovering heroin addict, she has just completed a three-year sentence for robbery to support her addiction. Although she has her own private room, she has chores she must perform and must share a pay phone with the other residents.Accustomed to using sex to get what she wants, she quickly seduces Andy (Rio Hackford), who manages the house. She also performs oral sex on her job placement counselor so he will get her the job she wants working in a daycare center. Sherry struggles with wanting to use again, and befriends Dean (Danny Trejo), a fellow recovery group member who remembers her from a bar she used to frequent when she was underage.She wants to be a good mother to her daughter, Alexis (Ryan Simpkins), who has been cared for by Sherry's brother, Bobby (Brad Henke), and sister-in-law, Lynette (Bridget Barkan). Alexis is confused about her mother's return, a situation that is not helped by Lynette's disapproval of Sherry and insistence that Alexis call her mother and Sherry by her first name.Sherry gets into conflict with another woman at Genesis and moves in with Bobby and Lynette. When her father (Sam Bottoms) and his wife come for a visit, Sherry tries to impress everyone by singing \\"Eternal Flame,\\" but the family is clearly more interested in Alexis and uncomfortable around Sherry. Alexis tells Sherry that Lynette doesn't want her to call Sherry mother, and Alexis and Lynette fight. Bobby takes Sherry to a motel. The next day, when Sherry reports to her parole officer, Hernandez (Giancarlo Esposito), he threatens to send her back to prison because she did not go through proper channels to leave Genesis. When a search doesn't turn up any drugs, Hernandez reveals she has a job at a local Catholic day care center.After completing her first day at the center, she goes to visit Dean, with whom she has begun a sexual relationship. Hernandez is tailing her and notes her new... Answer:","output":"Considering Sherry Swanson's journey in the movie, the challenges she faces in adjusting to life post-prison, rebuilding relationships, and her struggle with addiction, a suitable question about the movie plot would be: How does Sherry's journey in the movie serve as a portrayal of the difficulties ex-convicts face in reintegrating into society, and what lessons can be learned from her attempts to overcome her past and build a stable future for herself and her daughter? In this movie plot, we see Sherry navigating a new life post-incarceration and grappling with a variety of challenges, including finding work, fitting into a halfway house, repairing relationships with her family, and resisting the urge to fall back into old habits and coping mechanisms. Her interactions with other characters, such as her brother Bobby, sister-in-law Lynette, daughter Alexis, and parole officer Hernandez, demonstrate the barriers ex-convicts often face when trying to rebuild their lives. Sherry's experience highlights the importance of addressing addiction and mental health among individuals who have been incarcerated, as well as providing adequate support systems to ensure successful reintegration into society. Additionally, the movie plot showcases the complexities involved in rebuilding relationships and trust with loved ones after an extended absence. In Sherry's case, her longing to be a good mother to Alexis is complicated not only by her own past behavior but also by the opinions and choices of those now caring for her daughter. Furthermore, the movie plot emphasizes the impact of societal perspectives on ex-convicts and the significance of overcoming personal barriers and stigma when seeking employment and building new relationships. For example, Sherry's seduction of her job placement counselor can be interpreted as a reflection of her desperation to secure a job after her release, as well as her continued reliance on unhealthy behaviors to achieve her goals. Similarly, Sherry's relationship with Dean is a mixture of seeking support from a fellow recovering addict while also engaging in potentially risky behaviors that could jeopardize her progress. In conclusion, by exploring the question of how Sherry's journey serves as a portrayal of the difficulties faced by ex-convicts in reintegrating into society, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complexities surrounding post-incarceration adjustments and the importance of providing support, guidance, and opportunities for individuals like Sherry to overcome their past and forge a better future for themselves and their loved ones."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

We don’t talk much about the experience of waiting for reviews, and it’s not something that appears to have been researched. Yet it’s something everyone doing academic work has to go through and it may be bad for our mental health. I’m finding it particularly difficult at the moment because a lot rides on these reviews. The sole-authored book, which is on a contentious topic, has already had one set of reviews. Reviewer 1 was utterly damning, saying “I couldn’t find anything to praise”. Luckily, Reviewers 2 and 3 were more measured, offering both praise and constructive criticism, and their input helped me to revise and strengthen the typescript. However, in the process, my editor and I realised that we needed further reviews from people with a particular kind of specialist knowledge. My editor approached around ten potential reviewers, but only one agreed to do the job. So I’m gibbering – what if that person agrees with Reviewer 1? The co-authored book is in a contentious format. My co-authors and I decided that I would be the person to liaise with publishers, as I have form in this process. The last time I liaised with academic publishers for a co-authored book was in the early 2000s, and I’d forgotten how heavily responsible it makes me feel. Fortunately, I’ve found a publisher that is interested and has sent the book out for reviews, to two professional academics and two students. This is great – and terrifying – but at least there are four reviewers. Even so, what if they all think it’s rubbish? In many ways I love the peer review system.

Question: \\"What quality do incandescent lamps have less of that make them better than LEDs?\\"  Context: \\"Since LED efficacy is inversely proportional to operating temperature, LED technology is well suited for supermarket freezer lighting. Because LEDs produce less waste heat than incandescent lamps, their use in freezers can save on refrigeration costs as well. However, they may be more susceptible to frost and snow buildup than incandescent lamps, so some LED lighting systems have been designed with an added heating circuit. Additionally, research has developed heat sink technologies that will transfer heat produced within the junction to appropriate areas of the light fixture.\\"  Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"Incandescent lamps produce more waste heat, which can make them better for situations where frost and snow buildup could be an issue, as they are less susceptible to this problem than LEDs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Use this fact to answer the question: a pulley is used for lifting objects A pulley is used to lift a flag on a flagpole by","output":"1. Attaching the flag to a rope: The first step in using the pulley system is to attach the flag to the rope. To do this, I would connect the grommets (small metal rings) of the flag to the appropriate hooks or clips on the rope. This ensures that the flag remains secure when being lifted. 2. Ensuring the pulley is in place: To make sure the pulley is properly positioned, I would inspect the top of the flagpole to find the pulley system. The pulley should be securely fastened to the top of the flagpole, with the rope running through the wheel-like mechanism. This allows the rope to move smoothly when lifting the flag. 3. Feeding the rope through the pulley: Next, I would ensure that the rope is properly threaded through the pulley. The rope should run from the flag, up to the pulley at the top of the flagpole, and then back down to the person operating the pulley. This helps to create a mechanical advantage that makes lifting the flag easier. 4. Pulling the rope to raise the flag: With the flag securely attached to the rope and the rope properly threaded through the pulley, I would then begin to pull the loose end of the rope downward. As I pull the rope, the pulley system will use its mechanical advantage to lift the flag up the flagpole. 5. Securing the rope when the flag is raised: Once the flag has been lifted to the desired height, I would need to ensure that the rope is secured to prevent the flag from slipping down the flagpole. To do this, I would tie the rope around a cleat or other suitable fixture at the base of the flagpole. 6. Checking the flag's position: Finally, after securing the rope, I would inspect the position of the flag to ensure that it is flying properly, not tangled, and fully visible. If necessary, I would make adjustments to the flag's position by gently pulling on the rope and re-securing it. In summary, to lift a flag on a flagpole using a pulley, I would attach the flag to the rope, ensure the pulley system is in place, properly feed the rope through the pulley, pull the rope to raise the flag, secure the rope at the desired height, and check the flag's position for proper display."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What type of religious faith is the narrator ?","output":"Based on the information given in the text, it is not explicitly stated which specific religious faith the narrator follows. However, the text does provide enough information about the narrator's activities and objectives to make an educated guess about their religious affiliation.  The narrator mentions that they have been spending time on various campuses, meeting students, and seeking potential believers who they'd want to start a spiritual movement. Additionally, they mention that they worked together with members of the \\"Crusade team from Mexico City,\\" and this might imply that their religious faith is Christianity. The term \\"Crusade\\" is historically associated with Christianity, as it refers to the series of religious and military campaigns undertaken by the Christian powers of Europe against Muslims and others during the High Middle Ages. The narrator's goal of finding believers and initiating a spiritual movement on various campuses aligns with the teachings and goals of Christianity, which emphasizes spreading the faith and introducing new people to its teachings. With all of this information, it can be reasonably inferred that the narrator probably adheres to Christianity or a denomination within it. It's important to remember that this is an educated guess based on the available information and there is still room for interpretation.

It took less than 24 hours for Stuart Lancaster’s cautious optimism about the fitness of his players to be dimmed after it emerged that Joe Launchbury will miss next year’s RBS 6 Nations following spinal surgery. The 23-year-old lock, a pivotal member of the England squad when fit, must have his operation on Friday to correct the nerve problem in his neck which has caused discomfort for several months. Launchbury missed the autumn internationals and had hoped a period of extended rest would cure the debilitating injury. But Wasps director of rugby Dai Young revealed on Sunday that this recovery was behind schedule, raising the spectre of surgery. Joe Launchbury (right, in action against New Zealand in July) will undergo neck surgery on Friday. Lunchbury's injury is understood to be similar to the one sustained by Dan Cole last season. Launchbury will miss England's Six Nations campaign in a blow to Stuart Lancaster. Those fears were confirmed on Thursday when Wasps announced the 20-cap star will have a ‘routine decompression’ of a nerve in an attempt to cure a bulging disc which has caused him to lose power in his arm. Young said: ‘As you would expect, this is a frustrating time for Joe, but the most important thing in all of this isn’t rugby, it’s Joe’s long-term health. We have consulted specialists in this field and they have recommended surgery as the best option to get him back to full fitness for the long term. ‘Joe is in good hands. He is being looked after by one of the world’s leading surgeons and he will have the full support of the Wasps and England medical teams during his rehabilitation period.’ Launchbury’s recovery is expected to take between three and four months, making it is possible he will not play again this season. The news came a day after Lancaster learned of Lions prop Alex Corbisiero’s imminent return to action for Northampton. The 20-cap star will have a ‘routine decompression’ of a nerve in an attempt to cure a bulging disc. Launchbury has not played for Wasps since November due to his neck problem. Chris Robshaw: captain out for four weeks with ‘stinger’ shoulder injury. Joe Launchbury: out for up to four months with neck surgery pending. Brad Barritt: lengthy lay-off with calf injury. Ed Slater: lucky if he plays this season (knee). Tom Croft: horrendous run of injuries with setback after setback. Tom Johnson: neck injury is keeping him sidelined. Manu Tuilagi: groin injury proving hard to shake off. Will Fraser: back injury causing Saracen problems. Recently returned: Geoff Parling (concussion), Mako Vunipola (back, knee), Tom Youngs (shoulder), Dan Cole (neck surgery). Back soon: Alex Corbisiero (shoulder surgery). Launchbury’s injury — understood to be similar to the one suffered last season by England prop Dan Cole — raises more questions about the high number of neck injuries sustained by rugby’s top stars. Some believe those most proficient at ‘jackling’ for possession over the ball are especially vulnerable because their necks are exposed at the breakdown. Another injury causing concern — concussion — looks to have also ruled Ireland fly-half Jonny Sexton out of action until at least February. The Racing Metro star has not played since suffering a head injury playing for Ireland against Australia in November and French newspaper L’Equipe reported on Thursday that he has been suffering headaches and nausea ever since. After consulting a neurologist, it has been decided Sexton — who was also knocked unconscious in last season’s final Six Nations clash against France and was sidelined for several weeks — should not play until February 14 at the earliest. That makes the Lions No 10 certain to miss Ireland’s opening game against Italy but with such a notoriously difficult injury to asses, there are fears Sexton could be out for even longer. Racing coach Laurent Labit said: ‘As long as Jonny Sexton doesn’t feel 100 per cent, we cannot take any risks.’ Sexton has not played since suffering a head injury playing for Ireland against Australia in November. It has been reported that Sexton will be able to take part in non-contact training, although strict return-to-play protocols say a player can only return to non-contact training 24 hours after becoming symptom free. Sexton has struggled to settle at Racing following his move to Paris last summer and will return to Leinster at the end of this season, with New Zealand’s world-record points scorer Dan Carter confirmed yesterday as his replacement. Carter — who will earn close to £800,000 a year — predicts the move will be an ‘awesome experience’, while Racing’s millionaire owner Jacky Lorenzetti denies the 33-year-old’s wages are excessive because of his enormous marketing potential. ‘Carter will be the best-paid player at Racing but also the least expensive because of the economic benefits,’ Lorenzetti said. Meanwhile, European champions Toulon are considering suing the two Leicester Tigers supporters whose testimony led to Delon Armitage receiving a three-month ban on Wednesday. Sexton looks certain to miss Ireland's Six Nations opener against Italy, but is in danger of missing even more. Toulon owner Mourad Boudjellal was incensed by the length of the ban, imposed after a three-man disciplinary panel found the former England full back guilty of verbally abusing fans following Toulon’s European Cup defeat at Welford Road 12 days ago. ‘We aren’t discounting the eventuality of going after these two supporters in court for false testimonies,’ said Boudjellal. ‘This is an extraordinary decision which rests only on the allegations of two opposition supporters, whose objectivity we can legitimately put in doubt. ‘There is no formal proof, no official document, not even television pictures, to attest to the veracity of these testimonies.’ What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1. Joe Launchbury will miss the RBS 6 Nations Championship following spinal surgery to correct a nerve problem in his neck. 2. His recovery is expected to take between three and four months, possibly ruling him out for the entire season. 3.

What is the name of the heroine in Steig Larsson's Millennium Trilogy?","output":"The name of the heroine in Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy is Lisbeth Salander, a complex and highly skilled protagonist in the series. The Millennium Series consists of three novels: \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\", \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\", and \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest\\". The series was published posthumously after Larsson's death in 2004. Lisbeth Salander is portrayed as an unconventional and intelligent investigator and computer hacker who possesses prodigious skills in problem-solving, cryptography, and information gathering. Salander is also depicted as having a traumatic past, which contributes to her character's development and her interactions with the different characters in the series. Her partnering with investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist forms the core of the series, as the duo work together to solve multiple cases and unveil the dark secrets, conspiracies, and corruption they encounter along the way. Throughout the series, Lisbeth's character develops in fascinating ways as we witness her cooperation with Blomkvist and her confrontations with adversaries. The first book, \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\", begins with Salander helping Blomkvist work on a case involving a family with hidden secrets and a decades-long unsolved disappearance. As the two work together, they uncover a series of gruesome crimes. In \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\", Lisbeth becomes the target of an intense police investigation after being accused of murder, forcing her to dive into her past to prove her innocence. The third book, \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest\\", ties up the loose ends of Lisbeth's tumultuous past and her struggle against the criminal masterminds who have tormented her throughout her life. While Stieg Larsson originally planned for the series to span ten books, his untimely death left the future of the series uncertain. Eventually, Swedish author David Lagercrantz took over, adding three more novels to the series: \\"The Girl in the Spider's Web\\", \\"The Girl Who Takes an Eye for an Eye\\", and \\"The Girl Who Lived Twice\\". In these novels, Lisbeth Salander continues to feature as the prominent protagonist, and her character development continues to evolve. Larsson's Millennium Series gained immense popularity worldwide, and its cinematic adaptations received critical acclamation and box office success, both in Sweden and the United States. Lisbeth Salander's character has become iconic, and her portrayal as a strong, resilient, and brilliant underdog has resonated with readers and audiences alike."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:  (1). mass  (2). weight  (3). size  (4). volume","output":"The term for the amount of space taken up by an object is (4). volume. Volume refers to the three-dimensional space occupied by an object and is typically measured in cubic units, such as cubic centimeters (cm³) or cubic meters (m³). Volume is an important property of an object or substance, as it quantifies the space that an object occupies or the amount of substance present in a particular container. In contrast, the other terms mentioned in your list have different meanings: (1). Mass refers to the amount of matter in an object, irrespective of the space that it occupies. Mass is commonly measured in units such as grams (g) or kilograms (kg). It is an intrinsic property of an object, which means its mass remains constant regardless of its location or the environmental conditions that it experiences. (2). Weight refers to the force exerted on an object due to gravity and is directly proportional to its mass. The weight of an object depends on the local gravitational field strength, so it varies at different locations on Earth or in space. Weight is commonly measured in units such as newtons (N) or pounds (lbs). Thus, unlike mass, the weight of an object is not an intrinsic property, as it depends on external factors. (3). Size refers to the physical dimensions of an object, for example, its length, width, or height. Size can be measured in various units, such as meters (m), inches (in), or feet (ft), depending on the dimensions being considered. While the size of an object is related to the space it occupies, it does not directly indicate the actual volume of the object, as the latter involves the calculations of all three dimensions together. So, out of the given options, the appropriate term for the amount of space taken up by an object is volume. Volume serves as a useful property to characterize and compare different objects or substances, especially in applications related to storage and transportation, as well as in scientific calculations pertinent to chemistry and physics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The U.S. Congress is one step closer to averting a government shutdown Thursday after the U.S. House easily passed a 1.3 trillion spending plan that would end months of the government operating under short-term spending bills. The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown.  With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

Andoheb has called him to undertake a mission for the priesthood, but first refreshes his memory on the story of Kharis (Lon Chaney Jr.).3000 years ago, Kharis and the Princess Ananka were involved in a forbidden love affair. The princess died and because of her sin, her soul was cursed forever. Kharis was buried alive along with her. 30 years prior to the present time, an expedition located and entered the tomb of Ananka. They fought and escaped from the guardian of the tomb-the living Mummy of Kharis. The archaeologists brought Ananka's body back to the Scripps Museum in the United States. However, the priests of Arkham sent Kharis to seek vengeance against the defilers of the tomb. Every person from the expedition that entered the tomb died at the Mummy's hands. Kharis was believed to be destroyed in a fire at the residence of Stephen Banning (Dick Foran), leader of the expedition.The same story is being told to a group of skeptical college students in Mapleton Massachusetts. Professor Norman (Frank Reicher) expands on the story, explaining how Kharis was kept alive by the fluid of the leaves of the Tana bush, a plant that has long been extinct. In fact, Professor Norman himself was entrusted with a quantity of the tana leaves that investigators found in order to conduct scientific research.After the lecture ends, one of the students, Tom Hervey (Robert Lowery), meets up with his girlfriend Amina Mansori (Ramsay Ames), a beautiful woman of Egyptian descent. Amina has been researching Egyptian history, which has brought on a strange, clouded feeling in her mind.Back in Egypt, Andoheb informs Yousef Bey that Kharis still lives and that Yousef's mission is to retrieve Kharis and the body of Ananka and return them to their rightful resting place in Egypt.

It was during this period that Rome's control expanded from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world.  - Sulla's second civil war was one of a series of civil wars of ancient Rome. It was fought between Lucius Cornelius Sulla and Gaius Marius the younger in 82 BC. Prelude. Sulla had achieved temporary control of Rome and Marius's exile to Africa through his first march on Rome, but departed soon afterwards to lead the First Mithridatic War. This departure allowed Gaius Marius and his son Gaius Marius the younger to return to Rome with an army and, with Lucius Cornelius Cinna, to wrest control of Rome back from Sulla's supporter Gnaeus Octavius during Sulla's absence. Based on the orders of Marius, some of his soldiers went through Rome killing the leading supporters of Sulla, including Octavius. Their heads were exhibited in the Forum. After five days, Cinna ordered his more disciplined troops to kill Marius's rampaging soldiers. All told some 100 Roman nobles had been murdered. Marius declared Sulla's reforms and laws invalid, officially exiled Sulla and had himself elected to Sulla's eastern command and himself and Cinna elected consuls for the year 86 BC. Marius died a fortnight after and Cinna was left in sole control of Rome.   - Consul (abbrev. \\"cos.\\"; Latin plural \\"consules\\") was the title of one of the chief magistrates of the Roman Republic, and subsequently a somewhat significant title under the Roman Empire. The title was also used in other city states and also revived in modern states, notably in the First French Republic. The relating adjective is consular, from the \\"consularis\\".  - Armenia ( tr. \\"Hayastan\\"), officially the Republic of Armenia (tr. \\"Hayastani Hanrapetutyun\\"), is a sovereign state in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia. Located in Western Asia on the \\"Armenian Highlands\\", it is bordered by Turkey to the west, Russia and Georgia to the north and Azerbaijan to the east, and Iran and Azerbaijan's exclave of Nakhchivan to the south.  - Mithridates VI or Mithradates VI, from Old Persian \\"Miradta\\", \\"gift of Mithra\\"; 13563 BC, also known as Mithradates the Great (Megas) and Eupator Dionysius, was king of Pontus and Armenia Minor in northern Anatolia (now Turkey) from about 12063 BC. Mithridates is remembered as one of the Roman Republics most formidable and successful enemies, who engaged three of the prominent generals from the late Roman Republic in the Mithridatic Wars: Lucius Cornelius Sulla, Lucius Licinius Lucullus and Gnaeus Pompey Magnus. He is often considered the greatest ruler of the Kingdom of Pontus.  - Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (29 September 106 BC  28 September 48 BC), usually known in English as Pompey or Pompey the Great, was a military and political leader of the late Roman Republic. He came from a wealthy Italian provincial background, and his father had been the first to establish the family among the Roman nobility. Pompey's immense success as a general while still very young enabled him to advance directly to his first consulship without meeting the normal requirements for office. His success as a military commander in Sulla's Second Civil War resulted in Sulla bestowing the nickname \\"Magnus\\", \\"the Great\\", upon him. He was consul three times and celebrated three triumphs.  - The Third Mithridatic War (7363 BC) was the last and longest of three Mithridatic Wars and was fought between Mithridates VI of Pontus, who was joined by his allies, and the Roman Republic. The war ended in defeat for Mithridates, ending the Pontic Kingdom, and resulted in the Kingdom of Armenia becoming an allied client state of Rome.  - Lucius Cornelius Sisenna ( c. 120 -- 67 BC ) was a Roman soldier , historian , and annalist . He was killed in action during Pompey 's campaign against pirates after the Third Mithridatic War . Sisenna had been commander of the forces on the coast of Greece . He was the author of a history in twenty - three books , all of which have been lost , save a few fragments . Sallust is said to have begun historical work as a continuation of Sisenna 's . Sisenna also translated a collection of erotic and picaresque tales by Aristides of Miletus entitled Milesiae fabulae , which was said to have served as a model for Petronius ' Satyricon .  - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: A chaser is a drink that you can use to decrease the taste of the shot. Get a soda, juice, or beer to take with your shot. You will take a sip of the chaser right after you down the shot to remove the taste of the liquor from your tongue. Make sure you have your chaser ready before you take your shot.  You can also take a small sip of the chaser before you take your shot and hold it in your mouth. Drink the shot, and then swallow the chaser and the shot at the same time. Once you have swallowed, take another sip of the chaser. Depending on the shot (i.e. tequila) you are taking, you may need to get your lemon, lime, or salt ready before you take the shot. Beer is the most commonly used chaser. Tequila can be chased with a light lager such as Tecate, Corona, or Pacifico. Bourbon pairs well with an imperial stout beer. Chase with any beer that you like or ask the bartender for a suggestion. If you are drinking whiskey, try using pickle juice as a chaser. Slightly tilt your head as you raise the shot glass to your mouth. Continue tilting your head and the shot glass at the same time as you drink the liquor. The shot glass should be upside-down when you are finished taking the shot. This motion will make it easier for you to get the shot down your throat.  Be careful not to tilt your head too far back. You do not want to choke on the liquor. Make sure you tilt both your head and the shot glass. Titling only one of these can result in a mess. For example, if you tilt the glass but do not tilt your head back, you may spill the shot on your clothes. Inhale right before you open your mouth to take the shot. Do not exhale before you drink the liquor. Exhaling before you take the shot may cause you to gag on the shot. Once you have finished the shot, exhale out of your mouth again.  Avoid breathing through your nose during the shot taking process. Breathing through your nose intensifies the taste of the shot. Remember to inhale before you take the shot. Inhaling while you take the shot will cause you to inhale fumes and cough. Shots are not meant to be sipped. Holding the liquor in your mouth will make it more difficult for you to swallow the shot or activate your gag reflex. You will also taste the liquor much more if you do not swallow it immediately.  Prolonging the shot can also cause the liquor to go down the wrong pipe. Keep your jaw and your throat relaxed as you swallow. Summary:","output":"A chaser is a beverage consumed after taking a shot of liquor to mitigate its strong taste. Common chasers include soda, juice, and beer. It is advisable to have the chaser prepared before taking the shot, and it can even be sipped prior to the shot and held in the mouth. Beer is the most common chaser, with specific pairings suggested for various liquors such as light lagers with tequila and imperial stout beer with bourbon. An alternative chaser for whiskey is pickle juice.  When taking a shot, it is important to slightly tilt the head and the shot glass simultaneously, being cautious not to tilt too far back or create a mess. Inhaling before taking the shot and avoiding exhaling or nose breathing during the process can reduce the chances of gagging or intensifying the drink's taste. Shots should not be sipped and must be swallowed immediately to avoid activating the gag reflex or the possibility of the liquid going down the wrong pipe. Relaxing the jaw and throat during swallowing can further aid in the process."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: \\"What can ants help plant?\\"  Context: \\"Pollination is the process by which pollen is transferred in the reproduction of plants, thereby enabling fertilisation and sexual reproduction. Most flowering plants require an animal to do the transportation. While other animals are included as pollinators, the majority of pollination is done by insects. Because insects usually receive benefit for the pollination in the form of energy rich nectar it is a grand example of mutualism. The various flower traits (and combinations thereof) that differentially attract one type of pollinator or another are known as pollination syndromes. These arose through complex plant-animal adaptations. Pollinators find flowers through bright colorations, including ultraviolet, and attractant pheromones. The study of pollination by insects is known as anthecology.\\"  Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"Ants can help plant various flowering plants by acting as pollinators. In the process of pollination, ants transfer pollen between flowers and contribute to the fertilization and sexual reproduction of these plants. This mutualistic relationship benefits both the plants and the ants, as the ants receive energy-rich nectar in return for their pollination services.

Michael Joseph Jackson was born in Gary, Indiana, near Chicago, on August 29, 1958. He was the eighth of ten children in the Jackson family, a working-class African-American family living in a two-bedroom house on Jackson Street. His mother, Katherine Esther Jackson (née Scruse), played clarinet and piano, had aspired to be a country-and-western performer, and worked part-time at Sears. She was a Jehovah's Witness. His father, Joseph Walter \\"Joe\\" Jackson, a former boxer, was a crane operator at U.S. Steel and played guitar with a local rhythm and blues band, the Falcons, to supplement the family's income. His father's great-grandfather, July \\"Jack\\" Gale, was a Native American medicine man and US Army scout. Michael grew up with three sisters (Rebbie, La Toya, and Janet) and five brothers (Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Randy). A sixth brother, Marlon's twin Brandon, died shortly after birth.Joe acknowledged that he regularly whipped Michael; Michael said his father told him he had a \\"fat nose\\", and regularly physically and emotionally abused him during rehearsals. He recalled that Joe often sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed, ready to physically punish any mistakes. Katherine Jackson stated that although whipping is considered abuse in more modern times, it was a common way to discipline children when Michael was growing up. Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon have said that their father was not abusive and that the whippings, which were harder on Michael because he was younger, kept them disciplined and out of trouble. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 1993, Jackson said that his youth had been lonely and isolating.In 1964, Michael and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothers—a band formed by their father which included Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine—as backup musicians playing congas and tambourine. In 1965, Michael began sharing lead vocals with Jermaine, and the group's name was changed to the Jackson 5. The following year, the group won a talent show; Michael performed...

The Cold War space missions that never happened Every jaded space nerd has a dream of where they hoped space exploration would take us. By now I imagined the Earth would be circled by gleaming space hotels, flights to the Moon would be routine and the first settlers would be colonising the dusty plains of Mars. As yet, despite Richard Branson’s best efforts, our glittering space future remains as elusive as ever. Although, only the other week, a man in a gorilla suit chased a British astronaut through a space station. So it’s not all bad. For the last 40 years, human progress beyond Earth’s orbit has been painfully slow, with space history littered with hundreds of abandoned projects and concepts. But an alternate and very different pattern of space exploration might have become reality had a few Cold War missions been given the final go-ahead. On the grey concrete of a small outdoor display area at Nasa’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama sits one of the most unusual engines the agency has ever developed. Mounted on a frame alongside a long thin Space Shuttle solid rocket booster (with “empty” reassuringly painted on the side), the funnel-shaped Nerva engine was designed to take astronauts to Mars. Many rocket engineers still believe that nuclear propulsion has a promising future Developed in the 1960s, Nerva – or Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application – consisted of a cylindrical uranium nuclear fission reactor that heated liquid hydrogen. The gas was then expelled through a rocket nozzle to generate high levels of thrust. Following Wernher von Braun’s plan, Nasa’s first Mars mission was slated for 1979 with astronauts blasting off on a conventional rocket before activating Nera in orbit to carry them onwards to the Red Planet. Around 20 nuclear engines were tested successfully, with the results suggesting it was a promising technology for interplanetary travel. The engine on display at Marshall would have been the most powerful but the project was cancelled in 1973 before anyone could try it out. Many rocket engineers still believe that nuclear propulsion has a promising future. However, the idea of launching a reactor filled with highly radioactive uranium on the top of a rocket filled with explosive gases also, unsurprisingly, has its detractors. One of the scariest spacecraft ever designed emerged from a 1960s Russian programme to militarise the Soyuz spacecraft. The aim was to develop a crewed spacecraft to observe enemy territory and destroy enemy satellites. The plan that emerged was for a manned gunship in space, able to creep up on other spacecraft and fire a projectile to blast them into pieces. The primary target would be American spy satellites as well as any weaponised US spacecraft. A cosmonaut would aim the weapon by pointing the spacecraft and lining up the target in a gunsight. To ensure that when they fired, the Soyuz didn’t recoil backwards or start spinning uncontrollably, the gun was mounted on an independent low-friction platform. Although it seems the technology was developed and cosmonauts trained, the military programme was abandoned in favour of a civilian space station programme. With the advent of more sophisticated spy satellites, it was also decided that there was no need for a man to snap the pictures. The Gemini programme of the mid-60s featured some of the most audacious missions ever flown. With two astronauts crammed into a cockpit around the size of the front seats of a small family car, Gemini notched up a heap of space firsts: the first American spacewalk, the first long-duration spaceflight, the first orbital rendezvous and docking, the first time a spacecraft was fitted with fuel cells and programmable computers. It was so good that its maker McDonnell Douglas had big plans for the little spacecraft, deciding to supersize it to carry nine astronauts. The programme that emerged was called ‘Big G’, described in the promotional brochure as “a truck in space”. Designed to transport astronauts to and from a planned military space station, Big G had two compartments: a regular two-man Gemini capsule at the front and a larger crew cabin behind. McDonnell Douglas drew up detailed plans for the project and built full-sized mock-ups to show Nasa officials how it would all work. With the space station on hold, Big G was finally dropped in favour of the Space Shuttle in 1971. The idea of a large crewed capsule to transport astronauts to and from orbit, however, is once more back in vogue, with Nasa currently funding designs by Boeing and SpaceX. The space station that President Reagan signed off in 1984 was very different to the International Space Station (ISS) that emerged from the political wreckage. Freedom was conceived to be far more than an orbiting laboratory. Not only would it be fitted with labs, it would also have a fully equipped sick bay and recreation facilities. Perhaps most excitingly, the design also featured a hangar – where satellites and spacecraft could be brought in for repair before being released back out into the void. In short, Freedom was far more like the space stations of science fiction than the lumpy collection of cylinders that we have ended up with. Unfortunately, Freedom turned out to be expensive, impractical and – with the end of the Cold War – unnecessary. Although the ISS has few of the refinements of Freedom, it does bring together the two former Cold War rivals. In fact, it would not have been possible without Russian space station expertise. You can read more about the history of the ISS here. During the 1960s the two superpowers developed very different-looking spacecraft to solve the same problems. The Americans favoured conical capsules like Apollo, the Russians liked theirs spherical. In the next decade, however, there was rather more, shall we say, ‘borrowing’ of technology. The Russian Buran spaceplane, for instance, was a straight rip-off of the Space Shuttle. But the Americans too were not immune to copying Soviet space technology. One of the most curious of these borrowed designs was derived from the slipper-shaped MiG-105. Developed in the mid-1960s, the MiG-105 was Russia’s first attempt at a spaceplane. The idea was to blast the small shuttle into orbit on the top of a conventional rocket. It would then return to Earth on a runway. A few successful atmospheric flights proved this was a sound idea and it wasn’t long before the US ‘acquired’ the technology and developed a version of its own. This could easily have become just another Cold War concept that was never going to make it into space. Instead, the original design has been adapted into the Dream Chaser spaceplane being developed by the Sierra Nevada Corporation. With funding from Nasa, the first of these spaceplanes is due to fly – unmanned – to resupply the ISS by the end of the decade. With interest from other nations and commercial operators, a crewed version could yet make it into orbit. Dream Chaser proves that unusual and ambitious ideas developed at the height of the Cold War are sometimes worth revisiting. As we set our sights on Mars, nuclear engines may also make a comeback. As for the space gun… as we reach towards the final frontier, we may need all the crazy ideas we can get.

Plot title: Mad Monster Party Movie plot: NOTE: All voices by Allen Swift, except where noted.Baron von Frankenstein [voice of Boris Karloff], the scientist who discovered the secret to creation, has just perfected the secret to destruction. In order to celebrate his discovery, the baron invites all his monster friends -- Dracula, the Werewolf, the Mummy, the Invisible Man, Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde, the Creature from the Black Lagoon, and the Hunchback of Notre Dame -- to his Caribbean Island of Evil for a big party. The baron also has another reason for hosting such a gala. He has decided to retire as head of Monsters Incorporated and to pass on his secrets to his only \\"living\\" heir -- geeky, allergy-ridden pharmacist Felix Flankin, son of the baron's sister, the white sheep of the family. As the SS Herring bearing all the guests nears the island, the baron briefs his zombies about the necessity of remaining calm and collected no matter what happens. Only Yetch is having trouble keeping his head (and hands) attached. This is partly because it's been so long since Yetch has seen all their friends, but also because he is besotted with the baron's secretary, the lovely, well-stacked, red-headed, cool-as-a-cucumber Francesca [Gale Garnet].As the baron and Francesca prepare to greet their guests, they are joined by Frankenstein's Monster and his Mate [Phyllis Diller]. First to arrive is Dracula, who is enchanted to see Francesca. (\\"You have always been my type...O-negative, isn't it?\\") Next is the Werewolf. (\\"Wolfie, you old dog! This convention is going to be a howling success!\\") The Invisible Man arrives. (\\"You're looking well...I think.\\") The Hunchback carries in the Mummy, then comes Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde, followed by the Creature. Meanwhile, in the kitchen, Chef Mafia Machiavelli is preparing the menu for the party. There's octopus soup and a poison ivy salad with toadstools, poison berries, and three kinds of dressings -- arsenic, cyanide, and nitroglycerin.

Adult daughters are often expected to caregiver for older parents. In 2007, Jorjan Sarich and her dad moved from California to Idaho. It was where he wanted to live his rest time.  \\"I left my occupation, I left my friends; he did the same thing,\\" said Sarich, who bought a house with her father, George Snyder, in the China Gardens neighborhood of Hailey after his health began to decline. Though a graduate student struggling to finish her dissertation , Sarich chose to be her dad's full-time caregiver.  \\"It's only now, several years later, that I'm realizing how much work it was. It's the kind of exhaustion that sleep doesn't cure,\\" she said.  About 6 million Americans provide care to elderly relatives or friends living outside of nursing homes. Laurel Kennedy, author of \\"The Daughter Trap\\" (Thomas Dunne Books, 25.95), says that women bear a disproportionate share of the burden -- about 70 percent of hands-on care giving such as bathing.  \\"I want to be clear: Women don't hate this,\\" Kennedy said. \\"What they hate is that everyone just assumes they'll do it.\\"  Kennedy is calling for _ equal to the rise of affordable child care and day care: Employers should help working caregivers by offering accommodations. Men should step up more often. It's unfair that women are always chosen to provide care for an elderly family member.  Despite the hard work it took on Sarich -- interrupted sleep and the knowledge that his 2009 death was the end game, she would do it again.

Article: Most teenagers in Britain receive pocket money from their parents. A report by the Bank of Scotland interviewed over 1,000 young people in Britain and found that 77% get pocket money. Different families give different amounts of pocket money. The average for eight-to-fifteen-year-olds in the UK is about PS6 a week. Children in Scotland receive slightly more than the national average and Londoners get the most. Teenagers, logically, get more money than younger children. Some fifteen-to-nineteen-year-olds receive more than PS100 a month. The report found that many children save at least a quarter of their weekly pocket money and that more boys than girls save their money. Lots of young people have to do housework to get their pocket money. They help at home with jobs like cleaning and cooking. A part-time job is a choice for teenagers who don't have pocket money or who want to earn extra money. About 15% of teenagers have a job. Popular part-time jobs for teenagers include delivering newspapers, shop work, and working in a restaurant or cafe. There are strict government laws about working hours. Only children over 13 can work (there are some exceptions, for example, for actors.) On a school day they can work a maximum of 2 hours a day but not during school hours. At weekends and during school holidays they can work longer hours. The national minimum wage for people aged 16-17 is PS3.57 per hour. 18-year-olds must earn a minimum of PS4.83. There isn't a national minimum waged for people under 16. In Britain some children and teenagers have a bank account. There is no legal age limit at which you can open a bank account but a bank manager can decide whether to allow a child or young person to open an account. Parents can put pocket money directly into their child's bank account and then children can use it to pay for things without carrying money.

And there’s a risk in writing about eastern Congo that readers think that the whole country is a catastrophe. In fact, most of the country has stabilized and is much better off. On my first visit to Congo in 1997, I drove from Kisangani all the way to the east (it took a week), and for years that was then impossible for security reasons. Now it can be done again, and the road has improved enough that the route takes just two days. Yet one of the problems is that even in places that are now secure, with no warfare, the rapes continue. That’s something we’ve seen elsewhere, such as in Liberia: that even when wars end, sexual violence tends to continue. I can’t tell you how sad it s to see the Kivus still a mess each time I visit, and in some ways worse off than when I first visited. And that doesn’t have to be that way.

Joe's parents are farmers and they have a huge farm with cows, chickens, and ducks. Joe loves the farm and all the things he gets to play around and play on. One day, Joe's father told him not to get near a tractor that was sitting in the field. His father was worried that Joe would climb on it and hurt himself. Joe went out to the field and was feeding the horses and cows. When he was done, he saw the tractor his father told him not to get near. He knew that climbing on the tractor wouldn't hurt anything, so he did. He climbed on to the seat and sat there. Then, he pretended he was his father and pretended that he was driving the tractor. Joe's father saw him playing on the tractor and called for him. Joe heard his father calling for him and got off the tractor really fast. When he did that, he fell off and hurt his arm. Joe was in pain and his father came running to check on him and picked him up and sat him on a bench and asked him why he did that. Joe looked at his father and said, \\"I wanted to be like you.\\" Joe's father gave him a hug and asked him if he wanted to ride with him on the tractor.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"Both questions ask for recommendations on the best horror movies, but they differ slightly in their focus. The first question specifically asks for the best horror movies that will keep you up at night, implying that the film should be particularly frightening or unsettling. The second question simply requests some top horror movies, without necessarily focusing on their ability to leave you scared through the night. Given the slight difference, I will provide recommendations to cater to both of the questions: For horror movies that will keep you up at night, I recommend the following: 1. The Exorcist (1973) - Directed by William Friedkin, this classic horror film tells the story of a demon-possessed girl and the attempts to exorcise her. 2. Rosemary's Baby (1968) - Directed by Roman Polanski, this psychological horror movie revolves around a pregnant woman who becomes increasingly paranoid about the safety of her unborn child. 3. A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) - Directed by Wes Craven, this film introduces the iconic character Freddy Krueger, a supernatural killer who preys on teenagers in their dreams. 4. The Ring (2002) - Directed by Gore Verbinski, this American remake of the Japanese film \\"Ringu\\" tells the story of a cursed videotape that causes anyone who watches it to die in seven days. 5. Hereditary (2018) - Directed by Ari Aster, this unnerving film focuses on the disturbing and tragic events that unfold after the death of a family's secretive grandmother. 6. The Babadook (2014) - Directed by Jennifer Kent, this psychological horror film tells the story of a mother and son who are haunted by a mysterious and sinister presence in their home. 7. The Conjuring (2013) - Directed by James Wan, this movie is based on the real-life investigations of paranormal experts Ed and Lorraine Warren. It focuses on their experiences with a family dealing with an evil entity in their home. For some more general best horror movies, consider the following: 1. Psycho (1960) - Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, this iconic thriller/horror movie is known for its shocking plot twists and infamous shower scene. 2. The Shining (1980) - Directed by Stanley Kubrick and based on the novel by Stephen King, this film follows a family's terrifying stay at an isolated hotel during the off-season. 3. Get Out (2017) - Directed by Jordan Peele, this social-thriller tells the story of a young black man who discovers a horrifying secret when he meets his white girlfriend's family. 4. Scream (1996) - Directed by Wes Craven, this meta-horror film offers a fresh take on the slasher genre while also paying homage to its roots. 5. The Silence of the Lambs (1991) - Directed by Jonathan Demme, this psychological horror film features the iconic characters Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling in a chilling battle of wits. 6. It Follows (2014) - Directed by David Robert Mitchell, this film deals with a supernatural entity that relentlessly pursues its victims after a curse is passed on through sexual contact. 7. The Witch (2016) - Directed by Robert Eggers, this chilling film is set in the 17th century and follows a Puritan family facing mysterious occurrences and witchcraft. In conclusion, both questions seek recommendations for the best horror movies, but they have slightly different emphases. The distinction between them lies in the degree of fear they're looking for in the film recommendations. Regardless, both queries can be addressed with a variety of classic and modern horror movies that cater to different interests and levels of fear."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A 14-year-old British student is packing for the next day of school: textbooks, notebooks, pens, 250 grams of flour, an egg and some cooking oil. Wait, what? It's not a joke. From September, cookery will be a compulsory   course for kids aged 7-14 in the UK. Primary school students will learn how to put things together and make simple, healthy food. At high school, students will then master a number of different meals. They will also learn some cooking skills including baking. Britain is sometimes known as a country with bad food and unhealthy eating habits. These new courses are part of the country's effort to bring healthy food back onto the table. \\"One in four British families no longer has a table that everyone can eat around. One out of every two meals we eat is eaten alone.

Article: The government of prefix = st1 /Norwayis planning to build an unusual storage center on an island in the Arctic Ocean. The place would be large enough to hold about two million seeds. The goal is to present all crops known to scientists. The British magazine New Scientist published details of the plan last month. The structure will be designed to protect the world's food supply against nuclear war, climate change and other possible threats. It will be built in a mountain on the NorwegianislandofSpitsbergen. The mountain is less than one thousand kilometers from the North Pole, the northernmost position on earth. An international group called the Global Crop Diversity Trust is working on the project. The director of the group, Cary Fowler, spoke to New Scientist. He said the project would let the world rebuild agriculture if, in his word, \\"the worst came to the worst\\". Norwayis expected to start work next year. The project is expected to cost three million dollars. Workers will drill deep in the side of a sandstone mountain. Temperatures in the area never rise above 0oC. The seeds will be protected behind concrete walls a meter thick and high-security door. The magazine report says the collection will represent the products of ten thousand years of farming. Most of the seeds at first will come from collections at seed banks in Africa, Asia and Latin America. To last a long time, seeds need to be kept in very low temperatures. Workers will not be present all the time. But they plan to replace the air inside the storage space each winter. Winter temperatures on the island are about eighteen degrees below 0oC. The cold weather would protect the seeds even if the air could not be replaced. Mr. Fowler says the proposed structure will be the world's most secure gene bank. He says the plant seeds would only be used when all other seeds are gone for some reason. Norwayfirst proposed the idea in the 1980s. But security concerns delayed the plan.

Almost certainly, a machine can do any work in thinking that a person can do--if the correct way for doing the thinking work can be told exactly. Besides, many programs have been made to direct machines so that they work in very clever ways. Machines have been taught to play chess and to learn from what happens in the games so as to make their play better and better. Machines can beat many persons who play chess. Machines can translate from one language to another. They can prove statements in geometry  as taught in school. Machines can notice printed marks on paper, so that a person is no longer needed to look at the marks. Computers can be used in many ways, such as business, science, industry, and government. _  If people cannot tell exactly the correct way to do certain work in thinking, it is still a question how much of _ a machine can do. Suppose a person is \\"teaching\\" the machine and telling the machine \\"yes\\" when the machine is right, and \\"no\\" when the machine is wrong. Then the machine can keep on searching among possible ways for solving a problem--until the machine can do as well as the person, and perhaps much better. But, what is thinking? People can agree about much that is thinking, and much that is not thinking; but they can't reach agreement because the word \\"think\\" is not a scientific word with an exact meaning. A lot of the discussion is wasted breath because the persons are using different meanings of the word \\"think\\". People, however, have only had experience with machines that appear to think since 1944. It would be too early to say that after the next 200 years, machines will not be thinking.

UPDATED:. 17:34 EST, 30 May 2012. A woman is suing Neiman Marcus after the luxury retailer refused to refund 1.4million worth of goods that her ex-husband gave to her. Patricia Walker from University Park, Texas wanted to return the goods after learning that her ex-husband had been having an affair with her own 'trusted' Neiman Marcus personal shopper. The collection of clothing, jewellery, accessories and artworks had been given to Ms Walker over the three years she had spent recovering from a serious car accident. Not happy: Patricia Walker (above) from University Park, Texas, is suing Neiman Marcus after the store refused to refund 1.4million worth of goods bought for her by her ex-husband. She claims she never wanted the gifts. Expensive taste: The women's now ex-husband was allegedly cheating on her with her own personal shopper from Neiman Marcus, who received a commission on the goods, some of which are pictured above. The accident, which occurred in 2007, left her bedridden for a majority of the time. Favi Lo, the female personal shopper who had an affair with Ms Walker's ex-husband, Robert Tennison, received a 'steep commission' from the purchases according to the plaintiff's attorney Mike Ticer. Mr Ticer is assisting his client in filing a lawsuit against the store on the grounds of 'fraud', 'deceptive trade practices' and a 'violation of company policies' which normally allow customers to return goods within a specified time frame. She had only learned of the alleged affair in 2010, which was just a few months into the couple's divorce. She closed her account with the store immediately after she found out. Ex-husband: Robert Tennison, pictured, is the ex-husband of Ms Walker. He spent 1.4million on gifts for her. Cheater: Favi Lo (above), Ms Walker's personal shopper, is said to have received a steep commission on each of the ex-husband's purchases. She is still employed at the department store in Dallas. Ms Walker was a loyal customer; she had spent 100,000 per year at the store up until her accident. Her husband's total purchases, which are described as 'like new' or in 'mint condition', outweighed her own by hundreds of thousands of dollars between 2007 and 2010. In 2009, his purchases totaled 850,000. Mr Ticer told ABC that the gifts, including a pair of earrings worth 30,000 and a pair pf pajamas worth 285, were items that his client 'couldn't wear and never really wanted'. He said: 'The product of these sales is sex for merchandise.' Distasteful: Mike Ticer (pictured), the woman's attorney, claimed the gifts were items she 'never really wanted' The store's return policy states: 'If for any reason you are not satisfied, we will gladly accept your. timely return of unworn, unwashed, or defective merchandise. 'Returned. merchandise should include the vendor packaging and tags and be in the. same condition as when it was received. Used merchandise cannot be. returned unless defective. A pickup and/or restock fee may apply.' After Ms Walker had requested that the goods be refunded, the store sent staff out to inspect the merchandise. Mr Ticer said 'the store never followed through or offered an explanation for not taking the items back'. Location: The Neiman Marcus store in Dallas where Ms Walker's ex-husband purchased the large amount of goods. His mistress, the personal shopper who earned commission on the purchases, still works there. He expressed further disapproval over the company's choice to keep Ms Lo as an employer. She is still employed at the retailer's NorthPark Mall location in Dallas. He said: 'The real villain in this case is Neiman Marcus. After. learning of this affair, they decided they weren't going to do anything about. it.' As for the merchandise, it is currently being held in storage under tight security.

Kim Sears wasn't showing the strain of supporting Britain's number one tennis player as she arrived at Wimbledon today to see him take victory in his first match. While Murray's mother Judy was seen earlier looking tried and grey, by contrast Kim looked happy and relaxed as she walked towards centre court with Andy's entourage. She carried a Mulberry handbag as she walked in heels wearing jeans and a cream blouse with an orange stripe down the front. What pressure? Kim smiles broadly as she walks to centre court to watch her boyfriend. Stylish: The 25 year old wore a blue blazer and jeans as she carried her Mulberry handbag. She topped her outfit off with a colourful blue blazer, a broad smile and perfectly blow dried hair. But despite her demeanor today, on the BBC documentary broadcast last night called Andy Murray: The Man Behind the Racquet, when asked by Sue Barker if she looked forward to Wimbledon she replied with a laugh: 'No, I used to!' The 25-year-old is usually seen to be on tenterhooks as Murray goes from round to round as the pressure for him to win on home turf is immense.

He famously choked back tears as he gave a gallant loser speech while Kim was also seen looking tearful in the royal box. Colourful: Kim teamed a blue blazer with a cream and orange blouse. Here we go again: Kim arrived in her seat in time to see Andy take to centre court again. Still smiling: Kim could relax as Andy won the first set and then the match. One step closer: Kim applauds as her boyfriend's quest to win Wimbledon gets off to a good start. Kim recalled of the heartbreaking moment: 'There were a lot of tears,. it's just horrible seeing someone you care about going through that. The immediate aftermath wasn't pretty.'

Murray returned to centre court today to begin his campaign today against German's Benjamin Becker. Confident start: Murray celebrates after staring the tournament with a win in straight sets. Relief: Judy Murray had looked strained earlier in the day but broke into a smile after her son's victory. Supporters: Pippa and James Middleton have been following the centre court action all day and cheered Murray on on his match. The tennis champ took to Twitter ahead of his opener to express gratitude to his fans for their backing and encouragement. 'I'll give everything I have on the court starting with round 1', he wrote. He was true to his word, beating the German in straight sets 6-4, 6-3, 6-2. As well as Kim, also watching from the royal box was his ever present mother, Judy, and tennis fans Pippa and James Middleton. High hopes: Once again the nation is behind Andy Murray's bid to become Wimbledon champ. Support: Kim told Sue Barker that she doesn't look forward to Wimbledon and it was hard last year when her boyfriend was so upset by his loss in the final. On yesterday's BBC documentary Kim also revealed what it was like to be suddenly thrust into the lime light when he won his first tournament at San Jose in 2006.

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What are the first names of the two people who are married and run a bookstore? from the following article ?  In 1939, in the Kingdom of Italy, Guido Orefice is a young Jewish man who arrives to work in the city where his uncle Eliseo operates a restaurant. Guido is comical and sharp, and falls in love with a girl named Dora. Later, he sees her again in the city where she is a teacher and set to be engaged to a rich, but arrogant, man, a local government official with whom Guido has regular run-ins. Guido sets up many \\"coincidental\\" incidents to show his interest in Dora. Finally, Dora sees Guido's affection and promise, and gives in, against her better judgement. He steals her from her engagement party, on a horse, humiliating her fiancé and mother. They are later married and have a son, Giosué, and run a bookstore. When World War II breaks out, Guido, his uncle Eliseo, and Giosué are seized on Giosuè's birthday. They and many other Jews are forced onto a train and taken to a concentration camp. After confronting a guard about her husband and son, and being told there is no mistake, Dora volunteers to get on the train in order to be close to her family. However, as men and women are separated in the camp, Dora and Guido never see each other during the internment. Guido pulls off various stunts, such as using the camp's loudspeaker to send messages—symbolic or literal—to Dora to assure her that he and their son are safe. Eliseo is executed in a gas chamber shortly after their arrival. Giosuè narrowly avoids being gassed himself as he hates to take baths and showers, and did not follow the other children when they had been ordered to enter the gas chambers and were told they were showers.

He amassed  a fortune of 1.3 billion dollars during his career but instead of keeping the money and living like an emperor, he decided to give it all away. All of his fortune will be spent on helping poor Chinese students get a better education. And Yu isn't the only super-rich person in China who has this spirit of giving. Chen Guangbiao, a Jiangsu recycling tycoon, has given millions of dollars to charity  and promises to give all of his money to charity when he dies.    Yu and Chen are among the many businessmen who have become prosperous during China's economic rise. An American business magazine, Forbes, estimates that there are 117 billionaires in China and hundreds of thousands of millionaires. What sets Yu and Chen apart from the rest, though, is their tremendous generosity(,) when it comes to donating money to charity.    Last week Bill Gates and Warren Buffett came to Beijing. Gates and Buffett, two of the world's richest men, are also the world's biggest philanthropists. They invited fifty of China's richest people to have dinner with them and talk about the spirit of giving. At first, only a few people accepted their invitation. It seemed some of the invited guests were afraid that Buffett and Gates were going to pressure them into giving their wealth to charity.    A lot of people are angry at the billionaires who are not willing to give away their fortunes. They  _ hem for being miserly and not caring about the poor and the less fortunate. But I think this criticism is wrong. A gift, any gift, should come from the heart. Instead of criticism, these reluctant billionaires should be encouraged to follow the examples of Yu Pengnian and Chen Guangbiao. Encouragement is always a better strategy than criticism.

According to the 1478 census Selânik (), as the city came to be known in Ottoman Turkish, had 6,094 Greek Orthodox households, 4,320 Muslim ones, and some Catholic. No Jews were recorded in the census suggesting that the subsequent influx of Jewish population was not linked to the already existing Romaniote Jews community.

Article: A team of British surgeons has carried out Gaza's first organ transplants for a long-term plan to train local medical staff to perform the operations. Two patients underwent kidney transplants at the Shifa, Gaza's biggest public hospital. The operations were conducted a fortnight ago by a volunteer medical team from the Royal Liverpool hospital. Ziad Matouk, 42, was born with one kidney and was diagnosed with renal failure several years ago. Matouk, whose wife donated one of her kidneys, hopes to return to his job within six months. The couple had sought a transplant in Cairo, but were rejected as unsuitable at a state hospital and could not afford the fee at a private hospital. \\"We were desperate,\\" said Matouk. The UK-Gaza link-up began about a year ago after Abdelkader Hammad, a doctor at the Royal Liverpool hospital, was contacted by an anaesthetist at the Shifa, who outlined the difficulties the Gaza hospital was facing with dialysis . The Shifa is forced to rely on generators because of power cuts; spare parts for its ageing dialysis machines have been difficult to import; and supplies of consumables are often scarce. After an exploratory trip last April, Hammad---whose family is Palestinian---and three colleagues from Liverpool arrived in Gaza via Egypt last month, bringing specialist equipment. Two patients were selected for surgery. The first, Mohammed Duhair, 42, received a kidney donated by his younger brother in a six-hour operation. Two days later, Matouk received a transplant after his wife, Nadia, 36, was found to be a good match. The surgeon was carried out by the British team, assisted by doctors and nurses from the Shifa. \\"We are very satisfied with the results,\\" said Sobbi Skaik, head of surgery at the Gaza hospital. Skaik hopes that Gaza medical teams will eventually carry out kidney transplants independently, and that other organ transplants may follow. The Shifa is working with the Gaza ministry of health on a plan to train its doctors, surgeons, nursing staff and laboratory technicians... Question: Why did the state hospital refuse to practice surgeon for Ziad Matouk? Options: A: Because he couldn't afford the fee at a public hospital.

It is also important to consider the geographic location and the definition of a \\"cold day.\\" If Gurstelle was born in a region that typically experiences colder weather in March, then the likelihood of the hypothesis being correct may naturally increase. Conversely, if he was born in a location that typically has warmer weather in March, then the hypothesis may be less likely to be true. In summary, the given context does not provide us with enough information to accurately determine whether the hypothesis at hand is valid. Further research into historical weather conditions on March 29, 1956, as well as further understanding of the location where Gurstelle was born, would be needed to make a more informed conclusion about the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Here's the step-by-step process: Step 1: Understand the definition The ripened part of a flowering plant that contains seeds is usually called the \\"fruit.\\" It is the mature ovary of a flowering plant and is responsible for protecting and dispersing seeds. Step 2: Investigate plant anatomy To identify the fruit, it's essential to be familiar with the basic structure of flowering plants. The main parts include the roots, stem, leaves, flowers, and fruits. Each of these structures contributes to the growth, reproduction, and overall survival of the plant. Step 3: Locate the fruit Once familiar with plant anatomy, focus on the flower components. As a flower matures and undergoes pollination, the ovary develops into the fruit. Trace back from the petals to the base of the flower, which will lead to the fruit. Step 4: Observe the fruit's characteristics Fruits come in various shapes, sizes, and colors – from oranges and apples to berries and nuts. Some characteristics to consider when identifying the fruit are its shape, texture, color, and whether it is fleshy or dry. Step 5: Verify seed presence Finally, examine the fruit to confirm the presence of seeds. Depending on the fruit, seeds can be found within the flesh, on the surface, or enclosed in a hard shell or protective covering. In conclusion, the ripened part of a flowering plant that contains seeds is the fruit. Follow the steps above to identify it based on characteristics and plant anatomy knowledge."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

He says that \\"digestion is the process of breaking down food into components the body can absorb\\" and \\"food is digested and absorbed in the small intestine\\".   So, what's the best answer to the question? A:","output":"The best answer to the quiz question \\"Where does digestion happen?\\" is the Small intestine. According to the hints provided by the teacher, digestion is the process of breaking down food into components the body can absorb, and food is digested and absorbed in the small intestine.  The small intestine is a crucial part of the gastrointestinal tract, as it is the primary site for digestion and absorption of nutrients. The small intestine consists of three sections: the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Each section plays a different role in the digestion process. 1. Duodenum: The duodenum is the first section of the small intestine, responsible for receiving partially digested food from the stomach in the form of chyme. It continues the process of chemical digestion with the help of enzymes and digestive juices from the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder. These secretions help to break down proteins, carbohydrates, and fats present in the chyme.  2. Jejunum: The jejunum is the middle segment of the small intestine, which is responsible for the majority of nutrient absorption. Here, the broken-down components of food (amino acids, simple sugars, fatty acids, glycerol, vitamins, and minerals) are absorbed into the bloodstream through the walls of the small intestine. The main feature of the jejunum is the presence of finger-like projections called villi, which increase the surface area for more efficient absorption. 3. Ileum: The ileum is the last section of the small intestine, where any remaining nutrients are absorbed, including vitamin B12 and bile salts. This section also contains villi, which help in the absorption process. In conclusion, the small intestine is the best answer to the question \\"Where does digestion happen?\\" as it is the primary site where the mechanical and chemical digestion of food is completed and nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream for the body to utilize."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"The largest desert in the world is the Antarctic Desert, which is located on the continent of Antarctica. It may be surprising to some people since deserts are often associated with hot, arid landscapes, but the definition of a desert is not constrained to temperature. A desert is defined by the amount of precipitation it receives and its limited ability to support life, specifically plant and animal species. In the case of the Antarctic Desert, it experiences extremely low temperatures and minimal precipitation, making it the largest and coldest desert in the world. The Antarctic Desert covers an area of approximately 14 million square kilometers, making it almost 1.5 times larger than the second largest desert in the world, the Arctic Desert, which is situated in the Arctic region at the Earth's North Pole. Comparatively, the third largest desert on Earth and the most famous hot desert, the Sahara Desert, is much smaller, at 9.2 million square kilometers, and can be found in North Africa. Antarctica, located at the southernmost part of the Earth, is surrounded by the Southern Ocean and is almost entirely covered in ice. This ice sheet covering 98% of the continent's surface makes the Antarctic Desert unique in comparison to other deserts. The continent experiences extremely harsh climatic conditions, featuring cold temperatures that can drop as low as -89 degrees Celsius (-128 degrees Fahrenheit), strong winds, and sporadic snowfall. The Antarctic Desert's ice sheet is the largest freshwater reserve on Earth, accounting for approximately 70% of the planet’s freshwater supply. Due to the Earth's axial tilt, there are seasons of continuous daylight during summer months and total darkness during winter months in this desert. The constant sunlight during the summer can lead to an increase in the temperature, creating seasonal meltwater lakes. Despite these hostile environmental conditions, the Antarctic Desert is home to a unique and hardy array of native wildlife, such as the Emperor Penguin, the Weddell Seal, and the Antarctic krill, which form the base of the food chain. In terms of vegetation, only a few resilient forms of plants and mosses are found here due to the scarce availability of nutrients and the extreme climate. Although the continent of Antarctica is mostly uninhabited by humans, there are numerous research stations scattered across the continent, where scientists from various countries conduct research in the fields of climatology, geology, biology, and glaciology. The Antarctic Treaty, signed in 1959, regulates these activities and ensures that the continent remains a place of peace, scientific cooperation, and environmental preservation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Gaye proceeded to record some more politically conscious material at the Golden World Records studio, known as Motown's Studio B, as well as the preliminary vocals and instrumentation for some of the material to be featured on Let's Get It On. Following the earlier sessions in Detroit at Golden World, Gaye recorded at Hitsville West in Los Angeles from February to July 1973. Accompanied by an experienced group of session musicians called The Funk Brothers, who had contributed to Gaye's What's Going On, and received their first official credit, Gaye recorded the unreleased songs \\"The World is Rated X\\" and \\"Where Are We Going\\" and the single \\"You're the Man\\" (1972) at Golden World. \\"Where Are We Going\\" was later covered by trumpeter Donald Byrd. Gaye had planned the release of an album titled You're the Man, but it was later shelved for unknown reasons. The songs that were to be included on it, along with other unreleased recordings from Hitsville West and Golden World, were later featured on the 2001 re-release of Let's Get It On.  The album's first recording, \\"Let's Get It On\\", was composed by Gaye with friend and former Motown label mate Ed Townsend. It was originally written by Gaye as a religious ode to life, but Motown singer-songwriter Kenneth Stover re-wrote it as a more political first draft. Upon hearing Gaye's preliminary mix of Stover's draft, Townsend protested and claimed that the song would be better suited with sexual and romantic overtones, particularly \\"about making sweet love.\\" Gaye and Townsend rewrote the song's lyrics together with the original arrangements and musical accompaniment of the demo intact. The lyrics were inspired by Janis Hunter, whom Gaye had become infatuated with after meeting each other through Ed Townsend during the initial sessions. Townsend has cited Hunter's presence during the album's recording as an inspiration for Gaye. Gaye's intimate relationship with Hunter subsequently became the basis for his 1976 album I Want You. While recording the title track, he was inspired to revive unfinished recordings from his 1970 sessions at the Hitsville U.S.A. Studio.  Townsend assisted Gaye with producing the rest of the album, whose recording took place at several sessions throughout 1970 to 1973. They worked on four songs together, including the ballad \\"If I Should Die Tonight\\", while Gaye composed most of the other songs, including those from past sessions. \\"Just to Keep You Satisfied\\" was originally recorded by several Motown groups, including The Originals and The Monitors, as a song dedicated to long-standing love. With re-recording the song, he had re-written the arrangement and lyrics to address the demise of his volatile marriage to Anna Gordy Gaye, who happened to be the original song's co-writer. The background vocals for the album were sung by Gaye, with the exception of \\"Just to Keep You Satisfied\\", which were done by The Originals. Most of the instrumentation for the album was done by members of The Funk Brothers, including bassist James Jamerson, guitarists Robert White and Eddie Willis, and percussionist Eddie \\"Bongo\\" Brown. Gaye also contributed on piano during the sessions. Answer this question \\"Where was Let's get it on recorded?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"Let's Get It On was recorded at multiple locations, including Golden World Records studio (Motown's Studio B) in Detroit, Hitsville West in Los Angeles, and Hitsville U.S.A.

Sentence from a movie review: really funny  Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","output":"Based on the provided sentence from a movie review, which states that it was \\"really funny,\\" it can be inferred that the movie was seen positively by the reviewer.  Humor is a significant factor for many people when evaluating the quality of a film, particularly when it comes to comedies, as it indicates that the movie was successful in entertaining and amusing its audience. In the context of a one-sentence review, using the term \\"really funny\\" implies that the movie exceeded the expectations of a usual comedy and delivered humor in an effective and memorable way. While this brief review does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the film, it highlights one aspect that has resonated positively with the viewer, which is the humor. This positive reaction to the film's comedic elements suggests that the movie was able to engage and delight the reviewer, thus providing a favorable viewing experience.  It is essential to acknowledge, however, that a single positive aspect does not always define a movie's overall reception. Other factors, such as plot, character development, and filmmaking quality, can play crucial roles in determining whether a film is seen in a positive or negative light. In the absence of information about these aspects, one can only assume that the movie's humor contributed to a positive perception of the film. In conclusion, based on the sentence from the movie review mentioning that the film was \\"really funny,\\" it can be inferred that the movie was seen positively by the reviewer, at least in terms of its humor.

(Franco Origlia/Getty Images)      Since Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio became Pope Francis in March, the new pontiff has made headlines around the world for his emphasis on social and economic equality. The first major document of his papacy, released today, is no different. Though framed as a call for Catholics to embrace a new evangelization, much of “Evangelii Gaudium” is relevant to both Catholics and non-Catholics — especially the pope’s stinging critique of the unequal economy that we live in. He writes:      Just as the commandment “Thou shalt not kill” sets a clear limit in order to safeguard the value of human life, today we also have to say “thou shalt not” to an economy of exclusion and inequality. Such an economy kills. How can it be that it is not a news item when an elderly homeless person dies of exposure, but it is news when the stock market loses two points? This is a case of exclusion. Can we continue to stand by when food is thrown away while people are starving? This is a case of inequality. Today everything comes under the laws of competition and the survival of the fittest, where the powerful feed upon the powerless. As a consequence, masses of people find themselves excluded and marginalized: without work, without possibilities, without any means of escape.      Trickle-down economics comes in for a hiding, as does the market:      In this context, some people continue to defend trickle-down theories which assume that economic growth, encouraged by a free market, will inevitably succeed in bringing about greater justice and inclusiveness in the world. This opinion, which has never been confirmed by the facts, expresses a crude and naïve trust in the goodness of those wielding economic power and in the sacralized workings of the prevailing economic system. Meanwhile, the excluded are still waiting…. This imbalance is the result of ideologies which defend the absolute autonomy of the marketplace and financial speculation. Consequently, they reject the right of states, charged with vigilance for the common good, to exercise any form of control. A new tyranny is thus born, invisible and often virtual, which unilaterally and relentlessly imposes its own laws and rules.      Now, as Tim Fernholz and others have noted, Francis is far from the first pontiff to attack the capitalist system. But such a take is a bit too jaded. First, as Fernholz notes, Francis’s arguments are more specific, name-checking modern theories like “trickle-down” economics. Second, unlike many of his predecessors, Francis is actually practicing the humility he preaches, from giving up the opulent papal residence to using a 30-year-old Renault as his personal vehicle. And unlike all but his most immediate predecessors, the Web allows his calls for humility and equality to be broadcast directly to people around the world, rather than filtered through political and religious establishments. Francis’s approach is succeeding: There is evidence that the pope’s tenure has already seen many Catholics return to Mass (though the effect is mixed in the United States). Either way, the fact is that Francis is only saying what more and more people in the United States and around the world recognize: The increasing inequality of recent decades “cannot be the basis of hope for a better future.” Now if only our leaders would listen.      Gallery: Pope Francis’s acts of humility ||||| Look at this radical anti-capitalist. (Wikimedia Commons)      Can you believe the latest papal news, hot off the presses in Rome? Everyone’s talking about how a Catholic pope would criticize capitalism with words like these:      On inequality and the financialization of the economy: “Hence, by degrees it has come to pass that working men have been surrendered, isolated and helpless, to the hardheartedness of employers and the greed of unchecked competition. The mischief has been increased by rapacious usury, which, although more than once condemned by the Church, is nevertheless, under a different guise, but with like injustice, still practiced by covetous and grasping men. To this must be added that the hiring of labor and the conduct of trade are concentrated in the hands of comparatively few; so that a small number of very rich men have been able to lay upon the teeming masses of the laboring poor a yoke little better than that of slavery itself.”      On the welfare state: “As regards the State, the interests of all, whether high or low, are equal. The members of the working classes are citizens by nature and by the same right as the rich; they are real parts, living the life which makes up, through the family, the body of the commonwealth; and it need hardly be said that they are in every city very largely in the majority. It would be irrational to neglect one portion of the citizens and favor another, and therefore the public administration must duly and solicitously provide for the welfare and the comfort of the working classes; otherwise, that law of justice will be violated which ordains that each man shall have his due.”      On the virtues of wealth and poverty: “Therefore, those whom fortune favors are warned that riches do not bring freedom from sorrow and are of no avail for eternal happiness, but rather are obstacles; that the rich should tremble at the threatenings of Jesus Christ—threatenings so unwonted in the mouth of our Lord—and that a most strict account must be given to the Supreme Judge for all we possess…God Himself seems to incline rather to those who suffer misfortune; for Jesus Christ calls the poor “blessed”; He lovingly invites those in labor and grief to come to Him for solace; and He displays the tenderest charity toward the lowly and the oppressed. These reflections cannot fail to keep down the pride of the well-to-do, and to give heart to the unfortunate.”      On the abuse of workers: “The first thing of all to secure is to save unfortunate working people from the cruelty of men of greed, who use human beings as mere instruments for money-making. It is neither just nor human so to grind men down with excessive labor as to stupefy their minds and wear out their bodies.”      Oh, wait. Got my encyclicals mixed up. This is all from 1891, when Pope Leo XIII was trying to find a Catholic alternative to socialism and capitalism; his encyclical Rerum Novarum became central to the church’s economic thought. The text you’re probably looking for today is the 2013 apostolic exhortation of Pope Francis, which strikes similar themes. The 2013 version is more strident and specific, but perhaps that’s because so little has changed. ||||| ***      In 1962, as the Second Vatican Council opened in Rome, Europe was deeply divided. In his book What Happened at Vatican II, Jesuit historian John O’Malley set the scene:      The Iron Curtain had fallen. For Catholicism this meant, among other things, that even the simplest communication with bishops and the faithful in Eastern Europe was difficult and fraught with dangers. The arrest and trial of the primate of Hungary, Cardinal József Mindszenty, in 1948, opened the public’s eyes to the brutal attitude of the Communist regime toward the Church. The even more brutal suppression of the revolution there by Russian troops in 1956 was just one more confirmation that no reconciliation was possible between “the free world” and “the Soviet bloc.”      Thirteen years earlier, at the end of World War II, the Holy Office had officially excommunicated communists from the Catholic Church and declared the ideology at odds with fundamental tenets of the faith. But in the lead-up to the Council, it wasn't clear whether the broader body of Church leaders would make a similar statement. Several bishops from communist countries weren’t able to travel to Rome because their visas were denied. Although certain bishops, particularly those from the Eastern bloc, pushed for a sweeping statement against communism, the Council never formally considered a proposal to make a statement.      Before he died in 1963, the pope who convened the Council, John XXIII, did issue an encyclical, Pacem in Terris, which addressed the issue of “universal peace.” While he didn’t condemn communism, he did endorse democracy. “The fact that authority comes from God does not mean that men have no power to choose those who are to rule the State, or to decide upon the type of government they want,” he wrote. “Hence the above teaching is consonant with any genuinely democratic form of government.”      The following year, John’s successor, Pope Paul VI, made a much clearer statement against communism in his encyclical Ecclesiam Suam. “We are driven to repudiate such ideologies as deny God and oppress the Church,” he wrote. “These ideologies are often identified with economic, social and political regimes; atheistic communism is a glaring instance of this.”      Albeit in somewhat passive terms, the Church had made its political and economic position clear: It rejected communism, and specifically its suppression of religion, in favor of the West and democracy—which were tied tightly to free-market economic principles. Many years later, the Polish Pope John Paul II was given credit for helping to undermine communist rule in his country, where Catholic churches provided a space for anti-communist artists and thinkers to hold discussions and distribute anti-regime writings.      In light of this long-standing tension between the Church and communism, Pope Francis’s aggressively anti-capitalist posture seems all the more remarkable. The bishop of Rome hasn't just condemned what he sees as a failed free-market—he'a condemned the ethic and ideology that underlie free-market economies. “The culture of prosperity deadens us; we are thrilled if the market offers us something new to purchase,” Francis writes. “In the meantime all those lives stunted for lack of opportunity seem a mere spectacle; they fail to move us.\\" ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Pope Francis has made headlines for his emphasis on social and economic equality since he became Pope in 2013.

While both statements involve a man roller skating for a crowd of spectators, there are significant differences in the level of detail that prevent us from concluding that the first statement can be inferred from the second statement. The second statement, \\"Man roller skates for a crowd to watch,\\" is a more generalized and ambiguous version of the event without providing any specific information about the man's appearance or the exact circumstances of the display. On the other hand, the first statement, \\"A tall black man in yellow pants shows his roller-skating skills while pedestrians watch,\\" provides a more complete and vivid description of the scene. This statement indicates the man's height, race, clothing, and the fact that he is demonstrating skillful roller-skating. Moreover, it specifies that the spectators watching are pedestrians. There are multiple reasons why we cannot conclude the first statement based on the second statement: 1. The second statement does not mention any descriptive details about the man's appearance, while the first statement highlights that he is tall, black, and wearing yellow pants. 2. The second statement does not explicitly state that the man is showcasing his roller-skating skills, while the first statement emphasizes his skilled performance. 3. The second statement makes no mention of the type of crowd, whereas the first statement clarifies that the spectators are pedestrians. Given the lack of specific details in the second statement, it is not possible to ascertain whether the intended meaning aligns with the first statement.

Complete the next sentence: How to press tofu  Determine if you need to press the tofu at all.  Silken tofu does not need pressing, as it is softer and used more often in blended dishes. Firm and extra firm tofu almost always needs to be pressed, as it's density allows it to keep more water when cooking.","output":"To press firm or extra firm tofu, follow these steps: 1. Drain the tofu: Remove the tofu from its packaging and drain any excess water. This step is important because it helps to get rid of the initial moisture content before pressing. 2. Slice the tofu block: Cut the tofu into slabs about half an inch thick. Slicing it makes it easier for the moisture to be removed during pressing and can also help to achieve a more even press. 3. Prepare a clean towel or paper towel: Lay out a clean kitchen towel or several layers of paper towels on a flat surface. This helps to wick away moisture from the tofu during the pressing process. 4. Place the tofu on the towel: Arrange the tofu slices in a single layer on the towel or paper towel, leaving some space in between each piece to allow for proper absorption. 5. Cover the tofu: Place another layer of clean towel or paper towel on top of the tofu slices, ensuring they are fully covered. This helps to absorb the moisture that is pressed out of the tofu. 6. Add weight: Place a flat, heavy object on top of the covered tofu, such as a cutting board with a few canned goods or a heavy skillet. This applies pressure to the tofu, forcing the excess water out and into the towels. 7. Press the tofu: Leave the tofu to press for at least 30 minutes, although pressing for an hour or more can result in a firmer texture. Check the towels periodically and replace them if they become saturated with water. 8. Cook the tofu: Once the tofu has been pressed to your desired level of firmness, remove it from the towels, and it is ready to be prepared in your desired recipe. Pressed tofu has a better texture for dishes like stir-fries, grilled or pan-fried dishes, as it absorbs flavors and holds its shape better."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You guys don’t drink.’ The weekend incident comes two years after Ford’s drunken St. Patrick’s Day party inside the mayor’s office and months after he swore off drinking entirely after he admitted to smoking crack cocaine while in a 'drunken stupor.' After his crack-smoking confession last November, Ford swore off booze entirely, claiming that he had a ‘come to Jesus moment.’ He admitted to drinking again in January after video surfaced online of him inside the Steak Queen restaurant in Etobicoke where he appeared intoxicated as he swore and ranted in Jamaican patois.

During Spacey's appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live, the actor cracked several jokes at the mayor's expense when Spacey appeared after a brief cameo by Ford.

Hanson's popularity exploded during the summer of 1997, and Mercury Records released Hanson's first documentary Tulsa, Tokyo, and the Middle of Nowhere and their Christmas album Snowed In in the wake of their success. Hanson also launched MOE (which stood for Middle of Everywhere), a fan club magazine that ran for 12 issues. After numerous unauthorized biographies of each of the brothers were published, Hanson turned to their close friend, Jarrod Gollihare of Admiral Twin, to write their authorized biography. Hanson: The Official Book reached number 9 on the New York Times Best Sellers List (nonfiction) on February 1, 1998. The band was nominated for three Grammy Awards in 1998: Record of the Year, Best New Artist, and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. During the summer of 1998, Hanson began a highly successful concert tour, the Albertane Tour. They performed a string of shows throughout stadiums and arenas in the US, targeting young audiences with a playful and energetic style. A live album, titled Live From Albertane, was released the following fall, as well as their second documentary The Road to Albertane.  In response to the demand for their earlier work, Hanson re-released MMMBop as 3 Car Garage, minus four tracks, in May 1998. To date, the tracks from Boomerang have not been re-released. Three tracks from Boomerang (\\"Boomerang\\", \\"More Than Anything\\", and \\"Rain (Falling Down)\\") and two of the remaining tracks from MMMBop (\\"Incredible\\" and \\"Baby (You're So Fine)\\") were released on the first MOE CD sent to fan club members.  During the Albertane Tour, Hanson wrote and demoed what would later become the songs for their second major studio album, This Time Around. During this time period, Mercury Records, the band's label, had been merged with Island Def Jam. Almost immediately following the changeover in May 2000, Hanson released their second album, This Time Around, but due to lack of promotional funding, sales were low and the label eventually pulled funding for their tour. The band toured through the summer and fall of 2000 on their own funds.

I didnt have the workbook so maybe that would have helped, but so far this book is completely useless. I wouldnt recommend this unless you really love the pure formulas an no examples. If its required i guess its better than nothing Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","output":"This review depicts the product in an unflattering light.  Step 1: Identify the reviewer's opinion In this case, the reviewer's opinion is negative. They mention that the book is \\"completely useless\\" and that they \\"wouldn't recommend\\" it. Step 2: Analyze the comments about the product The reviewer points out that the book has very few numerical examples, and they did not have the workbook that could have potentially helped. This suggests that the book may not effectively explain or teach the subject of economics. Step 3: Determine if the reviewer is suggesting any positive aspects The only positive comment in the review is when the reviewer says, \\"If it's required, I guess it's better than nothing.\\" However, this comment is more of a resigned acceptance rather than a genuine appreciation of the product. Based on these steps, the review portrays the product in an unflattering light as the reviewer's opinion is negative, their comments focus on the product's shortcomings, and they only provide a faintly positive remark in the context of the product being a last resort."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For much of the world, the Algarve is synonymous with Portugal, yet the Portuguese will tell you the exact opposite: the region has little in common with the rest of the country. The southern stretch of coast is more reminiscent of a North African landscape than a European one. It has no cosmopolitan cities, like Lisbon and Porto, which are farther north. Most of Portugal is known for quaint towns, medieval castles, and grand palaces. The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments, hotels, and meticulously manicured golf courses. And beaches. Think Algarve and the mind pictures long, glorious stretches of golden sands, secluded coves framed by odd ochre-colored rock formations, and deep green waters. With about 160 km (100 miles) of coastline, Portugal's southern province is one of Europe's premier beach destinations. The occasionally chilly ocean is the Atlantic, but the Algarve has a sultry Mediterranean feel. Its consistent climate is the best in Portugal, and one of the kindest in the world: more than 250 days of sunshine a year — more than almost any other international resort area. The moderating effect of the Gulf Stream produces a fresh springtime breeze throughout winter, and in late January and February, white almond blossoms blanket the fields. In summer the heat is intense but rarely unbearable, and regardless, beautiful beaches and innumerable pools are always just a dive away. Magnificent year-round weather has made the Algarve a huge destination for sporting vacations. Superb golf facilities abound — several with tees dramatically clinging to cliffs and fairways just skirting the edge of the ocean — and horseback riding, tennis, big-game fishing, sailing, and windsurfing are immensely popular. Sports, beaches and hospitable weather — not to mention easily organized package vacations — are surely the reasons the Algarve receives as many visitors as the rest of Portugal in its entirety. But it's not just international tourists that descend on the Algarve; many Portuguese from Lisbon and elsewhere in the north have holiday homes and spend their summer vacations here. The coast is neatly divided into the rugged Barlavento to the west and the flat beauty of Sotavento to the east. West is where you'll find the famous orange cliffs and surreal eroded rock stacks.

I have a new situation: Two students read about brains in the animal kingdom. Tom read more about the brains of mammals, while Reed learned more about the brains of amphibians.  But I can use this background: The brains of all mammals have a unique layer of nerve cells covering the cerebrum. This layer is called the neocortex (the pink region of the brains in Figure above ). The neocortex plays an important role in many complex brain functions. In some mammals, such as rats, the neocortex is relatively smooth. In other mammals, especially humans, the neocortex has many folds. The folds increase the surface area of the neocortex. The larger this area is, the greater the mental abilities of an animal.  What is an answer for this question: Which student learned less about a unique layer of nerve cells covering the cerebrum?","output":"To answer this question, let's break down the information provided step-by-step.

Given the following passage  \\"The Epicureans and the Cynics rejected public offices and civic service, which amounted to a rejection of the polis itself, the defining institution of the Greek world. Epicurus promoted atomism and an asceticism based on freedom from pain as its ultimate goal. Cynics such as Diogenes of Sinope rejected all material possessions and social conventions (nomos) as unnatural and useless. The Cyrenaics meanwhile, embraced hedonism, arguing that pleasure was the only true good. Stoicism, founded by Zeno of Citium, taught that virtue was sufficient for eudaimonia as it would allow one to live in accordance with Nature or Logos. Zeno became extremely popular, the Athenians set up a gold statue of him and Antigonus II Gonatas invited him to the Macedonian court. The philosophical schools of Aristotle (the Peripatetics of the Lyceum) and Plato (Platonism at the Academy) also remained influential. The academy would eventually turn to Academic Skepticism under Arcesilaus until it was rejected by Antiochus of Ascalon (c. 90 BCE) in favor of Neoplatonism. Hellenistic philosophy, had a significant influence on the Greek ruling elite.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: This step may look different depending on the type of gum you've selected. If you have chosen a stick of gum, you might fold the piece in half as you pop it into your mouth. With smaller tabs, you might even place two in your mouth at once. If you've chosen a giant gumball, you may opt to bite off half. You may need to chew a bit more vigorously to loosen up a new piece of gum. Use your big teeth in the back of your mouth, called your molars, to chew. Molars are the teeth associated with chewing because of their flatter surfaces. This will ensure that one side of your mouth doesn't get tired from the repetitive chewing motion. Occasionally, draw the gum to the front of your mouth and exercise your biting teeth. This will give your molars a short break. If you are not in a formal setting, you can try blowing  bubbles. Enjoy the flavor that you've chosen. As you chew, the flavoring agents in the gum will gradually dissolve and be swallowed, so eventually the gum loses its flavor completely. Urban legend suggests that swallowed gum remains in your stomach for years, but this isn't factual. Gum is passed through your digestive tract into your stool. However, frequently swallowing your gum can lead to constipation and other minor stomach issues, so it isn't recommended.  The easiest thing is to just spit it out once you are finished. Because the gum is still sticky, it can make a big mess if you don't discard it properly. It's a good idea to save your gum wrapper so that you can wrap your gum in it when you've finished. If you didn't save the wrapper, just wrap it in a tissue or a scrap of paper.","output":"This is about chewing gum. There are different types of gum, like sticks, tabs, or big gumballs.

This solution not only ensured that his neighbors could enjoy a quieter atmosphere, but it also enhanced his own listening experience by blocking out any extraneous sounds. Another possible solution James considered was the installation of acoustic panels in his room. These panels, made from a variety of materials such as foam or fiberglass, are designed to absorb sound waves and dampen the propagation of noise. By strategically placing these sound-absorbing materials around his room, James could better isolate his music from other areas of the house and, by extension, from his neighbors. While researching these options, James also became aware of certain music genres that were more conducive to maintaining a peaceful environment. For instance, he discovered that ambient and classical music generally had a calming effect on listeners, reducing the likelihood of complaints from those around him. To further accommodate his neighbors, James decided to explore and incorporate these genres into his playlist during the hours when people were most likely to be at home and in need of quiet. Lastly, James resolved to establish a regular practice of communication with his neighbors, keeping the lines of dialogue open to ensure that he was aware of any potential issues that might arise. This proactive approach demonstrated his commitment to fostering a harmonious living atmosphere for everyone in the community. In summary, James needed to reduce the sound of his music in the neighborhood to maintain good relations with his neighbors and respect their need for peace and quiet. By investing in noise-cancelling headphones, installing acoustic panels, adjusting his music preferences, and engaging in ongoing communication with his fellow residents, he was able to create an environment that catered to both his love for music and his commitment to being a considerate neighbor."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the answer for the question: What is the partial collection that the government received from Steamtown that is still on display in Scranton? from the following article ?  Steamtown, U.S.A., was a steam locomotive museum that ran steam excursions out of North Walpole, New Hampshire, and Bellows Falls, Vermont, from the 1960s to 1983. The museum was founded by millionaire seafood industrialist F. Nelson Blount.  The non-profit Steamtown Foundation took over operations following his death in 1967. Because of Vermont's air quality regulations restricting steam excursions, declining visitor attendance, and disputes over the use of track, some pieces of the collection were relocated to Scranton, Pennsylvania, in the mid-1980s and the rest were auctioned off. After the move, Steamtown continued to operate in Scranton but failed to attract the expected 200,000–400,000 visitors.  Within two years the tourist attraction was facing bankruptcy, and more pieces of the collection were sold to pay off debt. In 1986, the United States House of Representatives, under the urging of Pennsylvania Representative Joseph M. McDade, voted to approve 8 million to study the collection and to begin the process of making it a National Historic Site. As a result, the National Park Service (NPS) conducted historical research on the equipment that remained in the Foundation's possession. This research was used as a Scope of Collections Statement for the Steamtown National Historic Site.  The scope was published in 1991 under the title Steamtown Special History Study. The report provided concise histories of each piece of equipment and made recommendations as to whether or not each piece belonged in the soon-to-be government-funded collection. By 1995, Steamtown had been acquired and developed by the NPS with a 66 million allocation. Several more pieces have been removed from the collection as a result of the government acquisition. Part of the Blount collection is still on display at the Steamtown National Historic Site in Scranton.

Question: who could disable the omnitrix's self-destruct-mode? Movie title: Ben 10: Secret of the Omnitrix Movie plot: During a battle with Dr. Animo, Ben Kirby Tennyson's destruction of the scientist's \\"DNA bomb\\" accidentally sets off a self-destruct protocol in the Omnitrix. Its activation alerts Tetrax (known as Hoverboard in \\"Hunted\\"), who travels with his alien blob-like pilot Gluto to Earth in order to retrieve Ben. He explains the situation to Ben, who hasn't figured out the meaning of the countdown. He leaves Gwen and Grandpa Max behind, not wanting the latter to be recognized during their trip. Gwen sneaks on board anyway. Using the advanced medical equipment on board his ship, Tetrax finds the DNA signature of the Omnitrix's creator, Azmuth, and tracks him to a prison facility called Incarcecon. During the journey, Tetrax hopes Ben would stop being a hero when the Omnitrix stop the countdown and Azmuth would shut it up for good. Ben is upset that he'll never be a hero again. After staging a breakout, they free a female Chimera Sui Generis (Vilgax's species) named Myaxx, who is Azmuth's assistant; she had switched her DNA signature for Azmuth's when he refused to give her credit for helping to create the Omnitrix. Myaxx is also unable to disarm the self-destruct, which will not only kill Ben, but most of the universe's inhabitants, including Earth itself, but Myaxx knows how to find Azmuth, and leads them to the planet he's hiding out on: Xenon. Vilgax, who has also picked up on the Omnitrix's self-destruct signal, picks up Sixsix (an alien who also appeared in 'Hunted' and tracks Ben). While attempting to reach Azmuth, they are attacked by Vilgax, who has escaped the Null Void and has commandeered a ship to track down Ben. Ben is ultimately successful in repelling the attack, though Gluto is killed in the conflict while protecting Gwen. Gwen blames Ben's selfishness despite the fact that Ben had nothing to do with it.

Coyote (Eatibus Anythingus) trudges across the desert floor, catching and eating anything that he finds to satisfy himself, ranging from a fly to an empty tin can, before being flattened by the Road Runner (Hot-roddicus Supersonicus). Wile E., after recovering, blinks his eyes and visualizes a wonderful Road Runner feast. Seeing no need for a comparatively tawdry can, he chases the Road Runner. Wile's low stance reduces his drag and allows him to approach the Road Runner until the bird rockets away. The coyote's eyes pop out of his sockets and he is left dejectedly planning his next scheme. 1. First, the coyote uses a pulley, rope and rock trap to smash the passing Road Runner, evidently hoping the extra complexity will stop himself from being squashed instead. No dice; Wile E. is squashed by the rock as the Road Runner stops and mocks him. 2. The clearly angry coyote, with a lasso in the road, listens for the Road Runner, but a truck trips the lasso first, dragging the coyote across the hard ground. Wile E. is left with a bare rear end from friction as he paces off the road. 3.

The camera displays a road with a pop-up grate intended to block the Road Runner; Wile tests its crank control successfully, but it fails to deploy against the speeding Road Runner. The coyote unsuccessfully tries numerous methods of unspringing the grate, then resumes the chase in outrage and is soon stopped by a railroad crossing.

They are especially dangerous in cases involving accidental consumption by children attracted to the bright red berries. Ingestion of over 20 berries may be fatal to children. Question: are the berries on a holly tree poisonous?","output":"Yes, the berries on a holly tree are poisonous to both humans and pets. The primary toxic components of holly berries are ilicin, saponins, and various alkaloids, which can cause a range of undesirable symptoms upon ingestion. In particular, holly berries have been known to cause vomiting and diarrhea, along with several other symptoms such as nausea, dehydration, dizziness, and stomach pain. When ingested in large quantities, holly berries pose a significant risk to small children who may be attracted to their bright red color and accidentally consume them. If a child consumes more than 20 holly berries, the toxic compounds present in the berries can be potentially fatal. In case of ingestion, it is essential to seek immediate medical attention, preferably with the assistance of a poison control center. Additionally, holly tree berries can pose a threat to pets, such as dogs and cats, since they may also be drawn to the colorful berries and consume them accidentally. Pets that ingest holly berries may exhibit symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, excessive drooling, and lack of coordination. In extreme cases, seizures may occur. It is crucial to contact a veterinarian promptly should your pet ingest holly berries to ensure that they receive appropriate treatment. To prevent accidents involving holly berries, it is important to be mindful of the presence of holly trees in your surroundings. In households with young children and pets, it is advisable to either remove holly trees or place barriers around them to minimize the risk of accidental consumption. In summary, holly tree berries are indeed poisonous, especially to young children and pets. Caution is vital when it comes to ensuring the safety of those who may be at risk of ingesting the berries. Immediate action should be taken in case of ingestion, as the toxic effects associated with the consumption of holly berries can be severe and potentially life-threatening."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - closet - musical instrument store - instrument case - music shop - music store  The answer is \\"instrument case\\" because Answer:","output":"Storing your mandolin in an instrument case is the best option among the choices provided, due to several reasons. An instrument case is specifically designed to protect and preserve the instrument from possible damage, maintain its optimal condition, and make transporting the mandolin more convenient and secure. 1. Protection: Instrument cases are made to shield your mandolin from a variety of potential hazards. They are constructed with durable materials that can withstand impact and prevent the mandolin from getting dented, scratched, or otherwise damaged. The case's interior also provides a cushioned environment, which helps absorb any shock the case might experience during transport. Furthermore, the case's design helps protect the mandolin from humidity and temperature fluctuations that can negatively impact the instrument's wooden components. 2. Preservation: Whenever the mandolin is not in use, it's essential to store it in a place where its condition remains consistent. An instrument case is designed to maintain optimal conditions for storage. The controlled environment inside the case allows the mandolin to age well, ensuring better sound quality over time. Proper storage also prevents warping and other damage that could weaken the instrument's structural integrity. 3. Transport: Cases for mandolins are specifically tailored to fit the instrument's unique shape and size snugly. This makes it easier to carry and transport your mandolin securely, as it will not shift or move around inside the case. Cases are often equipped with handles or straps for easy carry, and they can also be locked to prevent theft or tampering when you are traveling or storing your instrument away from home. 4. Organization: Mandolin cases often have compartments to store accessories such as picks, strings, tuners, and extra parts. Having these items organized and in one place makes it easy for you to access them when needed, prevents loss, and ensures that you are always prepared for performances, rehearsals, or practice sessions. In contrast, the other options listed – closet, musical instrument store, music shop, and music store – do not offer the same level of protection, preservation, and convenience as an instrument case. Storing your mandolin in a closet may expose it to changes in temperature and humidity, while leaving it at a musical instrument store, music shop, or music store means it is more susceptible to accidents or misplacement. In conclusion, an instrument case is the most suitable and practical option for storing your mandolin when not in use. Not only does it protect your instrument from potential damage and provide a consistent storage environment, but it also makes transportation and organization more manageable. By storing your mandolin in a proper instrument case, you can ensure that it remains in good condition and continues to produce high-quality sound throughout its life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  A few weeks after Of Human Feelings was recorded, Mwanga went to Japan to negotiate a deal with Trio Records to have the album released on Phrase Text. Trio, who had previously released a compilation of Coleman's 1966 to 1971 live performances in Paris, prepared to press the album once Mwanga provided the label with the record stamper. Coleman was also set to perform his song \\"Skies of America\\" with the NHK Symphony Orchestra, but cancelled both deals upon Mwanga's return from Japan. Mwanga immediately quit after less than four months as Coleman's manager. In 1981, Coleman hired Stan and Sid Bernstein as his managers, who sold the album's recording tapes to Island Records. He signed with the record label that year, and Of Human Feelings was released in 1982 on Island's subsidiary jazz label Antilles Records. Billboard magazine published a front-page story at the time about its distinction as both the first digital album recorded in New York City and the first digital jazz album recorded by an American label.According to jazz writer Francis Davis, \\"a modest commercial breakthrough seemed imminent\\" for Coleman, who appeared to be regaining his celebrity. German musicologist Peter Niklas Wilson said the album may have been the most tuneful and commercial-sounding of his career at that point. The album's clean mix and relatively short tracks were interpreted as an attempt for radio airplay by Mandel, who described its production as \\"the surface consistency that would put it in the pop sphere\\". Of Human Feelings had no success on the American pop charts, only charting on the Top Jazz Albums, where it spent 26 weeks and peaked at number 15. Because the record offered a middle ground between funk and jazz, McRae argued that it consequently appealed to neither demographic of listeners. Sound & Vision critic Brent Butterworth speculated that it was overlooked because it had electric instruments, rock and funk drumming, and did not conform to what he felt was the hokey image of jazz that many of the genre's fans...

This move further complicates efforts to close the infamous detention center, which has long been a subject of human rights concerns and international criticism. Background Established in 2002 during the George W. Bush administration in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Guantanamo Bay detention facility in Cuba has been home to hundreds of detainees, most of whom were captured in the war against terrorism. Throughout its existence, the detention center has been marred by numerous allegations of abuse, torture, and indefinite detention, leading to calls from human rights groups, foreign governments, and even past and present U.S. officials for its closure. Efforts to Close Guantanamo In 2009, President Barack Obama issued an executive order directing the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility within one year. However, various legal, political, and logistical hurdles have prevented the fulfillment of that order. Then-President Trump endorsed keeping the prison open during his term, further halting progress on its closure. In January 2021, President Joe Biden reiterated his commitment to closing the detention facility, stating that doing so would uphold America's values and signal a departure from controversial counterterrorism policies. However, the recent House vote against transferring detainees to U.S. soil makes it increasingly challenging to fulfill this pledge. The House Vote The amendment to prohibit the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the United States was introduced in the House of Representatives by Republican Congressman Mat Gates. The amendment received broad support from Republicans and a handful of Democrats, resulting in a final vote of 218-204. Some legislators argue that the detainees should not be released or transferred until there are clear plans for their ultimate disposition. The primary argument against bringing detainees to U.S. soil lies in the concern that doing so could pose a security risk to the nation. Proponents of this position argue that these individuals, who have allegedly been involved in terrorism and other illicit activities, may pose continued threats if they are allowed back into the United States. Additionally, there is the potential for unrest and hostility from communities where these detainees would be held or put on trial. Counterarguments Critics of the recent House vote assert that the refusal to transfer detainees to U.S. soil perpetuates the inhumane conditions and marginalization that have long plagued Guantanamo. They note that many of these detainees have never been charged and may have been wrongfully held, leading to further human rights abuses. These opponents argue that transferring detainees to face trial and potential imprisonment in the United States would not only uphold the rule of law but also provide these individuals with due process, a principle enshrined in the U.S. Constitution. Furthermore, they believe that the closure of Guantanamo Bay would remove a significant recruitment tool for terrorist organizations and demonstrate America's commitment to upholding human rights. Conclusion The decision by the House of Representatives to vote against bringing Guantanamo Bay detainees to U.S. soil underscores the complexity and sensitivity surrounding the future of this notorious detention facility and its prisoners. Despite President Biden's stated intent to close Guantanamo, achieving that objective will be an uphill battle requiring untangling layers of legal, political, and ethical issues. The recent House vote is a reminder of the deep divisions that persist in the quest for a resolution to a persistent international headache, the Guantanamo Bay detention facility."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: U.S. lawmakers grilled Trump administration officials Tuesday about the war in Afghanistan, saying the new White House strategy was inconsistent and was not producing results. The comments made at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing reflected growing frustration in Congress about the U.S.-led war, which is entering its 17th year. ​As recently as November, General John Nicholson, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, acknowledged that the conflict remained a stalemate. Since then, a wave of high-profile insurgent attacks have rocked the capital, Kabul. The Taliban now controls or contests almost half the country, according to latest U.S. estimates. Despite the setbacks, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, who is helping oversee the new White House strategy, gave a positive assessment of the conflict. \\"The president's South Asia strategy is showing some signs of progress,\\" Sullivan said. \\"On the battlefield, we are seeing the Taliban's momentum begin to slow.\\" But lawmakers from both parties expressed skepticism. \\"Something is clearly not working,\\" said Senator Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat and longtime Afghan war critic. \\"By any standard, the current security situation is grim.\\" Some lawmakers took aim at President Donald Trump, who last week said he didn't want to talk with the Taliban — a statement that seemingly contradicted his own strategy. After Sullivan and a top Pentagon official told the lawmakers that the U.S. was in fact still open to negotiations with the Taliban, lawmakers pressed for more details. \\"You can see that the world and those involved in the peace process may be pretty confused about what the U.S. position is. What is it?\\" asked Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat. Sullivan said he thought Trump was expressing a reaction to last month's terrorist attacks, and was pointing out that \\"significant elements of the Taliban are not prepared to negotiate.\\" \\"And it may take a long time before they are willing to negotiate,\\" he added.

Only 0.5% is absorbed when insoluble forms of uranium, such as its oxide, are ingested, whereas absorption of the more soluble uranyl ion can be up to 5%. However, soluble uranium compounds tend to quickly pass through the body, whereas insoluble uranium compounds, especially when inhaled by way of dust into the lungs, pose a more serious exposure hazard. After entering the bloodstream, the absorbed uranium tends to bioaccumulate and stay for many years in bone tissue because of uranium's affinity for phosphates. Uranium is not absorbed through the skin, and alpha particles released by uranium cannot penetrate the skin. What happens to a majority of ingested uranium?","output":"When someone ingests uranium, most of it leaves their body during digestion.

Possible A: retire, direct traffic, case, fine person for speeding, order to stop running  Why is \\"retire\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Retire\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it takes into consideration the typical age for retirement and the physical demands of a job like a police officer.  Step 1: Understand the context of the question and possible answers. The given question asks about the possible actions of a police officer in their sixties. Possible answers include retire, direct traffic, case, fine person for speeding, and order to stop running.  Step 2: Consider the typical age for retirement.  In many countries, the retirement age ranges between 60 to 65 years old. This means that when people reach their sixties, they are usually nearing or at the age where they might consider or be eligible to retire. Step 3: Take into account the physical demands of a police officer. Being a police officer can be physically demanding because it involves activities such as chasing suspects, making arrests, and dealing with emergencies. With age, one's physical capabilities might decline, making it harder to efficiently and safely perform in such roles. Step 4: Compare \\"retire\\" to the other possible answers. Given the retirement age and the physical demands of the job, \\"retire\\" becomes a more plausible and reasonable answer aligned with human common sense as it considers the natural progression of an individual's career and age-related factors. While the other possible answers involve actions a police officer might take, \\"retire\\" specifically addresses the age context of the question. So, \\"retire\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense based on the typical age for retirement and the physical demands associated with being a police officer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To control the \\"happy\\" effect of major key, they also played the minor key  pieces in major key, and vise versa. The researchers explained that sad music aroused contradictory emotions because the participants of the study tended to feel sad to be more tragic and less romantic than they felt themselves while listening to it. \\" In general, sad music causes sadness in listeners, and sadness is regarded as an unpleasant emotion. If sad music actually arouses only unpleasant emotion, we would not listen to it,\\" the researchers wrote in the study. \\"Music that is believed as sad actually causes romantic emotion as well as sad emotion.And people, regardless of their musical training, experience this ambivalent  emotion to listen to the sad music,\\" added the researchers. Also, unlike sadness in daily life, sadness experienced through art actually feels pleasant, possibly because the latter does not cause an actual threat to our safety. This could help people to deal with their negative emotions in daily life, concluded the authors. \\"Emotion experienced by music has no direct danger or harm unlike the emotion experienced in everyday life. Therefore, we can even enjoy unpleasant emotion such as sadness. If we suffer from unpleasant emotion aroused through daily life, sad music might be helpful...

Movie title: Tideland Context: Tideland centers on an abandoned child, Jeliza-Rose, and her solitary adventures during one summer in rural Texas while staying at a rundown farmhouse called What Rocks, and focuses on the increasingly dark, imaginative fantasy life the girl creates with the aid of dismembered Barbie doll heads that she often wears on her fingertips. With names such as Mystique, Sateen Lips, Baby Blonde and Glitter Gal, the doll heads not only engage in long conversations with Jeliza-Rose, reflecting different aspects of the girl's psyche, but also act as her companions while she explores the barren Texas landscape. After her mother chokes to death, Jeliza-Rose and her father, Noah, flee to Noah's mother's home, a remote Texas farmhouse. Noah fears that with all the drugs in their house he will lose Jeliza-Rose and be sent to prison, so he attempts to set it alight before they leave, although Jeliza-Rose manages to stop him. They find the farmhouse abandoned, but they settle in anyway. Their first night there, Noah dies from a heroin overdose. For much of the rest of the film, Noah's corpse remains seated upright in a living room chair with sunglasses covering his eyes. As her father slowly begins to decompose, Jeliza-Rose doesn't readily acknowledge his death because she has grown accustomed to him being unconscious for long periods at a time. Instead, she retreats deeper and deeper into her own mind, exploring the tall grass around the farmhouse, relying on her doll heads for friendship as an unconscious way of keeping herself from feeling too lonely and afraid. During Jeliza-Rose's wanderings, she eventually encounters and befriends her neighbors, a mentally impaired young man called Dickens and his older sister Dell who is blind in one eye from a bee sting. At this point the story begins to unfold, revealing a past connection between Dell and Jeliza-Rose's deceased father.

When Roman goes to meet with him again he finds Roenick murdered seconds before other police arrive, pinning him as the prime suspect. Things only get worse for Roman when Internal Affairs investigator Terence Niebaum (J. T.

After the gun that killed Roenick is linked to a case Roman had worked on, Niebaum and other investigators search Roman's house and discover papers for an offshore bank account with a deposit equal to one of the amounts of money embezzled. Roman is made to surrender his gun and badge and his colleagues are doubtful of his protests of innocence. With murder and embezzlement charges pending, Roman storms into Niebaum's office and demands answers about who set him up. When Niebaum stonewalls, Roman takes Niebaum, his administrative assistant Maggie (Siobhan Fallon), police commander Grant Frost (Ron Rifkin), and two-bit con man Rudy Timmons (Paul Giamatti) as hostages.

One possible expanded answer could be: The period that ended towards the end of the 18th century is often referred to as the \\"First British Empire\\" by some historians. This era began with the establishment of English and later, British, overseas colonies in various parts of the world, and ended with the loss of the Thirteen Colonies in North America after the American War of Independence.  During the 16th and 17th centuries, England, later becoming Great Britain after the Acts of Union 1707, established and expanded its colonies in the Americas, the Caribbean, and the Indian subcontinent. Key events during this period include the founding of Jamestown in 1607, the first permanent English settlement in present-day United States, and the growth of English influence in regions such as the West Indies and India, particularly due to the activities of organizations like the British East India Company. The First British Empire saw the foundation of British imperial power through maritime trade, colonization, and military conquest. Its global reach created and facilitated the exchange of ideas, goods, and people, resulting in significant cultural, economic, and political changes throughout the territories under its control. One notable consequence was the development of the transatlantic slave trade, which played a significant role in the economic growth of the British Empire, but at the same time caused immense human suffering and has had lasting negative impacts. The era saw its end with the conclusion of the American War of Independence in 1783, when Britain recognized the independence of the United States following the Treaty of Paris. This marked the loss of the Thirteen Colonies and a significant reduction in British influence in North America. Britain's imperial focus later shifted towards Africa and Asia, particularly India, leading to what is commonly known as the \\"Second British Empire.\\" In summary, the period referred to as the \\"First British Empire\\" ended towards the end of the 18th century with the loss of the Thirteen Colonies, following the American War of Independence. This period saw the establishment and growth of British colonial power in various parts of the world and had lasting effects on the countries and cultures involved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Q: In which order does the reactivity of halogen group decline?   A: The answer is:","output":"To find the order in which the reactivity of the halogen group declines, follow these steps: 1. Identify the halogen group: The halogen group consists of elements in Group 17 of the periodic table. These elements include fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine (I), and astatine (At). 2. Analyze the periodic trends: Reactivity in the halogen group is mainly determined by the ability of the halogen atom to attract electrons to form a bond with other atoms. The larger the halogen atom, the lower its electronegativity and reactivity. As you move down the group, atomic size increases due to the addition of electron shells, and electronegativity decreases. 3. Order the reactivity: Based on the periodic trends mentioned above, the reactivity of the halogen group declines in the following order: Fluorine (F) > Chlorine (Cl) > Bromine (Br) > Iodine (I) > Astatine (At) So, the order of decreasing reactivity in the halogen group is from F to At."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He converces schizophrenically with himself via tape recordings of his own voice. He is also being hounded by Randy (Pier Luigi Conti), a shady loan shark whom he owes money to after accruing bad gambling debts.Lester picks up a certain Maggie MacDonald (Sasha Darwin), an obnoxious, hysterical, mustached, sexually frustrated alcoholic, whom he invites over at his house for dinner. His attempt to poison her is thwarted because she is already so drunk when she arrives at his place that she spills her glass of wine onto the floor.

Figures for different police areas vary, with 43 FBOs for under-18s in one force's area and none in many others. People with FBOs may have to surrender passports before overseas matches, such as the current Euro 2016 tournament. England fans - and those from countries including Russia and Croatia - have been involved in violence at the championship in France. FBOs can be issued by courts after a football-related conviction, or following complaints by police forces or prosecutors. They can last from three to 10 years, and breaching an order can lead to a Â£5,000 fine or a prison sentence. The figures on FBOs, obtained by the Press Association through the Freedom of Information Act, cover the three years up to March 2016.

The Circle, dedicated to protecting ancient artifacts and knowledge, has been active for centuries and has counted members from all over the world. Members of The Circle have been in hiding for years due to an ongoing battle with a rival group, The Terminus Order, which seeks those same artifacts for their own nefarious purposes. Upon learning this, Mark and Damien become determined to learn more about The Circle and their family's involvement. They embark on a journey to uncover long-lost secrets and protect their family legacy. As they travel, Damien begins to uncover his hidden talents, passed down from generations of Circle members. His artistic abilities allow him to see symbolism and clues that others cannot, which turn out to be essential in locating ancient artifacts. Mark, who has been part of The Circle for many years, serves as a mentor to Damien, teaching him the ways of the secret society and the history of their family's involvement.

What is a sentence that would be (on a scale from 0 to 5) a 3 out of 5 in terms of textual similarity to the above sentence?","output":"\\"An echidna is gnawing on a towel.\\" Explanation: This sentence draws a 3 out of 5 similarity to the original sentence (\\"A hedgehog is biting at a blanket.\\") for several reasons. First, the structure of the sentence is nearly identical. They both begin with an article (\\"A\\"/\\"An\\") followed by an animal, a linking verb (\\"is\\"), a verb related to biting (\\"biting\\" / \\"gnawing\\"), a preposition (\\"at\\" / \\"on\\"), an article (\\"a\\"), and a noun related to a textile or fabric (\\"blanket\\" / \\"towel\\"). Second, the content is also similar. Both sentences describe a small, prickly mammal engaging in the behavior of biting or gnawing on a fabric item. An echidna, like a hedgehog, is a small, spiny mammal. Here, the distinct differences between the two sentences lie within the specific choice of animal and textile. A hedgehog is not an echidna, and a blanket is not a towel, but they are close enough in nature to draw a parallel without being directly synonymous or equivalent, thus falling midway on the scale of 0 to 5. Lastly, the action of the animal in the sentence, i.e., \\"biting at\\" and \\"gnawing on\\", is not identical but similar in nature, making the sentence somewhat but not completely similar to the original sentence. While \\"biting\\" and \\"gnawing\\" might imply slightly different actions, both convey the image of the animal using its teeth to interact with the fabric object.  Therefore, due to similar structure, content, and action, the sentence draws a moderate or 3 out of 5 similarity rating to the original sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: Are Extended Warranties Worth The Money? By Marianne Goldstein CBS August 10, 2007, 3:36 PM When you're about to purchase a big-ticket item such as a plasma TV, or even a fragile small item like a PDA, you're usually offered the chance to extend the manufacturer's warranty — for a fee. But is this insurance really necessary — or can it pay for itself? Do you have to sign up while you're signing on the dotted line? The Early Show's financial guru, Ray Martin, weighs the pros and cons of extended warranties. A few years ago extended warranties were only offered on costly appliances and big-ticket items. But today, these \\"protection plans\\" are offered on just about any appliance or consumer electronics products you can buy. For years, consumer advocates such as Consumer Reports have cautioned against buying extended warranties. But that advice may be in need of updating. In a recent development, many appliance makers are consolidating the terms of warranty coverage on their products to include one period covering all parts and service. The period is one year — after that, if a part wears out or breaks, you'll pay. Before this, appliance makers would have warranties with different coverage periods for various parts, ranging from five to 20 years. Now they say a simpler and clearer warranty — one that covers all parts and services for the same one-year period — will benefit consumers. The reality is that in most cases, manufacturers' warranties for many appliances will be shorter and if you want to extend the warranty coverage for periods longer than a year, you'll have to open your wallet.Shorter and \\"simpler\\" warranties for appliance brands such as Whirlpool, Roper, Estate, General Electric, Hotpoint, Maytag, Amana, Frigidaire and many other brands went into effect late last year and earlier this year. Some premium appliance brands still offer warranties that apply for longer than a year. Some consumer electronics makers have also cut their warranties. For example, according to PC World magazine, Dell used to offer a three-year warranty on numerous products — but has cut warranties on some products to just one year, and just three months on others. Once the manufacturer's warranty runs out, all costs for repairs are borne by the consumer, unless you pay for an extended warranty.Extended WarrantiesAn extended warranty typically covers the costs of repairing or replacing an item during the same period when the manufacturer's warranty runs — and extends for an additional period of time, typically two to five years from the date of purchase. Extended warranties may also cover items that are never covered by the manufacturer, such as normal wear, damage caused by a power surge, and additional services such as annual cleaning and preventative maintenance.\\"Chili Dog With Cheese\\"Anyone who buys an appliance or consumer electronics from a major retailer is likely to be asked, \\"Would you like to purchase an extended warranty with that?\\" According to reports, many large electronics retailers, such as Best Buy and Staples, encourage their salespeople to offer additional extended warranty coverage on every sale, but they don't directly pay commissions to their sales people on these. Instead, they may pay an indirect benefit, such as a team bonus for the shift that sells the most extended warranties. But sales reps are getting into the game, even having code names for the sales. According to reports, in online forums a good sale without a warranty is a \\"hot dog\\" but a good sale with an extended warranty is a \\"chili dog with cheese.\\"The feeling by some consumers that extended warranties are just an add-on to boost profits is justified. According to industry experts, the profit margins on these are often 50 percent. Also, according to Consumer Reports, when the cost of an extended warranty exceeds 20 percent of the item's purchase price, it's often not a good deal for the consumer because the cost of the warranty is not likely to be less than the cost of a typical repair. When Wal-Mart enters the market for anything, the rules of the game can change. Wal-Mart now offers extended warranties that kick in only after the manufacturer's warranty expires, so there is no overlap. According to sampling by Warranty Week, Wal-Mart's extra coverage on consumer electronics costs about six to nine percent of the purchase price — versus 15 to 25 percent at the large electronics retailers. Because of the lower cost for the extra coverage on items purchased at Wal-Mart, buying the extended warranty may be worth it.A Better Bet on Some Products If you are thinking that the decision of whether or not to pay for an extended warranty is similar to buying insurance you may never need, you are not alone. The point is that the product you buy may never need a repair at all, so paying for an extended warranty can feel like throwing money away. But some products are more likely than others to need repairs within the first three years from date of purchase. Below is a list of products and repair rates from Consumer Reports:Product Repair RateDesktop PC 37%Laptop PC 33%Refrigerator 28%Washing Machine 22%Projection TV 16%Vacuum Cleaner 13%Dishwasher 13%Clothes Dryer 13%Microwave Oven 12%Camcorder 8%Digital Camera 8%(Source: Consumer Reports Annual Questionnaire, based on three-year-old products.)Missing on the list above are LCD and Plasma TV sets. Given that these are relatively new products (particularly plasma TVs), there is not yet enough data to determine the odds of needing a repair in the first three years. With the cost of an extended warranty for these products equaling approximately the costs of a repair, it may be prudent to consider buying the extra warranty coverage, particularly if the coverage is less than 20 percent of the cost of the item. Also, if you will use the item for your small business and quick repairs are important, buying an extended warranty with additional repair coverage may be worth it. But consumers don't need to make the decision to buy extended warranty coverage at the point of purchase and under pressure. Many retailers allow 30 days after the purchases to make a decision to buy the extra coverage.Who Buys Extended WarrantiesAccording to Warranty Week, consumers spent more than 16 billion on extended warranties last year. In a PC World survey of consumers who bought products from many retailers, including Best Buy, Circuit City and Dell, about 63 percent said they had bought extended warranties and on average 71 percent of these consumers are glad they purchased the extended warranty coverage. Of the 37 percent who said they did not buy an extended warranty, only 23 percent said they regretted it and wished they had bought one when their product failed after the manufacturers warranty expired.What to Know Before You BuyBefore you buy extended warranty coverage, here's what to think about: Copyright 2007 CBS. All rights reserved. Summary:","output":"This news article talks about whether extended warranties are worth the money when buying things like TVs or other electronics. It explains how companies have changed their warranties to make them more simple, but sometimes shorter. Extended warranties can help, but they can also be expensive. It's important to think about whether you really need one before you buy it. Some stores, like Walmart, offer cheaper extended warranties that might be worth looking into."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

OPT:  (a). no  (b). yes","output":"(b). yes Indeed, the questions \\"What TV series are worth watching?\\" and \\"Which TV series are worth watching?\\" essentially have the same meaning. Both are open-ended questions seeking for suggestions of notable or highly-recommended television series to watch. Additionally, both use interrogative words that are often used interchangeably ('what' and 'which'). Nonetheless, while the central meaning is the same, there's a slight difference in connotation. 'What’ is usually used when there is an unlimited number of possible answers, as it presents a more general inquiry. So, when you ask 'What TV series are worth watching?', it means you are open to hearing about any TV series that the respondent feels is worth watching, regardless of genre, broadcast year, or platform.  On the other hand, 'Which' is typically used when the number of options is limited, either by previous conversation or context. This implies a narrower, more specific choice. For instance, if you are having a conversation about HBO and Netflix TV series and you asked, ‘Which TV shows are worth watching?', this means you are only interested in hearing about TV series from HBO or Netflix. On the contrary, in most (if not all) contexts, the two questions will be taken to mean exactly the same thing. Audience will understand you're seeking suggestions for television series and will respond accordingly—with their suggestions and personal preferences, typically not limited by any specific subset unless previously stated in the context. Let's recommend some TV series! Some perennial fan favorites across different genres include: 1. Drama: \\"The Sopranos\\", \\"Breaking Bad\\", \\"The Wire\\", \\"Mad Men\\", and \\"Game of Thrones\\". 2. Comedy: \\"The Office (US)\\", \\"Parks and Recreation\\", \\"Friends\\", \\"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\\", and \\"The Big Bang Theory\\". 3. Fantasy/Sci-fi: \\"Stranger Things\\", \\"The Witcher\\", \\"The Mandalorian\\", \\"Doctor Who\\", and \\"The Expanse\\". 4. Crime/Thriller: \\"Sherlock\\", \\"The Crown\\", \\"Better Call Saul\\", \\"Money Heist\\", and \\"Mindhunter\\". 5. Animation: \\"Rick and Morty\\", \\"Bojack Horseman\\", \\"The Simpsons\\", \\"Adventure Time\\", and \\"Avatar: The Last Airbender\\".

I read this background article the other day: Human beings invented agriculture about 10,000 years ago. This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly.  I am facing a new situation today: Gary researched two old human settlements. Village A was smaller, it existed about 12,000 years ago. He also studied village B, which existed about 6,000 years ago. The village was much bigger and better developed.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which village had a less dependable food supply available? A:","output":"The village that likely had a less dependable food supply would be Village A. To justify my answer, let's refer to the information provided in the background article and the situation: 1. Human beings invented agriculture around 10,000 years ago.

Village B, on the other hand, existed around 6,000 years ago. This is well into the period after the invention of agriculture, indicating that this settlement likely had access to consistent agriculture and therefore a more dependable food supply.

Amanda Holden, one of the competition's judges, was brought to tears, and the audience offered Johnston a standing ovation. Johnston was tipped as the favourite to win the competition. Later, Johnston described his initial audition as daunting, saying that \\"it was scary singing in front of 2,500 people. I had never sang on stage before – then there was also Simon, Amanda and Piers\\". He won his semi-final heat on 27 May 2008, receiving the most public votes on the night and thereby qualifying for the final. He sang \\"Tears in Heaven\\" by Eric Clapton; judge Holden told him he had \\"a gift from God in [his] voice\\". At the final on 30 May, he again sang \\"Pie Jesu\\". He finished in third place, behind the winner, the street dancer George Sampson and runners-up, the dance group Signature. Johnston left the stage in tears, later saying that he \\"was upset.

Elizabeth Masterson, a young emergency medicine physician whose work is her whole life, is in a serious car accident while on her way to a blind date. Three months later, David Abbott, a landscape architect recovering from the sudden death of his wife, moves into the apartment that had been Elizabeth's, after 'discovering' it in what seems to be a fateful happenstance. Elizabeth's spirit begins to appear to David in the apartment with ghostly properties and abilities that make it clear that something is not right. She can suddenly appear and disappear, walk or move through walls and objects, and once takes over his actions. When they meet, they are both surprised, as Elizabeth is still unaware of her recent history and refuses to think she is dead. David tries to have her spirit exorcised from the apartment, but to no avail. Since only David can see and hear her, others think that he is hallucinating and talking to himself. David and Elizabeth begin to bond, as much as that is possible, and he takes her out of town to a beautiful landscaped garden he designed. Elizabeth tells him she senses she has been there before, and in fact, the garden was something she was dreaming of in the opening scenes of the film, where she was awakened by a colleague from cat-napping after working a 23-hour shift in the hospital. Together, assisted by a psychic bookstore clerk, Darryl, Elizabeth and David find out who she is, what happened to her, and why they are connected. She is not dead, but in a coma, her body being kept on life support at the hospital where she used to work.

Defeated last month for re-election, Gov.

În democraţiile cu tradiţie din Occident este de neconceput ca un politician să rămână pe acelaşi post dacă imaginea sa este afectată în vreun fel. Translate to English English:","output":"In Western democracies with established traditions, it is unthinkable for a politician to remain in the same position if their image is tarnished in any way. In Western democracies, which have a long-standing history of upholding democratic values and treating every citizen in a fair and transparent manner, it is absolutely inconceivable for a political figure to continue occupying their position if their reputation suffers any sort of setback or damage. The foundations of these democracies are largely built on the principles of openness, trust, and accountability, all of which are essential for their proper functioning and continued success. A political leader's image and reputation are critical aspects of their ability to effectively govern and make sound decisions on behalf of the people they represent. If a politician is embroiled in a scandal, is found to have lied, or has been involved in any conduct that is considered unethical or morally dubious, public confidence in their integrity and ability to lead will be significantly eroded. As a result, their positions, policies, and decisions come under increased scrutiny, leading to a general decline in the overall stability and credibility of the government or political party they belong to. In times when the trust between a politician and the public is compromised, it is crucial for the political leader in question to either step down from their post voluntarily or be removed through legal means such as impeachment or a vote of no confidence. This is because the essence of democracy lies in the will of the people and the understanding that those who are elected to serve should be accountable for their actions. A politician who remains in office despite evidence of misconduct or a damaged reputation is essentially undermining the core democratic principles that constitute the foundation of such political systems. Moreover, preserving political integrity and reputation is also vital in order to maintain productive diplomatic relations with other countries and international institutions. A leader with a tarnished image is likely to experience difficulties in negotiations, alliances, and forming partnerships on the global stage, as they may be perceived as untrustworthy or unreliable. This can hinder a country's ability to effectively address issues of international concern, ranging from trade and economic collaboration to security and climate change. In conclusion, the idea of a politician remaining in the same position with a tarnished image is entirely unacceptable in Western democracies with long-standing traditions. Upholding the principles of transparency, trust, and accountability is of the utmost importance for the continued stability and success of any democratic system. When the reputation of a political leader is in question, it is crucial for the democratic process to ensure that the individual is held accountable, either through resignation or legal removal from their post, in order to preserve the integrity of the system and continue serving the best interests of the people."},{"instruction":"Given those answer options, answer the question: Fact 1: Burning wood is used to produce heat.

Information:  - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines.  - Andesite (or ) is an extrusive igneous, volcanic rock, of intermediate composition, with aphanitic to porphyritic texture. In a general sense, it is the intermediate type between basalt and dacite, and ranges from 57 to 63% silicon dioxide (SiO) as illustrated in TAS diagrams. The mineral assemblage is typically dominated by plagioclase plus pyroxene or hornblende. Magnetite, zircon, apatite, ilmenite, biotite, and garnet are common accessory minerals. Alkali feldspar may be present in minor amounts. The quartz-feldspar abundances in andesite and other volcanic rocks are illustrated in QAPF diagrams.  - An effusive eruption is a type of volcanic eruption in which lava steadily flows out of a volcano onto the ground. Effusive eruption differs from explosive eruption, wherein magma is violently fragmented when expelled from a volcano. The shape of the lava flows created by effusive eruptions is governed by the type of lava, rate and duration of eruption, and slope of the surrounding areas.  - An explosive eruption is a volcanic term to describe a violent, explosive type of eruption. Mount St. Helens in 1980 was an example. Such eruptions result when sufficient gas has dissolved under pressure within a viscous magma such that expelled lava violently froths into volcanic ash when pressure is suddenly lowered at the vent. Sometimes a lava plug will block the conduit to the summit, and when this occurs, eruptions are more violent. Explosive eruptions can send rocks, dust, gas and pyroclastic material up to 20 km into the atmosphere at rate of up to 100,000 tonnes per second, traveling at several hundred meters per second. This cloud will then collapse, creating a pyroclastic flow of hot volcanic matter.  - Magma (from Ancient Greek  (\\"mágma\\") meaning \\"thick unguent\\") is a mixture of molten or semi-molten rock, volatiles and solids that is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and is expected to exist on other terrestrial planets and some natural satellites. Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals, dissolved gas and sometimes gas bubbles. Magma often collects in magma chambers that may feed a volcano or solidify underground to form an intrusion. Magma is capable of intruding into adjacent rocks (forming igneous dikes and sills), extrusion onto the surface as lava, and explosive ejection as tephra to form pyroclastic rock.  - Unimak Island is the largest island in the Aleutian Islands chain of the U.S. state of Alaska.  - Lava is the molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption. The resulting rock after solidification and cooling is also called \\"lava\\". The molten rock is formed in the interior of some planets, including Earth, and some of their satellites. The source of the heat that melts the rock within the earth is geothermal energy. When first erupted from a volcanic vent, lava is a liquid usually at temperatures from .   - Pumice, called pumicite in its powdered or dust form, is a volcanic rock that consists of highly vesicular rough textured volcanic glass, which may or may not contain crystals. It is typically light colored. Scoria is another vesicular volcanic rock that differs from pumice in having larger vesicles, thicker vesicle walls and being dark colored and denser.  - A stratovolcano, also known as a composite volcano, is a conical volcano built up by many layers (strata) of hardened lava, tephra, pumice, and volcanic ash. Unlike shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes are characterized by a steep profile and periodic explosive eruptions and effusive eruptions, although some have collapsed craters called calderas. The lava flowing from stratovolcanoes typically cools and hardens before spreading far due to high viscosity. The magma forming this lava is often felsic, having high-to-intermediate levels of silica (as in rhyolite, dacite, or andesite), with lesser amounts of less-viscous mafic magma. Extensive felsic lava flows are uncommon, but have travelled as far as .  - A shield volcano is a type of volcano usually built almost entirely of fluid lava flows. They are named for their low profile, resembling a warrior's shield lying on the ground. This is caused by the highly fluid lava they erupt, which travels farther than lava erupted from stratovolcanoes. This results in the steady accumulation of broad sheets of lava, building up the shield volcano's distinctive form. The shape of shield volcanoes is due to the low viscosity of their mafic lava.  - Dacite is an igneous, volcanic rock. It has an aphanitic to porphyritic texture and is intermediate in composition between andesite and rhyolite. The word dacite comes from Dacia, a province of the Roman Empire which lay between the Danube River and Carpathian Mountains (now modern Romania and Moldova) where the rock was first described.  - Alaska is a U.S. state located in the northwest extremity of North America. The Canadian administrative divisions of British Columbia and Yukon border the state to the east; its most extreme western part is Attu Island; it has a maritime border with Russia to the west across the Bering Strait. To the north are the Chukchi and Beaufort seasthe southern parts of the Arctic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean lies to the south and southwest. Alaska is the largest state in the United States by area, the 3rd least populous and the least densely populated of the 50 United States. Approximately half of Alaska's residents (the total estimated at 738,432 by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2015) live within the Anchorage metropolitan area. Alaska's economy is dominated by the fishing, natural gas, and oil industries, resources which it has in abundance. Military bases and tourism are also a significant part of the economy.  - Rhyolite is an igneous, volcanic rock, of felsic (silica-rich) composition (typically > 69% SiOsee the TAS classification). It may have any texture from glassy to aphanitic to porphyritic. The mineral assemblage is usually quartz, sanidine and plagioclase (in a ratio > 2:1see the QAPF diagram). Biotite and hornblende are common accessory minerals. It is the extrusive equivalent to granite.  - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).  - Pogromni Volcano is a stratovolcano on Unimak Island in the Aleutian Islands . Near it are 5 cinder cones , and a mountain called Pogromni 's Sister . Pogromni is old and eroded with a single glacier on its flank and base . Eruptions have been attributed to it in 1795 , 1796 , 1826 , 1827 , and 1830 , but historic eruptions attributed to it may have come from nearby Westdahl volcano . The volcano 's name comes from the Russian  , meaning \`\` characterised by violent outbreak . '' This naming refers to a volcanic eruption , but shares the same etymology as pogrom , a Russian word referring to violent riots against an ethnic group .  - A caldera is a large cauldron-like depression that forms following the evacuation of a magma chamber/reservoir. When large volumes of magma are erupted over a short time period, structural support for the crust above the magma chamber is lost. The ground surface then collapses downward into the partially emptied magma chamber, leaving a massive depression at the surface (from one to dozens of kilometers in diameter). Although sometimes described as a crater, the feature is actually a type of sinkhole, as it is formed through subsidence and collapse rather than an explosion or impact. Only seven known caldera-forming collapses have occurred since the start of the 20th century, most recently at Bárðarbunga volcano in Iceland.  - Tephra is fragmental material produced by a volcanic eruption regardless of composition, fragment size or emplacement mechanism.  - A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface.

The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees.

Step 1: Understanding the story In this story continuation, the seamstress is facing a problem while trying to sew a button on the collar of the coat because the button is too big. My task is to develop the story based on this situation, keeping the narrative engaging and relevant. Step 2: Expanding the story The seamstress held the large button between her fingers, examining it carefully. She knew that if she were to sew this button on, it would be both impractical and would look out of proportion compared to the rest of the coat. Instead of just sewing it on, the seamstress decided to find a solution to the problem. Step 3: Introduce a problem-solving process In order to find a more appropriate button, the seamstress began by searching through her vast collection of buttons. However, after an extensive search, she was unable to find one that would suit the coat perfectly. Step 4: Seek help or an alternative solution Feeling disappointed with her own collection, the seamstress decided to visit the local marketplace to search for the perfect button. She took the coat with her as she browsed the stalls, looking for a button that would match the style and size of the coat's collar. Step 5: Resolution At the marketplace, the seamstress discovered a small shop run by an old tailor who had a variety of unique and beautiful buttons. After talking with the tailor and explaining her situation, she managed to find the perfect button that would complement the coat.

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context?  A: take the shirt out  B: go to a store  C: rent a bike","output":"Based on the given context, the most likely answer to the question \\"What will Casey want to do next?\\" is A: take the shirt out. Here is a detailed explanation: In the context, Casey has just purchased a new shirt and placed it in the washing machine. At this point, it can be assumed that Casey is doing laundry, primarily focusing on taking care of their new shirt. Considering the options provided: A: Take the shirt out - This option indicates that after the laundry cycle is complete, Casey will likely want to take the shirt out of the washing machine. This is the most reasonable answer according to the context, as completing the washing process is logically the next step in the current activity. B: Go to a store - This option does not directly relate to the context. While it is possible for Casey to go to a store, there is no indication in the given context as to why Casey would want to do so immediately after putting the shirt in the washing machine. Furthermore, the context does not mention any need or plan to visit a store. This option would be less relevant and plausible than option A. C: Rent a bike - Similar to option B, this option does not have a direct connection to the given context. Renting a bike is an unrelated activity to the main focus of the context, which is doing laundry and taking care of the new shirt. Therefore, option C is also less relevant and plausible than option A.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Read the text and answer the questions. Philosophers in antiquity used the concept of force in the study of stationary and moving objects and simple machines, but thinkers such as Aristotle and Archimedes retained fundamental errors in understanding force. In part this was due to an incomplete understanding of the sometimes non-obvious force of friction, and a consequently inadequate view of the nature of natural motion. A fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion, even at a constant velocity. Most of the previous misunderstandings about motion and force were eventually corrected by Galileo Galilei and Sir Isaac Newton. With his mathematical insight, Sir Isaac Newton formulated laws of motion that were not improved-on for nearly three hundred years. By the early 20th century, Einstein developed a theory of relativity that correctly predicted the action of forces on objects with increasing momenta near the speed of light, and also provided insight into the forces produced by gravitation and inertia. 1.

What is the answer for the question: What was the last name of the art historian who stated that  the Kailasanath temple is considered an unrivalled work of rock architecture? from the following article ?  The Rashtrakutas contributed much to the architectural heritage of the Deccan. Art historian Adam Hardy categorizes their building activity into three schools: Ellora, around Badami, Aihole and Pattadakal, and at Sirval near Gulbarga. The Rashtrakuta contributions to art and architecture are reflected in the splendid rock-cut cave temples at Ellora and Elephanta, areas also occupied by Jain monks, located in present-day Maharashtra. The Ellora site was originally part of a complex of 34 Buddhist caves probably created in the first half of the 6th century whose structural details show Pandyan influence. Cave temples occupied by Hindus are from later periods.The Rashtrakutas renovated these Buddhist caves and re-dedicated the rock-cut shrines. Amoghavarsha I espoused Jainism and there are five Jain cave temples at Ellora ascribed to his period. The most extensive and sumptuous of the Rashtrakuta works at Ellora is their creation of the monolithic Kailasanath Temple, a splendid achievement confirming the \\"Balhara\\" status as \\"one among the four principal Kings of the world\\". The walls of the temple have marvellous sculptures from Hindu mythology including Ravana, Shiva and Parvathi while the ceilings have paintings. The Kailasanath Temple project was commissioned by King Krishna I after the Rashtrakuta rule had spread into South India from the Deccan. The architectural style used is Karnata Dravida according to Adam Hardy. It does not contain any of the Shikharas common to the Nagara style and was built on the same lines as the Virupaksha temple at Pattadakal in Karnataka. According to art historian Vincent Smith, the achievement at the Kailasanath temple is considered an architectural consummation of the monolithic rock-cut temple and deserves to be considered one of the wonders of the world. According to art historian Percy Brown, as an accomplishment of art, the Kailasanath temple is considered an unrivalled work of rock architecture, a monument that has always excited and astonished travellers.While some...","output":"The answer to the question is \\"Brown.\\" The last name of the art historian who stated that the Kailasanath temple is considered an unrivalled work of rock architecture is Percy Brown."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The perturbation of improper classification of cans would indirectly impact a step of the process in recycling more aluminum cans.  When cans are not properly classified, it means that aluminum cans may be mixed with other types of cans or materials that have different recycling processes. This may cause complications during the melting process, as different materials have different melting points and may not blend well together. Moreover, impurities can adversely affect the quality of the resulting recycled aluminum, potentially making it less suitable for use in new products. The indirect impact comes into play because improper classification does not directly stop a specific step in the recycling process. However, it makes the overall process less effective and efficient, as additional resources and energy might be required to sort and separate the materials before they can be properly recycled. This could lead to increased costs, reduced recycling rates, and lower overall production of recycled aluminum cans."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

But there could be another significant factor at work. During the heyday of The X-Files  alien conspiracy mania was mainstream. Independence Day used the Roswell incident of 1947 as a key plot point  and Men in Black suggested constant alien cover-ups  while a supposed alien autopsy aired in prime time. It was hip and cool to know the various plots associated with \\"the grays \\" and when the Lindsay Lohan vehicle I Know Who Killed Me cast radio show host Art Bell (of the conspiracy-themed Coast to Coast show) as himself  it played like an attempt at an in-joke for cool kids. These days  however  the most prominent talker about aliens and secret plots is no longer Bell  who kept things relatively apolitical on-air and is a centrist Libertarian. It's now  Alex Jones   a Trump supporter and peddler of doomsday supply wares.  Jones   whose conspiracy-mongering actually prompted NASA to deny  they  were hiding child slaves on Mars  is also known for more politically targeted rants  like the government turning children gay  Barack Obama being the head of ISIS  and the Sandy Hook massacre being faked to help facilitate a government gun grab.  Jones  and  his  contributors also have issues with \\"anti-white racism \\" all while a separate school of thought has emerged that tales of ancient aliens are racist  as they assume ancient civilizations of color like the Egyptians could only have come up with the pyramids and such by getting outside help from a more advanced race. Throw into that mix the \\"birther\\" theories that were all the rage during the Obama presidency -- promoted by our current president -- that the chief executive was some kind of secret Kenyan Muslim usurper  and you start to get a picture of what conspiracy theorists look like in today's media. Being into aliens and cover-ups is less associated now with young and sexy TV stars  and more the domain of aggrieved middle-aged men. X-Files creator Chris Carter is clearly having none of that  though given the overall storylines of the show  he seems at the very least to be inspired by a favorite left-wing conspiracy notion of contaminated vaccines. A montage of the achievements of archvillain Carl \\"Cigarette-Smoking Man\\" Busch includes a whole lot of Donald Trump and Steve Bannon (masterful timing  it turned out  as the spat between those two was making headlines almost simultaneously)  as well as a line about how people are easier to fool now because they don't believe in science (cough... GlobalWarming... cough cough) and don't know what fake news is. Meanwhile  our heroes remain FBI agents  who  in the minds of  Alex Jones  devotees  would be considered part of the anti-Trump \\"Deep State.\\"  Jones  was arguably an inspiration for Joel McHale's YouTube host character in season 10  and written semi-sympathetically...but that was January of 2016  when nobody assumed the election would go the way it did  or that  Jones  would get a big thumbs-up from candidate Trump. In an episode that also definitively stated the moon landing was faked and that Busch is definitely the father of two very significant characters  we also caught hints of two different conspiracies at war with one another. Their most obvious point of disagreement on the show is whether Dana Scully should live or die -- but in real life they may be representative of the Art Bell and  Alex Jones  wings of Conspiracystan. We get a strong sense of what side Carter is on...but the low ratings suggest that those who pore over cover-ups and aliens nowadays may no longer feel politically simpatico with the creator. Or  perhaps  they can just go to any corner of the Internet and find similarly intricate stories  many of which are shared as memes on Facebook by that uncle who turns out to have been a lot crazier than you ever suspected. Even as  Jones  semi-admitted in court that he's playing a character akin to  of all things  Jack Nicholson's Joker  I've seen family members share his stories about a coming race war with utter seriousness. Though when he talks about lizard people  of course he's \\"joking.\\" A:","output":"Part #1: Identify the document and the entity in question.

How to make a debt management program work for you  Choose a debt management program carefully.  The credit counseling and debt management industry is, unfortunately, infested with companies that are all too willing to take advantage of people who are already in money trouble. Choose the wrong program, and you could quickly end up in worse shape than before.","output":"To ensure that you select the best debt management program for your unique financial situation, it is essential to conduct thorough research, gather recommendations from trusted sources, and compare various program options to find the perfect balance between affordability, expertise, and debt resolution efficacy. One of the first steps you should take is to check if the debt management organization you are considering is accredited by a reputable industry body, such as the National Foundation for Credit Counseling (NFCC) or the Financial Counseling Association of America (FCAA). This accreditation is a clear indicator of the company's commitment to maintaining high ethical standards, providing transparent disclosure of fees and operational procedures, and safeguarding consumer rights. Equally important is to assess the debt management plan's (DMP) structure and review the debt payment strategies provided. A well-designed DMP should consolidate your unsecured debt into a single, affordable monthly payment while taking into account your financial capabilities as well as the payment timeline. The program you choose should also offer ongoing support during your debt repayment journey, providing access to experienced and certified credit counselors who can offer guidance on budgeting, financial planning, and debt reduction. As you compare different programs, pay close attention to the program fees and associated costs. While reputable organizations will often charge a nominal fee for their services, exorbitant or hidden fees should raise a red flag. Be wary of companies that ask for considerable upfront payments or have a fee structure that seems unclear or complicated. Moreover, make sure to read the fine print and understand the program's terms and conditions, specifically, the program's impact on your credit score and any guarantees offered by the company. A well-established debt management program should work closely with your creditors to negotiate reduced interest rates, waive late fees, and help rebuild your credit over time. However, keep in mind that each individual's circumstances are different, so don't fall for unrealistic promises or \\"quick-fix\\" solutions that may not necessarily address your unique debt situation. Gather recommendations from friends, family members, and online reviews to learn about other consumers' experiences with the debt management programs you are considering. By using these firsthand testimonials you can gain insight into how effective and reliable these programs are in helping people manage their debt. In conclusion, making a debt management program work for you involves diligent research, recommendations, and a thorough evaluation of the program's accreditations, fees, DMP structure, credit counselor expertise, and consumer success stories. By carefully considering these factors and making an informed decision, you can confidently choose a debt management program that best fits your needs and paves a smooth path toward financial freedom."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: V5C log books record a car's \\"registered keeper\\". However, in some cases they are not being updated for several months after cars are sold, a BBC investigation has found. Some dealers retain the documents to help them qualify for large discounts from car manufacturers. The National Franchised Dealers Association describe the findings as \\"concerning\\" and say bonuses linked to sales might \\"incentivise\\" the activity. The cars affected are \\"pre-registered,\\" excess stock sold cheaply by manufacturers to dealers. They must legally be kept off-road for 90 days before being re-sold. The delays can be even longer if the car was originally registered by a retailer as a business fleet vehicle. However, in some cases the cars are delivered to new buyers immediately, while the vehicles remain registered at a separate address, an investigation by BBC Radio 4's You and Yours has found. Many of the cars are sold on by online car brokers. They commonly disclose the disadvantages in their terms and conditions, explaining that the vehicles will be registered to customers \\"in due course\\". However, many customers fail to read the small print and some suffer the consequences. \\"I couldn't drive the car because it had been declared off-road\\", said buyer Andrew March. \\"The car log book had been withheld so I couldn't re-tax it.\\" After asking repeatedly for his logbook, motorist James Laddie applied to the DVLA for a new one. The three-month delay proved expensive: \\"The council would not transfer our old parking permit to the new car without proof of ownership. The combined cost of parking tickets was about Â£200.\\" Experts stress that there can be potentially more serious consequences of a driver and their car being registered to different addresses. For example, police speed camera fines are sent to the postal address linked via DVLA records to a car's registration plate. One driver who spoke to You and Yours lived in London while his car remained registered for several months in Bolton. Insurance companies also require drivers to disclose both the owner and the registered keeper of a vehicle. Roy Rodger, an expert on insurance law who has trained underwriters, warns that drivers' confusion over withheld log books could lead to costly mistakes. \\"In a situation where a driver misled the insurance company over registration details and a serious accident occurred, the driver could be in a very, very awkward position. \\"They could have to pay the claim out of their own pocket eventually,\\" he said. The Association of British Insurers told You and Yours it was not aware of any cases where this had happened, but added that drivers should inform motor insurers if they are not the registered keeper. The practice of log books being retained by third party suppliers was highlighted in a 2012 court case brought against a competitor by online car broker Richard Sanders, founder of Drive the Deal. The competitor had not adequately warned consumers of the risks involved. Although Mr Sanders won the case, he says the industry has not been fully cleaned up. \\"We decided to start looking at this because we were very concerned indeed about the trouble that some consumers would get themselves into,\\" he said. \\"Unfortunately I think the practice of wrongly registering cars on purpose does continue.\\" The director of the National Franchised Dealers Association, Sue Robinson, says she is very concerned by the findings. \\"As dealers are required to keep vehicles for 90 days to qualify for some bonuses, that could incentivise this type of activity,\\" she said. Autocar editorial director, Jim Holder, says transparency in the car industry has improved but problems remain. \\"This part of the industry is poorly regulated and there are still traders out there who ignore the rules,\\" he said. \\"It's not really a problem that the industry takes seriously and it's really only word of mouth and education that can stop this.\\" You and Yours is on BBC Radio 4 weekdays 12:15-13:00 GMT.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Cameron was born in 1954 in Kapuskasing, Ontario, Canada, the son of Shirley (nee Lowe), an artist and nurse, and Phillip Cameron, an electrical engineer. His paternal great-great-great-grandfather emigrated from Balquhidder, Scotland, in 1825. Cameron grew up in Chippawa, Ontario, and attended Stamford Collegiate School in Niagara Falls, Ontario. His family moved to Brea, California in 1971, when Cameron was 17 years old. Context: In June 2005, Cameron was announced to be working on a project tentatively titled \\"Project 880\\" (now known to be Avatar) in parallel with another project, Alita: Battle Angel (an adaptation of the manga series Battle Angel Alita). Both movies were to be shot in 3D. By December, Cameron stated that he wanted to film Battle Angel first, followed by Avatar. However, in February 2006, he switched goals for the two film projects and decided to film Avatar first. He mentioned that if both films were successful, he would be interested in seeing a trilogy being made for both. Alita: Battle Angel eventually began production in 2016 with Cameron writing and producing and Robert Rodriguez directing.  Avatar had an estimated budget of over 300 million and was released on December 18, 2009. This marked his first feature film since 1997's Titanic. It is composed almost entirely of computer-generated animation, using a more-advanced version of the \\"performance capture\\" technique used by director Robert Zemeckis in The Polar Express. James Cameron had written an 80-page scriptment for Avatar in 1995 and announced in 1996 that he would make the film after completing Titanic. In December 2006, Cameron explained that the delay in producing the film since the 1990s had been to wait until the technology necessary to create his project was advanced enough, since at the time no studio would finance for the development of the visual effects. The film was originally scheduled to be released in May 2009 but was pushed back to December 2009 to allow more time for post-production on the complex CGI and to give more time for theatres worldwide to install 3D projectors. Cameron originally intended Avatar to be 3D-only.  Avatar broke several box office records during its initial theatrical run. It grossed 749.7 million in the United States and Canada and more than 2.74 billion worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film of all time in the United States and Canada, surpassing Cameron's Titanic. Avatar also became the first movie to ever earn more than 2 billion worldwide. Including revenue from the re-release of Avatar featuring extended footage, it grossed 760.5 million in the United States and Canada and more than 2.78 billion worldwide. It was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, and won three for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography and Best Visual Effects.  Avatar's success made Cameron the highest earner in Hollywood for 2010, netting him 257 million as reported by Vanity Fair.  Disney announced in September 2011 that it would adapt James Cameron's film Avatar into Pandora-The World of Avatar, a themed area at Disney's Animal Kingdom in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. Question: what is james ole in avrtar. Whats the answer?","output":"James Cameron's role in Avatar is that he is the director, writer, and producer of the movie. He created the story, helped make the movie, and was in charge of the whole project. Avatar is a very special movie because it has a lot of special effects and 3D images, and James Cameron waited for a long time for the technology to be good enough to make it.

Write a summary based on this article: The Public Theater has confirmed that Edward Snowden will guest star in every performance of Privacy via a pre-recorded video. The co-production with Donmar Warehouse is inspired by a post-Snowden view on privacy and technology, and encourages the use of cell phones during the show.      Snowden made international headlines in 2013 when he copied and leaked classified National Security Agency documents. His actions shed light on issues of government secrecy and surveillance and fueled worldwide debates on the matter of informational privacy.      Starring Daniel Radcliffe, Privacy will begin performances July 2 and officially open July 18. The boundary-pushing work is co-created by James Graham and Josie Rourke, and is set to play through August 14 in the Public's Newman Theater.      Daniel Radcliffe Says Audience Can Email Him During Privacy      Radcliffe stars as “The Writer” and is joined by fellow cast members De’Adre Aziza, Raffi Barsoumian, Michael Countryman, Rachel Dratch and Reg Rogers, playing an ensemble of real-life politicians, journalists and technologists who have all contributed to the show.      Here’s how the theatre bills the new play: “Privacy explores our complicated relationship with technology and data through the funny and heart-breaking travails of a lonely guy (Radcliffe), who arrives in the city to figure out how to like, tag, and share his life without giving it all away. The play uncovers what our technological choices reveal about who we are, what we want and who’s keeping track of it all. This provocative theatrical event will ask audiences to charge their phones, leave them ON during the performance and to embark on a fascinating dive online and into a new reality where we’re all connected…for better or worse.”      Tickets are available by calling (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org, or in person at the Taub Box Office at The Public Theater at 425 Lafayette Street, Manhattan. ||||| Be not afeard, indeed.      In a clandestine confab, artists from the Public Theater and the Donmar Warehouse on Saturday met in the Lower Manhattan auditorium where “A Chorus Line” and “Hamilton” began so the actor Daniel Radcliffe (in the flesh) and the fugitive Edward J. Snowden (by video from Moscow) could run lines of Shakespeare.      The odd mash-up, three years in the making, produced one of the more unusual cameos of the moment: beginning this weekend, Mr. Snowden will appear in a new play at the Public, conjured up nightly to exchange bits of “The Tempest” and ideas about privacy with Mr. Radcliffe, who plays a writer in the show.      The interview/performance was a long-sought goal of the creators of “Privacy,” a British play, rewritten with an American context, that begins performances Saturday and explores how the personal has become public in the digital age. The play was conceived shortly before Mr. Snowden burst into public view, but his leaking of government documents shaped the drama.      “Privacy” is a work of documentary theater, in which actors speak words taken from interviews the writers conducted with politicians, scholars and journalists. The show’s creators, James Graham and Josie Rourke, tried repeatedly to reach Mr. Snowden — they were not successful before the London production in 2014. But Mr. Snowden is now on a bit of a remote-controlled publicity tear (he has even made appearances via robot), and last week his lawyer from the American Civil Liberties Union said he would do it. |||||","output":"Edward Snowden, the whistleblower who leaked classified National Security Agency documents in 2013, is set to guest star in every performance of Privacy at the Public Theater via a pre-recorded video.

Options: - atlas - countryside - united states - between to cities - repairs  The answer is \\"united states\\" because","output":"the road trip they planned consists of traversing various highways that enable them to explore the vast and diverse landscape of the United States. Taking a road trip across the United States offers a unique and unparalleled experience for travelers as they get to witness the country's breathtaking natural beauty, experience its rich culture, and immerse themselves in its fascinating history. The United States spans across a large geographical area that encompasses 50 states and numerous prominent cities, each with its distinct character, attractions, and appeal. One of the factors that contribute immensely to making the United States an ideal destination for a road trip is its extensive and well-developed network of highways that connect different cities and regions, allowing for smooth and convenient travel. Moreover, many of these highways provide awe-inspiring views and lead to some of the most iconic attractions in the country, such as national parks, landmarks, and monuments. Travelling across the United States on a road trip not only opens up the opportunity for visiting famous destinations like New York City, Los Angeles, or Chicago but also presents the chance to dive deep into the lesser-known, off-the-beaten-path attractions like small towns, hidden gem beaches, or quaint villages. This way, travelers can gain a more authentic and comprehensive understanding of the American way of life and its multitude of cultures, cuisines, and traditions. The other options mentioned, such as atlas, countryside, between two cities, and repairs, do not adequately explain or justify the reason behind choosing the United States as their road trip destination.  An atlas is simply a tool, often in the form of a book or a digital map, that provides geographical information about various places, including the United States. While an atlas may come in handy for planning the road trip, it alone cannot be the destination. The countryside, although it does evoke images of scenic landscapes and picturesque settings, is a vague term that could apply to rural areas in any country. It is not specific enough to justify the road trip across the United States. \\"Between two cities\\" might describe a more limited road trip, but it does not capture the scope of a cross-country journey encompassing multiple states and highways throughout the United States. Lastly, \\"repairs\\" seems wholly unrelated to the question, as it pertains to the maintenance or fixing of something, potentially a vehicle, but does not answer where they plan to travel on their road trip. In conclusion, the answer is \\"United States\\" because the extensive network of highways connecting its various cities, towns, and natural attractions makes it an ideal destination for a road trip, allowing travelers to witness the country's incredible diversity, distinct cultural experiences, and stunning landscapes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - AmigaOS is the proprietary native operating system of the Amiga and AmigaOne personal computers. It was developed first by Commodore International and introduced with the launch of the first Amiga, the Amiga 1000, in 1985. Early versions of AmigaOS required the Motorola 68000 series of 16-bit and 32-bit microprocessors. Later versions were developed by Haage & Partner (AmigaOS 3.5 and 3.9) and then Hyperion Entertainment (AmigaOS 4.0-4.1). A PowerPC microprocessor is required for the most recent release, AmigaOS 4.  - A type-in program, type-in game or just type-in, is a computer program listing of source code printed in a computer magazine or book, meant to be typed in on the computer's keyboard by the reader in order to run the program.  - A microprocessor is a computer processor which incorporates the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) on a single integrated circuit (IC), or at most a few integrated circuits. The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock driven, register based, programmable electronic device which accepts digital or binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic. Microprocessors operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary numeral system.  - In computing, source code is any collection of computer instructions, possibly with comments, written using a human-readable programming language, usually as ordinary text. The source code of a program is specially designed to facilitate the work of computer programmers, who specify the actions to be performed by a computer mostly by writing source code. The source code is often transformed by an assembler or compiler into binary machine code understood by the computer. The machine code might then be stored for execution at a later time. Alternatively, source code may be interpreted and thus immediately executed.  - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA). The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such as \\"Pong\\" and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s.  - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming.  - Guinness World Records, known from its inception in 1955 until 1998 as The Guinness Book of Records and in previous U.S. editions as The Guinness Book of World Records, is a reference book published annually, listing world records and national records, both of human achievements and the extremes of the natural world. The book itself holds a world record, as the best-selling copyrighted book of all time. As of the 2017 edition, it is now in its 63rd year of publication, published in 100 countries and 23 languages. The international franchise has extended beyond print to include television series and museums. The popularity of the franchise has resulted in \\"Guinness World Records\\" becoming the primary international authority on the cataloguing and verification of a huge number of world records; the organisation employs official record adjudicators authorised to verify the authenticity of the setting and breaking of records.  - Ahoy ! was a magazine published between January 1984 and January 1989 that focused on all Commodore International color computers , but especially the Commodore 64 and Amiga . It was noted for the quality and learnability of its type - in program listings .  - The Amiga is a family of personal computers sold by Commodore in the 1980s and 1990s. Based on the Motorola 68000 family of microprocessors, the machine has a custom chipset with graphics and sound capabilities that were unprecedented for the price, and a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS. The Amiga provided a significant upgrade from earlier 8-bit home computers, including Commodore's own C64.  - The Motorola 68000 (\\"'sixty-eight-thousand'\\"; also called the m68k or Motorola 68k, \\"\\"sixty-eight-kay\\"\\") is a 32-bit CISC microprocessor with a 16-bit external data bus, designed and marketed by Motorola Semiconductor Products Sector (later Freescale Semiconductor, now NXP). Introduced in 1979 with HMOS technology as the first member of the successful 32-bit m68k family of microprocessors, it is generally software forward compatible with the rest of the line despite being limited to a 16-bit wide external bus. After 37 years in production, the 68000 architecture is still in use.  - Commodore International (or Commodore International Limited) was a North American home computer and electronics manufacturer. Commodore International (CI), along with its subsidiary Commodore Business Machines (CBM), participated in the development of the homepersonal computer industry in the 1970s and 1980s. The company developed and marketed one of the world's best-selling desktop computers, the Commodore 64 (1982) and released its Amiga computer line in July 1985.  - The Commodore 64, also known as the C64, C-64, C= 64, or occasionally CBM 64 or VIC-64 in Sweden, is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International. It is listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time, with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units. Volume production started in early 1982, marketing in August for . Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET, the C64 took its name from its of RAM. It had superior sound and graphical specifications compared to other earlier systems such as the Apple II and Atari 800, with multi-color sprites and a more advanced sound processor.

Q: If I tell you that Beads of liquid are formed by vapor condensing, and ask you the question \\"vapor doing what forms beads of liquid?\\", is the correct answer \\"energy barrier\\"? The answer is:","output":"No, the correct answer is not \\"energy barrier.\\" If the question being asked is \\"vapor doing what forms beads of liquid?\\", the correct answer is \\"vapor condensing.\\" To provide a more detailed explanation, let's break down the process of vapor condensing to form beads of liquid: 1. The process begins with vapor, which is a substance in its gaseous state, typically at a temperature that is well above its boiling point. Common examples of vapor include steam, which is water vapor, or the fumes produced by volatile substances such as gasoline and alcohol. 2. When the surrounding temperature decreases or the pressure increases, the vapor starts to cool down considerably. As it cools, the particles within the vapor begin to lose their kinetic energy, and the attractive forces between these particles start to dominate. 3. As a result of this shift in dominant forces, the particles come closer together, and the vapor begins to transform into a liquid state. This process is called condensation. 4. Beads of liquid are formed as a result of vapor condensing on a nearby object or surface. This can be observed as dew or water droplets on cold surfaces such as a windowpane or a mirror. The formation of beads is due to the surface tension between the attracted molecules in the liquid state, which prevents the droplets from spreading out and forms a round or beaded appearance. In conclusion, the correct answer to the question, \\"vapor doing what forms beads of liquid?\\" is \\"vapor condensing.\\" The term \\"energy barrier\\" is not directly related to this process, as it is more pertinent to the study of chemical reactions and the activation energy threshold that must be overcome for a reaction to occur."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The phrase \\"Curse of the pharaohs\\" consists of three words: \\"Curse,\\" \\"of the,\\" and \\"pharaohs\\". 2. Now, I'll translate each word individually:    - \\"Curse\\" can be translated as \\"проклятие\\" (proklyatiye) in Russian.    - \\"of the\\" is a grammatical construction, so it doesn't have a direct translation. In Russian, this construction can be expressed using the genitive case, so I will decline the noun \\"pharaohs\\" accordingly.    - \\"pharaohs\\" can be translated as \\"фараонов\\" (faraonov) in Russian, because the genitive form of \\"фараон\\" (farаon) is \\"фараонов\\" (faraonov), which signifies possession. 3. Combining the translated words into a coherent phrase in Russian: \\"проклятие фараонов\\" (proklyatiye faraonov).

Read this: Recent developments in LEDs permit them to be used in environmental and task lighting. LEDs have many advantages over incandescent light sources including lower energy consumption, longer lifetime, improved physical robustness, smaller size, and faster switching. Light-emitting diodes are now used in applications as diverse as aviation lighting, automotive headlamps, advertising, general lighting, traffic signals, camera flashes and lighted wallpaper. As of 2015[update], LEDs powerful enough for room lighting remain somewhat more expensive, and require more precise current and heat management, than compact fluorescent lamp sources of comparable output. Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\"):  Why aren't some people hesitant to use LED lighting?","output":"Based on the information provided, some people might be hesitant to use LED lighting because, as of 2015, LEDs powerful enough for room lighting remain somewhat more expensive and require more precise current and heat management than compact fluorescent lamp sources of comparable output."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You might need to use additional knowledge to answer the question. I wrote about the rumored pricing of the Iphone in India in my post last week , the rumor turned out to be true . Iphone was unveiled in India at midnight last Thursday , the pricing is indeed 31k for 8Gb model and 36k for the 16Gb model . No wonder , it turned out to be lack luster , it is a very steep price and is definitely not worth spending so much for the phone especially when there is no 3 G yet in India . However the good thing is it comes without a monthly contract and it can be unlocked for other carriers by paying 2k extra ( I guess ) . Pick your answer from: i. None of the above choices .; ii. It is lustrous .; iii. It does n't require a monthly contract .; iv. It is only 2k .; Answer the following question: Why is the new phone beneficial ?","output":"iii. It does n't require a monthly contract. The new phone is beneficial because it does not require a monthly contract, meaning that users have more freedom and flexibility in choosing their service providers. They can switch carriers as needed without being locked into a long-term commitment. This can be advantageous for people who frequently travel or prefer to change their mobile plans regularly. Other answers are wrong because: i. None of the above choices does not provide any explanation related to the benefits of the new phone. ii. It is lustrous does not provide any information that is relevant to the benefits of the new phone. iv. It is only 2k is referring to the price for unlocking the phone for other carriers, which might be an additional advantage but does not directly answer why the phone itself is beneficial."},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given a tuple, comprising Head and Tail, separated with <sep>.
