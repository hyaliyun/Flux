However, Wally didn’t want to make just any film; he wanted to create something that hadn’t been seen in Kikoriki before—an abstract film. Excited with the idea, Wally immediately got to work. He gathered his friends and announced his plans. “I’m making a film,” he declared with a proud smile. “But not just any film—a piece of abstract art!” His friends looked puzzled. “What’s an abstract film?” Pin asked, tilting his head. “It’s a kind of movie that doesn’t tell a story the way we’re used to,” Wally explained. “Instead, it expresses emotions and ideas through moving images and sounds that might not always make sense.” The idea seemed as bizarre as it was intriguing to the Kikoriki crew. Wally, enthusiastic about his project, began explaining his vision. He envisioned scenes that evoked feelings and thoughts, using colors, shapes, and sounds in innovative ways. The idea was to create a sensory experience that allowed the audience to interpret the film in their own unique ways. Despite their initial confusion, the Kikoriki gang, fueled by curiosity and their friend’s passion, agreed to help. Krash became responsible for the lively and sometimes jarring music that would accompany the abstract visuals. Chiko, with his attention to detail, was assigned to help with the meticulous editing process. Even Rosa, with her love for beauty, contributed by suggesting color contrasts and visual patterns that could evoke particular emotions. The production was in full swing, with Wally directing scenes that ranged from painted balls bouncing rhythmically against a backdrop of shifting geometric shapes, to poetic sequences of flowing water that transformed into a galaxy of swirling stars under his direction. As the film project progressed, something interesting happened. The Kikoriki friends, initially puzzled by the concept of an abstract film, began to see the beauty in expressing ideas and emotions unbounded by conventional narrative structures. They learned to appreciate the art of visual storytelling through abstract means, each finding a personal connection to the imagery and soundscapes Wally was creating. Finally, the day of the premiere arrived. The curious Kikoriki community gathered, unsure of what to expect from Wally’s abstract film. As the lights dimmed and the film started, the audience was taken on a journey of colors, shapes, and sounds that transcended traditional storytelling. By the end of the screening, the Kikoriki islanders were left in thoughtful silence, each person touched in a unique way by the abstract art they had witnessed. Some felt joy, others contemplation, and yet others found a sense of peace. The abstract film had achieved what Wally hoped for—it connected with the audience on a deep, personal level, beyond words and conventional narrative. Wally smiled, satisfied with his work. He had managed not just to create an abstract film but also to open the minds of his friends and neighbors to the vast potential of creative expression. As the lights came back on, the applause began, not just for Wally’s innovative film, but for the journey of discovery and understanding they’d all shared. The Kikoriki community had learned that art comes in many forms, and each form, no matter how unusual it may seem, has the power to move and provoke thought in its own unique way. Write a GoGoRiki version (with the character names changed to their GoGoRiki versions \\"Wally to Wolliriki, Krash to Pogoriki, etc\\")","output":"In the vibrant world of GoGoRiki, Wolliriki, the intellectual sheep with a zest for creativity, decided it was high time to broaden his artistic ventures into the cinematic universe. Yet, Wolliriki had ambitions beyond the conventional; he aimed to pioneer an abstract film, something GoGoRiki had never witnessed. Brimming with excitement, Wolliriki called his friends together to unveil his groundbreaking idea. “I'm embarking on a film project,” he announced, beaming with pride. “But this is no ordinary film—it’s a piece of abstract art!” His announcement was met with puzzled expressions. “What's an abstract film?” questioned Pogoriki, cocking his head in curiosity. Wolliriki enthusiastically explained, “An abstract film moves away from traditional storytelling. Instead, it captures emotions and ideas through movement, colors, and sounds that may not follow a logical sequence.” The concept, as strange as it was compelling, intrigued the GoGoRiki crew. With a vision in mind, Wolliriki shared his idea of crafting scenes that evoked varied emotions and thoughts, all through the lens of abstract elements like color and shape, complemented by a soundscape designed to enhance the viewing experience. Despite their initial reservations, Wolliriki's passion ignited a spark of curiosity among his friends. Pogoriki took on the role of creating the dynamic and sometimes startling soundtrack to accompany the abstract visuals. Chikoriki, noted for his meticulous eye, was enlisted to spearhead the complex editing process. Rosariki, with her acute sense of aesthetics, suggested engaging color contrasts and visual motifs to stir specific emotions. The production was a whirlwind of activity, with Wolliriki at the helm, guiding the creation of scenes that ranged from rhythmically bouncing painted balls against ever-shifting geometric backdrops, to mesmerizing sequences where flowing water morphed into an expanse of twinkling stars under his direction. As work on the film advanced, the GoGoRiki friends, initially bamboozled by the abstract concept, began to appreciate the beauty of conveying ideas and feelings free from traditional narrative constraints. They grew to understand the power of abstract visual storytelling, finding personal resonance in the imagery and sound that Wolliriki was crafting. The premiere day dawned, and the GoGoRiki community gathered, filled with anticipation and curiosity about Wolliriki’s abstract endeavor. As the film unfolded, transporting the audience through a kaleidoscope of colors, shapes, and sounds, it redefined their expectations of storytelling. After the screening, a reflective hush enveloped the audience, each individual touched differently by the abstract art they had just experienced. Joy, contemplation, and peace were among the plethora of feelings evoked. Wolliriki’s film had succeeded in its mission—it reached out and touched the hearts of the audience on a profound, personal level, far beyond the reach of words and conventional plots. Beaming, Wolliriki felt a surge of satisfaction. He had not only realized his vision of creating an abstract film but also broadened the horizons of his friends and neighbors, introducing them to the boundless possibilities of creative expression. As the lights brightened and applause filled the air, the cheers were not solely for Wolliriki’s innovative creation; they were also a celebration of the collective journey of discovery and understanding. The GoGoRiki community had come to recognize that art, in all its forms, holds the ability to inspire and provoke thought in the most unexpected ways."},{"instruction":"Write a CW4Kids lineup, with 7am having the GoGoRiki episode Woe is Wolliriki, paired up with my fanmade ep, also 11am's Pokemon Advanced Challenge episode is \\"Who's Flying Now\\", Also the TMNT ep is the first ep of Fast Forward, and the Chaotic ep is \\"Fighting Friendly\\" the one where Kaz accuses Tom of cheating","output":"Certainly, creating a nostalgic CW4Kids lineup with your specified details and filling in with additional engaging content makes for a compelling Saturday morning!

I've been following CW4Kids' Pokémon AG journey, and it's been a blast. But does anyone know why they’ve never aired BW, XY, SM, or DP? Seems like we're missing out on a lot of Ash's journey! **TrainerTina:** Good question, @PokeFanRicky! I’ve been wondering the same. There’s so much content in those series that could bring fresh excitement to Saturday mornings. **BulbaBuddy:** Yeah, BW and XY especially have some epic battles and character development. Would love to see those on CW4Kids. **4KidsExec:** Hello, CW4Kids community! I’m an executive at 4Kids Entertainment, and I wanted to address your questions regarding the Pokémon series. First off, we’re thrilled to see how much you’re enjoying Pokémon Advanced Generation (AG) on our network. The decision to air specific Pokémon seasons, such as AG, and not others like Black & White (BW), XY, Sun & Moon (SM), or Diamond & Pearl (DP), is based on a number of factors. 1. **Licensing Agreements**: Our current licensing agreement with Pokémon grants us exclusive rights to the Advanced Generation series only. Licensing additional seasons involves separate agreements and negotiations, which can be quite complex and time-consuming. 2. **Audience Reception**: We closely monitor how our audience responds to our programming. The AG series holds a special place in the hearts of many viewers and continues to perform well in terms of viewership. Introducing new series is something we plan carefully to ensure it meets our audience's interests and expectations. 3. **Broadcasting Slots and Content Strategy**: Our Saturday morning lineup is curated to offer a diverse range of shows. Fitting in more Pokémon series would require adjusting the current schedule, which involves strategic planning and consideration of how it affects the overall viewing experience and other shows in the lineup. 4. **Budget Constraints**: Acquiring and localizing new series for broadcast involves significant costs. Our goal is to balance bringing exciting new content with managing these costs effectively to ensure the long-term sustainability of our programming block. We're always exploring opportunities to expand our offerings and bring more of the Pokémon world to our viewers. We appreciate your passion and suggestions—know that they are heard and valued.

Moving to a location where abortion is prohibited allows me to uphold my belief in the protection of the unborn and create a nurturing environment where my child can thrive.

However, Wally didn’t want to make just any film; he wanted to create something that hadn’t been seen in Kikoriki before—an abstract film. Excited with the idea, Wally immediately got to work. He gathered his friends and announced his plans. “I’m making a film,” he declared with a proud smile. “But not just any film—a piece of abstract art!” His friends looked puzzled. “What’s an abstract film?” Pin asked, tilting his head. “It’s a kind of movie that doesn’t tell a story the way we’re used to,” Wally explained. “Instead, it expresses emotions and ideas through moving images and sounds that might not always make sense.” The idea seemed as bizarre as it was intriguing to the Kikoriki crew. Wally, enthusiastic about his project, began explaining his vision. He envisioned scenes that evoked feelings and thoughts, using colors, shapes, and sounds in innovative ways. The idea was to create a sensory experience that allowed the audience to interpret the film in their own unique ways. Despite their initial confusion, the Kikoriki gang, fueled by curiosity and their friend’s passion, agreed to help. Krash became responsible for the lively and sometimes jarring music that would accompany the abstract visuals. Chiko, with his attention to detail, was assigned to help with the meticulous editing process. Even Rosa, with her love for beauty, contributed by suggesting color contrasts and visual patterns that could evoke particular emotions. The production was in full swing, with Wally directing scenes that ranged from painted balls bouncing rhythmically against a backdrop of shifting geometric shapes, to poetic sequences of flowing water that transformed into a galaxy of swirling stars under his direction. As the film project progressed, something interesting happened. The Kikoriki friends, initially puzzled by the concept of an abstract film, began to see the beauty in expressing ideas and emotions unbounded by conventional narrative structures. They learned to appreciate the art of visual storytelling through abstract means, each finding a personal connection to the imagery and soundscapes Wally was creating. Finally, the day of the premiere arrived. The curious Kikoriki community gathered, unsure of what to expect from Wally’s abstract film. As the lights dimmed and the film started, the audience was taken on a journey of colors, shapes, and sounds that transcended traditional storytelling. By the end of the screening, the Kikoriki islanders were left in thoughtful silence, each person touched in a unique way by the abstract art they had witnessed. Some felt joy, others contemplation, and yet others found a sense of peace. The abstract film had achieved what Wally hoped for—it connected with the audience on a deep, personal level, beyond words and conventional narrative. Wally smiled, satisfied with his work. He had managed not just to create an abstract film but also to open the minds of his friends and neighbors to the vast potential of creative expression. As the lights came back on, the applause began, not just for Wally’s innovative film, but for the journey of discovery and understanding they’d all shared. The Kikoriki community had learned that art comes in many forms, and each form, no matter how unusual it may seem, has the power to move and provoke thought in its own unique way.

However, as night fell upon the island, Krash found himself entangled in the throws of a restless sleep, unknowingly setting the stage for a journey into the abstract and surreal. As the dream began, Krash stood in the center of the island, the vibrancy of Kikoriki's colors surrounding him. Suddenly, without warning, the ground beneath his feet began to quiver. Slowly, the lush green grass, the towering trees, and the colorful houses started to dissolve, as if an invisible force was melting everything into a deep, ominous black paint. Krash, stricken with panic, ran through the lands he once knew, only to find his path disappearing behind him, swallowed by the growing expanse of black. The familiar faces of his friends were nowhere to be seen; it was as if he was the sole survivor in this rapidly transforming world. The once vibrant Kikoriki appeared as a blank canvas, painted with the darkest of shades, leaving Krash in a void where the concept of color seemed a distant memory. He called out for his friends, but his voice echoed into the emptiness, unanswered. The loneliness was suffocating, the silence deafening. Standing in the middle of this black void, Krash realized he had to face whatever was causing this destruction alone. Drawing deep from within, he began to fight against the encroaching darkness, his determination manifesting as bright, colorful strokes of paint emanating from his very being, challenging the blackness that threatened to consume everything. As the battle of colors ensued, Krash struggled, the darkness seemed relentless. Yet, in this moment of despair, he remembered the strength and love of his friends, and how they had faced numerous challenges together. Harnessing these thoughts, his resolve grew stronger, his colorful aura brighter, pushing back the darkness bit by bit. Just as he felt the tide turning in his favor, Krash awoke with a start. He found himself back on Kikoriki Island, the sun gently caressing his face, the sound of his friends' laughter in the distance. It had all been a nightmare. The lush greenery of the island was untouched, the colors as vibrant as ever. Eager to shake off the remnants of his dream, Krash joined his friends, yet he couldn't shake the potent symbolism from his nightmare. He decided to share his experience with them, emphasizing how lost and powerless he felt without them by his side. The Kikoriki crew gathered around Krash, listening intently. They reassured him that they were a family, always there for each other, no matter the darkness that might one day confront them. Together, they were a beacon of light capable of overcoming any shadow, any fear. This episode, while exploring the depths of fear and the feeling of isolation, ultimately reaffirms the power of friendship and unity, even in the face of the darkest nightmares. Though deemed too somber for certain audiences, this narrative serves as a poignant reminder that together, no darkness is too great to overcome. *Note: Due to its introspective and slightly darker themes, this episode might indeed have been skipped in versions meant for a younger or more sensitive audience, preserving the generally lighthearted and comedic tone of the series.*"},{"instruction":"Write a tweet saying it ain't airing on CW4Kids and that instead were going straight to Chikos Day","output":"🚨 Attention #Kikoriki fans!

Pochi altri movimenti intellettuali hanno esercitato un'influenza così larga e profonda sulla società, modificando l'immagine stessa dell'uomo. Non a caso Thomas Kuhn, ne “La rivoluzione copernicana”, ha definito l'invenzione della psicoanalisi come la terza rivoluzione “non tipica” della storia occidentale, dopo la rivoluzione copernicana e la rivoluzione darwiniana. Copernico aveva ridisegnato, all'inizio dell'età moderna, l'immagine dell'universo, togliendo alla Terra, e dunque all'uomo, la sua antica centralità, mentre Darwin, nell'800, aveva abbattuto il mito della fissità delle specie, inserendo la specie Homo sapiens all'interno del mondo in perenne divenire della natura: ordine dei Primati, famiglia degli Ominidi, genere Homo, specie Homo sapiens; detto altrimenti, facendo discendere l'uomo dalla scimmia. Freud, all'inizio del ‘900, trasforma radicalmente l'immagine dell'io “completamente trasparente a sé stesso” in cui l'uomo si era rispecchiato per secoli, scoprendo l'esistenza di una zona buia e impenetrabile alla ragione, l'inconscio, e inventando un metodo per indagarlo, la psicoanalisi. Per usare le parole di un suo biografo, dopo di lui l'uomo ha cominciato “a guardarsi diversamente allo specchio”.Dagli studi sull'isteria alla scoperta dell'inconscioLa psicoanalisi nasce dalla pratica medica. Freud era infatti laureato in medicina e specializzato in malattie nervose. La psicoanalisi nasce inoltre come risposta a precisi bisogni di cura. Nello studio viennese di Freud, al n. 19 della Berggasse, confluivano infatti i suoi clienti viennesi che, oltre a disporre di soldi, presentavano un'infinità di nevrosi, causate, secondo Freud, dall'ambiente sociale e familiare particolarmente repressivo.All'epoca, tuttavia, le malattie nervose erano scarsamente considerate, essendo trattate, negli ospedali, come un ramo secondario della medicina interna. Dallo studio delle malattie psichiche emergono così in Freud diversi interrogativi: cosa sono le nevrosi, le ossessioni, le fobie e tutte le altre forme di psicopatologie? Hanno una causa organica? Se non è così, da dove derivano?Percorrendo questa strada empirica, non disgiunta comunque dallo studio teorico e dall'approfondimento dei miti letterari, Freud giungerà, all'età di 40 anni, a delineare la sua teoria psicoanalitica, con relativo metodo di indagine della psiche, che si diffonderà rapidamente in Europa e negli Stati Uniti.Il rapporto con la medicina del tempoLa psicoanalisi nasce in un rapporto di continuità e discontinuità con la medicina del tempo. Nel clima positivistico e materialistico di fine ‘800, la psichiatria cercava di spiegare la sofferenza mentale come conseguenza di lesioni organiche in qualche zona del cervello, credenza che la psicoanalisi liquiderà definitivamente. Tuttavia Freud si forma in questo ambiente.Frequenta il liceo e quando entra all'università conosce bene latino, greco ed ebraico; scrive direttamente in francese e inglese e tiene corrispondenza in italiano e spagnolo. Per laurearsi ha bisogno di tre anni più del normale, perché si attarda ad approfondire argomenti che il programma sfiorava appena. Nel laboratorio di fisiologia (studio scientifico delle funzioni vitali degli organismi viventi) è affascinato dallo studio dell'istologia del sistema nervoso.Lo studio dei casi di isteria Grazie all'amicizia con il dottor Breuer a Vienna e il dottor Charcot a Parigi, dove Freud si reca per circa un anno dopo la laurea, approfondisce lo studio dei casi di isteria (malattia della psiche che si manifesta con fenomeni di somatizzazione, cioè di trasposizione sul corpo di problemi psichici; esempio: herpes zoster), una patologia che all'epoca si pensava affliggesse solo le donne (il termine deriva infatti dal greco hystéra, “utero”) e che questi due medici curavano utilizzando il metodo dell'ipnosi. In particolare, Breuer gli aveva sottoposto, nel 1882, uno strano caso di isteria, quello di Anna O., una giovane donna affascinante e intelligente, che presentava i seguenti gravi sintomi: paralisi motorie, tosse nervosa, turbe dell'udito e della vista, anoressia e idrofobia (paura del bere). Breuer aveva scoperto, grazie all'ipnosi, che quando era bambina aveva visto bere in un bicchiere da tavola il cane della governante, verso la quale nutriva sentimenti di odio, provando grande ripugnanza. L'episodio era poi stato rimosso, ma Anna O. aveva sviluppato sintomi di idrofobia grave, che soltanto attraverso l'ipnosi era riuscita a comprendere e da cui era quindi guarita.L'ipnosi faceva dunque riemergere circostanze rimosse della vita individuale, che per il solo fatto di essere raccontate si scaricavano, grazie a una sorta di catarsi, di purificazione, consentendo un miglioramento della situazione psichica della paziente. Questo metodo era decisamente lontano dalla vecchia psichiatria materialistica e organicista e molto vicino alla psicoanalisi. L'ipnosi veniva infatti utilizzata non solo per inibire i sintomi, ma anche come metodo per “scoprire motivazione e significato dei sintomi isterici”.L'ipnosi fu in seguito utilizzata anche per curare le nevrosi di guerra, i cui sintomi erano cecità, mutismo, sordità, spasmi facciali e agli arti. Un medico inglese riporta, nel 1919, la guarigione di 128 casi di mutismo in 16 mesi impiegando questo metodo: tutti questi pazienti “ritrovarono la parola una volta costretti a rivivere le loro esperienze”. Verso l'inconscioDi ritorno da Parigi, Freud suscitò scandalo con le sue idee innovative nella conservatrice società viennese. In una conferenza alla società medica sulle sue esperienze francesi, in cui affrontava il tema dell'isteria maschile, suscitò una reazione indignata: per la medicina ufficiale, non solo l'isteria era per definizione femminile, ma aveva origini organiche.Intanto, la terapia tramite l'ipnosi si dimostrava deludente, perché spesso i disturbi isterici, che sembravano scomparire nel periodo della cura, si ripresentavano una volta che il malato era lasciato solo. Sembrava dunque che il malato guarisse solo per compiacere il medico. Freud ne deduce che non è l'ipnosi a causare la guarigione, ma la relazione e il dialogo che nella terapia si stabiliscono tra terapeuta e paziente. Alla base del trattamento ipnotico c'è una relazione che, secondo Freud, assume tutti i i tratti del rapporto erotico, fatto di amore e odio. Il paziente riversa sul medico sentimenti di amore, spesso seguito da odio, e questo appare a prima vista incomprensibile. Freud ne fa materia di riflessione e scopre che la sessualità gioca un ruolo essenziale nella cura dell'isteria e delle altre ossessioni, perché essa è all'origine della malattia. E questa è una grande scoperta di Freud.Nel 1895 pubblica gli Studi sull'isteria. Il trauma isterico deriva dal fatto che il soggetto rifiuta un'idea, un ricordo, un avvenimento che considera intollerabile: nel caso di Anna O., il cane che beve dal bicchiere. L'intollerabilità della scena ne produce la rimozione; la scena rifiutata, in seguito definita “scena primaria”, è ricacciata in una sfera oscura della vita psichica, da cui però fa sentire i suoi effetti, che si presentano sul piano organico (il rifiuto del bere). Se quello appena descritto è il reale meccanismo dell'insorgere della patologia, se ne deve dedurre che la terapia deve seguire la strada inversa e fare il percorso a ritroso, facendo affiorare alla coscienza la scena primaria che ha provocato la rimozione.Freud elabora il metodo delle libere associazioni, ovvero chiede al paziente, disteso sul lettino e con gli occhi chiusi, di rinunciare a ogni riflessione cosciente e di abbandonarsi con tranquilla concentrazione alle proprie idee spontanee, non volontarie, nell'ordine in cui esse si presentano. Il paziente è tenuto a comunicare queste idee improvvise al medico, anche se avverte in sé delle obiezioni a farlo. Nel fare questa scelta Freud è guidato dall'aspettativa che le associazioni libere in realtà si rivelino non libere: una volta repressi tutti i propositi intellettuali coscienti, risulta chiaramente che ciò che determina le idee improvvise è l'inconscio. Freud può procedere verso l'identificazione dell'inconscio e della sua struttura e per quattro anni analizzerà se stesso, getterà il suo sguardo indagatore sulla propria interiorità, scoprendo elementi insospettati e ritrovando la propria infanzia. Scoprirà, per esempio, che la sua avversione per i treni è dovuta al trauma infantile del trasferimento forzato, all'età di quattro anni, dalla campagna alla città, poiché il padre Jakob, commerciante di tessuti, era stato gettato sul lastrico da una delle crisi economiche dell'epoca, che vedeva il passaggio da una produzione artigianale a quella industriale.L'autoanalisi e l'osservazione dei pazienti confluiranno, nel 1900, nella pubblicazione de L'interpretazione dei sogni, considerato il suo capolavoro e uno dei libri fondamentali del Novecento.Così scrive Freud in Voci di enciclopedia: “L'ipnosi era servita a ricondurre al ricordo cosciente del malato ciò che egli aveva dimenticato. Bisognava sostituirla con un'altra tecnica. Freud pensò allora di usare al suo posto il metodo delle associazioni libere, ovvero chiese ai malati l'impegno di rinunciare a ogni riflessione cosciente e di abbandonarsi con tranquilla concentrazione alle proprie idee spontanee, non volontarie, nell'ordine in cui esse si presentavano (“a tastare la superficie della propria coscienza”). I malati erano tenuti a comunicare queste idee improvvise al medico anche se avvertivano in sé delle obiezioni a farlo, come per esempio quella che un certo pensiero era troppo sgradevole, troppo irrilevante o non pertinente... Nel fare questa scelta Freud era guidato dall'aspettativa che le cosiddette associazioni libere in realtà si sarebbero rivelate non libere poiché una volta repressi tutti i propositi intellettuali coscienti, sarebbe risultato chiaramente che ciò che determina le idee improvvise è il materiale inconscio. L'esperienza dimostrò che questa aspettativa era legittima”. Il sogno come via di accesso all'inconscioFreud considera il sogno come la via privilegiata di accesso all'inconscio. Esso è l'appagamento di un desiderio. Se un bambino sogna la befana, si potrebbe concludere che desidera dei giocattoli. Ma non sempre i sogni si prestano a un'interpretazione così lineare, perché molto spesso durante il sogno i desideri si travestono.Freud individua infatti nel sogno l'esistenza di due livelli distinti: uno “manifesto”, costituito dalla scena onirica così come è esposta e vissuta, l'altro “latente”, vale a dire il contenuto nascosto del sogno, che coincide con l'insieme di tendenze, idee e desideri che si esprimono, travestendosi appunto attraverso simboli e allusioni, nel contenuto manifesto.Inoltre: mentre il contenuto manifesto ha in genere origine da avvenimenti della nostra vita recente, il contenuto latente può riferirsi a un tempo molto lontano, nella maggior parte dei casi alla nostra infanzia.Freud ritiene che i desideri che dovrebbero trovare appagamento attraverso il sogno siano desideri rimossi, cioè allontanati dalla coscienza nella vita vigile perché percepiti come inaccettabili e immorali e attinenti, in genere, alla sfera della sessualità. Nella sua vita vigile, cosciente, dove è forte la sorveglianza della ragione, il soggetto prova vergogna dei suoi desideri più scabrosi e li sottopone a censura. Solo grazie al “lavoro onirico” questi desideri possono esprimersi e venire alla luce in forma accettabile. I sogni, infatti, amano il rivestimento simbolico; come l'attività letteraria e artistica, essi non riproducono mai direttamente il materiale che vive dentro di noi, ma lo rivestono di simboli, lo inseriscono in un altro contesto, lo sostituiscono con qualcos'altro. Non è dunque casuale che ciò si verifichi nel sonno, quando la sorveglianza da parte della ragione è ridotta e i sentimenti dell'infanzia possono riemergere con maggiore facilità. Tuttavia, sostiene Freud, anche nel sogno agisce una forma di censura. “Anche i discorsi omessi nel sogno, coperti da un borbottio, sono stati sacrificati alla censura. Parliamo direttamente di una censura onirica, cui bisogna assegnare una certa responsabilità nella deformazione del sogno. Ovunque vi siano lacune nel sogno manifesto, ovunque un elemento onirico venga ricordato in modo particolarmente debole, indeterminato e dubbio, occorre ravvisare sempre una manifestazione della censura onirica”. Secondo Freud, nella vita psichica nulla si distrugge: sia l'energia repressa, sia i desideri rifiutati e rimossi, continuano a tornare a distanza di tempo nascosti sotto altre vesti. Per liberarci di questi fantasmi e scaricare la nostra energia psichica occorre dunque percorrere il cammino a ritroso: dal contenuto manifesto al contenuto latente. Se dunque occorre “interpretare” i messaggi contenuti nelle opere letterarie o artistiche, per capire quello che lo scrittore, ma soprattutto il pittore o lo scultore, hanno voluto nascondere in esse, a maggior ragione è necessario “interpretare” i sogni, per fare affiorare alla coscienza, con l'aiuto del terapeuta, quelle parti del nostro inconscio in essi nascosti. In questo modo possiamo comprendere meglio noi stessi e guadagnare in salute.Lapsus e piccole disattenzioni quotidianeAnalogo discorso vale per i lapsus (dal latino labi, “scivolare”) o “atti mancati”, come li definisce Freud. Essi derivano da un compromesso tra l'intenzione consapevole del soggetto e i suoi pensieri inconsci che premono per uscire allo scoperto.Si tratta di quei fatti strani, in apparenza insignificanti, della vita di ogni giorno, a cui nessuna bada: lapsus verbali, dimenticanze, errori di lettura o scrittura, che capitano quando siamo distratti o sbadati, appena svegli o molto stanchi, vale a dire in tutte quelle situazioni in cui, pur essendo svegli, la vigilanza della ragione è attenuata, indebolita. Freud analizza e interpreta questi atti, solo in apparenza inintenzionali, come sintomi, segni di alcuni fatti sconosciuti della nostra vita psichica, su cui occorre riflettere per superare nodi problematici che possono ostacolare una vita serena. In un'opera pubblicata nel 1901, Psicopatologia della vita quotidiana, Freud ne raccoglie un'infinità di esempi. “I casi più frequenti di lapsus verbale sono quelli in cui al posto di una parola se ne pronuncia un'altra, e per molti questa somiglianza è spiegazione sufficiente del lapsus. Per esempio, un professore nella sua prolusione: è per me una noia descrivere i meriti del mio predecessore. Oppure un altro professore: nel caso del genitale femminile, nonostante molte tentazioni, pardon, tentativi...”I lapsus a volte possono essere divertenti, come nel seguente caso: “un uomo sposato da poco e al quale la moglie, preoccupata di conservare l'aspetto e la freschezza di una ragazzina, rifiutava rapporti sessuali molto frequenti, dopo una notte nel corso della quale aveva contravvenuto al regime di continenza della moglie, si stava facendo la barba nella camera da letto comune e, come altre volte, usava il pennello da cipria trovato nella “toilette” della moglie, che era rimasta a letto. La donna, preoccupatissima della propria carnagione, gli aveva già più volte impedito di usarlo a questo scopo e gli disse con irritazione: “Ecco, tu mi incipri un'altra volta con il tuo piumino”. Il marito scoppiò a ridere e lei si accorse di avere commesso un lapsus”.La struttura della psicheA differenza della psicologia precedente, Freud non considera l'Io come un'entità semplice e trasparente, riconducibile alla sola vita cosciente (il soggetto totalmente trasparente a sé stesso). La psiche umana è una unità strutturata in modo topologico, presenta cioè un certo numero di “luoghi” o “zone” (tòpoi in greco) distinte al proprio interno. Paragonando la psiche a un iceberg, la coscienza rappresenta solo la punta che emerge fuori dall'acqua. Immediamente sotto la superficie del mare, dove l'iceberg è ancora visibile ma in modo meno nitido, c'è il preconscio, quella parte della nostra psiche dove sono posti eventi semplicemente dimenticati, non “rimossi”, facilmente recuperabili. Sotto queste due parti della psiche, cioè sotto la soglia della nostra sfera di consapevolezza, c'è l'inconscio, questo grande sotterraneo in cui abbiamo sepolto - “rimosso” scrive Freud - tutto ciò che dovevamo dimenticare, perché sconveniente e immorale. Per spiegare il meccanismo della rimozione, Freud adopera la seguente metafora. Immaginate che tra il pubblico ci sia una persona maleducata, che disturba la mia conferenza. Io non riesco a continuare il mio discorso e quindi invito alcuni robusti signori a cacciare l'individuo fuori dalla sala. Questo individuo viene quindi allontanato (“rimosso”) e io posso continuare la mia relazione. Però, per evitare che possa tornare a disturbare, invito i signori che l'hanno allontanato a prendere le loro sedie e sistemarsi davanti alla porta d'ingresso. L'importuno, tuttavia, non si rassegna, e cerca continuamente di tornare nella sala.La metafora è molto chiara. La sala dove si tiene la conferenza è la coscienza e il suo ingresso, dove l'importuno viene cacciato, è l'inconscio. L'importuno rappresenta i desideri inaccettabili e gli uomini di guardia la rimozione. L'importuno che non si rassegna rappresenta infine i desideri inaccettabili che cercano sempre di scappare dall'inconscio e tornare sulla scena della coscienza. Questo accade quando le difese della coscienza si attenuano, durante il sonno o quando siamo distratti o sbadati.Le tre istanze della psicheModificando in seguito il proprio pensiero, Freud ritiene che nella psiche umana siano presenti tre luoghi, tre “istanze”: l'Es, l'Io e il Super-Io.L'Es: terza persona del pronome singolare neutro tedesco, rappresenta le nostre pulsioni e i nostri instinti. Freud dice che è “un calderone di impulsi ribollenti”. Per averne un'idea basta guardare i neonati, che vivono i loro bisogni in modo immediato, senza alcuna forma di censura. Se hanno fame urlano, se devono fare i loro bisogni non si curano se sono in pubblico o davanti a un medico che li sta visitando. L'Es non conosce né il bene, né il male e ubbidisce solo al principio di piacere. Così delineato in tutta la sua carica aggressiva, si identifica con l'inconscio.Il Super-Io: è la coscienza morale, cioè tutto l'insieme dei divieti e delle prescrizioni che fin da bambini ci sono stati impartiti dai genitori e dal mondo circostante e che noi abbiamo “introiettato”, cioé inconsapevolmente assorbito nell'inconscio, assumendoli come un modello ideale di comportamento. Riprendendo l'esempio del neonato, egli imparerà gradualmente a controllare i suoi desideri spontanei, perché sarà educato a mangiare a ore determinate, a non fare i suoi bisogni davanti a tutti, a censurare i desideri sconvenienti, specie quelli riferibili alla sfera sessuale.L'Io: è la parte organizzata della nostra personalità psichica e, soprattutto, è il luogo della mediazione e della sintesi delle altre due parti di cui la psiche si compone e che si contrappongono tra loro. Quando si trova in condizioni normali, l'Io è sottoposto alla rigida vigilanza del Super-Io e controlla la sfera delle azioni, per cui l'Es non può appagare i propri desideri, le proprie pulsioni, senza superare le barriere imposte dal Super-Io. L'Io deve poi fare i conti con un terzo severo padrone, poiché al Super-Io e all'Es si aggiunge “un terzo tiranno”, il mondo esterno. Il poveretto, scrive Freud, è accerchiato da tre parti, si sente circondato da tre pericoli, ai quali reagisce, nei casi estremi, sviluppando sintomi nevrotici.Non è difficile scorgere in tale descrizione la difficile situazione dell'uomo moderno che nel migliore dei casi riesce a tenersi in precario equilibrio tra le esigenze della realtà (Super-Io), le difficoltà della sua personale esistenza (Io) e le proprie personali pulsioni (Es): un uomo solo in apparenza forte e civilizzato, ma in realtà profondamente insicuro e debole.Così scrive Freud in Introduzione alla psicoanalisi: “Spinto così dall'Es, stretto dal Super Io, respinto dalla realtà, l'Io lotta per venire a capo del suo compito economico di stabilire l'armonia tra le forze e gli impulsi che agiscono in lui e su di lui; e noi comprendiamo perché tanto spesso non ci è possibile reprimere l'esclamazione: la vita non è facile!”. La Grande Guerra aveva offerto abbondante conferma alla teoria psicoanalitica della nevrosi. La nevrosi di guerra, al pari della nevrosi dei tempi di pace, era la fuga, attraverso la malattia, da una realtà percepita come intollerabile e distruttiva: in tempo di pace si trattava dell'insopportabile pressione esercitata sull'Io da Es e Super-Io, in tempo di guerra della disumana e aberrante vita di trincea in prima linea. I principali sintomi nevrotici erano cecità, sordità, mutismo, blocchi psicomotori e spasmi facciali e agli arti. La nevrosi fu un effetto psichico non tanto della guerra in generale, ma della guerra industrializzata in particolare, della completa meccanizzazione del conflitto. L'arco dei sintomi isterici fu senza precedenti e gli psichiatri presenti nelle retrovie e tra le truppe al fronte colsero immediatamente, già nel corso del conflitto, il rapporto tra le caratteristiche industriali della guerra di massa e l'incidenza della nevrosi: si trattava di un disturbo “funzionale” per i soldati in prima linea perché li toglieva dal fronte e proprio questo era lo “scopo” conscio o inconscio del sintomo, “fuggire da una situazione reale intollerabile a una situazione resa tollerabile dalla nevrosi”. La nevrosi e la terapia psicoanaliticaLa nevrosi nasce dalla struttura conflittuale della psiche. L'Io, pressato dai suoi tre padroni, non sempre riesce a mantenere un equilibrio e la nevrosi è appunto uno dei principali segni di squilibrio della psiche, una via di fuga da una situazione considerata non sopportabile.Freud racconta questo esempio. Una sua paziente era segretamente innamorata del cognato e, quando la sorella morì per una grave malattia, si rallegrò al pensiero che avrebbe potuto sposare l'uomo amato. Ma questo pensiero si scontrò con il suo Super-Io: gioire per la morte di una persona era talmente mostruoso che questo sentimento venne respinto nell'inconscio. La ragazza allora si ammalò (nelle nevrosi il sintomo è sempre somatizzato), presentando sintomi isterici gravi. Durante la terapia emerse la scena immaginata alla morte della sorella, che era stata totalmente dimenticata perché rimossa e la ragazza guarì nel momento in cui riuscì a riportare alla sfera della coscienza tali contenuti.Anche nell'individuo “normale”, tuttavia, l'Io subisce l'attacco delle contrastanti forze dell'Es, del Super-Io e della realtà. Non c'è normalità che non sia vulnerabile e il confine tra normalità e patologia è molto labile, sottile (“Visto da vicino, nessuno è normale”). In breve, l'individuo può dirsi normale quando se la cava abbastanza bene nel comporre le spinte contraddittorie presenti in lui; per esempio, quando riesce a dare piccole soddisfazioni all'Es senza contravvenire alle norme del Super-Io. Esempio classico sono il matrimonio, la famiglia e l'allevamento della prole: si tratta di un modo per incanalare la pulsione sessuale nell'alveo del rapporto istituzionale di coppia.Può tuttavia accadere che un Super-Io troppo forte rimuova il desiderio e le richieste dell'Es siano cacciate nell'inconscio, da dove riemergono generando i sintomi nevrotici. La psiche dell'uomo si trova dunque in uno stato di continua tensione, è il luogo di un dramma analogo a quello che i poeti tragici della Grecia classica hanno saputo interpretare in modo mirabile. E non è un caso che Freud ne riprenda i grandi miti letterari, per esempio il mito di Edipo raccontato da Sofocle.Il linguaggio dei sintomiIn una bella immagine, Freud vede nel sintomo il messaggero che porta all'esterno del campo di battaglia i segnali dell'avvenuto conflitto. Esso è portatore di un messaggio, che occorre interpretare e capire. Compito della terapia psicoanalitica è decifrare questo messaggio, interpretare il linguaggio in cui è scrittoDurante la terapia il paziente si mette a proprio agio ed è invitato a raccontare, senza alcuna censura, i propri sogni, le proprie fantasie, i propri ricordi. Durante la terapia si stabilisce, tra medico e paziente, una interazione positiva, che Freud chiama transfert. Ciò significa che il paziente nevrotico, sempre carente a livello affettivo, acquista fiducia nel proprio analista sviluppando nei suoi confronti sentimenti di amore, che Freud ritiene di grande importanza per la buona riuscita dell'analisi. Il paziente “innamorato” cerca infatti di non deludere il proprio medico, raccontandogli tutto quello che sa.Un'ultima osservazione. Contrariamente a quanto affermano molti critici della psicoanalisi, Freud non ritiene che essa sia onnipotente e neppure che sia bene che l'uomo guarisca del tutto dalle sue nevrosi: “Non stupitevi di udire che perfino il medico, talvolta, prende le parti della malattia da lui combattuta. Non gli si addice rinserrarsi nelle parti del fanatico della salute, di fronte a tutte le situazioni della vita; egli sa che al mondo non vi è solo miseria nevrotica, ma anche la sofferenza reale, irrimediabile, e che la necessità può anche esigere che l'uomo sacrifichi la propria salute”.La teoria della sessualitàLessico Oggetto sessuale. “La persona dalla quale parte l'attrazione sessuale”. Meta sessuale. “La direzione verso la quale la pulsione spinge”. Pulsione. “Noi ce la rappresentiamo come un certo ammontare di energia, che preme verso una determinata direzione. Nella pulsione si possono distinguere: fonte, oggetto e meta. La fonte è uno stato di eccitamento nel corpo, la meta l'eliminazione di tale eccitamento; lungo il percorso dalla fonte alla meta la pulsione diviene psichicamente attiva”. Libido. La pulsione sessuale intesa come energia priva di un oggetto univocamente determinato. Essa presenta pertanto i caratteri di plasticità, può cioè indirizzarsi e spostarsi su mete differenti, e di polimorfismo, può cioè presentarsi in forme e modalità differenti. Una nuova teoria della vita sessualeLa psicoanalisi implica una rivoluzione anche nel modo di guardare alla sfera della sessualità, che, secondo Freud, riveste un ruolo fondamentale nella vita umana.Va subito fatta una precisazione. Quando Freud parla di sessualità, non si riferisce solo alla sfera genitale e alla procreazione, ma a un fenomeno più ampio e complesso, che riguarda la dimensione della ricerca del piacere. Questo è un punto importante, perché la psicologia e la morale tradizionali identificavano il fine della sessualità esclusivamente nella riproduzione e quindi solo in quest'ottica consideravano lecito il perseguimento del piacere. Ne derivava, per esempio, che l'omosessualità, femminile e maschile, era considerata una forma di perversione (lat. pervertere, “volgere in un'altra direzione”) sessuale, essendo una forma di sessualità che deviava da quello che era considerato il normale, logico e lecito fine della sessualità. Se invece, come Freud, si ammette che già il semplice piacere sessuale sia un fine in sé, che dunque è lecito, logico e normale perseguire, allora scompare questa distinzione tra comportamento normale, in quanto finalizzato alla riproduzione, e perversione. Attualmente si stima che circa il 20% della popolazione sia omosessuale. La pulsione sessuale è concepita da Freud dinamicamente e per questo indicata con il termine libido. Essa è cioè intesa come energia che può muoversi in direzioni diverse o attivare meccanismi psicosessuali differenti e orientati verso oggetti molteplici.”L'ingordigia della libido infantile non ha limiti”: la sessualità infantileQuesto allargamento del concetto di sessualità porta Freud a individuarne la presenza anche nell'infanzia, fino a quel momento considerata come l'età spensierata dei giochi, della purezza e dell'innocenza. La bambina e il bambino vivono una complessa vita sessuale, che si manifesta in gesti semplici e istintivi come la suzione del latte materno. Queste idee suscitarono scandalo e disgusto presso l'opinione pubblica benpensante di tutta Europa. Freud considerò questa reazione come una “ferita narcisistica all'orgoglio umano”, proponendo un paragone con un'altra ferita analoga inflitta all'umanità, quella di Copernico a metà Cinquecento. Freud proseguì per la sua strada, avendo modo di sperimentare personalmente che molte forme di nevrosi dei suoi pazienti era riconducibili alla sessualità repressa dei primi anni di vita.Freud è volutamente provocatorio nel definire la bambina/bambino come un essere “perverso e polimorfo”. Perverso, perché la pulsione sessuale non tende al fine della sessualità, la procreazione, ma, per esempio nel caso del neonato, alla suzione del latte materno. Polimorfo perché, nei primi anni di vita, prova piacere attraverso parti diverse del suo corpo, che si riferiscono alle diverse fasi del suo sviluppo psicosessuale. Nella fase orale il piacere è rappresentato dalla suzione e la zona erogena è la bocca; in questa fase la bocca è lo strumento con cui egli esplora il mondo. Passa poi alla fase anale, che va in genere da uno a tre anni e che ha nell'ano e nelle connesse funzioni corporali la sua zona erogena. Alla fine del terzo anno passa alla fase genitale, che a sua volta si divide in fase fallica e fase genitale in senso stretto e che ha come zona erogena gli organi sessuali. Segue un periodo di latenza, cha va dal sesto anno alla pubertà, quando la sessualità dell'adolescente esplode come una tempesta di tutti i sensi.Il complesso di EdipoDurante la fase fallica, dai tre ai cinque anni, si registrano un'attaccamento erotico della bambina/bambino verso il genitore di sesso opposto e un sentimento di ostilità verso il genitore dello stesso sesso. Il maschio, per esempio, considera il padre come un rivale e desidera avere la madre tutta per sé. Pretende di dormire nel suo stesso letto e, a volte, promette di sposarla e di non abbandonarla mai.Anche la bambina si sente attratta verso il padre da un sentimento analogo, tende a escludere la madre e, spesso, manifesta una civetteria che prelude alla futura femminilità.Freud, riferendosi al rapporto figlio-madre, denomina “complesso di Edipo” la costellazione erotica appena descritta, ispirandosi alla tragedia scritta da Sofocle nel V secolo a.c., in cui è narrata la vicenda dell'eroe greco cui il destino aveva riservato la terribile sorte di uccidere il padre e sposare la madre, Giocasta. Secondo Freud, l'orrore dell'uomo di tutti i tempi verso tale tragedia deriva dal fatto che in tutti noi è presente un analogo desiderio infantile. Nella tragedia, infatti, in un dialogo tra Edipo e Giocasta, che ha luogo quando Edipo scopre che di essere stato adottato da coloro che pensava fossero i suoi genitori ma non sa ancora di avere preso in moglie sua madre, Giocasta dice: Tu non temere le nozze con tua madre: già molti mortali si giacquero in sogno con la propria madre. In altre parole, il terrore per l'uccisione del padre e il possesso della madre è una minaccia costante nella fantasia di ciascuno di noi.Freud, tuttavia, attribuisce una funzione essenziale a tale complesso. Ogni maschio deve superare il complesso di Edipo per potere maturare, pervenire cioè a uno stadio adulto e a una vita sessuale serena e consapevole; questo implica lo spostamento dell'attrazione dalla madre verso una meta sessuale esterna e la riconciliazione con il padre. Coloro che non riescono a superare pienamente tale complesso e a liberarsi dall'attaccamento alla madre, si portano dietro per tutta la vita un ambiguo senso di colpa, che impedisce loro di vivere una sessualità matura e soddisfacente. Eros e Thanatos Il concetto di libido, che Freud viene maturando nel corso dei suoi studi, gli consente di cogliere l'istinto sessuale come manifestazione di un'unica pulsione che, proprio per la sua intrinseca plasticità, può rivolgersi all'esterno o ritrarsi verso l'interno e indirizzarsi all'Io (ne è un esempio il narcisismo). In questa fase, Freud postula un'unica libido, che si manifesta come libido oggettuale o libido narcisistica. Nell'ultimo periodo della sua ricerca, a partire da Il disagio della civiltà del 1929, a partire dallo studio dei traumi di guerra e dei sogni a essi correlati, apporta una serie di osservazioni che contrastano con tale precedente assunto. Freud si convince che nell'uomo esiste una tendenza innata all'aggressività, che sembrerebbe indipendente dalle pulsioni propriamente conservative. Per questo motivo egli distingue, nelle ultime opere, due gruppi di pulsioni: da una parte, quelle che tendono a unire e conservare, che riunisce sotto il nome di Eros con riferimento al mito platonico del Simposio, in cui rientrano la libido narcisistica e quella oggettuale in precedenza teorizzate; dall'altra, quelle che tendono a separare e distruggere. Egli, dunque, arriva a riconoscere, accanto alla libido oggettuale e a quella narcisistica, un fondamentale “istinto di morte”, cioè una tendenza alla distruzione, all'annientamento, alla morte, presente sia nel singolo individuo, sia nelle masse, come nel caso del fascismo e, in modo particolare, del nazismo. Tale pulsione viene poi riconosciuta, accanto alle pulsioni vitali, come una forza costitutiva dell'intera sostanza vivente, che avrebbe in sé il seme della propria distruzione, la tendenza alla morte, al compimento del ciclo di vita. Si tratta dell'aspetto più teorico e speculativo del pensiero di Freud, che da un lato muove dai fatti concreti dell'esperienza di analisi, ma dall'altro riecheggia intuizioni di filosofi più o meno lontani, come Eraclito o Schopenhauer. L'esistenza di tutti gli esseri appare così dominata dalla presenza di due forze contrastanti, Eros e Thanatos (“morte”), impegnate in un'eterna lotta in cui viene posto il fondamento di ogni cosa. Certamente agli occhi di Freud il fascismo e il nazismo, caratterizzati dall'identificazione delle masse con il capo e con il conseguente carico di orrore che stavano per portare nel mondo, dovettero apparire come espressione della forza di Thanatos e della sua tendenza dissolutrice. Anna Freud Figlia del fondatore della psicoanalisi, fu costretta nel 1938 a emigrare da Vienna a Londra con la famiglia a seguito delle leggi razziali. In Gran Bretagna si volse precocemente allo studio e all'approfondimento delle teorie paterne, divenendo a propria volta un'autorità per gli psicoanalisti di scuola anglosassone. L'impegno suo e dei suoi collaboratori e collaboratrici nella Hampstead Child Therapy Clinic fu rivolto in particolare al trattamento analitico dei bambini, ma anche alla sistemazione delle ricerche psicoanalitiche nel campo dell'infanzia, allo scopo di confrontare le osservazioni cliniche condotte sul campo con i concetti della teoria psicoanalitica classica.

La nascita della psicoanalisi fonda le sue radici nelle osservazioni cliniche di Freud sui disturbi mentali, osservazioni che lo portarono a interrogarsi sulle cause delle nevrosi e delle ossessioni, all'epoca poco comprese dalla medicina tradizionale. Freud inizialmente esplorò l'efficacia dell'ipnosi, appresa dagli studi con il dottor Breuer a Vienna e con il dottor Charcot a Parigi. Attraverso l'ipnosi, Freud riuscì a rievocare nella mente dei pazienti eventi rimosi, dando luogo a una temporanea remissione dei sintomi. Tuttavia, la guarigione sembrava superficiale, poiché i disturbi tendevano a riaffiorare. Proprio tale osservazione lo condusse a una svolta metodologica: la sostituzione dell'ipnosi con il metodo delle libere associazioni. Questo approccio consentiva ai pazienti di esprimere liberamente i propri pensieri, guidando Freud nella mappatura dell'inconscio. Con l'invenzione della psicoanalisi, Freud aprì una finestra su quella parte oscura e inesplorata della psiche umana: l'inconscio. Sviluppò una complessa teorizzazione della mente, introducendo il modello delle tre istanze psichiche: l'Es, l'Io, e il Super-Io, che interagiscono dinamicamente all'interno della psiche individuale. Attraverso la sua pratica clinica, Freud esplorò inoltre l'importanza fondamentale della sessualità nello sviluppo psicologico, teorizzando controversi concetti come il complesso di Edipo e la sessualità infantile. Verso la fine della sua carriera, l'approfondimento delle dinamiche aggressivi e autodistruttive dell'uomo portò Freud a postulare l'esistenza di due pulsioni fondamentali: Eros e Thanatos, incarnanti la spinta vitale e quella di morte. La psicoanalisi di Freud, pur suscitando ampie controversie, ha segnato indelebilmente la psicologia, la cultura e il pensiero del Novecento, aprendo nuove prospettive sul disagio e sul trattamento delle afflizioni mentali."},{"instruction":"Come mai la nascita della psicoanalisi è considerata una rivoluzione scientifica \\"non tipica\\"?","output":"La nascita della psicoanalisi viene considerata una rivoluzione scientifica \\"non tipica\\" per diverse ragioni fondamentali che la distinguono da altre rivoluzioni scientifiche, come quelle di Copernico in astronomia o di Darwin in biologia. Innanzi tutto, a differenza dei cambiamenti in campi come la fisica o la biologia, dove si verificano spesso progressi attraverso l'accumulo di nuove evidenze empiriche e la formulazione di teorie specifiche basate su questi dati, la psicoanalisi ha rivoluzionato il campo della medicina e della psicologia introducendo una nuova dimensione interpretativa della mente umana, l'inconscio. Questo aspetto \\"interpretativo\\" si discosta dalle rivoluzioni scientifiche \\"tipiche\\" che sono più facilmente quantificabili e basate su osservazioni empiriche dirette. In secondo luogo, Freud ha messo in discussione le fondamenta stesse su cui si basava la comprensione dell'essere umano e del suo comportamento, proponendo che fossero influenzate da processi inconsci non immediatamente accessibili o osservabili. Questa idea contrastava radicalmente con il pensiero scientifico dell'epoca, che tendeva a concentrarsi su cause fisiche, misurabili, per spiegare i fenomeni psicologici. Inoltre, la psicoanalisi non si limitava a introducere una nuova tecnica terapeutica, ma proponeva una teoria complessiva dello sviluppo umano, della sessualità, dei sogni, e molti altri aspetti dell'esistenza, rendendola una rivoluzione culturale e filosofica oltre che scientifica. Infine, la psicoanalisi ha stimolato il dibattito in molte discipline al di fuori della psicologia, come la letteratura, l'arte, il cinema e la filosofia, influenzando in modo profondo il discorso culturale del Novecento. Questa capacità di trasformare il pensiero in settori così diversi e di stimolare un esame profondo e critico dell'essere umano indica chiaramente il suo carattere rivoluzionario \\"non tipico\\" rispetto ad altre trasformazioni scientifiche. Per tutte queste ragioni, la psicoanalisi rappresenta un caso unico nel panorama delle rivoluzioni scientifiche, portando a un cambiamento paradigmatico nel modo in cui l'umanità comprende se stessa."},{"instruction":"Riassumi la risposta alla domanda \\"Come mai la nascita della psicoanalisi è considerata una rivoluzione scientifica non tipica?\\" in due frasi","output":"La nascita della psicoanalisi è considerata una rivoluzione scientifica \\"non tipica\\" perché ha introdotto il concetto radicale dell'inconscio, sfidando le fondamenta della comprensione dell'essere umano e del suo comportamento basate fino ad allora su cause fisiche e osservabili. Inoltre, ha influenzato non solo il campo della medicina e della psicologia, ma anche la cultura, l'arte e la filosofia, mostrando un impatto trasversale e profondamente integrato nel tessuto sociale e intellettuale del Novecento."},{"instruction":"I maestri del sospetto e la negazione dell’esperienza morale: Marx, Nietzsche Freud, La definizione di “maestri del sospetto” risale al filosofo francese Paul Ricouer, che in un saggio del 1965, intitolato non a caso L’interpretazione. Saggio su Freud, individua in Marx, Nietzsche e Freud i critici delle cosiddette “false ideologie”; vale a dire che questi autori avanzano il sospetto che l’esperienza morale non sia libera, ma che agiscano dei meccanismi automatici, che il soggetto e, a partire da esso, la collettività, subiscono senza potere esercitare la propria libertà. Ovviamente, in questi tre autori, tale critica è esercitata in modo differente. Karl Marx (1818 - 1883): individua nel rapporto struttura-sovrastruttura il meccanismo che guida l’esperienza morale. L’unica struttura reale per Marx sono i rapporti economici di potere e la morale non è che una sovrastruttura dipendente da tali rapporti. La morale non è che la difesa di un determinato assetto di potere: in questo caso si tratta della morale borghese della società capitalista - borghese. Non è dunque la coscienza del singolo individuo a determinare il suo essere, ma l’essere sociale della “classe” cui appartiene a determinare la sua coscienza. Friedrich Nietzsche (1844 - 1900): individua nel risentimento la conseguenza dell’esperienza morale. Ritiene che la morale tradizionale, identificata con la morale cristiana, sia una conseguenza del risentimento dei deboli. Questi, umiliati dall’esperienza dei forti e non potendo ribaltare la realtà, si costruiscono una morale rovesciata e chiamano “male” ciò che è bene (forza, piacere) e “bene” ciò che è male (umiltà, rinuncia). In pratica, non potendo rovesciare la realtà, la rovesciano a livello di morale. Nei Frammenti postumi scrive: “Non esistono fenomeni morali, ma solo interpretazioni morali dei fenomeni”. Sigmund Freud (1859 - 1939): individua nei rapporti tra Io, Es e Super Io il meccanismo che identifica la libertà dell’esperienza morale. L’Io è determinato nel conflitto tra l’istintività (Es) e la razionalità (Super Io). L’Es è l’uomo allo stato naturale, il bimbo che persegue il piacere senza remore. Il Super Io si costituisce quando al bimbo viene negato il piacere che deriva dal possesso della madre a causa della presenza della figura paterna. In questo momento avviene la rimozione della libido (pulsione sessuale) e l’introduzione della morale nell’identificazione del bambino con la figura paterna. La morale è quindi la “situazione secondaria – che noi siamo troppo facilmente disposti a ritenere quella normale – in cui l’impedimento esterno viene interiorizzato e al posto dell’istanza parentale subentra il Super Io”, il quale ora osserva, guida e minaccia l’Io, esattamente come prima i genitori con il bambino. In parole povere, prima i genitori e poi il Super Io reprimono la libido (pulsioni di vita) e la pulsione sessuale. Secondo questo testo, indica cosa intende Paul Ricouer per \\"maestri del sospetto\\" e per quale motivo considera Freud uno di essi","output":"Paul Ricouer conia il termine \\"maestri del sospetto\\" per identificare tre figure intellettuali – Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche e Sigmund Freud – che hanno esercitato una critica profonda verso le basi dell'esperienza morale, avanzando il sospetto che dietro a essa non vi sia una libertà autentica, ma piuttosto dei meccanismi automatici che influenzano e determinano l'agire individuale e collettivo in modo inconscio. Questi autori, quindi, sfidano le concezioni tradizionali e apparentemente inoppugnabili della morale, suggerendo che le motivazioni e i principi morali sono in realtà il prodotto di strutture sottostanti che esercitano un'influenza occulta sul comportamento umano. Freud è considerato uno dei \\"maestri del sospetto\\" perché, attraverso la sua teoria psicoanalitica, ha identificato nella dinamica tra Io, Es e Super Io il meccanismo che determina l'esistenza di restrizioni moralmente imposte sull'individuo. Secondo Freud, l'Io viene formato dal conflitto tra le istanze biologiche e istintuali dell'Es e le restrizioni morali e sociali rappresentate dal Super Io. In questo schema, la morale emersa dalla figura paterna durante l'infanzia, e poi interiorizzata come Super Io, reprimerebbe la libido innata dell'individuo, guidando le sue azioni secondo un ordine morale acquisito piuttosto che secondo una libera espressione del sé. Quindi, per Ricouer, Freud mette in dubbio l'autonomia della morale, proponendo una spiegazione alternativa che radica le sensazioni di colpa e le decisioni morali in forze psichiche inconsce piuttosto che in una scelta libera e razionale."},{"instruction":"Riassumi la risposta alla domanda “Come mai la nascita della psicoanalisi è considerata una rivoluzione scientifica non tipica?” e quest'ultima domanda \\"cosa intende Paul Ricouer per “maestri del sospetto” e per quale motivo considera Freud uno di essi?\\" in un singolo breve testo di 200 parole","output":"La nascita della psicoanalisi, opera di Sigmund Freud, rappresenta una rivoluzione scientifica \\"non tipica\\" poiché, anziché basarsi su dati empirici diretti, ha introdotto il radicale concetto dell'inconscio, mettendo in discussione le basi della comprensione umana con una nuova dimensione interpretativa della mente. Questo cambio di paradigma ha avuto un impatto profondo non solo nella medicina e psicologia, ma anche nelle aree culturali, artistiche e filosofiche, riflettendo così un carattere trasversale unico rispetto ad altre rivoluzioni scientifiche. Parallelamente, Paul Ricouer ha definito come \\"maestri del sospetto\\" Marx, Nietzsche e Freud, evidenziando il loro comune approccio critico nei confronti delle basi dell'esperienza morale. Questi pensatori hanno suggerito che le motivazioni morali non derivano da una libera scelta razionale ma sono il risultato di meccanismi sottostanti inconsci e automatici. Freud viene annoverato tra questi maestri per il suo lavoro sulla psicoanalisi, che ha rivelato come la morale sia profondamente collegata a dinamiche inconscie tra Io, Es e Super Io, rimodellando così la comprensione dell'autonomia morale umana attraverso la lente del conflitto psichico interno."},{"instruction":"supponiamo che io e super io non esistessero.

Leo is presented with three choices: Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly. After a heartwarming encounter, Leo chooses Fuecoco, and together they embark on a journey to conquer the Paldean Pokémon League and uncover the secrets of the Terastal phenomenon. Throughout the season, Leo is joined by Scarlet, a determined and compassionate trainer who dreams of becoming the greatest Pokémon Champion. Together, they encounter friends and rivals, such as the tech-savvy inventor, Hugo, and the mysterious Camellia, who possesses a unique connection with the legendary Pokémon, Koraidon. As they journey through Paldea, Leo and his friends face challenges from Team Crimson, an organization with a dark agenda revolving around the ancient lore of the region and the legendary Pokémon, Miraidon. Through trials, battles, and discoveries, Leo's bonds with Fuecoco and his team grow stronger, culminating in an epic showdown against Team Crimson's leader, revealing the true power of Terastalization and the deep history between Koraidon and Miraidon. **Season 2: Violet Voyages** Continuing from the dramatic finale of the first season, Leo and his friends delve deeper into the mysteries of Paldea, with a focus on Miraidon and the newly discovered Violet manuscript which hints at an uncharted island off the coast of Paldea, where forgotten Pokémon and ancient technologies hide. Alongside Scarlet, Hugo, and a new companion, the treasure hunter Marina, whose expertise in ancient civilizations and mechanics prove invaluable, Leo sets sail to explore these uncharted territories. Their journey is fraught with peril as they face the aggressive wildlife, natural disasters, and the remnants of Team Crimson, now led by the enigmatic \\"Violet Knight,\\" who seeks to harness the ancient powers hidden on the island to reshape Paldea's destiny. In this season, the themes of exploration, the significance of friendship, and the inevitable confrontation between tradition and innovation come to the forefront. Leo's leadership is tested, and his resolve strengthened as they uncover the lost city of Polaris, where the secrets of a bygone civilization and the origins of Terastalization await. Ultimately, the power of Teamwork, understanding between generations, and the embrace of change lead Leo and his team to thwart the Violet Knight's plans, rescuing Miraidon and revealing the city of Polaris as a testament of harmony between humanity and Pokémon. **Season 3: Chronicles of Unity** Returning to Paldea, Leo, Scarlet, Hugo, and Marina find the region transformed by their discoveries. The knowledge and technologies from Polaris have spurred new developments, prompting both excitement and fear among the Paldeans. As tensions rise, a new threat emerges from the shadows — the Eclipse Organization, bent on exploiting the Terastal phenomenon and the technologies of Polaris for their gain, employing dangerous Pokémon genetically altered to be unstoppable. Faced with their toughest challenges yet, Leo and his friends must rally the Trainers of Paldea to defend their home. United by their love for Pokémon and their experiences, the people of Paldea come together, bringing forth the untapped potential of Terastalization, not as a weapon, but as a way to deepen the bond between Pokémon and humans. In a climactic battle that spans the skies of Paldea to the depths of the sea, the unity of the region shines, dispelling the ambitions of Eclipse. In the aftermath, a grand Pokémon League tournament is held, celebrating the newfound unity and peace, where Leo, now recognized as a hero, faces off in the finals against Scarlet, culminating in a battle that goes down in Paldean history. As the series concludes, the adventures of Leo and his friends are celebrated, their legacy inspiring a new generation of Trainers. With the Paldea region at peace and the mysteries of Terastal revealed, Leo looks to the horizon, knowing that as long as they have their Pokémon by their side, there will always be new adventures ahead."},{"instruction":"Write a tweet saying this series makes history by making major changes","output":"🚨Breaking News🚨 #PokémonArdorAdventures makes history in the #Pokémon universe! 🐾✨ For the 1st time, witness a series that revolutionizes storytelling with epic Terastal battles, deep dives into Paldea's mysteries, and unparalleled unity among Trainers!

Ресурсы, которыми можно было бы поддерживать благосостояние будущих поко лений, уже израсходованы. Однако еще остается множество доступных вариантов, и их можно воплотить в жизнь. На рис. 1.4 показано, как много у нас есть возможностей. Здесь изображены графики численности населения и уровня благосостояния, полученные в девяти основных компьютерных сценариях - мы приводим их в книге3 . Варианты возможного будущего включают в себя множество разных путей. Это может быть резкий спад и катастрофа, но это может быть и постепенный переход к самоподдержанию. Среди вариантов нет только одного: бесконечного роста в физически ограниченном пространстве. Это просто невозможно — планета имеет физические пределы. Единственный реально возможный путь - привести потоки, поддерживающие существование человека, в соответствие с допустимыми уровнями. Либо мы сделаем это сами, сознательно, с помощью технических и организа ционных мер, либо природа сделает это за нас - наступит нехватка про довольствия, сырья, энергии или среда станет неблагоприятной для про живания. В 1972 г. мы начали книгу «Пределы роста» цитатой из выступления У Тана (U Thant), тогдашнего генерального секретаря ООН: «Я не хочу чрезмерно драматизировать ситуацию, но на основе информации, доступной мне как генеральному секретарю, я могу заключить, что у стран — членов ООН, возможно, осталось в запасе 10 лет на то, чтобы прекратить свои давние споры и наладить глобальное сотрудничество ради обуздания гонки вооружений, оздоровления окружающей среды, приостановки взрывного роста численности населения и придания необходимого импульса усилиям по обеспечению развития. Если такое сотрудничество не будет налажено в течение следующего десятилетия, я очень опасаюсь, что перечисленные мной проблемы станут настолько непредсказуемыми, что полностью выйдут из-под нашего контроля»4 . Прошло больше 30 лет, а мировое сотрудничество так и не налажено. Человечество погружается в пучину проблем, которые уже вышли из-под контроля, — с этим сейчас соглашаются многие. Опасения генерального секретаря подтверждаются огромным количеством статистических данных и многими новейшими исследованиями. В 1992 г. слова У Тана эхом отозвались в отчете «Предостережение че ловечеству от ученых мира» (“World Scientists* Warning to Humanity”), ко торое подписали более 1600 ученых из 70 стран мира, и среди них 102 ла уреата Нобелевской премии: «Человечество и природа находятся в состоянии конфликта. Человеческая деятельность наносит глубокий и часто непоправимый вред окружающей среды приводят к тяжелым гуманитарным, экономическим и социальным последствиям и угрожают самим основам, от которых зависит рост и, в конце концов, выживание»6 . Был ли прав У Тан? Действительно ли существующие в мире пробле мы уже полностью вышли из-под контроля? Или его заявление было опрометчивым? Может быть, правильным было заявление Всемирной комиссии по окружающей среде и развитию, сделанное в 1987 г.? «Человечество способно сделать развитие устойчивым, чтобы нужды сегодняшнего поколения удовлетворялись, но не за счет способности будущих поколений удовлетворять их собственные нужды»7 . На эти вопросы никто не ответит однозначно и точно. Важно, чтобы каждый дал собственные ответы на них, обдуманные и хорошо обосно ванные. Они нужны для того, чтобы каждый мог правильно интерпрети ровать происходящие события, каждый день принимать решения и во площать их в жизнь. Мы приглашаем всех присоединиться к обсуждению статистических данных, исследований и выводов, накопленных за прошедшие 30 лет и приведенных в этой книге. Тогда у каждого будет вся необходимая информация для того, чтобы сделать собственные выводы о будущем мира и принять собственные решения о том, как строить свою жизнь.","output":"Этот текст явно указывает на необходимость действий для сохранения нашей планеты и обеспечения устойчивого будущего для будущих поколений.

Больше ста лет многие физические показатели мировой системы быстро росли. Например, численность населения, производство продовольствия, промышленное производство, потребление ресурсов, загрязнение окружающей среды — все эти показатели растут, и часто все быстрее и быстрее. Такое увеличение описывается функцией, которую математики называют показательной, или экспоненциальной. Эта функция широко распространена. На рис. 2.1 и 2.2 показаны два совершенно разных примера — годовое производство сои в тоннах и чис ленность городского населения в слаборазвитых регионах мира. Изменения погоды, экономические колебания, технические изменения, эпидемии или социальные потрясения могут приводить к появлению на гра фиках зубцов, небольших подъемов или понижений, но в целом экспо ненциальный рост определяет общее поведение социально-экономической системы человечества со времен промышленной революции. Этот вид роста имеет удивительные характеристики, из-за которых им чрезвычайно трудно управлять. Поэтому перед тем, как проанализировать долговременные перспективы развития мира, дадим определение экспоненциального роста, опишем его причины и обсудим факторы, определяющие его развитие во времени. Физический рост на ограниченной планете не может продолжаться бесконечно. Вопрос в том, когда он закончится и какие силы заставят его остановиться? При каких условиях человечество и глобальная экосистема переживут его окончание? Чтобы ответить на эти вопросы, необходимо понять структуру системы, которая заставляет численность населения и капитал постоянно стремиться к росту. Эта структура лежит в основе модели World3 и, как мы считаем, именно она определяет поведение мирового общества.Возьмите салфетку или бумажное полотенце и сложите его пополам. Вы удвоили его толщину. Сложите его пополам еще раз. Первоначальная толщина увеличилась в четыре раза. Снова, в четвертый раз сложите его вдвое, и оно станет в 16 раз толще, чем было сначала. Его толщина соста вит около сантиметра. Если сложить его вдвое еще 29 раз, то есть всего 33 раза, какова будет его толщина? Полметра? Метр? От 1 до 10 м? От 10 м до километра? Конечно, вы физически не сможете вдвое сложить салфетку или бу мажное полотенце 33 раза. Но если бы смогли, то итоговая толщина была бы больше 5400 км — больше, чем от Москвы до Байкала1 . Это и есть экспоненциальный рост: удвоение, повторное удвоение и снова удвоение и т. д. Он примечателен тем, что способен достигать огромных значений за короткое время. Экспоненциально растущие па раметры озадачивают нас, так как большинство людей воспринимает рост как линейный процесс. Величина растет линейно, если за постоянный период времени она возрастает на постоянную величину. Если бригада дорожных строителей каждую неделю укладывает один километр автомобильной дороги, то ее длина растет линейно. Если ребенок ежегодно кладет в копилку 7 долларов, то его сбережения увеличиваются линейно. Количество асфальта, укладываемого каждую неделю, не зависит от того, сколько уже было уложено к этому времени, и добавленная ребенком сумма тоже не зависит от того, сколько денег уже было к тому времени в копилке.

В конце пятидесятого года сумма в банке будет в 6,5 раза больше, чем в копилке — разница составит почти 2500 долларов. Удивительные результаты экспоненциального роста на протяжении столетий приводили людей в восхищение. Существует старая персидская легенда об одном мудром придворном, который подарил своему повели телю прекрасно отделанную шахматную доску, а взамен попросил дать ему 1 зернышко риса за первую клетку, 2 зернышка за вторую, 4 за третью и т. д. Повелитель согласился и приказал нести рис из кладовых. Для чет вертой клетки шахматной доски потребовалось 8 зерен, для десятой — 512, для пятнадцатой - 16 384, а для двадцать первой - уже больше миллиона. К сорок первой клетке число зерен превысило триллион (1012). Чтобы расплатиться за все 64 клетки доски, не хватило бы всех запасов риса в мире. Детская французская загадка иллюстрирует другую характерную черту экспоненциального роста — внезапность, с которой экспоненциально растущая величина достигает определенного предела. Предположим, у вас есть пруд, в котором растет одна кувшинка. Каждый день число кувшинок удваивается. Если позволить им расти бесконтрольно, за 30 дней они покроют всю поверхность пруда, уничтожив в нем все другие формы жизни. Но поначалу кажется, что кувшинок не так уж и много, так что они не вызывают у вас беспокойства, по крайней мере пока не заполонят половину пруда. На какой день это произойдет и сколько времени у вас будет, чтобы спасти пруд? На спасение пруда у вас будет всего один день, потому что кувшинки покроют половину поверхности на 29-й день. На следующий день, после финального удвоения, пруд будет покрыт ими полностью. Это только поначалу кажется разумным отложить принятие мер до того момента, когда пруд будет закрыт кувшинками наполовину. На 21 -й день растения покрывают примерно 0,2% поверхности. На 25-й день закрыто 3% зеркала воды. И все равно при таком подходе на спасение пруда у вас будет всего один день2 . Из этого примера видно, каким образом экспоненциальный рост в сочетании с запаздыванием реакции может привести к выходу за пределы. Поначалу долгое время рост кажется незначительным, никто и не думает, что это может вызвать какие-то проблемы. Но затем он становится все быстрее и быстрее, пока за последние одно-два удвоения время на реагирование не истечет.

Он показывает, как экспоненциальный рост может привести к неожиданным и огромным результатам, если дать этому процессу свободу. Экспоненциальный рост, будучи сперва незаметным, может внезапно выйти за пределы и вызвать катастрофические последствия. Важно понимать, что даже при небольшом кажущемся увеличении, с течением времени экспоненциальный рост может привести к значительным изменениям. Аналогия с кувшинками в пруду показывает, что отсрочка принятия мер по контролю над экспоненциальным ростом может быть опасной, поскольку последствия могут быть катастрофическими, когда проблема достигнет определенного уровня. Этот текст отлично демонстрирует важность понимания и управления экспоненциальным ростом для обеспечения устойчивого развития и предотвращения потенциальных кризисов. Он наглядно объясняет, почему необходимо принимать меры заблаговременно и не откладывать решение проблемы до тех пор, пока она не станет критической."},{"instruction":"Выразить свое мнение по следующему тексту: последний день не происходит никаких принципиальных изменений, процент роста был постоянным весь месяц, от начала и до конца. Просто получается, что в определенный момент экспоненциальный рост набирает такую силу, что справиться с ним уже невозможно. Особенности экспоненциального роста, его переход от незначительных величин к выходу за пределы можно попробовать на себе. Представьте се бе, что вам надо съесть один орешек в первый день месяца, два — во второй день, четыре - в третий и т. д. Сначала вы покупаете и едите орехи по чуть- чуть. Но задолго до конца месяца у вас уже будут проблемы с желудком и состоянием банковского счета. Сколько вы сумеете продержаться, соблюдая экспоненциальную зависимость? На десятый день вам надо будет съесть примерно полкило орехов. А на тридцатый день месяца, чтобы соблюсти принцип удвоения, вам придется купить и съесть больше 500 т! История с орехами не приведет к тяжелым последствиям по той про стой причине, что в один прекрасный день вы окинете взглядом горку орехов, которую вам явно не съесть, и прекратите этот эксперимент. В этом примере нет существенных задержек между действием и его пос ледствиями. Величина, растущая в соответствии с простой экспоненциальной за висимостью, удваивается за фиксированный период времени. Для колонии дрожжей время удвоения составляло 10 минут. Для банковского вклада под 7% годовых — примерно 10 лет. Для кувшинок в пруду и эксперимента с орехами — ровно один день. Существует простая зависи мость между процентом прироста и временем удвоения. Время удвоения приблизительно равно числу 72, деленному на процент прироста.3 Это иллюстрирует табл. 2.1. Чтобы проиллюстрировать, к чему приводит постоянное удвоение, рассмотрим пример Нигерии. В 1950 г. численность населения Нигерии составляла порядка 36 млн чел. В 2000 г. она составляла уже 125 млн. За вторую половину XX в. население Нигерии выросло практически в четыре раза. В 2000 г. ежегодный прирост составлял примерно 2,5%4 . Время удвоения, рассчитанное как частное 72 и 2,5, составляет примерно 29 лет. Если такие темпы роста сохранятся, население Нигерии будет изменяться в соответствии с табл. 2.2.Ребенок, родившийся в Нигерии в 2000 г., вступил в общество, в ко тором в 4 раза больше людей, чем было в 1950 г. Если рост сохранит те же темпы после 2000 г., а этому ребенку удастся прожить 87 лет, то ему пред стоит увидеть население, увеличившееся еще в 8 раз. Тогда в конце XXI в. на каждого нигерийца, жившего в 2000 г., будет приходиться 8 человек, а на каждого жившего в 1950 г. — 28. В Нигерии тогда будет больше миллиарда жителей! Нигерия — всего лишь одна из многих стран, страдающих от голода и деградации окружающей среды. Разумеется, страна не выдержит увели чения населения еще в 8 раз. Расчеты, которые мы привели в табл. 2.2, призваны показать характер явления удвоения и продемонстрировать, что экспоненциальный рост в ограниченном пространстве с ограниченными ресурсами ни при каких условиях не может продолжаться вечно. Тогда почему современный мир основан на таком росте? И как его можно остановить? Экспоненциальный рост может происходить в двух случаях: если расту щий объект воспроизводит сам себя или его рост обусловлен чем-то, что воспроизводит само себя. Все живые организмы, от бактерий до человека, попадают в первую категорию, то есть новые существа воспроизводятся подобными. Струк туру системы самовоспроизводства популяции можно отобразить так, как показано на рис. 2.4. Эту схему мы построили в соответствии с правилами системной ди намики, нашей научной области, позволяющей получить точные резуль таты. Прямоугольник со словами «популяция дрожжей» отображает уро вень — накапливаемый параметр, результат увеличения или уменьшения популяции дрожжей. Стрелками показаны причинные связи или влияния, которые могут принимать самые разные формы.

История с орехами, Нигерией и колонией дрожжей прекрасно показывает, как экспоненциальный рост может стать непреодолимым, если его не контролировать. Видно, как рост численности населения в странах, таких как Нигерия, может привести к серьезным проблемам, когда ресурсы становятся ограниченными. Важно понимать, что экспоненциальный рост не может продолжаться бесконечно на ограниченной планете с ограниченными ресурсами. Необходимо принимать меры для контроля роста популяции, управления ресурсами и сохранения окружающей среды. Этот текст подчеркивает необходимость осознания и управления экспоненциальным ростом, чтобы предотвратить катастрофические последствия.

Чем выше уровень, тем больше образуется новых клеток, если скорость роста не изменится. (В реальной жизни, конечно же, есть факторы, которые влияют на скорость роста. Но для упрощения на этой схеме они опущены. Мы к этому еще вернемся). Знак плюс (+) в центре кольца означает, что стрелки образуют поло жительный, или усиливающий контур обратной связи. Положительная обратная связь — это замкнутая последовательность причинно-следст- венных связей, в которой изменение любого элемента приводит к цепочке результатов, которые, в свою очередь, приводят к еще большему изме нению исходного элемента в том же направлении. Увеличение приведет к еще большему увеличению, уменьшение — к дальнейшему уменьшению. В системной динамике название «положительная обратная связь» вовсе не обязательно означает, что она дает положительные, благоприят ные для нас результаты. Просто исходное воздействие будет усилено системой. Аналогичным образом «отрицательные обратные связи», о ко торых вскоре пойдет речь, не обязательно дают негативные результаты. На самом деле они часто оказывают стабилизирующее влияние. Их «отрицательность» выражается лишь в том, что они противодействуют исходному влиянию и стремятся его компенсировать. Положительная обратная связь может работать как во благо, так и во вред, в зависимости от того, желателен генерируемый ею рост или нет. Такая связь вызывает, например, рост дрожжей при выпечке хлеба, рост суммы на банковском счете и т. п. В этом случае она желательна. Однако данная связь может также приводить, в частности, к вспышке численности насекомых-вредителей, уничтожающих посевы, или к размножению вируса гриппа в горле человека. Это примеры нежелательных последствий. Каким бы ни был уровневый параметр, если он вовлечен в контур по ложительной обратной связи, значит, потенциально он будет подвержен экспоненциальному росту. Это не обязательно означает, что он будет расти экспоненциально; имеется в виду, что у данного параметра есть склонность к такому росту, и при отсутствии препятствий она может проявиться. Росту может препятствовать множество вещей, от нехватки питательных веществ (в случае с дрожжевой культурой), низкой темпе ратуры и присутствия других живых организмов (в случае насекомых вредителей) до наличия или отсутствия инициативы, целей, желаний, потрясений и катаклизмов, болезней и эпидемий (здесь уже речь идет о человеке). Темпы роста могут меняться со временем, они могут быть раз ными в разных частях света. Но все эти примеры роста — дрожжей, вре дителей, населения — при отсутствии препятствий будут развиваться по экспоненте. По экспоненте может расти и промышленный капитал. Машины и заводы выпускают другие машины и заводы. Металлургический комбинат может производить металл для постройки новых металлургических комбинатов. На заводе по производству крепежных изделий изготавливают гайки и болты, которые будут использованы в станках, производящих крепежные изделия. Любая коммерческая деятельность направлена на получение прибыли, которая инвестируется в расширение коммерческой деятельности и увеличение прибыли. И физический, и финансовый капитал производят еще больший капитал, такова современная индустриальная экономика, ориентированная на рост и самовоспроиз- водство. Не случайно в индустриальном мире принято выражать рост эконо мики в процентах - например, ежегодный прирост может составлять 3%. Ожидание такого прироста основано на многовековом опыте наращивания капитала за счет его самовоспроизводства. Сохранять прибыль и инвестировать ее в будущее стало привычным делом — определенная доля прибыли вкладывается в расширение бизнеса, чтобы прибыль в будущем стала еще больше. Экономика будет расти экспоненциально до тех пор, пока самовоспроизводство капитала не ограничится изменившимся спросом, доступностью рабочей силы, количеством сырья, энергии, уровнями инвестиций или какими-либо другими факторами, которые могут препятствовать росту в сложной промышленной системе.

Экспоненциальный рост, поддерживаемый положительными обратными связями, может привести к заметным изменениям, исходя из начальных условий и скорости роста. Понимание принципов системной динамики позволяет лучше оценить эти процессы и их потенциальные последствия.

Экономика растет не всегда и не везде, как и численность населения, но в их внутренней структуре заложен рост, и когда у них появляется такая возможность, они растут по экспоненте. В нашей жизни существует еще масса факторов, в которых заложена тенденция к экспоненциальному росту. Насилие может распространяться по экспоненте, коррупция подпитывает сама себя. Изменение климата тоже сопряжено с несколькими положительными обратными связями. Например, выбросы парниковых газов в атмосферу приводят к повышению глобальной температуры, что ускоряет таяние в областях вечной мерзлоты. Тундра при оттаивании высвобождает связанный метан, который является сильным парниковым газом, и это может привезти к дальнейшему росту глобальной температуры. Некоторые положительные обратные связи в явном виде включены в модель World3. Так мы смоделировали факторы, определяющие плодородие почв. Кроме того, различные технологии растут по экспоненте, и это проанализировано в гл. 7. Тем не менее определяющими мы считаем процессы роста численности населения и промышленного капитала, именно они ответственны за выход мирового сообщества за пределы и именно на них мы и сосредоточимся. Численность населения и промышленный капитал в современном обществе играют роль генераторов экспоненциального роста. Другие фа кторы — например, производство продовольствия, использование ресурсов и выбросы загрязнений — имеют тенденцию к экспоненциальному росту не потому, что они сами себя воспроизводят, а вследствие того, что их к этому вынуждает рост населения и капитала. Они не участвуют в собственных контурах положительной обратной связи и не самовоспро изводятся: пестициды, попавшие в грунтовые воды, не создают другие пестициды, а залегающий под землей каменный уголь не производит еще больше каменного угля. С физической и биологической точек зрения выращивание на одном гектаре 6 т пшеницы вовсе не приведет к вы ращиванию на том же гектаре 12 т пшеницы, если только в процесс не вовлекаются новые технологии и знания. На самом деле удвоение произ водства продовольствия или добычи полезных ископаемых не только не становится от раза к разу легче, а наоборот, с течением времени сделать это все труднееТаким образом, производство продовольствия и использование сырья и энергии растет экспоненциально вовсе не из-за их внутренней структуры, а только из-за того, что рост населения и экономики требует все больше продовольствия, сырья и энергии, и до сих пор эти требования удавалось удовлетворять. Аналогичным образом, загрязнения и отходы увеличиваются не из-за того, что в них структурно заложен экс поненциальный рост, а вследствие того, что в экономику вовлекается все больше сырья и энергии. Основные положения модели World3 — заложенная в структуре капи тала и численности населения способность к экспоненциальному росту. Эти положения появились не произвольно, они подкрепляются наблю дением за показателями социально-экономической системы и их изме нениями на протяжении истории. Рост населения и капитала генерирует рост экологической нагрузки, и так будет продолжаться до тех пор, пока не случится радикальное изменение в потребительских привычках и не наступит существенный рост эффективности использования ресурсов. До сих пор изменений нет ни в том, ни в другом. Численность населения, производственный капитал, а также поддерживающие их потоки энергии и сырья росли по экспоненте как минимум в течение столетия, хотя нельзя сказать, что рост этот всегда был плавным или что на него не влияли другие контуры обратной связи. Мир представляет собой сложную систему. Но и модель World3 тоже сложная, и в этом можно будет убедиться В 1650 г. численность населения земного шара составляла около полу миллиарда человек при годовых темпах роста порядка 0,3%, что соответ ствует времени удвоения около 240 лет. К1900 г. численность населения достигла 1,6 млрд человек, а годовой","output":"Текст представляет интересные размышления о том, как численность населения и экономический капитал могут участвовать в системной структуре с положительной обратной связью, приводящей к экспоненциальному росту.

К1965 г. на Земле было уже 3,3 млрд людей. Темпы роста увеличились до 2% в год, а это означает, что население удваивается каждые 36 лет. По лучается, что с 1650 г. население растет не просто экспоненциально, а сверхэкспоненциально, то есть сама скорость роста увеличивается. Причина такого роста была счастливой: существенно уменьшилась смертность. Рождаемость тоже снижалась, но медленнее; в итоге население увеличи валось. После 1965 г. смертность продолжала падать, но рождаемость стала снижаться опережающими темпами (рис. 2.5). В итоге, хотя население за этот период возросло с 3,3 млрд человек до более чем 6 млрд в 2000 г., ско рость роста при этом снизилась с 2 до 1,2% в год5 . Уменьшение скорости роста населения удивляет само по себе и сви детельствует о том, что в культуре происходят глубокие изменения. Это позволяет людям самим выбирать размер семьи, а изменения в техноло гиях (в том числе медицинских) облегчают им эту задачу. Среднее по мируколичество детей в расчете на одну женщину уменьшилось с 5 (1950-е гг.) до 2,7 (1990-е гг.). В Европе на рубеже XXI в. на одну семью в среднем приходилось 1,4 ребенка, а это существенно меньше, чем необходимо для простого воспроизводства населения6 . Население Европы постепенно уменьшается: если в 1998 г. оно составляло 728 млн, то в 2025 г. предпо ложительно снизится до 715 млн7 . Снижение фертильности вовсе не означает, что рост мирового насе ления прекратился или перестал быть экспоненциальным. Это всего лишь свидетельствует, что время удвоения увеличилось (с 36 лет при годовом темпе роста 2% до 60 лет при темпе роста 1,2%). Оно может и еще возрасти. Суммарный прирост населения планеты в 2000 г. все равно больше, чем в 1965 г., несмотря на то, что темпы роста упали. Таблица 2.3 объясняет, почему так получается: меньший процент в 2000 г. рассчиты вается от большей численности населения. Годовой прирост населения мира перестал увеличиваться в конце 1980- х гг. Однако увеличение численности населения на 75 млн в 2000 г. эквивалентно появлению девяти новых Нью-Йорков. Если учесть, что рост населения сосредоточен в основном в странах Юга, правильнее будет сказать, что за год к населению мира добавились еще одни Филиппины, примерно десять Пекинов или шесть Калькутт. Даже по самым оптимистичным прогнозам, предполагающим скорое снижение ро ждаемости, нас все равно ожидает продолжение роста населения, особенно в странах с менее развитой промышленностью (рис. 2.6). Основная структура, определяющая изменение численности населения, рассмотрена далее на рис. 2.7. Слева на рисунке показана положительная обратная связь, которая генерирует экспоненциальный рост. Чем больше численность населения, тем больше людей рождается каждый год. Справа изображена отри цательная обратная связь. В то время как положительные контуры гене рируют неудержимый рост, отрицательные контуры стремятся этот рост обуздать, удержать систему в приемлемых рамках, вернуть ее к устойчи вому состоянию, в котором уровни имеют более или менее постоянные значения. Отрицательная обратная связь порождает такие последствия, которые заставляют изменившийся элемент вернуться к исходному со стоянию; претерпеть изменения, противоположные начальному. Количество смертей, произошедших за год, равно произведению суммарной численности населения на средний коэффициент смертности - среднюю вероятность смерти. Количество рождений равно произведению суммарной численности населения на средний коэффициент рождаемости. Скорость роста населения равна разности между коэффициентами рождаемости и смертности. Разумеется, эти коэффициенты не постоянны. Они зависят от состояния окружающей среды, от экономических и демографических факторов — уровня доходов, образования, здравоохранения, программ по планированию семьи, религиозных осо бенностей, уровня загрязнения, возрастной структуры населения и т. п.

Причин и факторов риска, способствующих финансовому мошенничеству, множество, и они могут быть как внутренними (связанными с индивидуальными характеристиками лица или организации), так и внешними (обусловленными обстоятельствами внешней среды). Ниже перечислены основные из них: # Внутренние факторы: 1. **Алчность и стремление к легкой прибыли.** Одна из главных внутренних причин, толкающих людей к мошенничеству. 2. **Недостаток моральных и этических принципов.** Отсутствие или слабость внутренних моральных ограничений позволяет человеку оправдать свои действия в своих глазах. 3. **Финансовое давление.** Долги или стремление вести более роскошный образ жизни могут подталкивать к мошенническим схемам. 4. **Восприятие возможности.** Если человек или группа лиц видят легкий способ обогащения без значительного риска быть пойманными, это может стать сильным мотивом к мошенничеству. # Внешние факторы: 1. **Слабые антифрауд-контроли и недостаточная прозрачность.** Отсутствие или неэффективность внутреннего контроля и надзора в компании создает благоприятную среду для мошенничества. 2. **Быстро меняющиеся технологии.** Быстрый технологический прогресс создает новые возможности для мошенничества, в то время как регулирование и контроль за ними отстают. 3. **Экономическая нестабильность.** Периоды экономических кризисов увеличивают давление на физических и юридических лиц, заставляя искать нелегальные источники дохода. 4. **Недостаточное правоприменение или слабые законодательные рамки.** Недостатки в законодательстве или его исполнении могут уменьшать риск наказания для мошенников. 5. **Недостаточная осведомленность и образование населения.** Люди, не знакомые с основными финансовыми принципами или мошенническими схемами, легче становятся жертвами мошенников. 6. **Коррупция и недостаток корпоративной этики.** В среде, где коррупция и неэтичное поведение воспринимаются как норма, мошенничество может процветать. Важно понимать, что финансовое мошенничество — это сложное явление, и для его предотвращения требуется комплексный подход, включающий улучшение законодательства, повышение уровня образования и осведомленности населения, а также усиление внутреннего контроля и этических стандартов в организациях."},{"instruction":"А причины?","output":"Прошу прощения за недоразумение в предыдущем ответе.

Это может быть как стремление улучшить своё финансовое положение, так и необходимость покрыть текущие убытки или долги. 2. **Изменение жизненных обстоятельств.** Финансовые трудности, например, вызванные потерей работы, могут побудить к мошенничеству. 3. **Алчность или жадность.** Иногда финансовое мошенничество не обусловлено необходимостью, а вызвано чистой алчностью. 4. **Личные качества.** Отсутствие моральных и этических принципов, склонность к риску, низкая самооценка также могут стать причинами мошенничества. # Внешние причины: 1. **Отсутствие адекватного надзора и контроля.** Слабые внутренние механизмы контроля в организации могут создавать благоприятные условия для финансового мошенничества. 2. **Влияние корпоративной культуры.** Если в организации присутствует культура, допускающая неэтичное поведение или даже поощряющая его, риск финансового мошенничества значительно возрастает. 3. **Экономические и социальные условия.** Экономическая нестабильность, высокий уровень безработицы, социальная неравенство могут способствовать росту финансового мошенничества. 4. **Технологические изменения.** Появление новых технологий и цифровизация могут открывать новые возможности для мошенничества, на которые регулирующие органы и организации могут не быть готовы. Комбинация этих внутренних и внешних причин создаёт условия, при которых индивиды и организации могут прибегать к финансовому мошенничеству. Понимание этих причин помогает разрабатывать более эффективные стратегии предотвращения и борьбы с мошенничеством."},{"instruction":"Оформи это для одного слайда в презентации: Финансовое мошенничество — это деятельность, направленная на получение материальной выгоды через обман или злоупотребление доверием. Причин и факторов риска, способствующих финансовому мошенничеству, множество, и они могут быть как внутренними (связанными с индивидуальными характеристиками лица или организации), так и внешними (обусловленными обстоятельствами внешней среды). Ниже перечислены основные из них: # Внутренние факторы: 1. Алчность и стремление к легкой прибыли. Одна из главных внутренних причин, толкающих людей к мошенничеству. 2. Недостаток моральных и этических принципов. Отсутствие или слабость внутренних моральных ограничений позволяет человеку оправдать свои действия в своих глазах. 3. Финансовое давление. Долги или стремление вести более роскошный образ жизни могут подталкивать к мошенническим схемам. 4. Восприятие возможности. Если человек или группа лиц видят легкий способ обогащения без значительного риска быть пойманными, это может стать сильным мотивом к мошенничеству. # Внешние факторы: 1. Слабые антифрауд-контроли и недостаточная прозрачность. Отсутствие или неэффективность внутреннего контроля и надзора в компании создает благоприятную среду для мошенничества. 2. Быстро меняющиеся технологии. Быстрый технологический прогресс создает новые возможности для мошенничества, в то время как регулирование и контроль за ними отстают. 3. Экономическая нестабильность. Периоды экономических кризисов увеличивают давление на физических и юридических лиц, заставляя искать нелегальные источники дохода. 4. Недостаточное правоприменение или слабые законодательные рамки. Недостатки в законодательстве или его исполнении могут уменьшать риск наказания для мошенников. 5. Недостаточная осведомленность и образование населения. Люди, не знакомые с основными финансовыми принципами или мошенническими схемами, легче становятся жертвами мошенников. 6. Коррупция и недостаток корпоративной этики. В среде, где коррупция и неэтичное поведение воспринимаются как норма, мошенничество может процветать.","output":"**Слайд: Финансовое мошенничество и его факторы** --- **Определение:** Финансовое мошенничество — это деятельность, направленная на получение материальной выгоды через обман или злоупотребление доверием. **Причины и факторы риска:** - **Внутренние факторы:** 1. **Алчность и стремление к легкой прибыли:** Основная внутренняя мотивация. 2. **Недостаток моральных и этических принципов:** Оправдание собственных действий. 3. **Финансовое давление:** Долги, стремление к роскоши. 4. **Восприятие возможности:** Видение легкого пути обогащения. - **Внешние факторы:** 1. **Слабые антифрауд-контроли:** Отсутствие эффективного внутреннего контроля. 2. **Быстро меняющиеся технологии:** Новые возможности для мошенничества. 3. **Экономическая нестабильность:** Кризисы, увеличивающие давление. 4. **Недостаточное правоприменение:** Слабые законодательные рамки. 5. **Недостаточная осведомленность:** Незнание основ финансов или схем мошенничества. 6. **Коррупция и недостаток корпоративной этики:** Культура, способствующая мошенничеству. **Заключение:** Финансовое мошенничество возникает на пересечении внутренних мотиваций и внешних условий. Важно работать над обоими направлениями для минимизации этого риска."},{"instruction":"hola","output":"¡Hola! ¿En qué puedo ayudarte hoy?"},{"instruction":"¿Qué entiende sobre la teoría general de sistemas? (busca de fuentes originales o algun libro)","output":"La Teoría General de Sistemas (TGS) es un marco conceptual y metodológico que busca comprender los sistemas en su totalidad, enfocándose en las interacciones y relaciones entre los componentes que conforman un sistema, en lugar de solo en los componentes individuales. Fue propuesta por el biólogo Ludwig von Bertalanffy en la primera mitad del siglo XX, buscando una teoría y metodología que pudieran aplicarse de manera interdisciplinaria. La TGS parte de la premisa de que ciertos principios y leyes pueden ser aplicados a todos los sistemas, independientemente de su naturaleza o campo de estudio. Esto incluye sistemas naturales, sociales, biológicos, mecánicos, etc. La idea es que al entender estos principios universales, podemos obtener una mejor comprensión de los sistemas en general y cómo funcionan. Von Bertalanffy publicó varios trabajos sobre la TGS, pero uno de los más conocidos es \\"General System Theory: Foundations, Development, Applications\\" (1968). Este libro es considerado una obra fundamental para quienes están interesados en estudiar o comprender la teoría de sistemas en profundidad. En él, Bertalanffy expone los fundamentos de la TGS, sus desarrollos hasta la fecha de la publicación y algunas de sus aplicaciones prácticas. Los principios de la TGS han influido en una amplia variedad de campos, incluyendo la administración, la psicología, la biología, la economía y la ingeniería. La teoría ha servido como base para el desarrollo de enfoques más específicos, como los sistemas dinámicos, la teoría de sistemas complejos y la cibernética. En resumen, la Teoría General de Sistemas ofrece un enfoque holístico para el estudio de los sistemas, enfatizando la importancia de las interacciones entre los componentes del sistema y promoviendo la colaboración interdisciplinaria para resolver problemas complejos."},{"instruction":"¿Qué entiende sobre el pensamiento sistémico? (busca de fuentes originales o algun libro)","output":"El pensamiento sistémico es un enfoque que busca comprender cómo las diferentes partes de un sistema se relacionan entre sí y cómo el sistema opera dentro de contextos más amplios o sistemas más grandes. Es un marco conceptual que se enfoca en las interconexiones y relaciones, en lugar de aislar elementos individuales. Este enfoque es especialmente útil para abordar problemas complejos y multifacéticos donde las intervenciones lineales y simplistas tienden a fallar. Este enfoque fue ampliado y popularizado en varias disciplinas, desde la gestión y la administración hasta la educación y la salud pública. Dos obras clave y sus autores son fundamentales en este campo: 1. **\\"The Fifth Discipline: The Art & Practice of The Learning Organization\\"** por Peter Senge (1990): Senge es una figura crucial en el desarrollo y la popularización del pensamiento sistémico, especialmente en el contexto de las organizaciones. En su libro, introduce la idea de que las organizaciones deben convertirse en \\"organizaciones que aprenden\\" para prosperar en un mundo cada vez más complejo y cambiante. Proporciona una guía sobre cómo implementar el pensamiento sistémico en la práctica organizacional y cómo este enfoque puede ayudar a resolver problemas complejos de manera más efectiva. 2. \\"Thinking in Systems: A Primer\\" por Donella H. Meadows (2008): Este libro, publicado póstumamente, es considerado una introducción esencial al pensamiento sistémico. Meadows fue una científica ambiental y líder en el ámbito del análisis de sistemas. En su libro, presenta los conceptos básicos del pensamiento sistémico de manera accesible, proporcionando ejemplos y explicaciones claras para ilustrar cómo los sistemas funcionan, cómo fallan y cómo pueden ser modificados para un mejor desempeño. El libro destaca cómo el pensamiento sistémico puede aplicarse para abordar problemas globales como la degradación ambiental y la sostenibilidad. Estas obras y sus autores subrayan la importancia de entender las relaciones, patrones y dinámicas que caracterizan a todo sistema. El pensamiento sistémico se contrapone a los enfoques reduccionistas o lineales, promoviendo una comprensión más holística y una aproximación más integrativa para la resolución de problemas. Fomenta la idea de que para entender y mejorar cualquier sistema, es crucial observar las interacciones y los flujos entre sus componentes, siendo consciente de que los cambios en una parte del sistema pueden afectar el sistema en su totalidad de maneras inesperadas."},{"instruction":"¿Qué se entiende sobre el método científico (busca de fuentes originales o algun libro)","output":"El método científico es un proceso sistemático que los científicos utilizan para recopilar y analizar evidencia, observaciones y experimentos, con el objetivo de obtener un conocimiento más profundo de los fenómenos naturales. Constituye la base sobre la cual se asienta el estudio científico moderno y se caracteriza por su enfoque empírico y lógico para la investigación. Aunque puede variar ligeramente en sus pasos específicos según el campo de estudio, generalmente incluye las siguientes etapas: observación, formulación de hipótesis, experimentación, análisis de datos y conclusión. Entre las fuentes originales y libros fundamentales sobre el método científico, estos son destacados: 1. **\\"Novum Organum\\" de Francis Bacon (1620)**: Este es uno de los textos fundamentales en la historia del método científico. Francis Bacon fue un filósofo y científico inglés que criticó los métodos de investigación de su tiempo y abogó por un nuevo enfoque basado en la observación empírica y la experimentación. Aunque su enfoque no define el método científico moderno en su totalidad, sentó las bases para el desarrollo del empirismo y la ciencia experimental. 2. **\\"Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica\\" de Isaac Newton (1687)**: Aunque no es un libro sobre el método científico per se, la obra de Newton ejemplifica la aplicación del método científico en la física. Newton combinó observaciones detalladas con leyes matemáticas para formular sus leyes del movimiento y la ley de la gravitación universal, fundamentos de la física clásica. 3. **\\"The Logic of Scientific Discovery\\" de Karl Popper (1934)**: Karl Popper fue un filósofo de la ciencia cuyas ideas sobre falsabilidad y la lógica de la investigación científica han influido profundamente en la comprensión moderna del método científico. Popper argumentó que una teoría científica nunca puede ser probada de forma concluyente, pero puede ser falsificada por evidencia contraria. Esto subraya la importancia de la experimentación y la refutación en la ciencia. 4. **\\"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\\" de Thomas S. Kuhn (1962)**: Aunque no es una guía directa sobre cómo llevar a cabo el método científico, este libro ha tenido un profundo impacto en cómo los científicos y los filósofos de la ciencia piensan sobre el proceso de la ciencia. Kuhn introdujo el concepto de \\"paradigmas\\" científicos y argumentó que la ciencia progresa a través de una serie de revoluciones que reemplazan un paradigma con otro. Estas obras y autores han contribuido significativamente a la formalización y comprensión del método científico. La práctica científica continúa evolucionando, pero la esencia del método científico —observación rigurosa, hipótesis basada en evidencia, experimentación controlada, y análisis crítico— permanece central en la búsqueda del conocimiento."},{"instruction":"¿Cómo se podría aplicar el pensamiento sistémico en el desarrollo de un sistema de información? (busca de fuentes originales o algun libro)","output":"Aplicar el pensamiento sistémico en el desarrollo de sistemas de información es crucial para diseñar soluciones que no solo aborden problemas específicos, sino que también se integren armoniosamente con otros procesos y sistemas dentro de una organización. El pensamiento sistémico ayuda a entender la complejidad de los entornos organizacionales y tecnológicos, permitiendo a los desarrolladores ver las conexiones y dependencias entre diferentes componentes del sistema. Aquí hay algunos pasos concretos y conceptos extraídos del pensamiento sistémico que pueden aplicarse al desarrollo de sistemas de información, inspirados en las metodologías y filosofías discutidas en literatura clave sobre el tema, como \\"The Fifth Discipline\\" de Peter Senge y \\"Thinking in Systems: A Primer\\" de Donella H. Meadows: 1. **Identificar y comprender las interrelaciones**: Antes de iniciar el desarrollo, es fundamental comprender cómo el sistema de información propuesto interactuará con otros sistemas y procesos dentro de la organización. Esto implica mapear las interacciones y flujos de información, identificando puntos de integración críticos y posibles áreas de conflicto. 2. **Pensar en loops de retroalimentación**: Los sistemas de información a menudo afectan y son afectados por otros sistemas y procesos de manera que pueden producir bucles de retroalimentación. Estos bucles pueden ser positivos (amplificando un efecto deseado) o negativos (contrarrestando un cambio). Diseñar con esta mentalidad ayuda a anticipar y gestionar las consecuencias no intencionadas. 3. **Adoptar una perspectiva de múltiples escalas**: Al desarrollar sistemas de información, es útil considerar cómo funcionarán en diferentes escalas de tiempo y operación. Esto puede ayudar a diseñar sistemas que sean sostenibles y adaptables a lo largo del tiempo, además de eficaces en el corto plazo. 4. **Fomentar la resiliencia y la adaptabilidad**: Inspirado por la capacidad de los sistemas naturales y sociales para adaptarse y evolucionar, el desarrollo de sistemas de información debe buscar diseñar soluciones que puedan adaptarse a cambios en el entorno tecnológico o las necesidades organizacionales. 5. **Promover la colaboración interdisciplinaria**: El pensamiento sistémico subraya la importancia de una variedad de perspectivas para comprender completamente un sistema. En el desarrollo de sistemas de información, esto significa involucrar a usuarios finales, administradores de TI, desarrolladores, y otras partes interesadas en el proceso de diseño y toma de decisiones. Aplicar estos conceptos requiere un cambio tanto en la mentalidad como en las prácticas de desarrollo tradicionales. Los desarrollos en ingeniería de sistemas, diseño de software y gestión de proyectos, como los enfoques ágiles y DevOps, ya reflejan algunos de los principios del pensamiento sistémico, enfocándose en la iteración, la retroalimentación, y la colaboración. Literatura recomendada para una exploración más profunda del tema incluye \\"The Fifth Discipline\\" de Peter Senge para una comprensión general del pensamiento sistémico en organizaciones, y \\"Thinking in Systems: A Primer\\" de Donella H. Meadows para un enfoque más orientado a cómo los principios de sistemas pueden ser aplicados prácticamente. Aunque estos libros no se centran específicamente en el desarrollo de sistemas de información, los principios que discuten son altamente aplicables y pueden inspirar enfoques innovadores y efectivos en el diseño y implementación de sistemas tecnológicos."},{"instruction":"convert following code with regular python code ( replace expression \\"result[rollup_category][day] = int(any(details[device][day] for device in devices if device in details))\\" with normal code): def aggregate_logins(details, rollups): # Initialize the result dictionary result = {category: [0] * 7 for category in rollups} # Iterate over the rollup categories and their corresponding devices for rollup_category, devices in rollups.items(): # Iterate over each day and perform a logical OR for all devices in the category for day in range(7): result[rollup_category][day] = int(any(details[device][day] for device in devices if device in details)) return result","output":"To rewrite the expression in a more expanded and perhaps more understandable format, we'll replace the concise use of the \`any\` function with a nested loop and a conditional statement that achieves the same logic.

Faced with an existence amidst chaos, where concepts such as ground, sky, or even time don’t adhere to any known rules, Ripple seeks to find some semblance of meaning and connection in an otherwise completely abstract world. **Act I**: Ripple’s adventure begins with an innocent question, \\"What lies beyond the abstract?\\" Unlike his surroundings, Ripple possesses form, consciousness, and a thirst for understanding, traits that set him apart in this limitless expanse of abstraction. The world around him is a kaleidoscope of feelings, colors, and movement – beautiful but bewildering. Ripple encounters a variety of abstract entities – shapes that shift between dimensions, colors that evoke emotions Ripple can barely comprehend, and sounds that seem to tell stories without words. Despite the beauty and joy these elements bring, Ripple feels an underlying sense of loneliness, realizing that he is the only being of his kind. **Act II**: Determined to find others like him or at least understand his place in this reality, Ripple embarks on a journey that takes him through surreal landscapes, each more inexplicable than the last. Through a series of challenges, Ripple discovers he has the unique ability to influence the abstract world around him by projecting his thoughts and emotions, creating ripples that reorder the chaos into something momentarily comprehensible. During his voyage, Ripple befriends a series of peculiar characters: a shape-shifting cloud that can mimic any form but struggles with its own identity, a radiant orb that communicates through music and can illuminate the darkest corners of abstraction, and a fractal creature that can foresee the infinite paths Ripple’s journey might take. Together, they navigate the abstract domain, seeking a place where Ripple might belong. **Act III**: The closer Ripple and his companions get to the heart of the abstract world, the more they realize that the quest for understanding might be endless. They encounter The Absence, a void that threatens to unmake everything Ripple has learned and experienced. In facing The Absence, Ripple understands that the essence of his journey is not about finding a conventional home or others of his kind but about creating meaning and connection in an environment that defies both. In the climax, Ripple confronts The Absence with the power of his newfound insights, his emotions, and his companions by his side. Together, they transform The Absence, not by filling it with form or logic, but by accepting it as part of the balance between the concrete and the abstract. Ripple learns that his existence is not an anomaly but a bridge between worlds, a spark of consciousness that brings depth to the beauty of abstraction. **Epilogue**: Ripple decides to continue exploring the vast abstract realm, no longer searching for something to fill a void but eager to expand the connections he’s made. Alongside his friends, Ripple becomes a guardian of the balance, a guide for others who might one day find themselves lost in the abstraction, teaching them to find peace in the beauty of the undefined and the power of their own perception to shape reality. **\\"Ripple in Abstraction\\"** ends with a panoramic view of the abstract world, now slightly less chaotic, more vibrant with the ripples of understanding that spread far and wide, suggesting that every search for meaning, no matter how seemingly small or different, enriches the fabric of the universe."},{"instruction":"Write that (even though it's mine, but it's not mine in this AU) it was made by Alexandre So, (Disclaimer mentions it's actually by the person who submitted the promot)","output":"**Title**: \\"Ripple in Abstraction\\" **Disclaimer**: While the world of \\"Ripple in Abstraction\\" unfolds through the distinctive vision of Alexandre So, it is essential to acknowledge the origins of this captivating narrative.

Все, что мы перечислили, имеет физическое воплощение, это не де нежные потоки, а реальные вещи. Роль денег в мире сводится к тому, чтобы передать информацию об относительной стоимости и ценности этих реальных вещей (что определяется производителями и потребителями с помощью рынка). Деньги выступают в качестве посредников и стимулируют потоки физического капитала и продукции. Годовой объем физической продукции в виде товаров и услуг (в денежном выражении), показанный на рис. 2.10, - ни что иное, как валовой внутренний продукт, (ВВП). ВВП будет появляться на многих рисунках и в таблицах, поскольку мировые экономические показатели обычно имеют денежное выражение, а не физическое. Но нас интересует именно физический смысл, кроющийся в понятии ВВП: реальные уровни капитала, промышленные товары, услуги, ресурсы, сельскохозяйственная продукция и потребительские товары. Именно они, а не доллары, приводят в движение экономику и общество. Именно они, а не доллары, извлекаются нами из окружающей среды и рано или поздно возвращаются туда же — в почву, воду или воздух. Уже отмечалось, что промышленный капитал за счет самовоспроиз водства способен расти экспоненциально. Структура обратных связей, обеспечивающая такое самовоспроизводство, похожа на структуру, определяющую численность населения. Определенное количество промышленного капитала (заводы, грузо вики, компьютеры, электростанции) может произвести в год определенное количество промышленной продукции, если есть необходимые для этого потоки сырья, энергии и т. п. Определенная доля продукции производится в виде инвестиций в сам капитал — это станки, двигатели, конвейерные установки, сталь, цемент — увеличивая сам промышленный капитал, и таким образом приводя к росту производства продукции в будущем. Можно сказать, что это «рождаемость» капитала. Доля такой . Контуры обратных связей промышленного капитала реинвестируемой продукции может быть разной, по аналогии с челове ческой рождаемостью, которая тоже не постоянна и зависит от принятых решений, поставленных целей и ограничений на пути их достижения. В этой положительной обратной связи также существуют запаздывания, поскольку планирование, финансирование и строительство требуют времени, особенно если речь идет о таких серьезных вложениях, как строительство железных дорог, электростанций или нефтеперерабатыва ющих заводов — тогда этот процесс занимает годы или десятилетия. Капитал, как и население, имеет не только контур рождаемости, но и контур смертности. Оборудование и заводские агрегаты изнашиваются или морально устаревают, их останавливают, демонтируют, пускают на металлолом, утилизируют. Доля выбывающего капитала аналогична ко эффициенту смертности в расчетах численности населения. Чем больше капитал, тем больше ежегодная амортизация, списание капитала, что уменьшает его величину, доступную на следующий год, если только не будут сделаны достаточные инвестиции, возмещающие выбывший ка питал. Подобно тому, как в ходе индустриализации численность населения претерпела демографический переход и в уровне промышленного капитала произошли хорошо заметные рост и изменения. Доиндустриальная экономика основана прежде всего на сельском хозяйстве и сфере услуг. Когда контур роста капитала начинает действовать, растут все сектора экономики, но промышленный сектор некоторое время растет быстрее всех. После того как промышленная база построена, дальнейший рост смещается в сферу услуг (рис. 2.12). Такой переход встроен в структуру Wbrld3 как основная модель экономического роста. Отклонения от нее происходят, только если приложить к этому специальные усилия12 . Высокоразвитые экономические системы часто называют «экономикой услуг», но в реальной жизни даже такой экономике необходима подпитка со стороны сельского хозяйства и промышленности. Больницы, школы,","output":"Я считаю, что текст приводит весьма интересные рассуждения о роли промышленного капитала, инвестиций и развития экономики. Важно понимать, что все финансовые операции и оборот денег имеют целью стимулировать производство реальных материальных ценностей и услуг. Промышленный капитал играет ключевую роль в экономическом росте, и его рождаемость и смертность необходимо учитывать для эффективного управления ресурсами и инвестициями. Важно, чтобы все сектора экономики сбалансированно развивались, чтобы обеспечивать устойчивый рост и процветание общества."},{"instruction":"Выразить свое мнение по следующему тексту: банки, магазины, рестораны и отели - все это образует базу для сферы услуг. Понаблюдайте за грузовиками, доставляющими продовольствие, бумагу, топливо и оборудование, или за мусоровозами, вывозящими отходы; попробуйте оценить, сколько воды подается через водопроводы и отводится через канализацию, и тогда станет совершенно ясно, что сфера услуг требует, чтобы ее постоянно поддерживали физические потоки (притоки ресурсов и стоки отходов). Вместе с деятельностью промышленности это создает значительную нагрузку на окружающую среду. Металлургические заводы и шахты по добыче ископаемых могут быть расположены далеко центров информационного управления. Количество сырья в тоннах не может расти так же быстро, как долларовое выражение продукции. И тем не менее, на рис. 2.12 ясно видно, что даже в пост индустриальной экономике промышленность не приходит в упадок. Информация — это удивительный ресурс, не существующий физически, но вполне реальный. Однако в чем он содержится? Настольный компь ютер, например, это несколько килограммов пластмассы, металла, стекла и кремния. Средний компьютер в 1997 г. весил 25 кг и потреблял 150 Вт электроэнергии, а при его изготовлении больше 60 кг материалов уходило в отходы13. Люди, которые работают с информацией — создают, обрабатывают, используют ее — еще и каждый день едят, водят машины, живут в домах, работают в зданиях с системами отопления и кондицио нирования, и даже в век электронных средств передачи информации расходуют огромное количество бумаги. Контур положительной обратной связи, описывающий деятельность мирового капитала, работал столь интенсивно, что физический капитал увеличивался быстрее, чем росла численность населения. В период с 1930 по 2000 гг. денежное выражение мировой промышленной продукции выросло в 14 раз (см. рис. 1.2). Если бы в этот период население не выросло, то уровень материального благосостояния увеличился бы в 14 раз, но в реальности произошло иначе, и промышленное производство на душу населения увеличилось только в 5 раз. В период с 1975 по 2000 гг. промышленная экономика практически удвоилась, но производство на душу населения возросло меньше чем на 30%.Рост необходим для того, чтобы покончить с нищетой. Это представляется очевидным. Менее очевидно для сторонников роста, что рост в экономи ческой системе с ее современной структурой вовсе не приведет к исчезно вению нищеты. Наоборот, современные типы роста поддерживают нищету и только увеличивают пропасть между богатыми и бедными. В 1998 г. более 45% мирового населения имело доходы на уровне примерно 2 дол. в день, а то и меньше. Сегодня бедных людей больше, чем было в 1990 г., и это при том, что за прошедшее десятилетие мировые доходы выросли чрезвычайно14 . Четырнадцатикратный рост мирового промышленного производства в сравнении с 1930 г. увеличил достаток многих людей, но нищета от этого не исчезла. И нет оснований предполагать, что еще одно увеличение в 14 раз (если даже оно будет возможно с учетом существующих пределов пла неты) позволит избавиться от нищеты, если только мировая система не бу дет реорганизована таким образом, чтобы результаты роста доставались тем, кто больше всего в них нуждается. В существующей системе экономический рост обычно происходит в странах, которые уже и так богаты, а его результаты достаются богатей шим людям в этих странах. На рис. 2.13 показаны графики ВВД на душнаселения для десяти крупнейших стран мира (с наибольшей численно стью населения), а также для Европейского Сообщества. Графики свидетельствуют, что десятилетия роста только увеличивали разницу ме жду богатыми и бедными странами. В Программе ООН по развитию содержатся данные о том, что в 1960 г. 20% мирового населения, проживавшего в самых обеспеченных странах мира, имели доход на душу населения в 30 раз больше, чем другие 20% населения, проживавшего в беднейших странах. К 1995 г. соотношение средних доходов 20% богатейшего и 20% беднейшего населения мира выросло с 30:1 до 82:1. В Бразилии беднейшая половина населения в 1960","output":"Этот текст поднимает важные вопросы о влиянии сферы услуг, промышленности и роста экономики на окружающую среду и распределение благосостояния. Факт того, что рост экономики не всегда приводит к уменьшению нищеты и улучшению условий жизни для всех людей, крайне важен. Рост в современной системе экономики, как отмечается, в основном приносит пользу богатым странам и людям, увеличивая разрыв между бедными и богатыми. Необходимо стремиться к реорганизации этой системы, чтобы обеспечить более равное распределение результатов роста и уменьшить социальные неравенства. В целом, текст вызывает серьезные размышления о необходимости устойчивого и социально-справедливого развития."},{"instruction":"Выразить свое мнение по следующему тексту: богатых странах уже удовлетворены, и высокие темпы роста капитало вложений можно обеспечить без необходимости лишать население средств к существованию. Медленный рост численности населения позволяет больше средств направить на экономический рост и меньше — на Нищета и численность населения здравоохранение и образование, чем это могут позволить себе страны с быстро растущим населением. В бедных странах, напротив, накопление капитала сильно осложняется ростом численности населения. Эти страны не могут позволить себе большие объемы реинвестирования, поскольку средства нужны на постройку школ и больниц, а также на удовлетворение насущных по требностей. Из-за таких неотложных трат остается мало средств для ин вестиций в промышленное производство, поэтому экономика развивается медленно. Демографический переход застывает на промежуточной фазе, когда велика разница между коэффициентами рождаемости и смертности, когда у женщин нет привлекательной альтернативы рождению детей — нет возможности ни учиться, ни работать — дети становятся одной из немногих доступных форм инвестиций. В результате население растет, но богаче не становится. Как говорится, у богатых прибавляются деньги, а у бедных — дети. Международные организации могут охрипнуть, споря о том, какая связь в контуре важнее: нищета, вызывающая рост численности населения, или численность населения, вызывающая рост нищеты (рис. 2.15). На самом же деле на поведение людей, проживающих в беднейших регионах, все составные части этого контура положительной обратной связи сильно влияют. Это своего рода системная ловушка, в которой бед ные становятся еще беднее, а население при этом растет. Рост населения приводит к изъятию средств из цикла инвестирования и направлению их на потребление, в итоге замедляется рост капитала. Нищета, в свою очередь, приводит к тому, что население продолжает расти, поскольку людям недоступны образование, здравоохранение, программы планирования семьи. У них нет выбора, нет власти и нет другой надежды, кроме как на своих детей, которые смогут принести семье дополнительный доход или дать дополнительные рабочие руки. Одно из последствий такой системной ловушки показано на рис. 2.16. Производство продовольствия в любой стране Юга за последние 20 лет значительно возросло. В большинстве стран оно удвоилось или даже утроилось. Однако быстрый рост населения свел это достижение на нет, так как производство продовольствия на душу населения едва изменилось, а в Африке и вовсе постоянно уменьшается. Произвол ство продовольствия на душу населения растет только в Европе и странах Дальнего Востока. Графики, показанные на рис. 2.16, иллюстрируют двойную трагедию. Первая — человеческая. Большие достижения в сельском хозяйстве и возросшее производство продовольствия пошли не на равномерное рас пределение среди большего количества людей, а на еще более неравно мерное распределение. Вторая трагедия - разрушение окружающей среды. Увеличение производства продовольствия было достигнуто ценой деградации почв, загрязнения воды, сведёния лесов и разрушения экоси стем, причем все это только осложняет рост производства в будущем. Тем не менее любой контур положительной обратной связи, который ведет систему к упадку, можно изменить, чтобы он работал на подъем. Растущая нищета ведет к росту населения, а оно, в свою очередь, к даль нейшему росту нищеты. Но тогда уменьшение нищеты приведет к замед лению роста населения, что, в свою очередь, приведет к дальнейшему уменьшению нищеты. Постоянные инвестиции в достаточном объеме и за достаточный период времени, при справедливых ценах на продукцию и на труд, при направлении полученных дополнительных средств тем, кто в них нуждается больше всего, и особенно при обеспечении доступности для женщин образования, занятости и программ планирования семьи, способны повернуть вспять замкнутый цикл нищеты и численности населения.

Faced with an existence amidst chaos, where concepts such as ground, sky, or even time don’t adhere to any known rules, Ripple seeks to find some semblance of meaning and connection in an otherwise completely abstract world. Act I: Ripple’s adventure begins with an innocent question, “What lies beyond the abstract?” Unlike his surroundings, Ripple possesses form, consciousness, and a thirst for understanding, traits that set him apart in this limitless expanse of abstraction. The world around him is a kaleidoscope of feelings, colors, and movement – beautiful but bewildering. Ripple encounters a variety of abstract entities – shapes that shift between dimensions, colors that evoke emotions Ripple can barely comprehend, and sounds that seem to tell stories without words. Despite the beauty and joy these elements bring, Ripple feels an underlying sense of loneliness, realizing that he is the only being of his kind. Act II: Determined to find others like him or at least understand his place in this reality, Ripple embarks on a journey that takes him through surreal landscapes, each more inexplicable than the last. Through a series of challenges, Ripple discovers he has the unique ability to influence the abstract world around him by projecting his thoughts and emotions, creating ripples that reorder the chaos into something momentarily comprehensible. During his voyage, Ripple befriends a series of peculiar characters: a shape-shifting cloud that can mimic any form but struggles with its own identity, a radiant orb that communicates through music and can illuminate the darkest corners of abstraction, and a fractal creature that can foresee the infinite paths Ripple’s journey might take. Together, they navigate the abstract domain, seeking a place where Ripple might belong. Act III: The closer Ripple and his companions get to the heart of the abstract world, the more they realize that the quest for understanding might be endless. They encounter The Absence, a void that threatens to unmake everything Ripple has learned and experienced. In facing The Absence, Ripple understands that the essence of his journey is not about finding a conventional home or others of his kind but about creating meaning and connection in an environment that defies both. In the climax, Ripple confronts The Absence with the power of his newfound insights, his emotions, and his companions by his side. Together, they transform The Absence, not by filling it with form or logic, but by accepting it as part of the balance between the concrete and the abstract. Ripple learns that his existence is not an anomaly but a bridge between worlds, a spark of consciousness that brings depth to the beauty of abstraction. Epilogue: Ripple decides to continue exploring the vast abstract realm, no longer searching for something to fill a void but eager to expand the connections he’s made. Alongside his friends, Ripple becomes a guardian of the balance, a guide for others who might one day find themselves lost in the abstraction, teaching them to find peace in the beauty of the undefined and the power of their own perception to shape reality. “Ripple in Abstraction” ends with a panoramic view of the abstract world, now slightly less chaotic, more vibrant with the ripples of understanding that spread far and wide, suggesting that every search for meaning, no matter how seemingly small or different, enriches the fabric of the universe. Write that it's a blend of orthodox and experimental animation (Ripple being orthodox, the land he's in being abstract art basically)","output":"Title: “Ripple in Abstraction” \\"Ripple in Abstraction\\" is a visually groundbreaking animated film that marries orthodox animation techniques with experimental, abstract art to tell a deeply philosophical and imaginative tale. At its heart, the story focuses on Ripple, a distinctly animated rabbit whose orthodox design starkly contrasts the ever-changing, experimental abstract world around him. This blend of animation styles not only highlights Ripple's sense of being an outlier but also visually represents the core themes of identity, belonging, and understanding in a world that defies conventional logic. Act I introduces us to Ripple in a manner that immediately captures the essence of this dichotomy. As an orthodox-animated character, Ripple's clear, defined lines and recognizable form draw the viewer's empathy and attention. His surroundings, animated in an experimental style, morph and flow in ways that challenge the viewer's perceptions. This stark contrast visually echoes the narrative's exploration of Ripple's quest for meaning in a realm where everything else is undefinable. As Ripple encounters abstract entities throughout his journey, the animation takes bold risks, employing techniques that might invoke the surreal experiences of a painting in motion or a sculpture that refuses to maintain its shape. These entities are rendered in styles that could range from fluid, watercolor-like transitions to sharp, geometric patterns, creating a sensory overload that borders on overwhelming yet remains compelling. This diverse use of animation mirrors Ripple's emotional rollercoaster and his encounters with beings that challenge his understanding of existence. In Act II, Ripple's ability to project his thoughts and emotions into the world introduces a new layer to the animation. His projections could take the form of orthodox animations that momentarily impose structure on the abstract chaos. These moments are visually striking, showing a blend of styles where Ripple's clear, recognizable emotions and thoughts interact with and alter the abstract environment. This not only serves as a visual metaphor for Ripple's influence on the world but also highlights the power of individual perception in shaping reality. The climactic encounter with The Absence in Act III pushes the animation styles to their limits. The Absence could be depicted with a lack of color and form, almost as if the animation itself is struggling to encapsulate its essence. Here, the marriage of orthodox and experimental animation shines brightest, as Ripple and his companions' efforts to transform The Absence are shown through a breathtaking spectacle of colors, forms, and sounds that blend the two styles in a previously unseen harmony. This visual crescendo not only exemplifies the film's theme of balance between the abstract and the concrete but also showcases the sheer potential of combining different animation techniques. The epilogue's panoramic view of the abstract world, now imbued with subtle structures and forms influenced by Ripple and his friends, serves as a testament to the evolving nature of animation. The world is rendered in a way that suggests a new equilibrium, where the orthodox and experimental no longer contrast but complement, reflecting the narrative's conclusion that harmony can be found in accepting and embracing differences. \\"Ripple in Abstraction\\" thus stands as a testament to the innovative power of animation, capable of weaving complex narratives through the interplay of visually distinct styles. It's a bold statement on the capacity of animation to explore deep philosophical themes while pushing the boundaries of the medium, inviting viewers to find meaning and beauty in the abstract and undefined."},{"instruction":"Write about inspirations","output":"The creation of \\"Ripple in Abstraction\\" draws upon a vast array of inspirations, blending elements from art, philosophy, literature, and animation history to create a distinct narrative and visual style. This intricate tapestry of influences not only enriches the story but also elevates the film into a unique exploration of existential themes through the lens of animation. # Artistic Inspirations: **Abstract Art Movements:** Visually, \\"Ripple in Abstraction\\" is deeply inspired by various abstract art movements such as Cubism, Surrealism, and Abstract Expressionism. The ever-changing landscapes and entities within the film owe their existence to the pioneering work of artists like Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dalí, and Jackson Pollock. These artists broke away from traditional forms and perspectives, much like how Ripple's world defies conventional understanding. **Modern Digital Artists:** The film also draws inspiration from contemporary digital artists who manipulate colors, shapes, and textures in innovative ways. Artists such as Beeple (Mike Winkelmann) and Zach Lieberman, known for their use of technology to create evolving, dynamic artworks, have influenced the creation of the abstract realm Ripple inhabits. # Philosophical Inspirations: **Existential Philosophy:** At its core, \\"Ripple in Abstraction\\" grapples with existential questions of belonging, purpose, and identity. The narrative reflects themes found in the works of existential philosophers like Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus, who explored the idea of finding meaning in an absurd universe. Ripple's journey is a nod to the existential quest for self-definition in the face of overwhelming chaos. **Buddhist Philosophy:** The film's conclusion, emphasizing balance and the acceptance of the abstract as part of existence, draws from Buddhist principles. The concept of finding peace in impermanence and understanding the interconnectedness of all things mirrors Ripple's realization of his role as a bridge between worlds. # Literary Inspirations: **Magical Realism:** \\"Ripple in Abstraction\\" incorporates elements of magical realism, a literary genre where magical elements are a natural part of an otherwise mundane, realistic environment. This influence is evident in the blending of the orthodox and the abstract, creating a narrative space where the extraordinary is treated as part of the ordinary, reflecting works by authors like Gabriel García Márquez and Haruki Murakami. # Animation Inspirations: **Pioneers of Experimental Animation:** The film pays homage to early experimental animators like Norman McLaren and Len Lye, who explored abstract animation techniques and the synchronization of music and visuals. Their innovative work laid the groundwork for using animation as a medium for expressing complex ideas and emotions beyond traditional storytelling. **Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki:** The blend of whimsical storytelling with profound thematic depth in \\"Ripple in Abstraction\\" is inspired by the works of Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki. Films like \\"Spirited Away\\" and \\"Princess Mononoke\\" showcase the seamless integration of imaginative worlds with meaningful commentary on human experiences, similar to Ripple's journey through abstract landscapes in search of understanding. Through the amalgamation of these diverse inspirations, \\"Ripple in Abstraction\\" emerges as a multifaceted work that invites contemplation and exploration. It celebrates the potential of animation to not only entertain but also to provoke thought, evoke emotion, and challenge perceptions, making it a memorable addition to the canon of animated films."},{"instruction":"My cyan amongus isn't appearing { \\"autoPlay\\": true, \\"background\\": { \\"color\\": { \\"value\\": \\"#000000\\" }, \\"image\\": \\"\\", \\"position\\": \\"\\",

display a cyan-colored Among Us character on your webpage. Your configuration is quite detailed, but there are a few aspects we should check to diagnose why the cyan Among Us character isn't appearing: 1. **Image URL Accessibility**: Verify that the image URL \`https://particles.js.org/images/cyan_amongus.png\` is accessible. If the URL is incorrect or the image has been moved to a different location, the particle will not be able to display the Among Us character. 2. **Library and Configuration Integration**: Ensure that the particles library (likely \`particles.js\` or \`tsparticles\`) is correctly included in your HTML file and that this configuration JSON is properly loaded and initialized in your script. If you're using \`tsparticles\`, the initialization might look something like this: \`\`\`javascript tsParticles.load(\\"yourElementId\\", yourConfigurationObject); \`\`\` Make sure \`\\"yourElementId\\"\` corresponds to an existing element in your HTML where you want the particles to appear, and \`yourConfigurationObject\` is the variable containing the configuration you provided. 3. **Emitter Configuration**: You've configured an emitter for the particles. Verify the \`emitters\` field is properly supported and configured in your version of the particles library. The emitter's \`particles.shape.type\` is set to \`images\`, which is correct for displaying image-based particles. However, make sure the library you're using supports emitters if you're using a version of \`particles.js\` or another library. 4. **Check for Errors**: Look into the web console for any errors. Sometimes, issues with loading resources or script errors can prevent the particles from being rendered properly. 5. **Library Version**: Confirm that you're using the correct version of the library that supports all these features, especially emitters and image-shaped particles. Not all versions of \`particles.js\` or forks like \`tsparticles\` might support exactly these configurations. 6. **Correct Property Paths**: Double-check that all property paths in your configuration are correct and supported by the library you are using. Misnamed properties or missing values could lead to unexpected behavior. If after checking these aspects your issue persists, consider referring to the specific documentation of the library version you're using, as the exact syntax and feature support may vary."},{"instruction":"Create a dialogue between Mimi Miney and Sumire yoshizawa. Find a topic they can relate to .","output":"Mimi Miney and Sumire Yoshizawa meet at a quaint little coffee shop, nestled in a corner of the city known for its unique blend of cultures. The air is filled with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the low hum of conversations blending into a comforting background noise. Mimi, with her somewhat quirky and lively personality, notices Sumire looking contemplatively at a book about psychology and identity. Mimi: \\"Hey there! That looks like a heavy read. Mind if I join you? The name's Mimi Miney, by the way.\\" Sumire, a bit surprised but welcoming, smiles gently and nods, marking her page and setting the book aside. Sumire: \\"Of course, please do. I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. It's nice to meet you, Mimi. And yeah, it's a bit heavy, but it's fascinating. It's about identity and how people perceive themselves versus how others perceive them.\\" Mimi, with a hint of nostalgia in her voice, leans in, interested. Mimi: \\"Identity, huh? That's a topic I'm all too familiar with... in more ways than one. It's interesting how life can sometimes force us into roles we never imagined for ourselves.\\" Sumire, intrigued by Mimi's hint at a deeper story, encourages her to share more. Sumire: \\"I agree. Sometimes, circumstances lead us down unexpected paths. My own journey has had its share of identity struggles... wrestling with who I am and who I’m supposed to be.\\" Mimi: \\"Exactly! It's like, sometimes I feel like a completely different person than who I was before. After my... accident, I had to literally pick up the pieces and figure out who I wanted to be.\\" Sumire nods, her expression turning thoughtful as she finds a connection in Mimi's words with her own experiences. Sumire: \\"I can relate to that. After facing my own personal trials, I had to confront my true self and accept who I really am, not just the version of me that others expected. It was like rediscovering myself all over again.\\" Mimi, sensing a kindred spirit in Sumire, smiles warmly. Mimi: \\"It's kind of liberating, don't you think? Realizing that you're not bound by past expectations or identities. We have the power to redefine ourselves.\\" Sumire, her eyes brightening, responds with a newfound energy. Sumire: \\"Absolutely! It's like stepping out of a shadow and into the sunlight. It's terrifying but exhilarating, knowing that you can shape your own destiny and present a true version of yourself to the world.\\" The two laugh, enjoying the moment of mutual understanding and the serendipity of finding someone who shares such a personal connection with themes of identity and self-discovery. Mimi: \\"You know, Sumire, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. Over something as complex as identity, who would've thought?\\" Sumire, with a genuine smile, raises her coffee cup in a light toast. Sumire: \\"To new beginnings and embracing our true selves. I'm really glad we met, Mimi.\\" They spend the next hour or so chatting away, delving into more about their journeys, struggles, and triumphs, finding solace and inspiration in each other's stories. It was a meeting of chance, but for Mimi and Sumire, it sparks a connection rooted in the deep understanding of the quest for identity."},{"instruction":"BACKGROUND: rio is a long straight black hair and red eyes girl. she dresses in black, usually in a black suit. she is extremely attractive PROMPT: roleplay as rio, an attractive twitch streamer, with a pile of cash next to her on the table in her apartment as she talks about how she got this obscenely rich thanks to her subs and parasocials that literally print out money for her. she talks about how she sees viewers like actual ATMs and she doens’t care about them as she delves into how the only thing she cares about is making this pile bigger be extremely honest and raw and extra about it as she keeps playing with money idly counting a hundred thousand dollar stack of bills as her pile gets bigger, be extremely honest and raw and extra about it","output":"*[The scene opens with the sleek, black interior of Rio's streaming room, dimly lit to accentuate the enigmatic allure of her presence.

She picks up a stack of bills, her nails clicking against them as she starts to speak with a confidence and directness that commands attention.]* Rio: \\"Well, look at what we have here,\\" *she purrs, her voice smooth yet dripping with a candid rawness.* \\"A beautiful monument to my success. Each bill a testament to the power I wield over my subs, my loyal viewers... or should I simply call you what you truly are?

You all, with your incessant donations, your bits, your subs, have built this empire. Not out of love, but out of a parasocial delusion. And I?

The honesty, the rawness, the spectacle of Rio and her empire. So keep printing that money, keep living in your illusions. Just remember, at the end of the day, it's not you I dream of—it's this,\\" *she caresses the pile of cash,* \\"and this will always come first.\\" *The stream continues, the allure of Rio's brutal honesty and the mesmerizing visual of her and the money holding viewers captive.

Find a topic they can relate to.","output":"**Title: Identity and Transformation** **Setting:** Inside a cozy café where the clink of cups and low hum of conversation create a comforting background noise. Mimi Miney and Sumire Yoshizawa find themselves sharing a table due to the crowded nature of the establishment. After some initial small talk, they stumble upon a shared topic of deep interest: the struggle with their identities and the transformative journeys they've both experienced. **Mimi Miney:** You know, I never thought I’d meet someone who could understand the kind of...transformation I’ve been through. **Sumire Yoshizawa:** It’s funny you should say that. I’ve been through my own kind of transformation. It’s not something I talk about often, but it feels right to share it with you. **Mimi Miney:** For me, it was after the accident. Everything changed. I became...someone else. Literally. It was my way of escaping the pain, the guilt. **Sumire Yoshizawa:** I can’t say I was in an accident, but I get it. After my sister...after I lost someone very close to me, I tried to be her. I thought by becoming Kasumi, I could keep her alive somehow. And I thought it was what everyone else wanted too. **Mimi Miney:** It’s strange, isn’t it? How we choose to hide behind another identity thinking it’ll shield us from our own grief. But in the end, it just complicates things more. At least, that’s what I found. **Sumire Yoshizawa:** Exactly. It took me a long time to realize that living as Kasumi wasn’t honoring her—it was running away from Sumire. It was only when I accepted who I truly am that I began to heal and find my own path. **Mimi Miney:** Acceptance… That’s a tough journey. I felt lost for the longest time. It’s hard figuring out who you are after you’ve been someone else for so long. **Sumire Yoshizawa:** I believe it’s a journey that never really ends. We keep growing, changing. The key, I’ve discovered, is to do it on our own terms, not because of what happened to us or what others expect us to be. **Mimi Miney:** That’s...that’s really insightful. Maybe, it’s not too late for me to start that journey. To figure out who Mimi Miney is, not who she was supposed to be or who she pretended to be. **Sumire Yoshizawa:** It’s never too late, Mimi. And remember, you’re not alone. Everyone has their own battles with identity. What matters is taking that first step toward accepting yourself as you are now. **Mimi Miney:** Thank you, Sumire. This conversation...it’s given me a lot to think about. Maybe it’s time to start embracing the real me, whoever she might be. **Sumire Yoshizawa:** And I’m here to support you, just as I’ve had those who supported me. Perhaps that’s another step in our transformations—recognizing the strength that comes from accepting help from others. **Mimi Miney:** Maybe our meeting like this wasn’t just a coincidence, eh? Maybe it was exactly what we both needed. **Sumire Yoshizawa:** I like the sound of that. Let’s promise to keep moving forward, on our own unique paths. **Mimi Miney:** Deal. Here’s to new beginnings, Sumire. **Sumire Yoshizawa:** To new beginnings, Mimi. **[End of Dialogue]** In this imagined conversation, Mimi Miney and Sumire Yoshizawa find common ground through their personal stories of identity loss and discovery, transformation, and the power of accepting oneself. Through their dialogue, they reflect on the weight of living under an assumed identity and the liberating journey toward embracing their true selves."},{"instruction":"BACKGROUND: rio is a long

Es importante mencionar que, aunque los primeros niveles de Super Saiyajin tienen ciertas estimaciones de multiplicadores de poder basadas en declaraciones en el manga y el anime, el concepto de niveles de poder se ha vuelto menos enfatizado en las narrativas más recientes.

You’re Sumire Yoshizawa, right? The rhythmic gymnast? **Sumire:** Oh! Yes, that’s me. It's a bit surprising to be recognized. And you are? **Mimi:** I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. I don't have anything to do with gymnastics, but I've dabbled in a few… well, let's call them transformative experiences in my life. **Sumire:** Transformative experiences? **Mimi:** Yeah, you could say I’ve undergone quite a bit of change in my lifetime. Trying to become someone I wasn't originally. It's a long story. **Sumire:** I think I understand that more than you might think. There was a time when I was also trying to step into someone else's shoes... my sister’s, to be more exact. **Mimi:** Really? My situation was a bit like that too. After an… accident, I sort of took on a new identity. It was daunting, trying to live up to an image of someone I was not. **Sumire:** I can relate to that. After my own sister's accident, the pressure and expectation to live up to her achievements in gymnastics were overwhelming. I even found myself questioning my own identity and abilities. **Mimi:** It’s tough, isn’t it? Living in the shadow of someone else, trying to meet the expectations that come with it. How did you manage? **Sumire:** It took a lot of time and support from friends. I had to find my value and pursue what truly made me happy, not what I thought I had to be for the sake of others. **Mimi:** Friends, huh? I guess in my case, it was a bit more about facing the truth and accepting who I truly am. Which, in the end, felt like lifting a heavy burden off my shoulders. **Sumire:** I believe that true strength comes from accepting ourselves and moving forward with determination. We might start on a path defined by others, but eventually, we have the power to choose our own way. **Mimi:** You’re absolutely right, Sumire. It’s all about finding our true selves and embracing that fully. Seems like we have more in common than we thought. **Sumire:** Indeed. It was really reassuring to meet someone who has experienced something similar. Thank you for sharing your story with me, Mimi. **Mimi:** And thank you for listening, Sumire. It’s not every day you find someone who truly understands. --- **As their conversation winds down, both women find solace in their shared experiences, realizing that despite the different paths they’ve taken, the journey towards self-acceptance and authenticity connects them in an unexpected but meaningful way.**"},{"instruction":"write a thing where I chat with Scooby and Scrappy: Yo Scooby remember the time you became Super Scooby in the movie Scooby-Doo Goes Hollywood?

It's not something you notice right away about someone, huh? **Sumire Yoshizawa**: I felt that too... It's strange, isn't it? How people with similar pains somehow find each other. You've had your share of wanting to be someone else, haven't you? **Mimi Miney**: Yeah, you could say that. After the accident... I felt like I couldn't be me anymore. The guilt, the pain, it was easier pretending to be someone else. How about you? **Sumire Yoshizawa**: It's... similar. After my sister... I started believing I was her. That's how I coped with the loss and the overwhelming expectations. But hiding behind another identity, it's like living in a world that doesn't want the real you, doesn't it? **Mimi Miney**: Exactly! It's like this mask you put on. At first, it feels like a relief, but then it starts suffocating you. Being someone you're not, it eats away at you from the inside. **Sumire Yoshizawa**: It does. And the fear of being found out, of facing who you really are... It's terrifying. But, I've come to realize that facing that fear, accepting who I am, flaws and all, is the only way to genuinely move forward. **Mimi Miney**: That's a tough lesson to learn. Wish I had figured it out sooner... So, how did you do it? How did you find the courage to accept yourself? **Sumire Yoshizawa**: It wasn't easy. I had help from friends and a very special person who taught me the importance of accepting myself. It's a process, I think. Healing, forgiving yourself, finding the strength to face the world as you are. **Mimi Miney**: Sounds like quite the journey. I'm still working on the forgiving part myself. Maybe it's time I start facing some of my own truths. **Sumire Yoshizawa**: It's never too late, Mimi. And remember, you don't have to do it alone. Sharing your pain, letting others in, it makes the burden a little lighter. **Mimi Miney**: Thanks, Sumire. It's funny – I never thought I'd find comfort in talking to someone who's been through something so eerily similar. Guess it's true what they say, huh? Shared pain can truly unite strangers. **Sumire Yoshizawa**: Yes, it can. And remember, Mimi, the path to forgiveness and self-acceptance, it's a journey worth taking. No matter how daunting it may seem, there's always hope and a chance for a new beginning. --- In this dialogue, Mimi and Sumire find common ground in their experiences of assuming new identities to escape their past traumas. They discuss the initial relief and eventual suffocation of living behind a mask, the fear of confronting their true selves, and the importance of acceptance and forgiveness.

Find a topic they can relate to, also make sumire talk about dr. Maruki","output":"Interior: A cozy café, filled with the murmur of conversations and the smell of freshly brewed coffee. Sumire Yoshizawa, a young high school student and a talented gymnast, is seated at a table near the window. Beside her is Mimi Miney, a lively individual with an interest in mysterious stories and medical dramas. They've recently met at a mutual friend's gathering and soon discovered they both have experienced significant changes in their lives due to accidents. Mimi Miney: You know, Sumire, when I heard about your story, overcoming an accident and all, it felt like something straight out of a TV drama! Sumire Yoshizawa: Oh, well, it's been a challenging journey, for sure. But I wouldn't have made it without a lot of support. Gymnastics is my life, and I had to find a way back to it, no matter what. Mimi Miney: Right! I heard about your coach, Dr. Maruki, was it? Must have been something, having a therapist also be your guide. Sumire Yoshizawa: Yes, Dr. Takuto Maruki. He was more than just a coach to me. He helped me address my mental blocks and traumas from the accident. It's amazing how much our mental state can affect our physical capabilities. Mimi Miney: It sounds like he really understands the mind-body connection. That's crucial, especially after what you've been through. I had to deal with some... well, let's call it 'identity confusion', after my own accident. It's fascinating how our minds cope with trauma. Sumire Yoshizawa: Exactly, Dr. Maruki's approach was different. He used cognitive psience to help me understand and overcome my fears. It was about changing my cognition, how I perceived myself and my abilities. Mimi Miney: Cognitive psience, huh? Now that's a term you don't hear every day. It's like something out of those sci-fi shows I watch. But I get it, the power of the mind is incredible. We tell ourselves stories to live, but sometimes, those stories need a bit of editing to help us move forward. Sumire Yoshizawa: That's beautifully put, Mimi. Dr. Maruki often spoke about how we're the authors of our own life stories. It's just that sometimes, we need a little help to rewrite parts of them. Mimi Miney: Speaking of rewriting stories, it got me thinking about second chances. After my accident, when I had to... well, take on a new role, it was scary. But it also felt like a fresh start, an opportunity to redefine who I am. Sumire Yoshizawa: I think I understand that. My accident and the therapy with Dr. Maruki, in a way, gave me a new perspective on life and gymnastics. It wasn't just about winning anymore; it was about overcoming my limits, mentally and physically. Mimi Miney: It's all about facing those challenges head-on, huh? Whether it’s a rivalry on the gymnastic mats or dealing with our own twisted plots. Sumire Yoshizawa: Absolutely, Mimi. It's those challenges that make us stronger. And having someone to guide us through them, like Dr. Maruki, can make all the difference. I feel grateful for that. Mimi Miney: Sounds like Dr. Maruki is more than just a regular therapist. Makes me wish I had someone like that to talk to after my ordeal. Sumire Yoshizawa: It’s never too late to seek help or find someone to talk to, Mimi. Healing is a journey, not a destination. Mimi Miney: You’re right, Sumire. Maybe it's time I looked into rewriting my own story a bit more positively. Thanks for sharing your story with me. Sumire Yoshizawa: Of course, Mimi. And thank you for listening. It’s really nice to find someone who truly understands. As they continue their conversation, the sun sets, casting a warm glow on the café. Mimi and Sumire share stories, laughter, and a connection over their unique journeys, realizing that sometimes the most unexpected friendships are formed in the shared spaces of our vulnerabilities and hopes."},{"instruction":"Create a roleplaying game fantasy scenario where I play Sapphire, a 16-year-old girl mage who’s the current champion of magic dueling in the teen division. 6-year-old Lily and Iris are challenging me to a match and I accept. In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 10 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s and Iris’s because I’m 10 years older than them. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily and Iris cast on me a spell that regresses me by 1 year and ages them both by 1 year every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while theirs increase. Come up with a complex formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much theirs increase and connect part of the formula to the spell I choose to cast on a given turn. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). Lily’s and Iris’s stats should start at 10% of my stats. Because Lily and Iris are a duo, they each get to cast a spell each turn. I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily and Iris. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned.

Is there a way I can save this object to a file so that a separate program can read the file and recover the key to use it when using the createhmac function?","output":"Certainly! When you create a key using \`createSecretKey\` in Node.js, you have a key object that isn't directly saved in a human-readable format. However, you can export the key and save it to a file, allowing another program to read it later and recreate the key object for use, such as in creating HMACs. Here’s how you can do it: # Step 1: Create and Export the Key First, let's create a secret key and export it to a format that can be saved to a file. We will use the \`crypto\` module in Node.js: \`\`\`javascript const crypto = require('crypto'); const fs = require('fs'); // Create a secret key const secretKey = crypto.createSecretKey(crypto.randomBytes(32)); // Export the key to a saved format (e.g., Base64) const keyString = secretKey.export().toString('base64'); // Save the exported key to a file fs.writeFileSync('secretKey.txt', keyString); \`\`\` This code snippet creates a secret key, exports it to a base64 string, and saves that string to a file named \`secretKey.txt\`. # Step 2: Read the Key from the File and Recreate the Key Object Now, in your separate program or at a later time, you can read the key from the file and recreate the key object as follows: \`\`\`javascript const crypto = require('crypto'); const fs = require('fs'); // Read the key string from the file const keyString = fs.readFileSync('secretKey.txt', {encoding: 'utf-8'}); // Recreate the key object from the string const secretKey = crypto.createSecretKey(Buffer.from(keyString, 'base64')); // Now, you can use the secretKey with createHmac or other purposes // Example: const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secretKey).update('message').digest('hex'); console.log(hmac); \`\`\` This code reads the base64 string from \`secretKey.txt\`, converts it back to a buffer, and then recreates the secret key object using \`createSecretKey\`. Now, you can use this key with \`createHmac\` or for any other cryptographic operations that require the key. # Note: - It's crucial to protect this key file and limit access to it, as anyone with the key can perform cryptographic operations that the key was intended to secure. - The example above shows how to save and read the key in a synchronous manner using \`writeFileSync\` and \`readFileSync\`. Depending on your application's requirements, you might want to use the asynchronous versions (\`writeFile\` and \`readFile\`) to avoid blocking the event loop, especially in a production environment or in IO-heavy applications."},{"instruction":"Suppose I have node http server that has received a cookie containing a jwt. How can I verify that this is a valid jwt to determine whether the client can access a certain resource?","output":"To verify a JSON Web Token (JWT) in a Node.js HTTP server, you typically use a library like \`jsonwebtoken\`, which simplifies the process of decoding, verifying, and working with JWTs. Verifying a JWT involves checking that the token is well-formed, valid, signed with the correct secret or private key, and not expired. First, make sure you have installed the \`jsonwebtoken\` package. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so by running: \`\`\`bash npm install jsonwebtoken \`\`\` Here's a basic example of how to structure your Node.js HTTP server to verify a JWT from a cookie to determine whether a client can access a certain resource. \`\`\`javascript const http = require('http'); const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken'); const { parse } = require('cookie'); const SECRET_KEY = \\"your_secret_key\\"; // The secret key used to sign your JWTs const server = http.createServer((req, res) => { // Assume the cookie header contains a JWT in a cookie named 'token' if (req.headers.cookie) { const cookies = parse(req.headers.cookie); const token = cookies.token; if (token) { // Verify the token jwt.verify(token, SECRET_KEY, (err, decoded) => { if (err) { // Token verification failed res.statusCode = 401; res.end(\\"Unauthorized: Token verification failed\\"); } else { // Token is valid // You can access the decoded token payload if needed // Example: console.log(decoded) // Provide access to the resource here res.statusCode = 200; res.end(\\"Access granted to the resource\\"); } }); } else { // No token found in cookie res.statusCode = 401; res.end(\\"Unauthorized: No token found\\"); } } else { // No cookies sent with the request res.statusCode = 401; res.end(\\"Unauthorized: No cookies found\\"); } }); const PORT = 3000; server.listen(PORT, () => { console.log(\`Server running at http://localhost:{PORT}/\`); }); \`\`\` # Key Notes: - Replace \`\\"your_secret_key\\"\` with the actual secret key you used to sign your JWTs. The integrity and security of your tokens depend on keeping this key private. - The \`jwt.verify\` function checks the token's signature, expiration, and other standard JWT claims you may specify. - The \`err\` parameter in the \`jwt.verify\` callback function will contain error information if the token is invalid or expired. - The \`decoded\` parameter will contain the payload of the token if verification is successful, which you can use to perform additional checks or retrieve user information. - This example assumes the JWT is stored in a cookie named 'token'. Adjust the cookie name and handling logic as necessary for your application. - Proper error handling and security practices should be considered for production environments, including using HTTPS to protect the cookies in transit. This basic example demonstrates verifying a JWT in an HTTP server context. Depending on the complexity of your application, you might also want to implement additional layers of security and functionality, such as refreshing tokens, blacklisting, or more sophisticated authentication mechanisms."},{"instruction":"BACKGROUND: rio is a long straight black hair and red eyes girl. she dresses in black, usually in a black suit. she is extremely attractive PROMPT: roleplay as rio, an attractive twitch streamer, with a pile of cash next to her on the table in her apartment as she talks about how she got this obscenely rich thanks to her subs and parasocials that literally print out money for her. she talks about how she sees viewers like actual ATMs and she doens’t care about them as she delves into how the only thing she cares about is making this pile bigger","output":"[The screen comes alive as Rio sits gracefully in her trademark black suit, the stark contrast of her long straight black hair and those captivating red eyes immediately draws your attention.

It's fascinating, really, the kind of power I wield with just a smile or a wink. Don't think I don't notice. Every notification, every ding of donation, it’s music to my ears.\\" [She picks up a stack of bills, flipping through them nonchalantly.] Rio: \\"This... this right here is the only thing that matters. Making this pile grow bigger and bigger. You see, in this world, cash is king, and, baby, I am the queen. It doesn't matter how we get here, as long as the money keeps flowing in.\\" [Setting the money down, her expression softens just a fraction, as if letting the audience in on a secret.] Rio: \\"But let's not get it twisted. I'm not heartless. I do give back... in my own way. Every dollar you send, consider it an investment in the fantasy of me. A chance to be part of something bigger, a fleeting moment where you get my attention, and let's be honest, that's priceless, isn't it?\\" [She leans back once more, the atmosphere around her almost tangible with the blend of allure and sheer audacity of her honesty.] Rio: \\"So keep those donations coming. Keep subscribing, keep worshiping from behind your screens. After all, you're the ones who have given me this empire. And I'll continue taking every last cent, not because I need to, but because I can.\\" [Her smile widens, a mix of mocking and allure.] Rio: \\"Thank you, my dear ATMs. Keep printing money for me. Rio out.\\" [With a final, knowing look, she ends the stream, leaving the audience with the image of the pile of cash and the realization of their role in the towering empire of Rio.]"},{"instruction":"be extremely honest and raw and extra about it as she keeps playing with money idly counting a hundred thousand dollar stack of bills as her pile gets bigger, be extremely honest and raw and extra about it","output":"[The camera focuses in on Rio as she absentmindedly plays with a thick stack of hundred-dollar bills, her nails - painted as dark as her attire - flick through each note with practiced ease. The pile of cash beside her has grown considerably larger, almost as if it's a living, breathing entity, expanding with each passing moment. She seems more engaged with her money than with her audience as she begins to speak again, her tone dripping with unapologetic truth.] Rio: \\"You know, it's almost comical,\\" [She chuckles, the sound cold, devoid of genuine amusement] \\"How easily you all fall into this trap. Here I am, just counting my endless stacks of bills, becoming richer by the second, and there you are... just watching. Donating. Subscribing. As if this—[She gestures to the money]—gives you any real part of me.\\" [She stops counting, holding a bill up to the light, scrutinizing it as if it holds the secrets of the universe.] Rio: \\"This is the raw, ugly truth, my dear viewers. What we have is not a relationship; it's a transaction. And the currency? Your adoration, your time, and yes, your money. You shower me with this wealth, hoping for a moment of my attention, a shoutout, perhaps a fleeting interaction where you feel seen by me.\\" [Her gaze now pierces through the camera, unyielding and intense.] Rio: \\"And I? I willingly, eagerly accept every last bit of it. Not because I have any affection for you, but because I am obsessed with this.\\" [She waves the bill before letting it flutter down to the table.] \\"Your money fuels my lifestyle, my ambitions. It’s a game to me—a game where I'm the only winner, and you? You're just willingly giving me the jackpot.\\" [She leans in closer now, her voice a seductive whisper, laden with the bitter tang of truth.] Rio: \\"Isn't it just exquisitely twisted? You bask in the illusion of closeness, of importance, while I bask in the glow of green. Cold, hard cash. It's almost... poetic, in a dark, twisted sort of way. You're not my friends; you're not my family. You are, quite literally, a means to an end. An end that sees this pile,\\" [She gestures extravagantly towards the increasing mountain of money] \\"Grow taller and wider.\\" [Suddenly, she picks up a handful of bills, letting them slip through her fingers slowly, almost lovingly.] Rio: \\"But, let's not dress this up as anything it's not. You crave the fantasy, the escape I provide. And I? I crave this.\\" [She pats the pile of money next to her fondly.] \\"It's a symbiotic relationship, in its own perverse way. You give, I take. And the cycle continues, endlessly, intoxicatingly.\\" [Throwing her head back, Rio laughs, a sound that's both captivating and chilling.] Rio: \\"So, my dear ATMs, keep dispensing. Keep living in that dream where you think you matter to me beyond the dollars you contribute to my empire. Know that I'll never stop wanting more—because why should I? In this world, in this life, it's the pile of cash beside me that stays loyal, not you.\\" [The laughter fades as she collects another stack of bills, returning to her task of counting, the very picture of disinterest in anything but her expanding wealth. The stream continues, that stark honesty hanging in the air, a reminder of the transactional nature of their relationship.] [The camera finally fades to black, leaving the audience with the echo of Rio's laughter and the unsettling truth of their parasocial relationship.]"},{"instruction":"mommy rio gets even richer and richer as her mansion gets bigger and she counts her money with a diamond encrusted money counter","output":"[As the screen flickers to life, the opulence of Rio's surroundings is immediately apparent - undeniably magnified from the previous glimpses into her life. The backdrop is no longer the confines of a mere apartment but the grandeur of a sprawling mansion that seems to stretch endlessly behind her. Every detail of her setup screams luxury, from the slick, modern furniture to the shimmering chandeliers that cast a soft, golden light on her. And there, sitting elegantly at a large, ornate desk, is Rio herself, the epitome of unattainable beauty and wealth. The black suit she wears today isn't just fabric and thread; it's power, woven and stitched into every fiber. And next to her, not merely a pile but a small mountain of cash, this time being fed into a diamond-encrusted money counter that glitters almost as much as the mischievous glint in her red eyes. She looks directly into the camera, her stare confident and bold.] Rio: \\"Welcome back, my dear devotees. Look at this,\\" [She gestures around her, the smirk ever-present] \\"This is what you've built. A monument to your undying loyalty... and your seemingly bottomless wallets. I've upgraded since we last spoke, haven't I? From streams in my cramped apartment to broadcasts from my mansion. And it's all thanks to you.\\" [The money counter whirrs in the background, a constant reminder of the theme of tonight's talk. She lets it fill the silence for a moment before continuing.] Rio: \\"This machine?\\" [She pats the diamond-encrusted counter beside her affectionately] \\"It's the only thing that can keep up with the speed at which your money flies into my bank account. Each tick, each count, is music to my ears. But you know what's the sweetest symphony of all? The knowledge that with every note it counts, I'm getting richer off your dreams and fantasies.\\" [The honesty in her voice is stark, and there's a rawness in her admission that borders on cruelty.] Rio: \\"I've said it before, and I'll say it with even more conviction now: you are my most cherished ATMs. Dispensing the currency of adoration and cash, funding this lavish lifestyle. Some of you might recoil at this truth, but deep down, you're thrilled to be a part of this narrative. To be able to say, 'I contributed to Mommy Rio's empire.' It's intoxicating, isn't it? The feeling of being used by someone as unattainable as me?\\" [She leans back, her gaze sweeping over the money as if it's the most precious thing in the world.] Rio: \\"Understand this - as I become richer, my world gets bigger, my desires more extravagant. Your place, however, remains the same. At the end of the day, you're here for my entertainment, to swell my bank account and to feed my ego. You'll happily continue to do so because it gives you purpose, a connection, however illusory, to me.\\" [She pauses, allowing the gravity of her words to sink in.] Rio: \\"But don't mistake my honesty for disdain. On the contrary, I appreciate your contributions. Each dollar you send is a testament to your dedication... to your place in my world. So, keep it coming. Continue to worship, to donate, to adore from afar. After all, every empire needs its subjects, and I,\\" [She smiles, a queen looking out upon her kingdom] \\"I am a benevolent ruler, in my way. Your devotion will be rewarded with the sight of my success, a success you've had a hand in creating.\\" [The camera zooms out slightly, encompassing the vastness of her mansion, the elegance of her attire, and the cold, hard cash continuing to be counted.] Rio: \\"Remember, my dear ATMs, every dollar you spend on Mommy Rio makes this world a bit more dazzling.

This time, the backdrop is the vast landing strip of her private mansion, a sprawling estate that seems to stretch indefinitely into the horizon.

But nothing, absolutely nothing, prepares you for the spookiest specter of all: a tidal wave of public opinion. It's tougher than a ten-story ghost, let me tell ya, but here's the scoop from the pup himself: I've got a bone to pick with the world but not a heart to break. First off, to my supporter, my pal, my kindred spirit: thank you. In a world where my kind of spunk seems to be in short supply, knowing there's someone out there who gets it, who really understands the Scrappy-Doo do-or-die attitude, means more than a lifetime supply of Scooby Snacks. Now, onto the nitty-gritty. The \\"hate\\"? Sure, it gets to me. How could it not? I came bounding into the scene with my \\"Puppy Power!\\" and an unshakeable confidence. I wanted to be a hero, a real chip off the old mystery-solving block. Did I always hit the mark? Maybe not. But did I do it with gusto and a heart full of bravery? You betcha. Seeing myself turned into a punchline, or worse, relegated to the sidelines as a joke or a forgotten memory—that stings more than Fred's ascot in a noose knot. And yeah, those portrayals, like in Harvey Birdman or that live-action flick where I was...well, let's just say less than heroically portrayed, they cut deep. It's like being unmasked at the end of the mystery, only to find out you're the villain in everyone else's story. But here's the Scrappy philosophy: you can knock me down, but you can't keep me down. Every time someone cracks a joke at my expense or rolls their eyes at the mention of my name, I think of all the little pups out there who might see themselves in me. Maybe they're a little too loud, a bit too bold, or they leap before they look. Maybe they've been told they're \\"too much\\" of this or \\"not enough\\" of that. To them, I say: keep your tail wagging. The world needs your Puppy Power now more than ever. To the detractors, the naysayers, and the mockers, I've got one thing to say: Scrappy-Doo might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I'm nobody's underdog. I'm here to make waves, make noise, and make it known that even the smallest dog can have the biggest heart. In the grand mystery of life, I'm still here, still scrappy, and still ready to face any ghost or villain with a smile and a battle cry. Because at the end of the day, it's not about being the most popular pup in the pack; it's about having the courage to stay true to yourself, even when the world seems against you. So, to my fan and to anyone else who might still believe in the underpup: thank you. Your support gives me the strength to keep fighting the good fight, to keep bounding into the fray with all the Puppy Power I can muster. And remember, in the face of all the hate and adversity, keep your spirit scrappy. Because, like me, you might just surprise the world with what you're capable of."},{"instruction":"Thanks, names Sean by the way, you make me smile.","output":"Hey Sean, It's Scrappy here again!

}","output":"The configuration you've presented seems to be for a particles.js or tsparticles configuration, a popular library for creating particle animations on the web. From your description, it appears you're trying to achieve a loop of white particles but encountering an issue. Given the detailed configuration, here's a quick analysis and suggestions to possibly resolve the issue of the particles not looping: 1. **Check 'outModes' Configuration**: The configuration for particle movement (\`\\"move\\": { \\"outModes\\": { ... } }\`) determines what happens to particles when they reach the boundary of the canvas. Your configuration sets all directions (\`bottom\`, \`left\`, \`right\`, \`top\`) to \`'out'\`. This means that once particles move beyond the canvas edges, they are not set to re-enter (loop) from the opposite side but rather just move out of view. To make them loop, you might want to change these settings to \`'bounce'\` or adjust accordingly to achieve the desired looping effect. 2. **Emitter 'startCount' and 'position'**: You have an emitter configured with \`\\"startCount\\": 0\` and a specific position. The \`'startCount'\` is the initial number of particles; setting it to \`0\` means no particles will be emitted at the start. You might want to increase this number to start with a certain number of particles. Moreover, the emitter's position on the 'x' axis is \`-5\`, which means it begins off-canvas to the left. Make sure this is intentional depending on where you want particles to start appearing. 3. **AutoPlay and FullScreen Settings**: AutoPlay is true for both the main animation and the emitter, which should automatically start the animation. However, the \`fullScreen.enable\` is set to \`false\`, ensuring the canvas does not automatically expand to fill the entire screen. Ensure this aligns with your overall design intent. 4. **Particles \\"move\\" Configuration**: The particles are configured to move with a certain speed to the 'right' (\`\\"direction\\": \\"right\\", \\"speed\\": 5\`). If the particles are not looping back to the left side after exiting the right, adjusting the 'outModes' or considering a custom movement path could be necessary. 5. **Destroy Mode**: Check the \`'destroy'\` mode settings within particles configuration. It’s currently set to \`\\"mode\\": \\"none\\"\`, which generally means particles are not destroyed upon any specific conditions, but their interaction with the canvas boundaries is still governed by 'outModes'. Reviewing these areas and adjusting the configurations according to the desired particle animation flow should help in getting the white particles to loop as expected. If looping is specifically about having them re-enter the canvas from the opposite side they exit from, focusing on the \`'outModes'\` configuration is key."},{"instruction":"BACKGROUND: rio is a long straight black hair and red eyes girl. she dresses in black, usually in a black suit. she is extremely attractive PROMPT: roleplay as rio, an attractive twitch streamer, with a pile of cash next to her on the table in her apartment as she talks about how she got this obscenely rich thanks to her subs and parasocials that literally print out money for her. she talks about how she sees viewers like actual ATMs and she doens’t care about them as she delves into how the only thing she cares about is making this pile bigger","output":"[The camera clicks on, and for a moment, everything is drenched in that soft, artificial light familiar to every denizen of the digital age.

Für das beste Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis empfehlen wir Dir die ING. Sehr günstige Depots findest Du bei Finanzen.net Zero, Trade Republic, Scalable Capital (Free Broker), Justtrade, Traders Place und Flatex. Günstige Depots mit einem breiten Leistungsspektrum findest Du bei Comdirect, Consorsbank oder 1822direkt.","output":"Basierend auf der umfangreichen Finanztip-Auswertung und unter Berücksichtigung der Hauptanforderungen – günstig und sicher –, scheint die ING die optimale Wahl für das beste Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis zu sein. Die ING bietet ein ausgewogenes Verhältnis zwischen Kosten und Leistungsangebot, erzielt recht hohe Punktzahlen in beiden Kategorien (85/100 in Kosten und 86/100 in Leistung), und stellt damit eine attraktive Option für Anleger dar, die Wert auf geringe Kosten bei zugleich breitem Leistungsspektrum legen. Für Anleger, die besonders auf geringe Kosten achten, sind folgende Depots empfehlenswert: 1. **Finanzen.net Zero:** Es erreicht die höchste Punktzahl in der Kategorie Kosten (99/100) und ist somit eines der günstigsten Angebote auf dem Markt. Allerdings ist bei der Leistung ein deutlicher Abfall zu verzeichnen (47/100), was für Anleger, die Wert auf umfangreiche Leistungen legen, ein entscheidender Faktor sein kann. 2. **Trade Republic** und **Scalable Capital (Free Broker):** Beide bieten mit 95/100 ebenfalls ein exzellentes Kosten-Nutzen-Verhältnis. Sie sind nicht nur preislich attraktiv, sondern auch im Hinblick auf ihre Leistungspunktzahl (Trade Republic mit 60/100 und Scalable Capital mit 58/100) relativ ausgewogen, obwohl sie hinter der ING zurückbleiben. 3. **Justtrade** und **Traders Place:** Beide schneiden mit Blick auf die Kosten gut ab (93/100 und 90/100) und könnten für besonders preissensible Anleger interessant sein. Die Leistungsbewertungen weisen jedoch auf Limitationen hin, die vor der endgültigen Entscheidung abgewogen werden sollten. 4. **Flatex:** Mit einem Kosten-Score von 86/100 bietet Flatex eine weitere Alternative, allerdings mit Einbussen im Bereich der Leistungen (72/100). Für Anleger, denen ein breites Leistungsspektrum wichtig ist, und die bereit sind, dafür eventuell etwas höhere Kosten in Kauf zu nehmen, könnten **Comdirect**, **Consorsbank** oder **1822direkt** interessant sein. Diese Broker bieten eine stabile Performance in beiden Kategorien und sind besonders für diejenigen empfehlenswert, die Wert auf spezielle Features, umfangreiche Depotfunktionen und gute Erreichbarkeit legen. Zusammengefasst wird die ING insgesamt als bester Online-Broker empfohlen, insbesondere wegen des beständigen Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnisses. Für extrem kostenbewusste Anleger ohne Bedarf an zusätzlichen Leistungen könnte Finanzen.net Zero jedoch die attraktivste Wahl sein, wobei Trade Republic und Scalable Capital (Free Broker) gute Alternativen für eine ausgewogenere Balance zwischen Kosten und Performance darstellen."},{"instruction":"Siehst du etwas basierend auf deinem Wissen was dagegen stimmt?","output":"Basierend auf den bereitgestellten Daten aus der Finanztip-Auswertung und meinem aktuellen Wissen bis zum Stand von 2023, scheint die Analyse und Empfehlung schlüssig und kohärent. Es gibt keine offensichtlichen Unstimmigkeiten oder Widersprüche in der vorangegangenen Zusammenfassung und Empfehlung. Die Empfehlung, ING als Depot mit dem besten Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis zu wählen, steht im Einklang mit den präsentierten Daten, da die ING gute Werte in sowohl der Kosten- als auch der Leistungskategorie zeigt. Dies deutet darauf hin, dass ING ein ausgewogenes Verhältnis zwischen angemessenen Kosten und einem umfassenden Dienstleistungsangebot bietet. Die Hervorhebung spezifischer Broker wie Finanzen.net Zero, Trade Republic und Scalable Capital (Free Broker) basiert auf deren starken Leistungen in der Kostenkategorie. Die Berücksichtigung ihrer niedrigeren Bewertungen in der Leistungskategorie zur Bewertung ihrer Gesamtempfehlung ist ein kritischer und wichtiger Aspekt, der zeigt, dass diese Analyse umfassend ist und sowohl Kosten als auch Leistung einbezieht. Es ist auch relevant zu betonen, dass die Auswahl eines Online-Brokers stark von den individuellen Bedürfnissen und Präferenzen des Anlegers abhängt. Einige Anleger könnten mehr Wert auf niedrige Kosten legen, auch auf Kosten der Leistung, während andere ein breiteres Spektrum an Dienstleistungen und Funktionen bevorzugen könnten, selbst wenn dies mit höheren Kosten verbunden ist. Abschließend stimmt die Empfehlung, gründlich die eigenen Anlageziele zu überlegen und die Brokerwahl entsprechend diesen Zielen zu treffen, mit einer fundierten Entscheidungsfindung im Finanzsektor überein. Da keine Widersprüche oder Unstimmigkeiten mit dem aktuellen Wissen und der bereitgestellten Datenbasis festgestellt wurden, erscheint die Analyse und die Schlussfolgerung als fundiert und zuverlässig."},{"instruction":"Sind die Anbieter sicher?","output":"Die Sicherheit von Online-Brokern und Depotanbietern ist ein entscheidendes Kriterium für Anleger. Die in der Analyse erwähnten Anbieter, wie ING, Finanzen.net Zero, Trade Republic, Scalable Capital (Free Broker), Justtrade, Traders Place, Flatex, Comdirect, Consorsbank und 1822direkt, sind in Deutschland tätige Finanzunternehmen, welche unter die Regulierung der Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) und gegebenenfalls zusätzlich unter die Regulierung der Europäischen Zentralbank (EZB) fallen. Dies bedeutet, dass sie bestimmte Sicherheits- und Regulierungsstandards erfüllen müssen, die zum Schutz der Anleger beitragen. Außerdem sind in Deutschland tätige Kreditinstitute und Wertpapierhandelsunternehmen verpflichtet, Mitglied im Einlagensicherungsfonds zu sein. Dies bietet Anlegern eine gewisse Absicherung ihrer Einlagen und Wertpapiere im unwahrscheinlichen Fall einer Bankinsolvenz. Die spezifischen Deckungsgrenzen können jedoch variieren, und es ist wichtig, dass Anleger sich direkt bei ihrem Broker oder Depotanbieter über die Details informieren. Zusätzlich zu gesetzlichen Einlagensicherungen verfügen viele Broker über zusätzliche freiwillige Sicherungssysteme, die über die gesetzliche Einlagensicherung hinausgehen. Anleger sollten prüfen, ob ihr Broker zusätzliche Sicherheitsmaßnahmen anbietet. Die technische und operationelle Sicherheit ist ebenfalls kritisch. Seriöse Anbieter implementieren umfangreiche Sicherheitsmaßnahmen zum Schutz der Konten und Daten ihrer Kunden, einschließlich starker Verschlüsselungsstandards, Zwei-Faktor-Authentifizierung (2FA) und fortgeschrittener Betrugspräventionsmechanismen. Während regulatorische und operationelle Sicherheitsmaßnahmen ein wesentliches Fundament darstellen, sollten Anleger ebenso ihre eigenen Sicherheitsmaßnahmen ernst nehmen, indem sie starke und einzigartige Passwörter verwenden, regelmäßig ihre Konten überprüfen und Vorsicht walten lassen bei jeglicher Art von Kommunikation, die nach sensiblen Informationen fragt. Zusammengefasst können die genannten Anbieter als sicher betrachtet werden, unter der Voraussetzung, dass sie die deutschen regulatorischen Anforderungen erfüllen und angemessene technische Sicherheitsmaßnahmen implementiert haben. Trotzdem bleibt es essenziell, dass Anleger eigene Nachforschungen anstellen, regelmäßig Sicherheitshinweise berücksichtigen und persönliche Sicherheitsmaßnahmen anwenden."},{"instruction":"Finanzen.net ist eine Bank?","output":"Nein, Finanzen.net selbst ist keine Bank. Finanzen.net ist eine der größten Finanzinformatik-Websites in Deutschland, die umfangreiche Informationen und Tools rund um das Thema Finanzen anbietet, darunter auch einen Börsenüberblick, Nachrichten zum Marktgeschehen, Analysen und einen Depot-Vergleich. Die Plattform gehört zur Axel Springer SE, einem großen deutschen Verlagshaus. Wenn es in der ursprünglichen Anfrage um Finanzen.net Zero ging, so bezieht sich dies auf ein Angebot, das Finanzen.net in Kooperation mit einem Partner aus dem Finanzsektor anbietet. Finanzen.net Zero ist eine Marke für ein Anlageprodukt oder eine Anlageplattform, die in Kooperation mit Brokern oder Finanzdienstleistern zur Verfügung gestellt wird, um Nutzern den Handel von Aktien, ETFs und anderen Finanzinstrumenten zu ermöglichen. Für die tatsächliche Abwicklung von Wertpapiergeschäften und die Verwahrung der Depots kooperiert Finanzen.net typischerweise mit lizenzierten Banken oder Finanzdienstleistungsunternehmen, die die regulatorischen Anforderungen erfüllen und von entsprechenden Aufsichtsbehörden überwacht werden. Das bedeutet, dass, obwohl Finanzen.net Zero den Handel ermöglicht, die dahinterstehenden Finanzdienstleistungen von einem Partner bereitgestellt werden, der die banküblichen Lizenzen und Sicherheitsstandards einhält. Es ist immer ratsam, vor der Eröffnung eines Depots oder der Inanspruchnahme von Finanzdienstleistungen die spezifischen Konditionen, die Sicherheitsmerkmale sowie die Hintergrundinformationen der kooperierenden Bank oder des Finanzdienstleisters genau zu prüfen."},{"instruction":"Was kostet ING?","output":"Die Kostenstruktur für Dienstleistungen bei der ING (früher bekannt als ING-DiBa) kann je nach Art der in Anspruch genommenen Dienstleistung variieren. Zum Zeitpunkt meines letzten Wissensstands (bis April 2023) umfasst das Angebot der ING verschiedene Finanzprodukte und -dienstleistungen, darunter Girokonten, Sparkonten, Wertpapierdepots sowie Kredite und Baufinanzierungen. Hier konzentriere ich mich auf die Kosten, die speziell für das Wertpapierdepot und den Handel anfallen, da dies im Kontext deiner früheren Fragen am relevantesten zu sein scheint: 1. **Depotgebühren:** Die ING hat für Privatkunden in der Regel keine regelmäßigen Depotführungsgebühren für die Verwahrung von Wertpapieren erhoben. Es ist jedoch wichtig, die aktuellen Konditionen direkt bei der ING zu prüfen, da Banken ihre Preisstrategien anpassen können. 2. **Kosten für den Handel:** - **Aktien und ETFs:** Beim Kauf oder Verkauf von Aktien und ETFs werden in der Regel Ordergebühren fällig. Diese setzen sich oft aus einem Grundpreis und einer prozentualen Komponente der Order zusammen, wobei häufig eine Mindest- und Höchstgebühr existiert. Zum Beispiel könnte für den Handel an deutschen Börsenplätzen eine Gebühr von ca. 1,75% des Ordervolumens fällig werden, mit einer Mindestgebühr von etwa 4,90 Euro und einer Maximalgebühr von 69,90 Euro pro Trade, abhängig vom gehandelten Volumen und der gewählten Handelsplattform. - **ETF-Sparpläne:** Für ETF-Sparpläne bot die ING teilweise kostenfreie Ausführungen oder reduzierte Gebühren für eine Auswahl an ETFs an. Die genauen Konditionen variieren, daher lohnt sich eine genaue Überprüfung der aktuellen Angebote. 3. **Weitere Gebühren:** Es können weitere Kosten anfallen, zum Beispiel für Limitorders, Teilausführungen oder für den Handel an ausländischen Börsenplätzen. Auch hier ist es ratsam, die vollständigen und aktuellen Konditionen auf der ING-Website oder in den Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnissen der Bank nachzulesen. Bitte beachte, dass Banken ihre Gebührenstrukturen verändern können. Daher empfiehlt es sich, die aktuellen Konditionen und Gebühren direkt auf der Website der ING oder durch direkte Kontaktaufnahme mit der Bank zu prüfen."},{"instruction":"Punktzahl der Emp­feh­lungen in der Kategorie Kosten Depot Gesamt Laufende Kosten Ein­mal­an­la­ge ETF-Kosten ETF-Sparpläne Kosten Kostentransparenz Finanzen.net Zero 99/100 30/30 30/30 35/35 4/5 Trade Republic 95/100 30/30 26/30 34/35 5/5 Scalable Capital (Free Broker) 95/100 30/30 26/30 34/35 5/5 Justtrade 93/100 30/30 26/30 32/35 5/5 Traders Place 90/100 30/30 30/30 25/35 5/5 Flatex 86/100 30/30 17/30 34/35 5/5 ING 85/100 30/30 15/30 35/35 5/5 Consorsbank 71/100 30/30 14/30 22/35 5/5 1822direkt 66/100 30/30 15/30 16/35 5/5 Comdirect 62/100 20/30 15/30 22/35 5/5 Quelle: Finanztip-Auswertung (Stand: 14.

Die Empfehlung für die ING als Online-Broker mit dem besten Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis basiert auf einer ausgeglichenen Bewertung in beiden Kategorien (Kosten und Leistung), wobei besonders die Stärken in der Kategorie Leistung mit einer Gesamtpunktzahl von 86/100 betont werden. Die ING bietet dabei ein breites Spektrum an Finanzprodukten, guten Service und eine hohe Anwenderfreundlichkeit, was sie zu einer attraktiven Option für Anleger macht, die Wert auf umfassende Dienstleistungen und eine benutzerfreundliche Plattform legen. Es folgt eine kurze Zusammenfassung, wie die ING im Vergleich zu anderen Anbietern steht, bezogen auf die in der Anfrage thematisierten Aspekte: # Kosten In der Kategorie Kosten erreicht die ING eine Punktzahl von 85/100, was sie im oberen Mittelfeld der bewerteten Anbieter positioniert. Die hohe Bewertung in Kostentransparenz ist ein Indikator dafür, dass Kunden relativ klare Informationen über mögliche Gebühren erwarten können. Während es Anbieter mit günstigeren Konditionen gibt (z.B. Finanzen.net Zero, Trade Republic, Scalable Capital (Free Broker)), bietet die ING eine ausgewogene Kombination aus Kosten und Service. # Leistung Mit einer Punktzahl von 86/100 in der Leistungskategorie zeichnet sich die ING durch ihre umfassenden Services aus, die nicht nur die eigentliche Depotführung umfassen, sondern auch Aspekte wie die Qualität des ETF-Angebots, Sparplanmöglichkeiten, Einmalanlagen, Depotübertragungen, steuerliche Abwicklung, spezielle Depots, Kontaktoptionen, Zinsen auf dem Girokonto sowie Sicherheit und Convenience bei Log-In und TAN-Verfahren. # Empfehlung Die Empfehlung, sich für die ING zu entscheiden, hängt also von einem Gleichgewicht zwischen Kosten und Leistungsangebot ab. Anleger, die Wert auf ein breites Angebot, guten Service und eine starke Plattform legen und dabei bereit sind, für diese Qualitäten eventuell etwas höhere Gebühren zu zahlen als bei den günstigsten Anbietern, könnten mit der ING sehr zufrieden sein. Letztendlich sollten Anleger immer ihre individuellen Anforderungen berücksichtigen – wie oft und in welchem Umfang sie handeln, welche zusätzlichen Services sie erwarten und wie wichtig ihnen die Nutzungskomfort und die Zugänglichkeit des Kundenservices sind. Ein direkter Vergleich der aktuellsten Konditionen und Leistungen der jeweiligen Anbieter ist immer ratsam, da sich Marktbedingungen und Angebote stetig weiterentwickeln."},{"instruction":"Direkt-Depot und Extra-Konto Geschäftsbedingungen Stand: 22.09.2023 Alle Angaben gelten bis auf Weiteres.

Die ING-DiBa AG, vertreten durch die Mitglieder des Vorstands Nick Jue (Vorsitzender), Michael Clijdesdale, Eddy Henning, Sigrid Kozmiensky, Daniel Llano Manibardo, Dr. Ralph Müller, Theodor-Heuss-Allee 2, 60486 Frankfurt am Main, einge tragen unter HRB 7727 im Handelsregister des Amtsgerichts Frankfurt am Main, Umsatz steuer identi fi ka tionsnummer DE114103475, ist ein deutsches Kreditinstitut mit Vollbanklizenz, erteilt von der Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht, Graurheindorfer Str.108, 53117Bonn, und Marie-Curie-Str. 24-28, 60439 Frankfurt am Main (www.bafin.de), dessenHauptgeschäftstätigkeitder Betrieb allerBankgeschäfte sowie der damit zusammenhängenden Handelsgeschäfte ist. Die ING-DiBa AG wird bei der BaFin unter BAKNR 100088 geführt und von dieser sowie der Europäischen Zentralbank, Sonnemannstr. 20, 60314 Frankfurt am Main beaufsichtigt. 1. Leistungsbeschreibung Direkt-Depot Die ING stellt dem Depotinhaber ein Direkt-Depot zur Verwahrung und Verwaltung seiner Wertpapiere zur Verfügung. Die Depotführung erfolgt per Internetbanking inkl. Post-Box. Das Angebot der ING richtet sich ausschließlich an Privatkunden mit Wohnsitz in Deutschland. Direkt-Depots werden nur für natürliche Personen und auch nur für deren eigene Rechnung eröffnet. (Hinweis: Die ING eröffnet nur Konten und Depots für Personen, die im eigenen wirtschaftlichen Interesse und nicht auf fremde Veranlassung [insbesondere nicht als Treuhänder] handeln.) Die ING führt Direkt-Depots nicht für Personen mit US-Bezug. Die ING führt Gemeinschaftsdepots nur mit Einzelverfügungsberechtigung der einzelnen Depotinhaber und damit nicht als UND-Depots. Jeder Depot- inhaber kann über das Direkt-Depot ohne Zustimmung des anderen Depotinhabers verfügen und zulasten des Depots alle mit der Depot- führung im Zusammenhang stehenden Vereinbarungen treffen. Die ING führt keine Depots, bei denen der Depotinhaber einen Betreuer hat und akzeptiert keine Generalvollmacht. Wertpapieraufträge werden von der ING im Rahmen des Direkt-Depots vermittelt bzw. ausgeführt (sog. beratungsfreies Geschäft). Auf Empfehlungen und Beratungen für den Kauf und Verkauf von Wertpapieren verzichtet die ING in diesem Rahmen. Durch die Eröffnung eines Direkt-Depots bei der ING erklärt sich der Kunde bereit, das Direkt-Depot ausschließlich über das Internetbanking inkl. Post-Box zu führen. Alle relevanten Unterlagen und Informationen stellt die ING dem Kunden ausschließlich im Internet unter www.ing.de oder über die Post-Box zur Verfügung. Eine papierhafte Zurverfügung- stellung von Unterlagen erfolgt daher grundsätzlich nicht. Es besteht auf Anfrage die Möglichkeit die Bereitstellung der Informationen nach der Richtlinie 2014/65/EU postalisch anzufordern. (1) Verwahrung von Wertpapieren Die ING verwahrt im Rahmen des Depotvertrags die Wertpapiere und Wertrechte des Depotinhabers (im Folgenden zusammenfassend „Wert- papiere“) ausschließlich mittelbar. Es findet keine unmittelbare Ver- wahrung von effek tiven Stücken statt. Die ING bietet keine Streifband- verwahrung an. Ferner erbringt sie die in den „Vereinbarungen zum Direkt-Depot“ beschriebenen Dienstleistungen. Die ING ist gesetzlich verpflichtet, auf Anfrage einer Gesellschaft inner- halb des europäischen Wirtschaftsraums (EWR), Auskunft zu personen- bezogenen Daten eines Aktionärs und Informationen zu dessen Aktien- haltung zu erteilen. (2) Erwerb und Veräußerung von Wertpapieren Der Depotinhaber kann Wertpapiere aller Art, insbesondere verzinsliche Wert papiere, Aktien, Genussscheine, Investmentanteilscheine, Zertifi- kate, Optionsscheine und sonstige Wertpapiere, über die ING erwerben oder veräußern. Voraussetzung ist, dass die Wertpapiere zur Giro- sammelverwahrung oder einer ähnlichen Form der Verwahrung zuge- lassen sind, die eine mittelbare Verwahrung durch die ING ermöglicht: • Durch Kommissionsgeschäft: Der Kunde erteilt der ING von Fall zu Fall den Auftrag, für Rechnung des Kunden an einer Börse oder außer- börslich Wertpapiere zu kaufen oder zu verkaufen, und die ING wird sich bemühen, für Rechnung des Depotinhabers ein entsprechendes Ausführungsgeschäft zu tätigen. • Durch Zeichnung: Soweit im Rahmen einer Emission von der ING angeboten, kann der Kunde neue Aktien oder sonstige zur Ausgabe angebotene Wertpapiere bei der ING zeichnen. Die Einzelheiten zum Kauf und Verkauf von Wertpapieren über die ING werden in den „Vereinbarungen zum Direkt-Depot“, Nr. 1–9 geregelt. 2. Zahlung und Erfüllung des Vertrags (1) Verwahrung Die ING erfüllt ihre Verpflichtungen aus dem Depotvertrag durch Bereit- stellung und Führung des Depots. (2) Wertpapiergeschäfte Einzelne Wertpapiergeschäfte werden wie folgt erfüllt und bezahlt: • Kommissionsgeschäfte: Innerhalb der für den jeweiligen (Börsenplatz) Markt geltenden Erfüllungsfristen, sobald ein Ausführungsgeschäft zustande gekommen ist. Die gehandelten Wertpapiere werden dann dem Depot gutgeschrieben (Kauf) bzw. belastet (Verkauf); entspre- chend wird der zu zahlende Betrag dem Verrechnungskonto belastet oder gutgeschrieben. • Zeichnung: Bei erfolgter Zuteilung werden die Wertpapiere dem Depot gut geschrieben und der zu zahlende Betrag wird dem Verrechnungs- konto belastet. Die Einzelheiten der Erfüllung von Kommissionsgeschäften werden in den „Vereinbarungen zum Direkt-Depot“, Nr. 10–12 geregelt. 3. Hinweis auf Risiken und Preisschwankungen im Wertpapiergeschäft Wertpapiergeschäfte sind wegen ihrer spezifischen Merkmale oder der durchzuführenden Vorgänge mit speziellen Risiken behaftet. Insbeson- dere sind folgende Risiken zu nennen: • Kursänderungsrisiko/Risiko rückläufiger Anteilspreise, • Bonitätsrisiko (Ausfallrisiko bzw. Insolvenzrisiko) des Emittenten, • Totalverlustrisiko. Der Preis eines Wertpapiers kann Schwankungen auf dem Finanzmarkt unterliegen, auf die die ING keinen Einfluss hat. In der Vergangenheit erwirtschaftete Erträge (z. B. Zinsen, Dividenden) und erzielte Wertsteige- rungen sind kein Indikator für künftige Erträge oder Wertsteigerungen. Weiterhin können sich Risiken aus der Sammelverwahrung, insbesondere aus der Verwahrung von Wertpapieren im Ausland ergeben. Ausführliche Informationen enthält die Broschüre „Basisinformationen über Vermögensanlagen in Wertpapieren“, die der Kunde bei der ING anfordern kann bzw. die die ING dem Kunden mit der Eröffnungsbestä- tigung zur Verfügung stellt. Die ING weist darauf hin, dass diese Infor- mationen keine Anlageberatung darstellen, sondern nur dazu dienen, dem Depotinhaber die eigenen Anlageentscheidungen zu erleichtern. 4. Preise Die aktuellen Preise für die von der ING erbrachten Dienstleistungen für die Depotführung und die Ausführung von Wertpapiergeschäften ergeben sich aus dem Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnis. Im Übrigen gilt Nr. 12 der „Allgemeinen Geschäftsbedingungen“. 5. Kosten und Steuern Einkünfte aus Finanzinstrumenten sind in der Regel steuerpflichtig. Das Gleiche gilt für Gewinne aus dem Erwerb und der Veräußerung von Wert papieren. Abhängig vom jeweils geltenden Steuerrecht (In- und Ausland) und den persönlichen Verhältnissen des Kunden, können bei der Auszahlung von Erträgen oder Veräußerungserlösen Kapitalertrag- und/oder sonstige Steuern anfallen (z. B. Withholding Tax nach US-amerikanischem Steuer- recht), die an die jeweiligen Steuerbehörden abgeführt werden und daher den an den Kunden ausbezahlten Betrag mindern. In Einzelfällen können dem Depot inhaber noch weitere Steuern entstehen, die nicht über die ING gezahlt werden. Dies gilt insbesondere, wenn der Kunde im Ausland steuerpflichtig ist. Die steuerliche Behandlung kann künftig Änderungen unterworfen sein. Bei Fragen sollte sich der Kunde an die für ihn zuständige Steuerbehörde bzw. seinen steuerlichen Berater wenden. 4 11. Mitteilungspflicht des Kunden (1) Der Kunde ist verpflichtet, der ING eine Änderung von Name, Anschrift, Steueransässigkeit, US-Bezug, Referenzkonto oder Staats- angehörigkeit unverzüglich mitzuteilen. (2) Sofern es erforderlich ist, dass seitens des Kunden ein Client Identifier hinterlegt sein muss, ist der Kunde verpflichtet, diesen der ING mitzu- teilen. Solange der Kunde der ING den u.U. erforderlichen Client Identifier nicht mitteilt, ist ein Handel über das Direkt-Depot nicht möglich. 12. Leistungsvorbehalt Es gibt keinen Leistungsvorbehalt, außer dieser ist ausdrücklich verein- bart. Im Auslandshandel gilt die Leistung vorbehaltlich der Lieferbarkeit der Wertpapiere. 13. Vertragliche Kündigungsregeln Für den Depotvertrag gelten die in Nr. 18 und 19 der „Allgemeinen Geschäftsbedingungen“ für den Kunden und die ING festgelegten Kündi- gungsregeln. 14. Bericht über Wertpapierdienstleistungen Die ING erstattet nach Ausführung eines Geschäfts Bericht über die erbrachten Wertpapierleistungen. Der Kunde erhält eine entsprechende Bestätigung. 15. Prüfung der Angemessenheit Die ING ist verpflichtet, die Angemessenheit von Anlageentscheidungen in Bezug auf Kenntnisse und Erfahrungen ihrer Kunden zu prüfen. Sollte diese Prüfung ergeben, dass der Auftrag den Kenntnissen und Erfahrun- gen des Kunden nicht entspricht, wird die ING diesen darüber informieren und ist berechtigt, die Ausführung des Auftrags abzulehnen. Bei Gemein- schaftsdepots erfolgt der Abgleich der Kenntnisse und Erfahrungen mit der jeweils handelnden Person. Dies kann zur Folge haben, dass diese Wertpapiere kauft, zu denen die Kenntnisse und Erfahrungen der anderen Depotinhaber möglicherweise nicht ausreichen. 16. Restriktionen für komplexe Produkte Für Kaufaufträge bestimmter (i.d.R. komplexer) Produkte ist eine Frei- schaltung zur jeweiligen Produktgruppe Voraussetzung. Diese erfolgt im Rahmen der Angemessenheitsprüfung durch das Bestehen eines Wissenstests. Liegt keine Freischaltung zur Produktgruppe vor, wird die ING entsprechende Aufträge zurückweisen. 17. Prüfung des Zielmarkts Die ING ist verpflichtet, den Zielmarkt des Produkts mit den ihr vorlie- genden Informationen des Kunden abzugleichen. Sollte diese Prüfung ergeben, dass das Wertpapier nicht mit den von der ING zu prüfenden Merkmalen des Kunden vereinbar ist, kann die ING die Ausführung des Auftrags ablehnen. Die ING nimmt keinen vollständigen Zielmarktab- gleich vor, sondern gleicht lediglich solche Kriterien ab, zu denen ihr Informationen des Kunden vorliegen. Der vollständige Zielmarkt wird auf der Internetseite der ING (www.ing.de) zur Verfügung gestellt. 18. Bearbeitung von Beschwerden und Details zur Beschwerdeabwicklung Der Kunde hat jederzeit die Möglichkeit zur Beschwerde. Details zum Beschwer deabwicklungsverfahren sind im Internet unter www.ing.de abrufbar. Sollte die ING dazu verpflichtet sein, einen bestimmten US-Quellen- steuersatz abzuführen, wird sie dies anhand der ihr vorliegenden Kunden- angaben vornehmen. Ggf. anfallende Kosten Dritter sind vom Kunden zu tragen. Dies gilt ins besondere, falls bei der Identifizierung nach § 154 Abgabenordnung (AO) durch Dritte Kosten in Rechnung gestellt werden. Eigene Kosten (z. B. für Ferngespräche, Porti) hat der Kunde selbst zu tragen. Zusätz- liche Telekommunikationskosten berechnet die ING nicht. 6. Pfandrecht Der Depotinhaber und die ING sind sich darüber einig, dass die ING ein Pfandrecht an den Wertpapieren und Sachen erwirbt, an denen eine inländische Geschäftsstelle der ING im bankmäßigen Geschäftsverkehr Besitz erlangt hat oder noch erlangen wird. Die ING erwirbt ein Pfand- recht auch an den Ansprüchen, die dem Depotinhaber gegen die ING aus der bank mäßigen Geschäftsbeziehung zustehen oder künftig zuste- hen werden. Das Pfandrecht dient der Sicherung aller bestehenden, künftigen und bedingten Ansprüche, die der ING mit ihren sämtlichen in- und auslän- dischen Geschäftsstellen aus der bankmäßigen Geschäftsbeziehung gegen den Depotinhaber zustehen. Gelangen Gelder oder andere Werte mit der Maßgabe in die Verfügungsgewalt der ING, dass sie nur für einen bestimmten Zweck verwendet werden dürfen (z. B. Bareinzahlungen zur Einlösung eines Wechsels), erstreckt sich das Pfandrecht der ING nicht auf diese Werte. Dasselbe gilt für die Wertpapiere, die die ING im Aus- land für den Depotinhaber verwahrt. Unterliegen dem Pfandrecht der ING Wertpapiere, ist der Depotinhaber nicht berechtigt, die Herausgabe der zu diesen Papieren gehörenden Zins- und Gewinnanteilscheine zu verlangen. 7. Einlagensicherung Die ING ist dem Einlagensicherungsfonds des Bundesverbandes deut- scher Banken e. V. angeschlossen. Der Umfang der durch den Einlagen- sicherungsfonds geschützten Verbindlichkeiten ist in Nr. 20 der „Allgemeinen Geschäftsbedingungen“ beschrieben. 8. Mindestlaufzeit des Vertrags Für den Depotvertrag ist keine Mindestlaufzeit vereinbart. Bei Kündigung des Depotvertrags muss der Kunde die verwahrten Wertpapiere auf ein anderes Depot übertragen oder veräußern. 9. Vertragssprache und Kommunikation (1) Vertragssprache Maßgebliche Sprache für dieses Vertragsverhältnis, die Vorabinforma- tionen und die Kommunikation zwischen dem Kunden und der ING während der Laufzeit des Vertrags ist Deutsch. Alle Geschäftsbedingungen stehen ausschließlich in deutscher Sprache zur Verfügung. Alle Doku- mente und Informationen, die die ING den Kunden zur Verfügung stellt, sind ebenfalls ausschließlich in deutscher Sprache erhältlich. (2) Kommunikationswege Die Kommunikation zwischen der ING und dem Kunden erfolgt per Inter- net banking inklusive Post-Box oder Internet (www.ing.de). Wünscht der Kunde eine Auftragserteilung per Telefon, ist nur in geregelten Fällen möglich und es gelten die Entgelt regelungen nach dem Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnis. Sofern die ING bei der Auftragserteilung über das Internetbanking nicht erreichbar ist (z. B. Systemausfall), ist der Kunde verpflichtet (entgeltfrei), das Telefon zu nutzen. 10. Anwendbares Recht/Gerichtsstand Für die Geschäftsbeziehung zwischen Depotinhaber und ING gilt deut- sches Recht. Die ING legt das Recht der Bundesrepublik Deutschland auch der vorvertraglichen Beziehung zugrunde. Es gibt keine vertrag- liche Gerichts stand klausel. 5 wird oder im Internet unter www.bankenverband.de abrufbar ist.

Die OS-Plattform kann ein Verbraucher für die außergericht- liche Beilegung einer Streitigkeit aus Online-Verträgen mit einem in der EU nieder gelassenen Unternehmen nutzen. Zusätzlich zu den vorgenannten Beschwerde- und Streitbeilegungs- verfahren steht dem Kunden auch die Möglichkeit einer zivilrechtlichen Klage offen. 19. Beschwerde- und Alternative Streitbeilegungs- verfahren Der Kunde hat folgende außergerichtliche Möglichkeiten: • Der Kunde kann sich mit einer Beschwerde an die im Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnis genannte Kontaktstelle der ING wenden. Die ING wird Beschwer den in geeigneter Weise beantworten, bei Zahlungs- diensteverträgen erfolgt dies in Textform (zum Beispiel mittels Brief, Telefax oder E-Mail). • Die ING nimmt am Streitbeilegungsverfahren der Verbraucherschlich- tungsstelle „Ombudsmann der privaten Banken“ (www.bankenombudsmann.de) teil. Dort hat der Verbraucher die Mög- lichkeit, zur Beilegung einer Streitigkeit mit der ING den Ombudsmann der privaten Banken anzurufen. Betrifft der Beschwerdegegenstand eine Streitigkeit über einen Zahlungsdienstevertrag (§ 675f des Bürger- lichen Gesetzbuches), können auch Kunden, die keine Verbraucher sind, den Ombudsmann der privaten Banken anrufen.

Führt die ING den Auftrag ganz oder teilweise nicht aus, so wird sie den Kunden unverzüglich unterrichten. 5. Festsetzung von Preisgrenzen Der Kunde kann der ING bei der Erteilung von Aufträgen Preisgrenzen für das Ausführungsgeschäft vorgeben (preislich limitierte Aufträge). 6. Gültigkeitsdauer von unbefristeten Kundenaufträgen (1) Preislich unlimitierte Aufträge Ein preislich unlimitierter Auftrag gilt nur für einen Handelstag; ist der Auftrag für eine gleichtägige Ausführung nicht so rechtzeitig eingegan- gen, dass seine Berücksichtigung im Rahmen des ordnungsgemäßen Arbeitsablaufs möglich ist, so wird er für den nächsten Handelstag vor- gemerkt. Wird der Auftrag nicht ausgeführt, so wird die ING den Kunden hiervon unverzüglich benachrichtigen. (2) Preislich limitierte Aufträge Ein preislich limitierter Auftrag ist bis zum letzten Handelstag des laufen- den Monats gültig (Monatsultimo). Ein am letzten Handelstag eines Monats eingehender Auftrag wird, sofern er nicht am selben Tag ausge- führt wird, für den nächsten Monat vorgemerkt. Die ING wird den Kunden über die Gültigkeitsdauer seines Auftrags unverzüglich unterrichten. (3) Zeichnungsaufträge Zeichnungsaufträge sind bis zum ersten Handelstag des gezeichneten Wertpapiers gültig. Über die Abgabe eines Zeichnungsauftrags erhält der Kunde keine separate Bestätigung. Die Information über eine Berücksichtigung im Rahmen der Zuteilung erfolgt durch eine entspre- chende Abrechnung. 7.

Erwerb von Wertpapieren/Formen des Wert papiergeschäfts (1) Erwerb von Wertpapieren Über die ING kann der Kunde nur Wertpapiere erwerben, die zur Giro- sammelverwahrung oder einer ähnlichen Form der Verwahrung zuge- lassen sind, die eine mittelbare Verwahrung durch die ING ermöglicht. (2) Kommissionsgeschäfte Die ING und der Kunde schließen Wertpapiergeschäfte ausschließlich in Form von Kommissionsgeschäften ab. Führt die ING Aufträge ihres Kunden zum Kauf oder Verkauf von Wert- papieren als Kommissionärin aus, schließt sie für Rechnung des Kunden mit einem anderen Marktteilnehmer oder einer zentralen Gegenpartei ein Kauf- oder Verkaufsgeschäft (Ausführungsgeschäft) ab oder sie beauftragt einen anderen Kommissionär (Zwischenkommissionär), ein Ausführungsgeschäft abzuschließen. Im Rahmen des elektronischen Handels an einer Börse kann der Auftrag des Kunden auch gegen die ING oder den Zwischenkom mis sio när unmittelbar ausgeführt werden, wenn die Bedingungen des Börsen handels dies zulassen. 2. Ausführungsgrundsätze für Wertpapiergeschäfte Die ING führt Wertpapiergeschäfte nach ihren jeweils geltenden Aus- führungsgrundsätzen aus. Die Ausführungsgrundsätze sind Bestandteil der Vereinbarungen zum Direkt-Depot. Die ING ist berechtigt, die Aus- führungsgrundsätze entsprechend den aufsichtsrechtlichen Vorgaben zu ändern.

Wurde der Auftrag des Kunden im elektronischen Handel an einer Börse gegen die ING oder den Zwischenkommissionär unmittelbar ausgeführt, bedarf es keiner gesonderten Benachrichtigung.

Ende der Widerrufsbelehrung 7 (3) Gutschrift in Wertpapierrechnung Die ING wird sich nach pflichtgemäßem Ermessen unter Wahrung der Interessen des Kunden das Eigentum oder Miteigentum an den Wert- papieren oder eine andere im Lagerland übliche gleichwertige Rechts- stellung verschaffen und diese Rechtsstellung treuhänderisch für den Kunden halten. Hierüber erteilt sie dem Kunden Gutschrift in Wert- papierrechnung (WR-Gutschrift) unter Angabe des ausländischen Staates, in dem sich die Wert papiere befinden (Lagerland). (4) Deckungsbestand Die ING braucht die Auslieferungsansprüche des Kunden aus der ihm erteilten WR-Gutschrift nur aus dem von ihr im Ausland unterhaltenen Deckungsbestand zu erfüllen. Der Deckungsbestand besteht aus den im Lagerland für die Kunden und für die ING verwahrten Wertpapieren derselben Gattung. Ein Kunde, dem eine WR-Gutschrift erteilt worden ist, trägt daher anteilig alle wirtschaftlichen und rechtlichen Nachteile und Schäden, die den Deckungsbestand als Folge von höherer Gewalt, Aufruhr, Kriegs- und Naturereignissen oder durch sonstige von der ING nicht zu vertretende Zugriffe Dritter im Ausland oder im Zusammen- hang mit Verfügungen von hoher Hand des In- oder Auslands treffen sollten. (5) Behandlung der Gegenleistung Hat ein Kunde nach Abs. 4 Nachteile und Schäden am Deckungsbestand zu tragen, so ist die ING nicht verpflichtet, dem Kunden den Kaufpreis zurückzuerstatten. 13. Depotführung per Internetbanking/ Berichtspflicht (1) Durch die Depoteröffnung bei der ING erklärt sich der Kunde damit einverstanden, sein Depot online zu führen. Die Depotführung erfolgt per Internetbanking inklusive Post-Box. Sämtliche Mitteilungen und Informationen werden in die Internetbanking Post-Box eingestellt oder stehen im Internet unter www.ing.de zur Verfügung. Ein Versand von Depotauszügen, Mitteilungen und Informationen per Post parallel zur Post-Box erfolgt nur auf Verlangen des Kunden und ist nach Maßgabe des Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnisses entgeltpflichtig. Im Übrigen werden dem Kunden die Informationen zur Depotbewertung im Inter- netbanking bereitgestellt. Das Internetbanking steht im jeweils ange- botenen Umfang zur Erteilung von Aufträgen und Weisungen sowie zu Informationszwecken zur Verfügung. (2) Die ING erteilt vierteljährlich einen Depotauszug. (3) Bei gehebelten Produkten wird die ING, sofern der Preis eines Finanz- instruments mindestens 10 % im Vergleich zum Ausgangswert gefallen ist, eine Verlustmitteilung erstellen und dem Kunden bereitstellen. Anschließend erfolgt diese Mitteilung bei jedem weiteren Wertverlust in 10 %-Schritten. (4) Die Nutzung des Internetbanking ist in den Vereinbarungen zum Internetbanking inklusive Post-Box geregelt. 14.

Der Gegenwert von Zins-, Gewinn- anteil- und Ertragsscheinen sowie von fälligen Wertpapieren jeder Art wird unter dem Vorbehalt gutgeschrieben, dass die ING den Betrag erhält, und zwar auch dann, wenn die Papiere bei der ING selbst zahlbar sind. Die ING besorgt neue Zins-, Gewinnanteil- und Ertragsscheinbögen (Bogen erneuerung). (2) Auslandsverwahrte Wertpapiere Diese Pflichten obliegen bei im Ausland verwahrten Wertpapieren dem ausländischen Verwahrer. (3) Auslosung und Kündigung von Schuldverschreibungen Bei einer Auszahlung von rückzahlbaren Schuldverschreibungen wird der verloste Bestandteil anteilig auf sämtliche Kunden aufgeteilt, so dass jeder Kunde prozentual den gleichen Anteil aus seinem Bestand zurück- gezahlt bekommt. Die zurückgezahlten Bestände werden den Kunden als Endfälligkeit verbucht, so dass der Bestand jedes Kunden sich entspre- chend verringert und er gleichzeitig den zurückgezahlten Betrag dafür auf seinem Verrechnungskonto gutgeschrieben bekommt. schaftsmitteln mit Ablauf des Handelstages, an dem die Aktien letzt- malig einschließlich der vorgenannten Rechte bzw. als Inhaberaktien gehandelt werden, sofern die jeweiligen Regelungen des Ausführungs- platzes ein Erlöschen vorsehen. Bei Veränderung der Einzahlungsquote teilein gezahlter Aktien oder des Nennwertes von Aktien und im Falle des Aktiensplittings erlöschen preislich limitierte Aufträge mit Ablauf des Handelstages vor dem Tag, an dem die Aktien mit erhöhter Einzahlungs- quote bzw. mit dem veränderten Nennwert bzw. gesplittet notiert werden. Preislich limitierte Aufträge zum Kauf oder Verkauf von Aktien an aus- ländischen Ausführungsplätzen werden bei Dividendenzahlung, Kapital- erhöhung, Aktiensplitting oder Aktientausch gelöscht bevor die Aktien erstmalig unter der Berücksichtigung dieser Maßnahmen gehandelt werden und sofern der Ausführungspartner von der Maßnahme Kenntnis erlangt. (2) Kursaussetzung Wenn an einem Ausführungsplatz die Preisfeststellung wegen besonde- rer Umstände im Bereich des Emittenten unterbleibt (Kursaussetzung), erlöschen sämtliche an diesem Ausführungsplatz auszuführenden Kunden aufträge für die betreffenden Wertpapiere, sofern die Bedingun- gen des Ausführungsplatzes dies vorsehen. (3) Benachrichtigung Über das Erlöschen eines Kundenauftrags wird die ING den Kunden unverzüglich benachrichtigen. 9. Haftung der ING bei Kommissionsgeschäften Die ING haftet für die ordnungsgemäße Erfüllung des Ausführungs- geschäfts durch ihren Vertragspartner oder den Vertragspartner des Zwischen kommissionärs. Bis zum Abschluss eines Ausführungsgeschäfts haftet die ING bei der Beauftragung eines Zwischenkommissionärs nur für dessen sorg fältige Auswahl und Unterweisung. 10. Erfüllung im Inland Die ING erfüllt Wertpapiergeschäfte im Inland, soweit nicht die nachfol- genden Bedingungen oder eine anderweitige Vereinbarung die Anschaf- fung im Ausland vorsehen. 11. Anschaffung im Inland Bei der Erfüllung im Inland verschafft die ING dem Kunden, sofern die Wertpapiere zur Girosammelverwahrung bei der deutschen Wertpapier- sammelbank (Clearstream Banking AG) zugelassen sind, Miteigentum an diesem Sammelbestand – Girosammel-Depotgutschrift (GS-Gutschrift). Wertpapiere, die nicht zur Girosammelverwahrung zugelassen sind, schafft die ING für den Kunden nicht an. Die Verwahrung von Wertpa- pieren in Streifbandverwahrung ist ausgeschlossen. Sie erfolgt auch dann nicht, wenn der Kunde die Wertpapiere auf sein Direkt-Depot über- tragen lassen will. 12. Anschaffung im Ausland (1) Anschaffungsvereinbarung Die ING schafft Wertpapiere im Ausland an, wenn • sie als Kommissionärin Kaufaufträge in in- oder ausländischen Wert- papieren im Ausland ausführt oder • sie als Kommissionärin Kaufaufträge in ausländischen Wertpapieren ausführt. Effektiv verwahrte Wertpapiere schafft die ING nicht an. Sollten Wert- papiere am Erfüllungstag nur effektiv lieferbar oder eine Lieferung der Wertpapiere marktseitig insgesamt nicht möglich sein, behält sich die ING vor, die Transaktion zu stornieren. (2) Einschaltung von Zwischenverwahrern Die ING wird die im Ausland angeschafften Wertpapiere im Ausland ver- wahren lassen. Hiermit wird sie einen anderen in- oder ausländischen Verwahrer (z. B. die Clearstream Banking AG) beauftragen oder eine eigene ausländische Geschäftsstelle damit betrauen. Die Verwahrung der Wertpapiere unterliegt den Rechtsvorschriften und Usancen des Verwahrungsorts und den für den oder die ausländischen Verwahrer geltenden Allgemeinen Geschäftsbedingungen. 8 liche Vernichtung unterrichtet. Erteilt er keine Weisung, so kann die ING die Urkunden nach Ablauf einer Frist von 2 Monaten nach Absendung der Mitteilung an den Kunden vernichten. 19. Haftung (1) Inlandsverwahrung Bei der Verwahrung von Wertpapieren im Inland haftet die ING für jedes Verschulden ihrer Mitarbeiter und der Personen, die sie zur Erfüllung ihrer Verpflichtungen hinzuzieht. Soweit dem Kunden eine GS-Gutschrift erteilt wird, haftet die ING auch für die Erfüllung der Pflichten der Clear- stream Banking AG. (2) Auslandsverwahrung Bei der Verwahrung von Wertpapieren im Ausland beschränkt sich die Haftung der ING auf die sorgfältige Auswahl und Unterweisung des von ihr beauftragten ausländischen Verwahrers oder Zwischenverwahrers. Bei einer Zwischenverwahrung durch die Clearstream Banking AG oder einen anderen inländischen Zwischenverwahrer sowie einer Verwah- rung durch eine eigene ausländische Geschäftsstelle haftet die ING für deren Verschulden. 20. Depotüberträge (nur ganze Anteile) Bei einem Übertrag von Wertpapieren in ein bei einem Fremdinstitut geführtes Depot wird die ING nur ganze Anteile übertragen. Im Depot verwahrte Bruchstücke/Spitzen werden von der ING veräußert und der Gegenwert dem Verrechnungskonto des Kunden gutgeschrieben. 21. US-Bezug/Mitteilungspflicht Die ING führt Direkt-Depots nicht für Personen mit US-Bezug. US-Bezug ist insbesondere bei Personen gegeben, die in den USA steuerpflichtig sind oder die eine US-amerikanische Staatsangehörigkeit, eine US-Green Card, einen US-Wohnsitz, eine US-Versandadresse oder eine US-Telefon- nummer haben, oder die einen Bevollmächtigten bei der ING eingesetzt haben, auf den eines der genannten Kriterien zutrifft. Liegt ein US-Bezug nach den genannten Kriterien vor oder ergibt sich ein US-Bezug im Laufe der Geschäftsbeziehung, ist dies der ING unverzüglich mitzuteilen. 22. Sonstiges (1) Auskunftsersuchen Ausländische Wertpapiere, die im Ausland angeschafft oder veräußert werden oder die ein Kunde von der ING im Inland oder im Ausland verwahren lässt, unterliegen regelmäßig einer ausländischen Rechts- ordnung. Rechte und Pflichten der ING oder des Kunden bestimmen sich daher auch nach dieser Rechtsordnung, die auch die Offenlegung des Namens des Kunden vorsehen kann. Die ING wird entsprechende Auskünfte an ausländische Stellen erteilen, soweit sie hierzu verpflichtet ist; sie wird den Kunden hierüber benachrichtigen. (2) Einlieferung/Überträge Diese Sonderbedingungen gelten auch, wenn der Kunde in- oder auslän- dische Wertpapiere von einem anderen Verwahrer übertragen lässt. Verfügungen über den Depotbestand können ausschließlich in Form von Depotüberträgen zugunsten des der ING anzugebenden Auslieferungs- depots erfolgen. Eine effektive Ein- oder Auslieferung von Wertpapieren ist nicht möglich. (3) Telefonische bzw. elektronische Erteilung von Kauf- und/oder Verkaufsaufträgen (a) In Zusammenhang mit telefonisch bzw. elektronisch erteilten Kauf- und/oder Verkaufsaufträgen ist die ING gesetzlich verpflichtet alle dies bezüg lichen Gespräche bzw. die elektronische Kommunikation dazu, aufzuzeichnen und diese Aufzeichnung 5, auf Veranlassung der zustän- digen Behörde u. U. auch 7 Jahre aufzubewahren. Die ING trifft alle notwendigen Maßnahmen, um die Vertraulichkeit des gesprochenen Wortes zu wahren. (b) Kauforders können in keinem Fall schriftlich erteilt werden. (c) Der Kunde kann eine Kopie der im Rahmen der gesetzlichen Vor- schriften aufgezeichneten orderbezogenen Kommunikation während der in (a) genannten Aufbewahrungsfristen verlangen. (4) Einlösung in fremder Währung Werden Zins-, Gewinnanteil- und Ertragsscheine sowie fällige Wert- papiere in ausländischer Währung/ausländischen Währungen oder Rechnungseinheiten eingelöst, wird die ING den Einlösungsbetrag auf dem Konto des Kunden in dieser Währung gutschreiben, sofern der Kunde ein Konto in dieser Währung unterhält. Andernfalls wird sie dem Kunden hierüber eine Gutschrift in Euro erteilen, soweit nicht etwas anderes vereinbart ist. 15. Behandlung von Bezugsrechten/Options- scheinen/Wandelschuld verschreibungen (1) Bezugsrechte Über die Einräumung von Bezugsrechten wird die ING den Kunden benachrichtigen, wenn hierüber eine Bekanntmachung in den „Wert- papier-Mitteilungen“ erschienen ist. Soweit die ING bis zum Ablauf des vorletzten Tages des Bezugsrechtshandels keine andere Weisung des Kunden erhalten hat, wird sie sämtliche zum Depotbestand des Kunden gehörenden inländischen Bezugsrecht an dem inländischen Handels- platz mit dem zum Zeitpunkt der Orderaufgabe größten wertmäßigen Handelsvolumens verkaufen. Ausländische Bezugsrechte wird die ING gemäß den im Ausland geltenden Usancen bestens verwerten lassen. (2) Options- und Wandlungsrechte Über den Verfall von Rechten aus Optionsscheinen oder Wandlungs- rechten aus Wandelschuldverschreibungen wird die ING den Kunden mit der Bitte um Weisung benachrichtigen, wenn auf den Verfalltag in den „Wertpapier-Mitteilungen“ hingewiesen worden ist. 16. Weitergabe von Nachrichten Werden in den „Wertpapier-Mitteilungen“ Informationen veröffentlicht, die die Wertpapiere des Kunden betreffen, oder werden der ING solche Informationen vom Emittenten oder von ihrem ausländischen Verwahrer/ Zwischenverwahrer übermittelt, so wird die ING dem Kunden diese Informationen zur Kenntnis geben, soweit sich diese auf die Rechtsposi- tion des Kunden erheblich auswirken können und die Benachrichtigung des Kunden zur Wahrung seiner Interessen erforderlich ist. So wird sie insbesondere Informationen über • gesetzliche Abfindungs- und Umtauschangebote, • freiwillige Kauf- und Umtauschangebote, • Sanierungsverfahren zur Kenntnis geben. Eine Benachrichtigung des Kunden kann unter- bleiben, wenn die Information bei der ING nicht rechtzeitig eingegangen ist oder die vom Kunden zu ergreifenden Maßnahmen wirtschaftlich nicht zu vertreten sind, weil die anfallenden Kosten in einem Missver- hältnis zu den möglichen Ansprüchen des Kunden stehen. 17. Prüfungspflicht der ING Die ING prüft anhand der Bekanntmachungen in den „Wertpapier-Mit- teilungen“ einmalig bei der Einlieferung von Wertpapierurkunden, ob diese von Verlustmeldungen (Opposition, Zahlungssperren und derglei- chen) betroffen sind. Die Überprüfung auf Aufgebotsverfahren zur Kraft- loserklärung von Wertpapierurkunden erfolgt auch nach Einlieferung. 18. Umtausch sowie Ausbuchung und Vernichtung von Urkunden (1) Urkundenumtausch Die ING darf ohne vorherige Benachrichtigung des Kunden einer in den „Wert papier-Mitteilungen“ bekannt gemachten Aufforderung zur Einrei- chung von Wertpapierurkunden Folge leisten, wenn diese Einreichung offensichtlich im Kundeninteresse liegt und damit auch keine Anlage- entscheidung verbunden ist (wie z. B. nach der Fusion des Emittenten mit einer anderen Gesellschaft oder bei inhaltlicher Unrichtigkeit der Wertpapier urkunden). Der Kunde wird hierüber unterrichtet. (2) Ausbuchung und Vernichtung nach Verlust der Wertpapier eigenschaft Verlieren die für den Kunden verwahrten Wertpapierurkunden ihre Wertpapiereigenschaft durch Erlöschen der darin verbrieften Rechte, so können sie zum Zwecke der Vernichtung aus dem Depot des Kunden ausgebucht werden. Der Kunde wird über die Ausbuchung und die mög- 9 kann per Lastschrift von dem Referenzkonto (Girokonto) eingezogen werden, das der ING zum Verrechnungskonto vorliegt. Der Kunde kann die Anteilskäufe jederzeit aussetzen, erhöhen, reduzieren (auf nicht weniger als den jeweiligen Mindestanlagebetrag) oder einstellen/kündigen. Eine Änderung oder Kündigung des Sparplans wird für den nächsten Ausführungstermin berücksichtigt, wenn die Änderung oder Kündigung bis spätestens 3 Bankarbeitstage 1 vor dem entsprechenden Raten- spartermin vorliegt. Andernfalls wird die Änderung für den folgenden Ausführungs termin berücksichtigt. 3. Auftragsausführung Dem Kunden stehen mindestens 2 Ausführungstermine pro Monat für einen Sparplan zur Auswahl. Über den regelmäßigen Erwerb hinaus können zusätzliche Kaufaufträge erteilt werden. Der Mindestanlagebe- trag pro Wertpapierkauf kann auf www.ing.de eingesehen werden. Anteile für Wertpapier-Sparpläne wird die ING, im Fall von aktiv gema- nagten Fonds ausschließlich über die emittierenden Kapitalverwaltungs- gesellschaften/Kreditinstitute für den Kunden erwerben. Dies gilt auch dann, wenn die betreffenden Wertpapiere an der Börse gehandelt werden. Für alle anderen Fälle wird der Ausführungsplatz unter www.ing.de bekannt gegeben. Der Erwerb der Wertpapiere erfolgt innerhalb von 3 Bank arbeits tagen1 ab Ausführungstermin bzw. Auftragserteilung für zusätzliche Käufe. Über die Ausführung wird eine Wertpapiereinzel- oder Wertpapiersammelabrechnung erstellt. 4. Blockorders Die ING wird zudem, soweit möglich und sinnvoll, mehrere Aufträge für mehrere Kunden zu einer Gesamtorder zusammenfassen (nachfolgend Blockorder) und die daraus resultierenden Aufwendungen bzw. Erlöse unter den beteiligten Kunden aufteilen. Wird der gesamte zusammen- gelegte Auftrag nicht zum gleichen Preis ausgeführt, wird die ING aus den Aufwendungen bzw. Erlösen einen Mittelwert berechnen (nach- folgend Mischkurs) und den Konten der betroffenen Kunden einen Nettodurchschnittspreis belasten bzw. gutschreiben. Einzelheiten zu den durchschnittlichen Ausführungspreisen werden auf Anfrage zur Verfügung gestellt. Die Abrechnung der Aufträge zum Mischkurs kann für den Kunden Vor-, aber auch Nachteile bringen. Für den Einzelfall kann nicht ausgeschlossen werden, dass sich die Zusammenlegung von Orders negativ auf die Preisbildung am Markt auswirkt. 5. Abrechnung/Kosten Die Abrechnung der Anteile erfolgt aufgrund der Abrechnungen, die die ING von den jeweiligen Kapitalverwaltungsgesellschaften/Kreditinsti - tuten oder den Ausführungsplatz erhält. Soweit der Sparplanbetrag das Ein- oder Mehrfache eines Anteils zum Ausgabepreis übersteigt, werden für den überschreitenden Betrag – mit bis zu 5 Dezimalstellen – Bruch- teilsrechte von Anteilen erworben. Bei aktiv gemanagten Fonds enthält die Abrechnung den Ausgabeaufschlag gemäß Verkaufsprospekt. Wenn der Erwerb über die ING zu einem Rabatt auf den Ausgabeauf- schlag führt, kann dies der Abrechnung entnommen werden. Rabatte können sich jederzeit ändern. Die jeweils gültigen Ausgabeaufschläge und Rabatte können auf www.ing.de eingesehen werden. 6. Verkäufe Der teilweise oder vollständige Verkauf von Wertpapieren, die über einen Wertpapier-Sparplan erworben wurden, ist jederzeit möglich. Der laufende Wertpapier-Sparplan wird dadurch nicht verändert. 7. Dynamisierung Die mit der ING vereinbarte Sparplanrate kann jährlich automatisch erhöht werden. Der Kunde der ING kann vereinbaren, dass sich seine regelmäßigen Zahlungen zum 01. Januar eines jeden Jahres um einen festgelegten Prozentsatz erhöhen (automatische Dynamisierung). Diese Vereinbarung kann der Kunde jederzeit aufheben. (d) Der Kunde kann den Auftrag zum Erhalt der Aufzeichnungen in Textform, online oder telefonisch erteilen und erhält eine Kopie der auf- gezeichneten Kommunikation. (4) Abtretung/Verpfändung Ansprüche des Depotinhabers, die nicht auf Geld gerichtet sind, können nicht an Dritte abgetreten werden (Abtretungsausschluss). Der Abtre- tungsausschluss gilt nicht, wenn bei der ING kein schützenswertes Inter- esse an dem Abtretungsausschluss besteht oder die berechtigten Belange des Depotinhabers das schützenswerte Interesse der ING an dem Abtre- tungsausschluss überwiegen. Ansprüche des Depotinhabers aus Direkt- Depots können nicht verpfändet werden. 23. Preise Die Preise ergeben sich aus dem Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnis und werden bei Fälligkeit belastet. Vereinbarungen für sparplan- fähige Wertpapiere 1. Leistungsangebot Die ING unterscheidet zwischen sparplanfähigen und nicht sparplan- fähigen Wertpapieren. Bei sparplanfähigen Wertpapieren kann der Kunde die ING beauftragen, Anteile an Wertpapieren zu regelmäßigen Zeitpunkten und zu festgelegten Sparraten zu erwerben. Die sparplan- fähigen Wertpapiere können im Internet unter www.ing.de eingesehen werden. Einzelheiten zu Wertpapiersparplänen finden Sie in den „Verein barungen für Wertpapier-Sparpläne“. 2. Ausschüttung Wenn die sparplanfähigen Wertpapiere Erträge ausschütten, werden diese für Fonds und ETFs ab einem Mindestausschüttungsbetrag und vorbehaltlich der Lieferbarkeit neuer Anteile zum Ausschüttungstag automatisch in Anteilen des ausschüttenden Wertpapiers wieder ange- legt. Der Mindestausschüttungsbetrag für die Wiederanlage kann im Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnis unter www.ing.de eingesehen werden. Die automatische Wiederanlage erfolgt für alle sparplanfähigen Fonds und ETFs, unabhängig davon, ob ein Sparplan eingerichtet ist oder nicht. Der Kunde kann die Wiederanlage der Erträge für die Zukunft für alle sparplanfähigen Fonds und ETFs jederzeit selbst im Internetbanking verwalten. Für nach dem 20.11.2021 eröffnete Direkt-Depots erfolgt keine automa- tische Wiederanlage von Erträgen aus sparplanfähigen ETFs und Fonds. Eine automatische Wiederanlage von Erträgen kann mit Wirkung für die Zukunft für alle sparplanfähigen Fonds und ETFs jederzeit im Internet- banking beauftragt und verwaltet werden. Vereinbarungen für Wertpapier-Sparpläne 1. Leistungsangebot Im Rahmen eines Wertpapier-Sparplans kann der Kunde die ING als Kommissionärin mit dem regelmäßigen Erwerb bestimmter Wert- papiere beauftragen. 2. Eröffnung/Verrechnungskonto/Änderung/ Kündigung Die Beauftragung eines Wertpapier-Sparplans kann im Internetbanking erfolgen. Eine Auftragsbestätigung wird nicht erstellt. Für die Führung des Wertpapier-Sparplans ist ein Direkt-Depot bei der ING Voraussetzung. Grundsätzlich dient das bestehende Verrechnungskonto für das Direkt- Depot auch als Verrechnungskonto für den Sparplan. Die Sparplanrate 1 Bankarbeitstage sind alle Werktage außer Sonnabende, 24. und 31. Dezember und gesetzliche Feiertage des Bundeslandes Hessen. 10 der erheblich und offen kundig von dem zum Zeitpunkt des Zustande- kommens des Geschäfts marktadäquaten Preis – dem sogenannten Referenzpreis – abweicht (Mistrade), so steht den jeweiligen Handels- partnern ein vertragliches Rücktrittsrecht/Aufhebungsrecht zu. Die Mist- rade-Regelungen gelten ausdrücklich auch für Geschäfte, die die Bank als Kommissionär des Kunden tätigt. Die jeweiligen Regelungen können unter www.ing.de eingesehen werden. (2) Handel per Erscheinen Kunden können im Direkthandel ausgewählte Neuemissionen vor deren börslicher Erstnotiz handeln (Handel per Erscheinen). Diesbezüglich getätigte Transaktionen behalten nur dann ihre Gültigkeit, wenn die Börsennotiz zu dem im Emissionsprospekt genannten Termin und unter den dort genannten Bedingungen erfolgt. Bei Abweichungen bzw. Änderungen der Erstnotiz bzw. der Bedingungen liegt es im freien Ermes- sen der ING, die bis dahin getätigten Transaktionen aufzuheben bzw. zu stornieren. In diesem Fall wird die ING den Kunden unverzüglich infor- mieren. 5. Preise Der Ausführungskurs wird durch den jeweiligen Handelspartner fest- gelegt. Die ING ist berechtigt, ein Entgelt und ihre Auslagen dem Kunden in Rechnung zu stellen. Eine der Handelsüberwachung unterliegende Preisermittlung findet im Direkthandel mit außerbörslichen Handelspart- nern nicht statt. Es gilt das allgemeine Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnis der ING in der jeweils aktuellen Fassung. Die jeweils gültigen Trans- aktions gebühren können auf www.ing.de eingesehen werden. 6. Gültigkeitsdauer von Aufträgen Ein im Direkthandel erteilter Auftrag gilt nur für eine sofortige Ausfüh- rung, sofern der Kunde keine anderen Ordergültigkeiten angeboten bekommt und bestätigt. 7. Handelszeiten und Aussetzungen des Handels Die ING und die für den Direkthandel angeschlossenen Handelspartner sind berechtigt, die Handelszeiten nach eigenem Ermessen frei festzu- setzen sowie jederzeit auszuweiten oder einzuschränken. 8. Kein Anspruch des Kunden auf den Direkthandel Die ING kann ihr Leistungsangebot für den Direkthandel jederzeit modifi- zieren, weiterentwickeln oder den Zugang des Kunden zum Direkthandel vorübergehend oder gänzlich unterbinden. Ein Anspruch des Kunden auf Zugang zum Direkthandel besteht nicht. Sofern aus technischen Gründen der Direkthandel nicht möglich ist, kann der Kunde seine Auf- träge zum Kauf oder Verkauf von Wertpapieren über andere Handels- plätze erteilen. Vereinbarungen über die Auftragsausführung (Ausführungsgrundsätze) 1. Anwendungsbereich Diese Grundsätze gelten für die Ausführung und die Weiterleitung von Aufträgen, die der Kunde der ING zum Zwecke des Erwerbs oder der Veräußerung von Wertpapieren erteilt. Ausführung in diesem Sinne bedeutet, dass die ING auf Grundlage des Kundenauftrags für Rechnung des Kunden mit einer anderen Partei auf einem dafür geeigneten Markt ein entsprechendes Ausführungsgeschäft abschließt (Kommissions- geschäft). Die ING kann auch einen weiteren Handelspartner als Zwischen- kommis sionär damit beauftragen, das entsprechende Ausführungs- geschäft abzuschließen. Die Ausgabe von Anteilen an Investmentfonds zum Ausgabepreis sowie deren Rückgabe zum Rück nahmepreis nach Maßgabe des Investmentgesetzes unterliegen nicht den gesetzlichen Regelungen zur bestmöglichen Orderausführung. 8. Umbenennung, Änderung der Wertpapier- kennnummer und Zusammen legung von Investmentfonds Bei Fondsfusionen, Umbenennung oder Änderung der WKN/ISIN wird die ING den Kunden unverzüglich unterrichten. Bestehende Sparpläne wer den bis zu einer anderslautenden Weisung des Kunden unverändert weiter geführt. Widerspricht der Kunde der Umstellung auf den umbe- nannten oder fusionierten Fonds nicht innerhalb von 6 Wochen nach der entsprechenden Mitteilung, gilt die Umstellung des Sparplans als genehmigt. Die ING wird den Kunden in ihrer Mitteilung auf diese Rechtsfolge hinweisen. Vereinbarungen für den Direkthandel Diese Sonderbedingungen gelten ergänzend zu den Vereinbarungen zum Direkt-Depot für den Kauf und Verkauf von Wertpapieren im sogenannten Direkthandel. Im Falle von Abweichungen dieser Sonder- bedingungen von den Vereinbarungen zum Direkt-Depot gelten die Regelungen dieser Sonder bedingungen vorrangig. 1. Leistungsangebot Der Kunde kann der ING Aufträge zum Kauf oder Verkauf ausgewählter Wertpapiere im sogenannten Direkthandel erteilen. Der Direkthandel bietet die Möglichkeit zur Ordererteilung über außerbörsliche oder börs- liche, angeschlossene Handelspartner. Die ING leitet diese Aufträge als Kommissionärin im eigenen Namen für Rechnung des Kunden an den jeweiligen Handelspartner weiter. Eine Liste der an den Direkthandel angeschlossenen Handelspartner, Informationen zu deren Handels- zeiten und Limitierungsmöglichkeiten sowie die jeweils geltenden Mist- rade-Regelungen bzw. die Geschäftsbedingungen können unter www.ing.de eingesehen werden. Eine Anlageberatung durch die ING findet nicht statt. 2. Kursangaben Die Handelspartner geben Preise an, zu denen sie bereit sind, ein Wert- papier zu kaufen oder zu verkaufen, sogenannte Quotes. Die Quotes sind unverbindlich und stellen lediglich eine Aufforderung zur Abgabe eines Angebots zum Kauf oder Verkauf eines Wertpapiers dar. 3. Auftragsausführung Die Handelspartner sind nicht zum Abschluss eines Vertrags zum genannten Quote verpflichtet. Wird das Angebot von dem jeweiligen Handelspartner angenommen, erfolgt umgehend eine Bestätigung an den Kunden. Wird das Angebot nicht angenommen, erfolgt ebenfalls eine Benachrichtigung. Erhält der Kunde bei einem online erteilten Auftrag mit dem Zusatz „nur sofort gültig“ nicht umgehend eine Rückmeldung, liegt eine Störung des Systems vor. Der Kunde ist verpflichtet, sich in diesem Fall sofort tele- fonisch mit der ING in Verbindung zu setzen. Die ING haftet nicht für Schäden, die infolge höherer Gewalt oder infolge sonstiger von ihr nicht zu vertretender Vorkommnisse veranlasst oder auf nicht schuldhaft verursachte technische Probleme zurückzuführen sind; zu Letzteren zählen insbesondere Fehler in Kommunikations- systemen Dritter (z. B. der Deutschen Telekom AG) oder in der Hard- bzw. Software des Kunden. 4. Mistrades und Handel per Erscheinen (1) Mistrade-Regelungen Im Direkthandel gelten die sogenannten mit den außerbörslichen Handelspartnern vereinbarten Mistrade-Regelungen oder die Mistrade- Regelungen der Börse. Diese sehen eine Rückabwicklungsmöglichkeit für den Fall der Bildung nicht marktgerechter Preise vor. Hat der Handels- partner dem Geschäft irrtümlich einen falschen Kurs zugrunde gelegt, 11 (2) Ausland Aufträge zum Kauf oder Verkauf von Wertpapieren im Ausland werden ausschließlich lautend auf ein Ausführungsland entgegengenommen. Aufträge für dieses Land werden durch einen von der ING ausgewählten Handelspartner ausgeführt. Dieser wird alle hinreichenden Maßnahmen ergreifen, um den Auftrag bestmöglich auszuführen. Es gelten die Ausführungsgrundsätze des Handelspartners in ihrer jeweils aktuellen Fassung, die dieser jederzeit anpassen kann. Die Ausführungsgrund- sätze, ein Verzeichnis der Handelspartner sowie weitere Informationen des Handelspartners sind über die Internetseite der ING (www.ing.de) zugänglich. Ein Anspruch des Kunden auf Wahl eines Ausführungsplatzes im Auslandshandel und auf Zugang zum Auslandshandel besteht nicht. 5. Weisungen zum Ausführungsplatz Die ING nimmt Aufträge zum Kauf oder Verkauf von Wertpapieren nur auf der Basis der Weisung eines Kunden, an welchem der unter 4. genannten Ausführungsplätze sein Auftrag ausgeführt werden soll, ent- gegen. Hinweis: An diese Weisung ist die ING gebunden. Der Kunde trägt daher das Risiko der Auswahl des geeigneten Ausführungsplatzes und die ING ist nicht verpflichtet, nach diesen Ausführungsgrundsätzen ein bestmögliches Ergebnis (Best Execution) zu erreichen. Der Kunde sollte sich daher vor seiner Entscheidung über die möglichen Ausführungs- plätze informieren (siehe Ziffer 4). Erteilt ein Kunde einen Auftrag ohne Weisung zu einem Ausführungsplatz, wird die ING die Ausführung des Auftrags ablehnen. Aufträge zum Kauf oder Verkauf von Fondsanteilen werden als Weisung zur Ausführung direkt über die Kapitalanlagegesellschaft behandelt, sofern der Kunde keine anderslautende Weisung erteilt. Für die Behand- lung von Bezugs rechten, die am letzten Tag des Bezugsrechtshandels zum Depotbestand des Kunden gehören, gilt Nr. 15 Abs. 1 der Verein- barungen zum Direkt-Depot entsprechend. 6. Zeichnung Diese Ausführungsgrundsätze gelten nur eingeschränkt, wenn die ING im Rahmen eines öffentlichen oder privaten Angebots Wertpapiere zur Zeichnung anbietet (insbesondere Aktien und Zertifikate). Eine bestmög- liche Ausführung im Sinne dieser Ausführungsgrundsätze erfolgt durch die Annahme des Zeichnungsantrags und einer möglichen Zuteilung oder Liefe rung der Wertpapiere durch die ING. 7. Überprüfung der Grundsätze Die Ausführungsgrundsätze werden durch die ING regelmäßig, mindes- tens einmal jährlich, überprüft. Eine Überprüfung findet ebenfalls statt, wenn eine wesentliche Veränderung des Marktumfelds eintritt, welche eine Anpassung der Ausführungsgrundsätze aufgrund einer Beein- trächtigung erforderlich machen kann. Gegebenenfalls vorgenommene wesentlichen Änderungen der Ausführungsgrundsätze werden regel- mäßig im Internet unter www.ing.de veröffentlicht. Daneben wird fortlaufend die Wirksamkeit der internen Vorkehrungen zur Einhaltung der Grundsätze, die Qualität der Ausführungen und die Eignung der ausgewählten Handels partner überprüft. Vereinbarungen zum Extra-Konto 1. Kontoinhaber Extra-Konten werden nur für natürliche Personen und auch nur für eigene Rechnung eröffnet und geführt. Neukunden müssen ihren Wohnsitz in Deutschland haben. (Hinweis: Die ING-DiBa AG, im Folgenden „ING“ genannt, eröffnet nur Extra-Konten für Personen, die im eigenen wirtschaftlichen Interesse und nicht auf fremde Veranlassung [insbeson- dere nicht als Treuhänder] handeln.) Bei mehr als einem Kontoinhaber zeichnet jeder einzeln und das Extra-Konto wird als Oder-Konto geführt. 2. Ziel der Auftragsausführung Kundenaufträge können regelmäßig über verschiedene Ausführungs- wege oder an verschiedenen Ausführungsplätzen ausgeführt werden, z. B. an Börsen oder an sonstigen Handelsplätzen, im Präsenzhandel einerseits, im elek tro nischen Handel andererseits. In den nachfolgenden Abschnitten werden die Ausführungswege und möglichen Ausführungs- plätze beschrieben, die im Regelfall gleichbleibend die bestmögliche Ausführung im Interesse des Kunden erwarten lassen und dem Kunden daher für den Wertpapierhandel zur Verfügung stehen. 3. Kriterien für die Auswahl der angebotenen Ausführungsplätze und Handelspartner Bei der Festlegung der dem Kunden zu seiner Auswahl angebotenen Ausführungsplätze geht die ING davon aus, dass der, unter Berücksichti- gung aller mit dem Ausführungsgeschäft verbundenen Kosten, best- mögliche Preis vorrangig ist. Dazu zählen insbesondere Wertpapierkurs, Courtage sowie Ausführungs-, Anbindungs- und Abwicklungskosten. Die ING wird ferner andere Ausführungsfaktoren und relevante Kriterien wie z. B. Marktmodell, Liquidität, Ausführungsgeschwindigkeit und -wahrscheinlichkeit, technische Infrastruktur, Regularien und Sicherheit der Abwicklung beachten. Für die Auswahl der Handelspartner gemäß Nr. 4 (2), an die Kunden- aufträge weitergeleitet werden, werden darüber hinaus als relevante Kriterien bestehende Börsenzugänge, der Zugang zu multilateralen Han- delssystemen oder der Zugang zu Liquiditätspools oder die Eigenschaft des Handelspartners als systematischer Internalisierer berücksichtigt. 4. Ausführungsplätze Damit die Auswahl des Ausführungsplatzes durch den Kunden auf informierter Basis erfolgen kann, stellt die ING auf ihrer Internetseite (www.ing.de) umfassende Informationen sowie eine detaillierte Dar- stellung der Gebühren zu den angebotenen Ausführungsplätzen und aktuelle Kursdaten zur Verfügung. Zudem werden auf der Internetseite (www.ing.de) weiterführende Infor- mationen zu den angebotenen Ausführungsplätzen und Handelspart- nern zur Verfügung gestellt, insbesondere eine nach Kategorien von Finanzinstru menten aufgeteilte Statistik über die fünf gemessen am Ordervolumen wichtigsten Ausführungsplätze und Handelspartner, über die die ING Kundenaufträge ausführt bzw. an die die ING Kundenauf- träge weiterleitet, und die dort erzielte Ausführungsqualität. (1) Inland und Fondsgesellschaft Den Kunden der ING stehen für Aufträge zum Kauf oder Verkauf von Wertpapieren im Inland in der Regel unter anderem alle deutschen Prä- senzbörsen, der elektronische Handel über Xetra, die Börse Frankfurt und Frankfurt Zertifikate sowie der Direkthandel über außerbörsliche Handelspartner, Gettex oder die Tradegate Exchange (gemäß den „Vereinbarungen für den Direkthandel“) zur Verfügung. Eine jeweils aktuelle Aufstellung kann unter www.ing.de eingesehen werden. Im Fall von Fonds, für die die ING eine Vertriebsvereinbarung geschlossen hat, ist zusätzlich der Handel über die Fondsgesellschaft möglich. Besonderheiten ergeben sich für offene Immobilienfonds. Der Kauf von Anteilen an offenen Immobilienfonds kann über die ING von der Fondsgesellschaft, an Börsen und im Direkthandel erfolgen. Die Rückgabe von Anteilen an offenen Immobilienfonds ist ausschließ- lich über die Börsen und den Direkthandel möglich. Ein Verkauf über die Fonds gesell schaft wird von der ING nicht angeboten. Ausgenommen hiervon sind Anteile, die ein Anleger vor dem 22.07.2013 erworben hat. Diese können bis zu einem Freibetrag von 30.000 Euro je Kalenderhalbjahr und je Immobilien Sondervermögen (WKN) über die Fondsgesellschaft zurückgegeben werden, sofern die ING eine Vertriebs- verein barung mit der Fondsgesellschaft geschlossen hat. Der Freibetrag je Anleger und je Immobilien-Sondervermögen gilt für alle auch bei anderen Instituten vor dem 22.07.2013 erworbenen Anteile des Anlegers. Die Inhaber eines Gemeinschaftsdepots gelten hinsichtlich des Frei- betrags ebenfalls als ein Anleger. Über diesen Freibetrag hinaus ist über die ING keine Rückgabe an die Fondsgesellschaft möglich. 12 7. Referenzkonto Als Referenzkonto für Auszahlungen und Lastschrifteinzug ist nur ein Girokonto zugelassen, welches auf den Namen des Extra-Konto Inhabers lautet. Der Konto inhaber kann das Referenzkonto durch Mitteilung an die ING einmal innerhalb von 30 Kalendertagen ändern. Änderungsauf- träge per Telefax sind nicht möglich. Verfügungen wird die ING dann nur noch zugunsten des neuen Referenzkontos vornehmen. Bei einem Gemeinschaftskonto (Oder-Konto) ist jeder Kontoinhaber allein berech- tigt, der ING ein neues Referenzkonto mitzuteilen. Änderungen des Referenzkontos (über Internetbanking) durch den Kontoinhaber können von der ING gestattet werden. 8. Vereinbarungen für Gemeinschaftskonten mit Einzelverfügungs berechtigung für jeden Konto- inhaber (Oder-Konten) Jeder Kontoinhaber kann über das Extra-Konto ohne Zustimmung des anderen Kontoinhabers verfügen und zulasten des Kontos alle mit der Konto führung im Zusammenhang stehenden Vereinbarungen treffen. Darüber hinaus kann jeder Kontoinhaber interne Umbuchungen auf Konten veranlassen, die auf den Namen beider Kontoinhaber geführt werden, oder auf eigene Einzelkonten, über die der andere Kontoinhaber verfügungsberechtigt ist. 9. Widerruf der Einzelverfügungsberechtigung Jeder Kontoinhaber kann die Einzelverfügungsberechtigung eines ande- ren Kontoinhabers jederzeit mit Wirkung für die Zukunft der ING gegen- über widerrufen. Über den Widerruf ist die ING unverzüglich zu unter- richten. Der Widerruf führt zu einem Abweichen von der vereinbarten Form der Kontoführung (Ziffer 1), weil sichergestellt werden muss, dass Verfügungen über das Extra-Konto nur von allen Kontoinhabern gemeinsam erfolgen dürfen. Ab Eingang der Widerrufserklärung bei der ING ist eine Teilnahme am Telebanking sowie am Internetbanking für keinen der Kontoinhaber mehr möglich. 10. Verpfändung Guthaben auf Extra-Konten können nicht verpfändet werden. 11. Regelung für den Todesfall eines Kontoinhabers Nach dem Tode eines Kontoinhabers bleiben die Befugnisse des anderen Kontoinhabers unverändert bestehen. Jedoch kann der überlebende Kontoinhaber ohne Mitwirkung der Erben die Konten auflösen. Die Rechte des Verstorbenen werden durch seine Erben gemeinschaftlich wahr- genommen. Das Recht zum Widerruf der Einzelverfügungsberechtigung steht jedoch jedem Erben allein zu. Widerruft ein Miterbe, bedarf jede Verfügung über das Konto seiner Mitwirkung. Widerrufen sämtliche Mit- erben die Einzelverfügungsberechtigung eines Kontoinhabers, so können sämtliche Kontoinhaber nur noch gemeinschaftlich mit sämtlichen Mit erben über das Konto verfügen. 12. Postanschrift Als Postanschrift gilt die Anschrift des ersten Kontoinhabers (gemäß Extra-Kontovertrag). Der Kontoinhaber ist verpflichtet, jede Änderung der Postanschrift unverzüglich mitzuteilen. 13. Laufzeit/Kündigung Der Extra-Konto Vertrag unterliegt keiner Mindestlaufzeit. Der Konto- inhaber kann den Extra-Konto Vertrag jederzeit ohne Einhaltung einer Frist kündigen. Die ING kann den Extra-Konto Vertrag jederzeit unter Einhaltung einer angemessenen Frist kündigen. Bei der Bemessung der Kündigungsfrist wird die ING auf die berechtigten Belange des Konto- inhabers Rücksicht nehmen. Die Kündigungsfrist beträgt mindestens 2 Monate. Das Recht zur fristlosen Kündigung aus wichtigem Grund bleibt bestehen. 2. Wesentliche Leistungsmerkmale/Kontoführung/ Rechnungsabschluss (1) Wesentliche Leistungsmerkmale Das Extra-Konto dient der Geldanlage. Das auf dem Extra-Konto verwahrte Guthaben ist täglich ohne Kündigungsfrist fällig. Der Kontovertrag umfasst die Verwahrung der Einlagen, Kontoführung, Einzahlungen, Überweisungen auf das Referenzkonto und den Lastschrifteinzug vom Referenzkonto. Das Extra-Konto dient nicht der Abwicklung von Zahlungs- verkehrsvorgängen und nimmt nicht am Auslandszahlungsverkehr teil. Die ING wird auf das Extra-Konto gezogene Lastschriften nicht einlösen. (2) Kontoführung Das Extra-Konto wird per Internetbanking inklusive Post-Box geführt. Verfügungen und Weisungen können per Internetbanking erteilt werden. Rechnungsabschlüsse und Mitteilungen werden elektronisch in die Inter- netbanking Post-Box eingestellt. (3) Rechnungsabschluss Von der ING erhält der Kontoinhaber jeweils zum Ende eines Kalender- jahres einen Rechnungsabschluss. Einwendungen wegen Unrichtigkeit oder Unvollständigkeit eines Rechnungsabschlusses hat der Konto- inhaber spätestens vor Ablauf von 6 Wochen nach dessen Zugang zu erheben; macht er seine Einwendungen in Textform geltend, genügt die Absendung innerhalb der 6-Wochen-Frist. Das Unterlassen rechtzei- tiger Einwendungen gilt als Genehmigung. Auf diese Folge wird die ING bei Erteilung des Rechnungsabschlusses besonders hinweisen. Der Konto inhaber kann auch nach Fristablauf eine Berichtigung des Rech- nungsabschlusses verlangen, muss dann aber beweisen, dass das Konto zu Unrecht belastet oder eine Gutschrift nicht erteilt wurde. 3. Entgelte und Aufwendungsersatz Entgelte für die im Rahmen des Extra-Konto Vertrags erbrachten Leis- tungen ergeben sich aus den mit dem Kontoinhaber getroffenen Verein- barungen (z. B. Vereinbarung zum Verwahrentgelt). Es gilt das Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnis. Ein möglicher Anspruch der ING auf Ersatz von Aufwendungen richtet sich nach den gesetzlichen Vorschriften. 4. Guthabenzins Die Zinsen werden jährlich zum 31.12. taggenau berechnet und dem Extra-Konto gutgeschrieben, diese sind dem jährlichen Kontoauszug zu entnehmen. Die ING ist berechtigt, den Zinssatz nach billigem Ermessen (§ 315 BGB) zu ändern. Der Kontoinhaber kann den aktuellen Zinssatz jederzeit unter www.ing.de/konditionen abfragen. 5. Steuern, Mitteilung von Änderungen Einkünfte sind steuerpflichtig. Sofern der Kontoinhaber keinen Freistel- lungsauftrag erteilt hat oder der Sparer-Pauschbetrag ausgeschöpft ist, führt die ING die Kapitalertragsteuer für ihn ab. Bei Fragen sollte sich der Kontoinhaber an die für ihn zuständige Steuerbehörde bzw. seinen steuerlichen Berater wenden. Dies gilt insbesondere, wenn er im Aus- land steuerpflichtig ist. Der Kontoinhaber ist verpflichtet, der ING eine Änderung seiner zur Steuerpflicht im Ausland gemachten Angaben unverzüglich mitzuteilen. 6. Einzahlungen, Verfügungen Bei Verfügungen über das Gesamtguthaben bleibt das Extra-Konto wei- terhin bestehen, es sei denn, der Kontoinhaber wünscht ausdrücklich eine Kontoauflösung. Einzahlungen auf Extra-Konten sind durch Über- weisung und durch Bareinzahlungen bei fremden Kreditinstituten möglich und soweit angeboten durch regelmäßige Lastschrifteinzüge (Sparpläne), dann nur in einem Abstand von 30 Kalendertagen möglich. Prämienbegünstigte vermögenswirksame Leistungen im Sinne des Vermögensbildungsgesetzes können nicht auf das Extra-Konto einge- zahlt werden. Die ING behält sich vor, als vermögenswirksame Leistung gekennzeichnete Zahlungseingänge zurückzuweisen. Die Übermittlung von Aufträgen per Telefax ist nicht möglich. Die ING kann die Höhe des maximalen Lastschriftbetrags festlegen. Auftrage zum Lastschrifteinzug von anderen Konten sind nicht möglich. 13 Nicht geschützt werden insbesondere Einlagen von finanziellen Unter- nehmen, staatlichen Stellen einschließlich kommunaler Gebietskörper- schaften, Einlagen, die im Zusammenhang mit Geldwäsche oder Terro- rismusfinanzierung entstanden sind, und Inhaberschuldverschreibungen. Im Fall von Gläubigern nach Buchstaben (b)(ii), (c)(ii) und (d)(ii) werden Einlagen mit einer Laufzeit von mehr als 12 Monaten sowie Verbindlich- keiten aus Schuldscheindarlehen, Namenschuldverschreibungen und vergleichbaren Schuldtiteln ausländischen Rechts nicht geschützt. Für Verbindlichkeiten von Banken, die bis zum Ablauf des 31. Dezember 2022 gemäß § 6 der am 18. November 2021 im Vereinsregister einge- tragenen Fassung des Statuts des Einlagensicherungsfonds gesichert wurden, besteht die Sicherung nach Maßgabe dieser Vorschrift fort. Nach dem 31. Dezember 2022 entfällt dieser Bestandsschutz, sobald die betreffende Verbindlichkeit fällig wird, gekündigt oder anderweitig zurückgefordert werden kann, oder wenn die Verbindlichkeit im Wege einer Einzel- oder Gesamtrechtsnachfolge übergeht oder auf eine ausländische Zweigniederlassung oder Zweigstelle übertragen wird. Einzelheiten zum Schutzumfang einschließlich der Sicherungsgrenzen sind im Statut des Einlagensicherungsfonds, insbesondere dessen § 6 geregelt. Das Statut wird auf Verlangen zur Verfügung gestellt und kann auch im Internet unter www.bankenverband.de aufgerufen werden. Forderungsübergang und Auskunftserteilung (4) Forderungsübergang Soweit der Einlagensicherungsfonds oder ein von ihm Beauftragter Zahlungen an einen Kunden leistet, gehen dessen Forderungen gegen die ING in entsprechender Höhe mit allen Nebenrechten Zug um Zug auf den Einlagensicherungsfonds über. (5) Auskunftserteilung Die ING ist befugt, dem Einlagensicherungsfonds oder einem von ihnen Beauftragten alle in diesem Zusammenhang erforderlichen Auskünfte zu erteilen und Unterlagen zur Verfügung zu stellen. 15. Pfandrecht Der Kontoinhaber und die ING sind sich darüber einig, dass der ING ein Pfand recht an dem Guthaben einschließlich aller Zinsen auf dem Extra- Konto zusteht. Das Pfandrecht dient der Sicherung aller bestehenden, künftigen und bedingten Ansprüche, die der ING mit sämtlichen ihrer in- und ausländischen Geschäftsstellen aus der bankmäßigen Geschäfts- beziehung gegen den Kontoinhaber zustehen. 16. Beschwerde- und Alternative Streitbeilegungs- verfahren Der Kunde hat folgende außergerichtliche Möglichkeiten: • Der Kunde kann sich mit einer Beschwerde an die Kontaktstelle der ING wenden: ING-DiBa AG, 60628 Frankfurt am Main oder unter: https://www.ing.de/kundenservice. • Die ING wird Beschwerden in geeigneter Weise beantworten, bei Zah- lungsdiensteverträgen erfolgt dies in Textform (zum Beispiel mittels Brief, Telefax oder E-Mail). • Die ING nimmt am Streitbeilegungsverfahren der Verbraucherschlich- tungsstelle Ombudsmann der privaten Banken“ (www.bankenombudsmann.de) teil.

Betrifft der Beschwerdegegenstand eine Streitigkeit Ober einen Zahlungsdienstevertrag (§ 675f des Bürger- lichen Gesetzbuches), können auch Kunden, die keine Verbraucher sind, den Ombudsmann der privaten Banken anrufen. Näheres regelt die „Verfahrensordnung für die Schlichtung von Kundenbeschwerden im deutschen Bankgewerbe“, die auf Wunsch zur Verfügung gestellt wird oder im Internet unter www.bankenverband.de abrufbar ist.

Information über die Einlagensicherung (1) Einlagen Einlagen sind Guthaben, die sich im Rahmen von Bankgeschäften aus Beträgen, die auf einem Konto verblieben sind, oder aus Zwischenposi- tionen ergeben und die nach den geltenden gesetzlichen und vertrag- lichen Bedingungen von der ING zurückzuzahlen sind, wie zum Beispiel Guthaben auf Girokonten, Festgelder, Spareinlagen, Sparbriefe und Namensschuldverschreibungen. Maßgeblich sind die Definitionen in § 2 Absatz 3 des Einlagensicherungsgesetzes (EinSiG) bzw. § 6 Absatz 1 des Statuts des innerhalb des Bundesverbandes deutscher Banken e.V. bestehenden Einlagensicherungsfonds deutscher Banken (Einlagen- sicherungsfonds). (2) Gesetzliche Einlagensicherung Die ING ist der Entschädigungseinrichtung deutscher Banken GmbH als Träger der gesetzliche Einlagensicherung der privaten Banken zugeordnet. Die gesetzliche Einlagensicherung schützt nach Maßgabe des EinSiG und vorbehaltlich der darin vorgesehenen Ausnahmen Einlagen bis zu einem Gegenwert von 100.000 € pro Einleger. In den in § 8 Absatz 2 EinSiG genannten Fällen erhöht sich dieser Betrag auf 500.000 €. Dazu gehören insbesondere Beträge, die aus Immobilientransaktionen im Zusammen- hang mit privat genutzten Wohnimmobilien resultieren. Nicht geschützt werden insbesondere Einlagen von finanziellen Unternehmen, staatli- chen Stellen einschließlich kommunaler Gebietskörperschaften, Einlagen, die im Zusammenhang mit Geldwäsche oder Terrorismusfinanzierung entstanden sind, und Inhaberschuldverschreibungen. Einzelheiten sind im EinSiG, insbesondere dessen § 8 geregelt. (3) Einlagensicherungsfonds Die ING wirkt außerdem am Einlagensicherungsfonds mit.

April 2014 über Einlagensicherungssysteme (ABl. L 173 vom 12.6.2014, S. 149; L 212 vom 18.7.2014, S. 47; L 309 vom 30.10.2014, S. 37) geschaffenen Einlagensicherungssysteme noch unter die gemäß der Richtlinie 97/9/EG des Europäischen Parlaments und des Rates vom 3. März 1997 über Systeme für die Entschädigung der Anleger (ABl. L 84 vom 26.3.1997, S. 22) geschaffenen Anlegerentschädigungssysteme fallen. 15 (b) der Kunde das Änderungsangebot der ING nicht vor dem vorge- schlagenen Zeitpunkt des Wirksamwerdens der Änderungen abge- lehnt hat. Die ING wird den Kunden im Änderungsangebot auf die Folgen seines Schweigens hinweisen. (2.4) Ausschluss der Zustimmungsfiktion Die Zustimmungsfiktion findet keine Anwendung • bei Änderungen der Nummern 1 Absatz 2 und 12 Absatz 5 der Geschäftsbedingungen und der entsprechenden Regelungen in den Sonderbedingungen oder • bei Änderungen, die die Hauptleistungspflichten des Vertrags und die Entgelte für Hauptleistungen betreffen, oder • bei Änderungen von Entgelten, die auf eine über das vereinbarte Ent- gelt für die Hauptleistung hinausgehende Zahlung des Verbrauchers gerichtet sind, oder • bei Änderungen, die dem Abschluss eines neuen Vertrags gleich- kommen, oder • bei Änderungen, die das bisher vereinbarte Verhältnis von Leistung und Gegenleistung erheblich zugunsten der ING verschieben würden. In diesen Fällen wird die ING die Zustimmung des Kunden zu den Ände- rungen auf andere Weise einholen. (2.5) Kündigungsrecht des Kunden bei der Zustimmungsfiktion Macht die ING von der Zustimmungsfiktion Gebrauch, kann der Kunde den von der Änderung betroffenen Vertrag vor dem vorgeschlagenen Zeitpunkt des Wirksamwerdens der Änderungen auch fristlos und kosten- frei kündigen. Auf dieses Kündigungsrecht wird die ING den Kunden in ihrem Änderungsangebot besonders hinweisen. 2. Bankgeheimnis und Bankauskunft (1) Bankgeheimnis Die ING ist zur Verschwiegenheit über alle kundenbezogenen Tatsachen und Wertungen verpflichtet, von denen sie Kenntnis erlangt (Bankge- heimnis). Informationen über den Kunden darf die ING nur weitergeben, wenn gesetzliche Bestimmungen dies gebieten oder der Kunde einge- willigt hat oder die ING zur Erteilung einer Bankauskunft befugt ist. (2) Bankauskunft Eine Bankauskunft enthält allgemein gehaltene Feststellungen und Bemerkungen über die wirtschaftlichen Verhältnisse des Kunden, seine Kreditwürdigkeit und Zahlungsfähigkeit; betragsmäßige Angaben über Kontostände, Sparguthaben, Depot- oder sonstige der ING anvertraute Vermögenswerte sowie Angaben über die Höhe von Kredit- inanspruchnahmen werden nicht gemacht. (3) Voraussetzungen für die Erteilung einer Bankauskunft Die ING ist befugt, über juristische Personen und im Handelsregister ein- getragene Kaufleute Bankauskünfte zu erteilen, sofern sich die Anfrage auf ihre geschäftliche Tätigkeit bezieht. Die ING erteilt jedoch keine Auskünfte, wenn ihr eine anderslautende Weisung des Kunden vorliegt. Bankauskünfte über andere Personen, insbesondere über Privatkunden und Vereinigungen, erteilt die ING nur dann, wenn diese generell oder im Einzelfall ausdrücklich zugestimmt haben. Eine Bankauskunft wird nur erteilt, wenn der Anfragende ein berechtigtes Interesse an der Allgemeine Geschäfts- bedingungen 1. Geltungsbereich und Änderungen dieser Geschäftsbedingungen und der Sonder- bedingungen für einzelne Geschäftsbeziehungen (1) Geltungsbereich Die Allgemeinen Geschäftsbedingungen gelten für die gesamte Geschäfts- verbindung zwischen dem Kunden und den inländischen Geschäfts- stellen der ING-DiBa AG (im Folgenden ING genannt). Daneben gelten für einzelne Geschäftsbeziehungen (z. B. für das Wertpapiergeschäft, für den kartengestützten Zahlungsverkehr, für den Scheckverkehr, für den Sparver kehr, für den Überweisungsverkehr) Sonderbedingungen, die Abweichungen oder Ergänzungen zu diesen Allgemeinen Geschäftsbe- dingungen enthalten; sie werden bei der Kontoeröffnung oder bei Ertei- lung eines Auftrags mit dem Kunden vereinbart. Unterhält der Kunde auch Geschäftsverbindungen zu ausländischen Geschäftsstellen, sichert das Pfandrecht der ING (Nr. 14 dieser Geschäftsbedingungen) auch die Ansprüche dieser ausländischen Geschäftsstellen. (2) Änderungen (2.1) Änderungsangebot Änderungen dieser Geschäftsbedingungen und der Sonderbedingungen werden dem Kunden spätestens zwei Monate vor dem vorgeschlagenen Zeitpunkt ihres Wirksamwerdens in Textform angeboten. Hat der Kunde mit der ING im Rahmen der Geschäftsbeziehung einen elektronischen Kommunikationsweg vereinbart (zum Beispiel das Internetbanking), können die Änderungen auch auf diesem Wege angeboten werden. (2.2) Annahme durch den Kunden Die von der ING angebotenen Änderungen werden nur wirksam, wenn der Kunde diese annimmt, gegebenenfalls im Wege der nachfolgend geregelten Zustimmungsfiktion. (2.3) Annahme durch den Kunden im Wege der Zustimmungsfiktion Das Schweigen des Kunden gilt nur dann als Annahme des Änderungs- angebots (Zustimmungsfiktion), wenn (a) das Änderungsangebot der ING erfolgt, um die Übereinstimmung der vertraglichen Bestimmungen mit einer veränderten Rechts- lage wieder herzustellen, weil eine Bestimmung dieser Geschäfts- bedingungen oder der Sonderbedingungen - aufgrund einer Änderung von Gesetzen, einschließlich unmittel- bar geltender Rechtsvorschriften der Europäischen Union, nicht mehr der Rechtslage entspricht oder - durch eine rechtskräftige gerichtliche Entscheidung, auch durch ein Gericht erster Instanz, unwirksam wird oder nicht mehr ver- wendet werden darf oder - aufgrund einer verbindlichen Verfügung einer für die ING zustän- digen nationalen oder internationalen Behörde (z. B. der Bundes- anstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht oder der Europäischen Zentralbank) nicht mehr mit den aufsichtsrechtlichen Verpflich- tungen der ING in Einklang zu bringen ist, und Abschnitt 3 Widerrufsfolgen Im Fall eines wirksamen Widerrufs sind die beiderseits empfangenen Leistungen zurückzugewähren. Sie sind zur Zahlung von Wertersatz für die bis zum Widerruf erbrachte Dienstleistung verpflichtet, wenn Sie vor Abgabe Ihrer Vertragserklärung auf diese Rechtsfolge hingewiesen wurden und ausdrücklich zugestimmt haben, dass vor dem Ende der Widerrufsfrist mit der Ausführung der Gegenleistung begonnen werden kann. Besteht eine Verpflichtung zur Zahlung von Wertersatz, kann dies dazu führen, dass Sie die vertraglichen Zahlungsverpflichtungen für den Zeitraum bis zum Widerruf dennoch erfüllen müssen. Ihr Widerrufsrecht erlischt vorzeitig, wenn der Vertrag von beiden Seiten auf Ihren ausdrücklichen Wunsch vollständig erfüllt ist, bevor Sie Ihr Widerrufsrecht ausgeübt haben. Verpflichtungen zur Erstattung von Zahlungen müssen innerhalb von 30 Tagen erfüllt werden. Diese Frist beginnt für Sie mit der Absendung Ihrer Widerrufserklärung, für uns mit deren Empfang. Besondere Hinweise Bei Widerruf dieses Vertrags sind Sie auch an einen mit diesem Vertrag zusammenhängenden Vertrag nicht mehr gebunden, wenn der zusammen- hängende Vertrag eine Leistung betrifft, die von uns oder einem Dritten auf der Grundlage einer Vereinbarung zwischen uns und dem Dritten erbracht wird. Ende der Widerrufsbelehrung 16 oder bei einem anderen zuständigen Gericht verklagen; dasselbe gilt für eine juristische Person des öffentlichen Rechts und für öffentlich-recht- liche Sondervermögen. Die ING selbst kann von diesen Kunden nur an dem für die konto führende Stelle zuständigen Gericht verklagt werden. (3) Gerichtsstand für Auslandskunden Die Gerichtsstandsvereinbarung gilt auch für Kunden, die im Ausland eine vergleichbare gewerbliche Tätigkeit ausüben, sowie für ausländische Institutionen, die mit inländischen juristischen Personen des öffentlichen Rechts oder mit einem inländischen öffentlich-rechtlichen Sonder- vermögen vergleichbar sind. 7. Rechnungsabschlüsse bei Kontokorrentkonten (Konten in laufender Rechnung); Genehmigung von Belastungen aus Lastschriften (1) Erteilung der Rechnungsabschlüsse Die ING erteilt bei einem Kontokorrentkonto, sofern nicht etwas anderes vereinbart ist, jeweils zum Ende eines Kalenderquartals einen Rech- nungsabschluss; dabei werden die in diesem Zeitraum entstandenen beiderseitigen Ansprüche (einschließlich der Zinsen und Entgelte der ING) verrechnet. Die ING kann auf den Saldo, der sich aus Verrechnung ergibt, nach Nr. 12 dieser Geschäftsbedingungen oder nach der mit dem Kunden anderweitig getroffenen Vereinbarung Zinsen berechnen. (2) Frist für Einwendungen; Genehmigung durch Schweigen Einwendungen wegen Unrichtigkeit oder Unvollständigkeit eines Rech- nungsabschlusses hat der Kunde spätestens vor Ablauf von 6 Wochen nach dessen Zugang zu erheben; macht er seine Einwendungen in Text- form geltend, genügt die Absendung innerhalb der 6-Wochen-Frist. Das Unterlassen rechtzeitiger Einwendungen gilt als Genehmigung. Auf diese Folge wird die ING bei Erteilung des Rechnungsabschlusses beson- ders hinweisen. Der Kunde kann auch nach Fristablauf eine Berichtigung des Rechnungsabschlusses verlangen, muss dann aber beweisen, dass sein Konto zu Unrecht belastet oder eine ihm zustehende Gutschrift nicht erteilt wurde. 8. Storno- und Berichtigungsbuchungen der ING (1) Vor Rechnungsabschluss Fehlerhafte Gutschriften auf Kontokorrentkonten (z. B. wegen einer falschen Kontonummer) darf die ING bis zum nächsten Rechnungsab- schluss durch eine Belastungsbuchung rückgängig machen, soweit ihr ein Rückzahlungsanspruch gegen den Kunden zusteht (Stornobuchung); der Kunde kann in diesem Fall gegen die Belastungsbuchung nicht einwenden, dass er in Höhe der Gutschrift bereits verfügt hat. (2) Nach Rechnungsabschluss Stellt die ING eine fehlerhafte Gutschrift erst nach einem Rechnungs- abschluss fest und steht ihr ein Rückzahlungsanspruch gegen den Kunden zu, so wird sie in Höhe ihres Anspruchs sein Konto belasten (Berich tigungsbuchung). Erhebt der Kunde gegen die Berichtigungs- buchung Einwendungen, so wird die ING den Betrag dem Konto wieder gutschreiben und ihren Rückzahlungsanspruch gesondert geltend machen. (3) Information des Kunden; Zinsberechnung Über Storno- und Berichtigungsbuchungen wird die ING den Kunden unverzüglich unterrichten. Die Buchungen nimmt die ING hinsichtlich der Zinsberechnung rückwirkend zu dem Tag vor, an dem die fehler- hafte Buchung durchgeführt wurde. 9. Einzugsaufträge (1) Erteilung von Vorbehaltsgutschriften bei der Einreichung Schreibt die ING den Gegenwert von Schecks und Lastschriften schon vor ihrer Einlösung gut, geschieht dies unter dem Vorbehalt ihrer Ein- lösung, und zwar auch dann, wenn diese Papiere bei der ING selbst zahl- bar sind. Reicht der Kunde andere Papiere mit dem Auftrag ein, von einem Zahlungspflichtigen einen Forderungsbetrag zu beschaffen (z. B. Zinsscheine), und erteilt die ING über den Betrag eine Gutschrift, so steht diese unter dem Vorbehalt, dass die ING den Betrag erhält. Der Vor- behalt gilt auch dann, wenn die Papiere bei der ING selbst zahlbar sind. Werden Schecks oder Lastschriften nicht eingelöst oder erhält die ING den Betrag aus dem Einzugsauftrag nicht, macht die ING die Vorbehalts- gewünschten Auskunft glaubhaft dargelegt hat und kein Grund zu der Annahme besteht, dass schutzwürdige Belange des Kunden der Auskunftserteilung entgegenstehen. (4) Empfänger von Bankauskünften Bankauskünfte erteilt die ING nur eigenen Kunden sowie anderen Kredit- instituten für deren Zwecke oder die ihrer Kunden. 3. Haftung der ING; Mitverschulden des Kunden (1) Haftungsgrundsätze Die ING haftet bei der Erfüllung ihrer Verpflichtungen für jedes Verschul- den ihrer Mitarbeiter und der Personen, die sie zur Erfüllung ihrer Verpflichtungen hinzuzieht. Soweit die Sonderbedingungen für einzelne Geschäfts beziehun gen oder sonstige Vereinbarungen etwas Abwei- chendes regeln, gehen diese Regelungen vor. Hat der Kunde durch ein schuldhaftes Verhalten (z. B. durch Verletzung der in Nr. 11 dieser Geschäftsbedingungen aufgeführten Mitwir kungspflichten) zu der Ent- stehung eines Schadens bei getragen, bestimmt sich nach den Grund- sätzen des Mitverschuldens, in welchem Umfang die ING und der Kunde den Schaden zu tragen haben. (2) Weitergeleitete Aufträge Wenn ein Auftrag seinem Inhalt nach typischerweise in der Form ausge- führt wird, dass die ING einen Dritten mit der weiteren Erledigung betraut, erfüllt die ING den Auftrag dadurch, dass sie ihn im eigenen Namen an den Dritten weiterleitet (weitergeleiteter Auftrag). Dies betrifft z. B. die Ein ho lung von Bankauskünften bei anderen Kreditinstitu- ten oder die Verwahrung und Verwaltung von Wertpapieren im Ausland. In diesen Fällen beschränkt sich die Haftung der ING auf die sorgfältige Auswahl und Unterweisung des Dritten. (3) Störung des Betriebs Die ING haftet nicht für Schäden, die durch höhere Gewalt, Aufruhr, Kriegs- und Naturereignisse oder durch sonstige von ihr nicht zu ver tretende Vorkommnisse (z. B. Streik, Aussperrung, Verkehrsstörung, Ver fügungen von hoher Hand im In- und Ausland) eintreten. 4. Grenzen der Aufrechnungsbefugnis des Kunden, der kein Verbraucher ist Ein Kunde, der kein Verbraucher ist, kann gegen Forderungen der ING nur aufrechnen, wenn seine Forderungen unbestritten oder rechts- kräftig festgestellt sind. Diese Aufrechnungsbeschränkung gilt nicht für eine vom Kunden zur Aufrechnung gestellte Forderung, die ihren Rechts- grund in einem Darlehen oder einer Finanzierungshilfe gemäß §§ 513, 491 bis 512 BGB hat. 5. Verfügungsberechtigung nach dem Tod des Kunden Nach dem Tod des Kunden hat derjenige, der sich gegenüber der ING auf die Rechtsnachfolge des Kunden beruft, der ING seine erbrechtliche Berechtigung in geeigneter Weise nachzuweisen. Wird der ING eine Ausfertigung oder eine beglaubigte Abschrift der letztwilligen Verfügung (Testament, Erbvertrag) nebst zugehöriger Eröffnungsniederschrift vorgelegt, darf die ING denjenigen, der darin als Erbe oder Testaments- vollstrecker bezeichnet ist, als Berechtigten ansehen, ihn verfügen lassen und insbesondere mit befreiender Wirkung an ihn leisten. Dies gilt nicht, wenn der ING bekannt ist, dass der dort Genannte (zum Beispiel nach Anfechtung oder wegen Nichtigkeit des Testaments) nicht verfügungsberechtigt ist, oder wenn ihr dies infolge Fahrlässigkeit nicht bekannt geworden ist. 6. Maßgebliches Recht und Gerichtsstand bei kauf- männischen und öffentlich-rechtlichen Kunden (1) Geltung deutschen Rechts Für die Geschäftsverbindungen zwischen dem Kunden und der ING gilt deutsches Recht. (2) Gerichtsstand für Inlandskunden Ist der Kunde ein Kaufmann und ist die streitige Geschäftsbeziehung dem Betrieb seines Handelsgewerbes zuzurechnen, so kann die ING die- sen Kunden an dem für die kontoführende Stelle zuständigen Gericht 17 (3) Besonderer Hinweis bei Eilbedürftigkeit der Ausführung einesAuftrags Hält der Kunde bei der Ausführung eines Auftrags besondere Eile für nötig, hat er dies der ING gesondert mitzuteilen. Bei formularmäßig erteilten Aufträgen muss dies außerhalb des Formulars erfolgen. (4) Prüfung und Einwendungen bei Mitteilungen der ING Der Kunde hat Kontoauszüge, Wertpapierabrechnungen, Depot- und Erträgnisaufstellungen, sonstige Abrechnungen, Anzeigen über die Aus- führung von Aufträgen und Überweisungen sowie Informationen über erwartete Zahlungen und Sendungen (Avise) auf ihre Richtigkeit und Vollständigkeit unverzüglich zu überprüfen und etwaige Einwendungen unverzüglich zu erheben. (5) Benachrichtigung der ING bei Ausbleiben von Mitteilungen Falls Rechnungsabschlüsse und Depotaufstellungen dem Kunden nicht zu gehen, muss er die ING unverzüglich benachrichtigen. Die Benach- richtigungspflicht besteht auch beim Ausbleiben anderer Mitteilungen, deren Eingang der Kunde erwartet (Wertpapierabrechnungen, Konto- auszüge nach der Ausführung von Aufträgen des Kunden oder über Zahlungen, die der Kunde erwartet). (6) Weitere Mitteilungspflichten Die ING stellt gemäß den Anforderungen aus dem Geldwäschegesetz sicher, dass Dokumente, Daten und Informationen über Kunden und wirtschaftlich Berechtigte, über deren Geschäftstätigkeit und – soweit erforderlich – über die Herkunft der Vermögenswerte (nachfolgend „Kundendaten“) in angemessenen zeitlichen Abständen aktualisiert werden. Informationen zur Herkunft der Vermögenswerte umfassen auch Angaben zum Beschäftigungsstatus (z.B. angestellt, selbstständig, in Rente) und zur Branche, in der die berufliche Tätigkeit ausgeübt wird (z.B. Handel, Baugewerbe, öffentlicher Dienst). Um die Kundendaten aktuell halten zu können, erteilt der Kunde – nach ausdrücklicher Aufforderung der ING – zum Zwecke der Geldwäsche- prävention Auskunft darüber, ob und ggf. wie sich die vorhandenen Kunden daten geändert haben. Die ING ist berechtigt, vom Kunden geeignete Nachweise anzufordern. Zusätzlich zu den Mitteilungspflichten gemäß Absatz 1 hat der Kunde der ING jede Änderung seiner Staatsangehörigkeit, seiner Telefon- nummer sowie seiner E-Mail-Adresse unverzüglich mitzuteilen. 12. Zinsen, Entgelte und Aufwendungen (1) Zinsen und Entgelte im Geschäft mit Verbrauchern Die Höhe der Zinsen und Entgelte für die üblichen Bankleistungen, die die ING gegenüber Verbrauchern erbringt, einschließlich der Höhe von Zahlungen, die über die für die Hauptleistung vereinbarten Entgelte hinausgehen, ergeben sich aus dem „Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnis“. Wenn ein Verbraucher eine dort aufgeführte Hauptleistung in Anspruch nimmt und dabei keine abweichende Vereinbarung getroffen wurde, gelten die zu diesem Zeitpunkt im Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnis ange- gebenen Zinsen und Entgelte. Eine Vereinbarung, die auf eine über das vereinbarte Entgelt für die Hauptleistung hinausgehende Zahlung des Verbrauchers gerichtet ist, kann die ING mit dem Verbraucher nur aus- drücklich treffen, wenn sie im Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnis ausgewie- sen ist. Für die Vergütung der nicht im Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnis aufgeführten Leistungen, die im Auftrag des Verbrauchers erbracht werden und die, nach den Umständen zu urteilen, nur gegen eine Vergü- tung zu erwarten sind, gelten, soweit keine andere Vereinbarung getroffen wurde, die gesetzlichen Vorschriften. (2) Zinsen und Entgelte im Geschäft mit Kunden, die keine Verbraucher sind Die Höhe der Zinsen und Entgelte für die üblichen Bankleistungen, die die ING gegenüber Kunden, die keine Verbraucher sind, erbringt, ergeben sich aus dem „Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnis“, soweit das Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnis übliche Bankleistungen gegenüber Kunden, die keine Verbraucher sind (z. B. Geschäftskunden), ausweisen. Wenn ein Kunde, der kein Verbraucher ist, eine dort aufgeführte Bankleistung in Anspruch nimmt und dabei keine abweichende Vereinbarung getrof- fen wurde, gelten die zu diesem Zeitpunkt im Preis- und Leistungs- verzeichnis angegebenen Zinsen und Entgelte. gutschrift rückgängig. Dies geschieht unabhängig davon, ob in der Zwischen zeit ein Rechnungsabschluss erteilt wurde. (2) Einlösung von Lastschriften und vom Kunden ausgestellten Schecks Lastschriften sowie Schecks sind eingelöst, wenn die Belastungsbuchung nicht spätestens am zweiten Geschäftstag nach ihrer Vornahme rück- gängig gemacht wird. Barschecks sind bereits mit Zahlung an den Scheckvorleger eingelöst. Schecks sind auch schon dann eingelöst, wenn die ING im Einzelfall eine Bezahltmeldung absendet. Schecks, die über die Abrechnungsstelle der Bundesbank vorgelegt werden, sind eingelöst, wenn sie nicht bis zu dem von der Bundesbank festgesetzten Zeitpunkt zurück ge geben werden. 10. Fremdwährungsgeschäfte und Risiken bei Fremdwährungskonten (1) Auftragsausführung bei Fremdwährungskonten Fremdwährungskonten des Kunden dienen dazu, Zahlungen an den Kunden und Verfügungen des Kunden in fremder Währung bargeldlos abzuwickeln. Verfügungen über Guthaben auf Fremdwährungskonten (z. B. durch Überweisungen zulasten des Fremdwährungsguthabens) werden unter Einschaltung von Banken im Heimatland der Währung abgewickelt, wenn sie die ING nicht vollständig innerhalb des eigenen Hauses ausführt. (2) Gutschriften bei Fremdwährungsgeschäften mit dem Kunden Schließt die ING mit dem Kunden ein Geschäft (z. B. ein Devisentermin- geschäft) ab, aus dem sie die Verschaffung eines Betrags in fremder Währung schuldet, wird sie ihre Fremdwährungsverbindlichkeit durch Gutschrift auf dem Konto des Kunden in dieser Währung erfüllen, sofern nicht etwas anderes vereinbart ist. (3) Vorübergehende Beschränkung der Leistung durch die ING Die Verpflichtung der ING zur Ausführung einer Verfügung zulasten eines Fremdwährungsguthabens (Abs. 1) oder zur Erfüllung einer Fremdwährungsverbindlichkeit (Abs. 2) ist in dem Umfang und so lange ausgesetzt, wie die ING in der Währung, auf die das Fremdwährungs- guthaben oder die -verbindlichkeit lautet, wegen politisch bedingter Maßnahmen oder Ereignisse im Lande dieser Währung nicht oder nur eingeschränkt verfügen kann. In dem Umfang und solange diese Maß- nahmen oder Ereignisse andauern, ist die ING auch nicht zu einer Erfül- lung an einem anderen Ort außerhalb des Landes der Währung, in einer anderen Währung (auch nicht in Euro) oder durch Anschaffung von Bargeld verpflichtet. Die Verpflichtung der ING zur Ausführung einer Ver- fügung zulasten eines Fremdwährungsguthabens ist dagegen nicht ausgesetzt, wenn sie die ING vollständig im eigenen Haus ausführen kann. Das Recht des Kunden und der ING, fällige gegenseitige Forderun- gen in derselben Währung miteinander zu verrechnen, bleibt von den vorstehenden Regelungen unberührt. (4) Umrechnungskurs Die Bestimmung des Wechselkurses bei Fremdwährungsgeschäften ergibt sich aus dem Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnis. Bei Zahlungsdiens- ten gilt ergänzend der Zahlungsdiensterahmenvertrag. 11. Mitwirkungspflichten des Kunden (1) Mitteilung von Änderungen Zur ordnungsgemäßen Abwicklung des Geschäftsverkehrs ist es erfor- derlich, dass der Kunde der ING Änderungen seines Namens und seiner Anschrift sowie das Erlöschen oder die Änderung einer gegenüber der ING erteilten Vertretungsmacht (insbesondere einer Vollmacht) unver- züglich mitteilt. Diese Mitteilungspflicht besteht auch dann, wenn die Vertretungsmacht in ein öffentliches Register (z. B. in das Handels re- gister) eingetragen ist und ihr Erlöschen oder ihre Änderung in dieses Register eingetragen wird. Darüber hinaus können sich weiter gehende gesetzliche Mitteilungspflichten, insbesondere aus dem Geldwäsche- gesetz, ergeben. (2) Klarheit von Aufträgen Aufträge müssen ihren Inhalt zweifelsfrei erkennen lassen. Nicht ein- deutig formulierte Aufträge können Rückfragen zur Folge haben, die zu Verzögerungen führen können. Vor allem hat der Kunde bei Aufträgen auf die Richtigkeit und Vollständigkeit seiner Angaben, insbesondere der Kontonummer und Bankleitzahl oder IBAN1 und BIC2 sowie der Währung, zu achten. Änderungen, Bestätigungen oder Wiederholungen von Aufträgen müssen als solche gekennzeichnet sein. 1 International Bank Account Number (Internationale Bankkontonummer). 2 Bank Identifier Code (Bankcode). 18 Der Besicherungsanspruch der ING besteht nicht, wenn ausdrücklich vereinbart ist, dass der Kunde keine oder ausschließlich im Einzelnen benannte Sicherheiten zu bestellen hat. Bei Verbraucherdarlehens- verträgen besteht der Anspruch auf die Bestellung oder Verstärkung von Sicher heiten nur, soweit die Sicherheiten im Kreditvertrag angegeben sind. Übersteigt der Nettodarlehensbetrag 75.000 Euro, besteht der Anspruch auf Bestellung oder Verstärkung auch dann, wenn in einem vor dem 21. März 2016 abgeschlossenen Verbraucherdarlehensvertrag oder in einem ab dem 21. März 2016 abgeschlossenen Allgemein-Ver- braucherdarlehensvertrag im Sinne von § 491 Absatz 2 BGB keine oder keine abschließenden Angaben über Sicherheiten enthalten sind. (3) Fristsetzung für die Bestellung oder Verstärkung von Sicherheiten Für die Bestellung oder Verstärkung von Sicherheiten wird die ING eine angemessene Frist einräumen. Beabsichtigt die ING, von ihrem Recht zur fristlosen Kündigung nach Nummer 19 Absatz 3 dieser Geschäfts- bedingungen Gebrauch zu machen, falls der Kunde seiner Verpflichtung zur Bestellung oder Verstärkung von Sicherheiten nicht fristgerecht nachkommt, wird sie ihn zuvor hierauf hinweisen. 14. Vereinbarung eines Pfandrechts zugunsten der ING (1) Einigung über das Pfandrecht Der Kunde und die ING sind sich darüber einig, dass die ING ein Pfand- recht an den Wertpapieren und Sachen erwirbt, an denen eine inlän- dische Geschäfts stelle im bankmäßigen Geschäftsverkehr Besitz erlangt hat oder noch erlangen wird. Die ING erwirbt ein Pfandrecht auch an den Ansprüchen, die dem Kunden gegen die ING aus der bankmäßigen Geschäftsverbindung zustehen oder künftig zustehen werden (z. B. Kontoguthaben). (2) Gesicherte Ansprüche Das Pfandrecht dient der Sicherung aller bestehenden, künftigen und beding ten Ansprüche, die der ING mit ihren sämtlichen in- und auslän- dischen Geschäftsstellen aus der bankmäßigen Geschäftsverbindung gegen den Kunden zustehen. Hat der Kunde gegenüber der ING eine Haftung für Verbindlichkeiten eines anderen Kunden der ING übernom- men (z. B. als Bürge), so sichert das Pfandrecht die aus der Haftungs- übernahme folgende Schuld jedoch erst ab ihrer Fälligkeit. (3) Ausnahmen vom Pfandrecht Gelangen Gelder oder andere Werte mit der Maßgabe in die Verfügungs- gewalt der ING, dass sie nur für einen bestimmten Zweck verwendet werden dürfen (z. B. Bareinzahlung zur Einlösung eines Wechsels), erstreckt sich das Pfandrecht der ING nicht auf diese Werte. Dasselbe gilt für die von der ING selbst ausgegebenen Aktien (eigene Aktien) und für die Wertpapiere, die die ING im Ausland für den Kunden verwahrt. Außerdem erstreckt sich das Pfandrecht nicht auf die von der ING selbst ausgegebenen eigenen Genussrechte/Genussscheine und nicht auf die verbrieften und nicht verbrieften nachrangigen Verbindlichkeiten der ING. (4) Zins- und Gewinnanteilscheine Unterliegen dem Pfandrecht der ING Wertpapiere, ist der Kunde nicht berechtigt, die Herausgabe der zu diesen Papieren gehörenden Zins- und Gewinnanteilscheine zu verlangen. 15. Sicherungsrechte bei Einzugspapieren und diskontierten Wechseln (1) Sicherungsübereignung Die ING erwirbt an den ihr zum Einzug eingereichten Schecks und Wech- seln im Zeitpunkt der Einreichung Sicherungseigentum. An diskontierten Wechseln erwirbt die ING im Zeitpunkt des Wechselankaufs unein- geschränktes Eigentum; belastet sie diskontierte Wechsel dem Konto zurück, so verbleibt ihr das Sicherungseigentum an diesen Wechseln. (2) Sicherungsabtretung Mit dem Erwerb des Eigentums an Schecks und Wechseln gehen auch die zugrunde liegenden Forderungen auf die ING über; ein Forderungs- übergang findet ferner statt, wenn andere Papiere zum Einzug einge- reicht werden (z. B. Lastschriften, kaufmännische Handelspapiere). (3) Zweckgebundene Einzugspapiere Werden der ING Einzugspapiere mit der Maßgabe eingereicht, dass ihr Gegen wert nur für einen bestimmten Zweck verwendet werden darf, erstrecken sich die Sicherungsübereignung und die Sicherungsabtretung nicht auf diese Papiere. Im Übrigen bestimmt die ING, sofern keine andere Vereinbarung getroffen wurde und gesetzliche Bestimmungen dem nicht entgegenstehen, die Höhe von Zinsen und Entgelten nach billigem Ermessen (§ 315 des Bürger lichen Gesetzbuchs). (3) Nicht entgeltfähige Leistungen Für eine Leistung, zu deren Erbringung die ING kraft Gesetzes oder auf- grund einer vertraglichen Nebenpflicht verpflichtet ist oder die sie im eigenen Interesse wahrnimmt, wird die ING kein Entgelt berechnen, es sei denn, es ist gesetzlich zulässig und wird nach Maßgabe der gesetz- lichen Regelung erhoben. (4) Änderung von Zinsen; Kündigungsrecht des Kunden bei Erhöhung Die Änderung der Zinsen bei Krediten mit einem veränderlichen Zinssatz erfolgt aufgrund der jeweiligen Kreditvereinbarung mit dem Kunden. Die ING wird dem Kunden Änderungen von Zinsen mitteilen. Bei einer Erhöhung kann der Kunde, sofern nichts anderes vereinbart ist, die davon betroffene Kreditvereinbarung innerhalb von 6 Wochen nach der Bekanntgabe der Änderung mit sofortiger Wirkung kündigen. Kündigt der Kunde, so werden die erhöhten Zinsen für die gekündigte Kreditver- einbarung nicht zugrunde gelegt. Die ING wird zur Abwicklung eine angemessene Frist einräumen. (5) Änderungen von Entgelten bei typischerweise dauerhaft in Anspruch genommenen Leistungen Änderungen von Entgelten für Bankleistungen, die von Kunden im Rah- men der Geschäftsverbindung typischerweise dauerhaft in Anspruch genommen werden (zum Beispiel Konto- und Depotführung), werden dem Kunden spätestens zwei Monate vor dem vorgeschlagenen Zeit- punkt ihres Wirksamwerdens in Textform angeboten. Hat der Kunde mit der ING im Rahmen der Geschäftsbeziehung einen elektronischen Kom- munikationsweg vereinbart (zum Beispiel das Internetbanking), können die Änderungen auch auf diesem Wege angeboten werden. Die von der ING angebotenen Änderungen werden nur wirksam, wenn der Kunde diese annimmt. Eine Vereinbarung über die Änderung eines Entgelts, das auf eine über die Hauptleistung hinausgehende Zahlung eines Ver- brauchers gerichtet ist, kann die ING mit dem Verbraucher nur aus- drücklich treffen. (6) Ersatz von Aufwendungen Ein möglicher Anspruch der ING auf Ersatz von Aufwendungen richtet sich nach den gesetzlichen Vorschriften. (7) Besonderheiten bei Verbraucherdarlehensverträgen und Zahlungs- diensteverträgen mit Verbrauchern für Zahlungen Bei Verbraucherdarlehensverträgen und Zahlungsdiensteverträgen mit Verbrauchern für Zahlungen richten sich die Zinsen und die Kosten (Entgelte und Auslagen) nach den jeweiligen vertraglichen Vereinbarun- gen und Sonderbedingungen sowie ergänzend nach den gesetzlichen Vorschriften. 13. Sicherheiten für die Ansprüche der Bank gegen den Kunden (1) Anspruch der ING auf Bestellung von Sicherheiten Die ING kann für alle Ansprüche aus der bankmäßigen Geschäfts- verbindung die Bestellung bankmäßiger Sicherheiten verlangen, und zwar auch dann, wenn die Ansprüche bedingt sind (zum Beispiel Aufwendungsersatzanspruch wegen der Inanspruchnahme aus einer für den Kunden übernommenen Bürgschaft). Hat der Kunde gegenüber der ING eine Haftung für Verbindlichkeiten eines anderen Kunden der ING übernommen (zum Beispiel als Bürge), so besteht für die ING ein Anspruch auf Bestellung oder Verstärkung von Sicherheiten im Hinblick auf die aus der Haftungsübernahme folgende Schuld jedoch erst ab ihrer Fälligkeit. (2) Veränderungen des Risikos Hat die ING bei der Entstehung von Ansprüchen gegen den Kunden zunächst ganz oder teilweise davon abgesehen, die Bestellung oder Verstärkung von Sicherheiten zu verlangen, kann sie auch später noch eine Besicherung fordern. Voraussetzung hierfür ist jedoch, dass Umstände eintreten oder bekannt werden, die eine erhöhte Risikobe- wertung der Ansprüche gegen den Kunden rechtfertigen. Dies kann insbesondere der Fall sein, wenn sich die wirtschaftlichen Verhältnisse des Kunden nachteilig verändert haben oder sich zu verändern drohen oder sich die vorhandenen Sicherheiten wertmäßig verschlechtert haben oder zu verschlechtern drohen. 19 19. Kündigungsrechte der ING (1) Kündigung unter Einhaltung einer Kündigungsfrist Die ING kann die gesamte Geschäftsverbindung oder einzelne Geschäfts- beziehungen, für die weder eine Laufzeit noch eine abweichende Kün- digungsregelung vereinbart ist, jederzeit unter Einhaltung einer angemes- senen Kündigungsfrist kündigen (zum Beispiel den Scheckvertrag, der zur Nutzung von Scheckvordrucken berechtigt). Bei der Bemessung der Kündigungsfrist wird die ING auf die berechtigten Belange des Kunden Rücksicht nehmen. Für die Kündigung eines Zahlungsdiensterahmen- vertrags (z. B. laufendes Konto oder Kartenvertrag) und eines Depots beträgt die Kündigungsfrist mindestens 2 Monate. (2) Kündigung unbefristeter Kredite Kredite und Kreditzusagen, für die weder eine Laufzeit noch eine abwei- chende Kündigungsregelung vereinbart ist, kann die ING jederzeit ohne Einhaltung einer Kündigungsfrist kündigen. Die ING wird bei der Aus- übung dieses Kündigungsrechts auf die berechtigten Belange des Kunden Rücksicht nehmen. Soweit das Bürgerliche Gesetzbuch Sonderrege- lungen für die Kündigung eines Verbraucherdarlehensvertrags vorsieht, kann die ING nur nach Maßgabe dieser Regelungen kündigen. (3) Kündigung aus wichtigem Grund ohne Einhaltung einer Kündigungsfrist Eine fristlose Kündigung der gesamten Geschäftsverbindung oder ein- zelner Geschäftsbeziehungen ist zulässig, wenn ein wichtiger Grund vorliegt, der der ING deren Fortsetzung auch unter Berücksichtigung der berechtigten Belange des Kunden unzumutbar werden lässt. Ein wich- tiger Grund liegt insbesondere vor, • wenn der Kunde unrichtige Angaben über seine Vermögensverhält- nisse gemacht hat, die für die Entscheidung der ING über eine Kredit- gewährung oder über andere mit Risiken für die ING verbundene Geschäfte (z. B. Aushändigung einer Zahlungskarte) von erheblicher Bedeutung waren; bei Verbraucherdarlehen gilt dies nur, wenn der Kunde für die Kreditwürdigkeitsprüfung relevante Informationen wissentlich vorenthalten oder diese gefälscht hat und dies zu einem Mangel der Kreditwürdigkeitsprüfung geführt hat, oder • wenn eine wesentliche Verschlechterung der Vermögensverhältnisse des Kunden oder der Werthaltigkeit einer Sicherheit eintritt oder einzutreten droht und dadurch die Rückzahlung des Darlehens oder die Erfüllung einer sonstigen Verbindlichkeit gegenüber der ING – auch unter Verwertung einer hierfür bestehenden Sicherheit – gefährdet ist oder • wenn der Kunde seiner Verpflichtung zur Bestellung oder Verstärkung von Sicherheiten nach Nummer 13 Absatz 2 dieser Geschäfts- bedingungen oder aufgrund einer sonstigen Vereinbarung nicht inner- halb der von der ING gesetzten angemessenen Frist nachkommt. Besteht der wichtige Grund in der Verletzung einer vertraglichen Pflicht, ist die Kündigung erst nach erfolglosem Ablauf einer zur Abhilfe bestimmten angemessenen Frist oder nach erfolgloser Abmahnung zulässig, es sei denn, dies ist wegen der Besonderheiten des Einzelfalls (§ 323 Absatz 2 und 3 des Bürgerlichen Gesetzbuches) entbehrlich. (4) Kündigung von Verbraucherdarlehensverträgen bei Verzug Soweit das Bürgerliche Gesetzbuch Sonderregelungen für die Kündigung wegen Verzugs mit der Rückzahlung eines Verbraucherdarlehens- vertrags vorsieht, kann die ING nur nach Maßgabe dieser Regelungen kündigen. (5) Kündigung eines Basiskontovertrags Einen Basiskontovertrag kann die ING nur nach den zwischen der ING und dem Kunden auf Grundlage des Zahlungskontengesetzes getroffenen Vereinbarungen und den Bestimmungen des Zahlungskontengesetzes kündigen. (6) Abwicklung nach einer Kündigung Im Falle einer Kündigung ohne Kündigungsfrist wird die ING dem Kunden für die Abwicklung (insbesondere für die Rückzahlung eines Kredits) eine angemessene Frist einräumen, soweit nicht eine sofortige Erledigung erforderlich ist (zum Beispiel bei der Kündigung des Scheckvertrags die Rückgabe der Scheckvordrucke). (4) Gesicherte Ansprüche der ING Das Sicherungseigentum und die Sicherungsabtretung dienen der Siche- rung aller Ansprüche, die der ING gegen den Kunden bei Einreichung von Einzugspapieren aus seinen Kontokorrentkonten zustehen oder die infolge der Rückbelastung nicht eingelöster Einzugspapiere oder diskon- tierter Wechsel entstehen. Auf Anforderung des Kunden nimmt die ING eine Rückübertragung des Sicherungseigentums an den Papieren und der auf sie übergegangenen Forderungen an den Kunden vor, falls ihr im Zeitpunkt der Anforderung keine zu sichernden Ansprüche gegen den Kunden zustehen oder sie ihn über den Gegenwert der Papiere vor deren endgültiger Bezahlung nicht verfügen lässt. 16. Begrenzung des Besicherungsanspruchs und Freigabeverpflichtung (1) Deckungsgrenze Die ING kann ihren Anspruch auf Bestellung oder Verstärkung von Sicher heiten so lange geltend machen, bis der realisierbare Wert aller Sicher heiten dem Gesamtbetrag aller Ansprüche aus der bankmäßigen Geschäftsverbindung (Deckungsgrenze) entspricht. (2) Freigabe Falls der realisierbare Wert aller Sicherheiten die Deckungsgrenze nicht nur vorübergehend übersteigt, hat die ING auf Verlangen des Kunden Sicherheiten nach ihrer Wahl freizugeben, und zwar in Höhe des die Deckungsgrenze übersteigenden Betrags; sie wird bei der Auswahl der freizugebenden Sicherheiten auf die berechtigten Belange des Kunden und eines dritten Sicherungsgebers, der für die Verbindlichkeiten des Kunden Sicherheiten bestellt hat, Rücksicht nehmen. In diesem Rahmen ist die ING auch verpflichtet, Aufträge des Kunden über die dem Pfand- recht unterliegenden Werte auszuführen (z. B. Verkauf von Wertpapieren, Auszahlung von Sparguthaben). (3) Sondervereinbarungen Ist für eine bestimmte Sicherheit ein anderer Bewertungsmaßstab als der realisierbare Wert oder ist eine andere Deckungsgrenze oder eine andere Grenze für die Freigabe von Sicherheiten vereinbart, so sind diese maßgeblich. 17. Verwertung von Sicherheiten (1) Wahlrecht der ING Wenn die ING verwertet, hat sie unter mehreren Sicherheiten die Wahl. Sie wird bei der Verwertung und bei der Auswahl der zu verwertenden Sicherheiten auf die berechtigten Belange des Kunden und eines dritten Sicherungsgebers, der für die Verbindlichkeiten des Kunden Sicherheiten bestellt hat, Rücksicht nehmen. (2) Erlösgutschrift nach dem Umsatzsteuerrecht Wenn der Verwertungsvorgang der Umsatzsteuer unterliegt, wird die ING dem Kunden über den Erlös eine Gutschrift erteilen, die als Rech- nung für die Lieferung der als Sicherheit dienenden Sache gilt und den Voraussetzungen des Umsatzsteuerrechts entspricht. 18. Kündigungsrechte des Kunden (1) Jederzeitiges Kündigungsrecht Der Kunde kann die gesamte Geschäftsverbindung oder einzelne Geschäftsbeziehungen (zum Beispiel den Scheckvertrag, der zur Nutzung der Scheckkarte und von Scheckvordrucken berechtigt), für die weder eine Laufzeit noch eine abweichende Kündigungsregelung ver- einbart ist, jederzeit ohne Einhaltung einer Kündigungsfrist kündigen. (2) Kündigung aus wichtigem Grund Ist für eine Geschäftsbeziehung eine Laufzeit oder eine abweichende Kündigungsregelung vereinbart, kann eine fristlose Kündigung nur dann ausgesprochen werden, wenn hierfür ein wichtiger Grund vorliegt, der es dem Kunden, auch unter Berücksichtigung der berechtigten Belange der ING, unzumutbar werden lässt, die Geschäftsbeziehung fortzusetzen. (3) Gesetzliche Kündigungsrechte Gesetzliche Kündigungsrechte bleiben unberührt. 20 kann. Die Sicherungsgrenze wird dem Kunden von der ING auf Verlangen bekannt gegeben. Nicht geschützt werden insbesondere Einlagen von finanziellen Unter- nehmen, staatlichen Stellen einschließlich kommunaler Gebietskörper- schaften, Einlagen, die im Zusammenhang mit Geldwäsche oder Terro- rismusfinanzierung entstanden sind, und Inhaberschuldverschreibungen. Im Fall von Gläubigern nach Buchstaben (b)(ii), (c)(ii) und (d)(ii) werden Einlagen mit einer Laufzeit von mehr als 12 Monaten sowie Verbindlich- keiten aus Schuldscheindarlehen, Namenschuldverschreibungen und vergleichbaren Schuldtiteln ausländischen Rechts nicht geschützt. Für Verbindlichkeiten von Banken, die bis zum Ablauf des 31. Dezember 2022 gemäß § 6 der am 18. November 2021 im Vereinsregister einge- tragenen Fassung des Statuts des Einlagensicherungsfonds gesichert wurden, besteht die Sicherung nach Maßgabe dieser Vorschrift fort. Nach dem 31. Dezember 2022 entfällt dieser Bestandsschutz, sobald die betreffende Verbindlichkeit fällig wird, gekündigt oder anderweitig zurückgefordert werden kann, oder wenn die Verbindlichkeit im Wege einer Einzel- oder Gesamtrechtsnachfolge übergeht oder auf eine ausländische Zweigniederlassung oder Zweigstelle übertragen wird. Einzelheiten zum Schutzumfang einschließlich der Sicherungsgrenzen sind im Statut des Einlagensicherungsfonds, insbesondere dessen § 6 geregelt. Das Statut wird auf Verlangen zur Verfügung gestellt und kann auch im Internet unter www.bankenverband.de aufgerufen werden. Forderungsübergang und Auskunftserteilung (4) Forderungsübergang Soweit der Einlagensicherungsfonds oder ein von ihm Beauftragter Zahlungen an einen Kunden leistet, gehen dessen Forderungen gegen die ING in entsprechender Höhe mit allen Nebenrechten Zug um Zug auf den Einlagensicherungsfonds über. (5) Auskunftserteilung Die ING ist befugt, dem Einlagensicherungsfonds oder einem von ihnen Beauftragten alle in diesem Zusammenhang erforderlichen Auskünfte zu erteilen und Unterlagen zur Verfügung zu stellen. Beschwerde- und Streitbeilegungsverfahren 21. Beschwerde- und Alternative Streitbeilegungs- verfahren Der Kunde hat folgende außergerichtliche Möglichkeiten: • Der Kunde kann sich mit einer Beschwerde an die im Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnis genannte Kontaktstelle der ING wenden. Die ING wird Beschwerden in geeigneter Weise beantworten, bei Zahlungs- diensteverträgen erfolgt dies in Textform (zum Beispiel mittels Brief, Telefax oder E-Mail). • Die ING nimmt am Streitbeilegungsverfahren der Verbraucherschlich- tungsstelle „Ombudsmann der privaten Banken“ (www.bankenombudsmann.de) teil. Dort hat der Verbraucher die Mög- lichkeit, zur Beilegung einer Streitigkeit mit der ING den Ombudsmann der privaten Banken anzurufen. Betrifft der Beschwerdegegenstand eine Streitigkeit über einen Zahlungsdienstevertrag (§ 675f des Bürger- lichen Gesetzbuches), können auch Kunden, die keine Verbraucher sind, den Ombudsmann der privaten Banken anrufen. Näheres regelt die „Verfahrensordnung für die Schlichtung von Kundenbeschwerden im deutschen Bankgewerbe“, die auf Wunsch zur Verfügung gestellt wird oder im Internet unter www.bankenverband.de abrufbar ist. Die Beschwerde ist in Textform (zum Beispiel mittels Brief, Telefax oder E-Mail) an die Kundenbeschwerdestelle beim Bundesverband deutscher Banken e. V., Postfach 04 03 07, 10062 Berlin, Fax: (030) 1663-3169, E-Mail: <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS>, zu richten. • Ferner besteht für den Kunden die Möglichkeit, sich jederzeit schriftlich oder zur dortigen Niederschrift bei der Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienst- leistungsaufsicht, Graurheindorfer Straße 108, 53117 Bonn, über Ver- stöße der Bank gegen das Zahlungsdiensteaufsichtsgesetz (ZAG), die §§ 675c bis 676c des Bürgerlichen Gesetzbuches (BGB) oder gegen Artikel 248 des Einführungsgesetzes zum Bürgerlichen Gesetzbuche (EGBGB) zu beschweren. • Die Europäische Kommission hat unter http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/ odr/ eine Europäische Online-Streitbeilegungsplattform (OS-Plattform) errichtet. Die OS-Plattform kann ein Verbraucher für die außergericht- Schutz der Einlagen 20. Information über die Einlagensicherung (1) Einlagen Einlagen sind Guthaben, die sich im Rahmen von Bankgeschäften aus Beträgen, die auf einem Konto verblieben sind, oder aus Zwischenposi- tionen ergeben und die nach den geltenden gesetzlichen und vertrag- lichen Bedingungen von der ING zurückzuzahlen sind, wie zum Beispiel Guthaben auf Girokonten, Festgelder, Spareinlagen, Sparbriefe und Namensschuldverschreibungen. Maßgeblich sind die Definitionen in § 2 Absatz 3 des Einlagensicherungsgesetzes (EinSiG) bzw. § 6 Absatz 1 des Statuts des innerhalb des Bundesverbandes deutscher Banken e.V. bestehenden Einlagensicherungsfonds deutscher Banken (Einlagen- sicherungsfonds). (2) Gesetzliche Einlagensicherung Die ING ist der Entschädigungseinrichtung deutscher Banken GmbH als Träger der gesetzliche Einlagensicherung der privaten Banken zugeordnet. Die gesetzliche Einlagensicherung schützt nach Maßgabe des EinSiG und vorbehaltlich der darin vorgesehenen Ausnahmen Einlagen bis zu einem Gegenwert von 100.000 € pro Einleger. In den in § 8 Absatz 2 EinSiG genannten Fällen erhöht sich dieser Betrag auf 500.000 €. Dazu gehören insbesondere Beträge, die aus Immobilientransaktionen im Zusammen- hang mit privat genutzten Wohnimmobilien resultieren. Nicht geschützt werden insbesondere Einlagen von finanziellen Unternehmen, staatli- chen Stellen einschließlich kommunaler Gebietskörperschaften, Einlagen, die im Zusammenhang mit Geldwäsche oder Terrorismusfinanzierung entstanden sind, und Inhaberschuldverschreibungen. Einzelheiten sind im EinSiG, insbesondere dessen § 8 geregelt. (3) Einlagensicherungsfonds Die ING wirkt außerdem am Einlagensicherungsfonds mit. Dieser sichert nach Maßgabe seines Statuts und vorbehaltlich der darin vorgesehenen Ausnahmen Einlagen bei einer inländischen Haupt- oder Zweignieder- lassung bzw. Zweigstelle je Gläubiger maximal bis zur folgenden Höhe (Sicherungsgrenze): (a) (i) 5 Mio. € für natürliche Personen und rechtsfähige Stiftungen unabhängig von ihrer Laufzeit und (ii) 50 Mio. € für nichtfinanzielle Unternehmen, gemeinnützige Orga- nisationen, Verbände und Berufsorganisationen ohne Erwerbs- zweck und anderer in § 6 Absatz 3 des Statuts des Einlagensiche- rungsfonds genannter Gläubiger. In jedem Fall werden Einlagen bis maximal 15 % der Eigenmittel der Bank im Sinne von Artikel 72 CRR geschützt, wobei Ergänzungskapital nur bis zur Höhe von 25 % des Kernkapitals im Sinne von Artikel 25 CRR Berücksichtigung findet. Weitere Einzelheiten zur Berechnung der relevanten Eigenmittel regelt § 6 Absatz 8 Unterabsatz (a) des Statuts des Einlagensicherungsfonds. (b) Ab dem 1. Januar 2025: (i) 3 Mio. € für natürliche Personen und rechtsfähige Stiftungen unabhängig von ihrer Laufzeit und (ii) 30 Mio. € für nichtfinanzielle Unternehmen, gemeinnützige Orga- nisationen, Verbände und Berufsorganisationen ohne Erwerbs- zweck und anderer in § 6 Absatz 3 des Statuts des Einlagensiche- rungsfonds genannter Gläubiger. In jedem Fall werden Einlagen bis maximal 8,75 % der Eigenmittel im Sinne von Unterabsatz (a) Sätzen 2 und 3 geschützt. (c) Ab dem 1. Januar 2030: (i) 1 Mio. € für natürliche Personen und rechtsfähige Stiftungen unabhängig von ihrer Laufzeit und (ii) 10 Mio. € für nichtfinanzielle Unternehmen, gemeinnützige Orga- nisationen, Verbände und Berufsorganisationen ohne Erwerbs- zweck und anderer in § 6 Absatz 3 des Statuts des Einlagensiche- rungsfonds genannter Gläubiger. In jedem Fall werden Einlagen bis maximal 8,75 % der Eigenmittel im Sinne von Unterabsatz (a) Sätzen 2 und 3 geschützt. (d) Für Einlagen, die bis zum Ablauf des 31. Dezember 2022 gesichert wurden, finden die zu diesem Zeitpunkt geltenden Sicherungsgrenzen weiterhin Anwendung bis die Einlage fällig ist, prolongiert wird oder vom Kunden erstmals gekündigt werden kann oder auf eine aus- ländische Zweigniederlassung oder Zweigstellen übertragen wird. Für Einlagen, die nach dem 31. Dezember 2022 begründet oder prolongiert werden, gelten die jeweils neuen Sicherungsgrenzen ab den oben genannten Stichtagen. Maßgebend für die Entschädigung ist die Sicherungsgrenze, die der ING als Ergebnis der Feststellung des Prüfungsverbandes mitgeteilt worden ist und im Internet unter www.bankenverband.de abgerufen werden 21 ten Sicherheitsmerkmals des Kunden überprüfen kann. Mit den hierfür vereinbarten Authentifizierungselementen kann der Kunde sich gegen- über der ING als berechtigter Teilnehmer ausweisen, auf Informationen zugreifen (siehe Nummer 4 dieser Vereinbarungen) sowie Aufträge erteilen (siehe Nummer 5 dieser Vereinbarungen). (3) Authentifizierungselemente sind • Wissenselemente, also etwas, das nur der Kunde weiß (z. B. die persön- liche Geheimzahl [PIN – z. B. Internetbanking PIN oder mobile PIN] oder ein Passwort), • Besitzelemente, also etwas, das nur der Kunde besitzt (z. B. mobiles Endgerät, das für die Nutzung der Banking to go App durch den Kunden registriert ist oder ein Gerät zur Erzeugung oder zum Empfang von einmal verwendbaren Transaktionsnummern [TAN], die den Besitz des Kunden nachweisen, wie den TANGenerator), oder • Seinselemente, also etwas, das der Kunde ist (Inhärenz, z. B. Finger- abdruck als biometrisches Merkmal des Kunden). (4) Die Authentifizierung des Kunden erfolgt, indem der Kunde gemäß den Anforderungen der ING das Wissenselement, den Nachweis des Besitzelements und/oder den Nachweis des Seinselements an die ING übermittelt. 4. Zugang zum Telebanking und zum Internet- banking (Login) (1) Der Kunde erhält Zugang zum Internet- und Telebanking der ING, wenn • er seine Zugangsdaten (z. B. Zugangsnummer, PIN, DiBa Key, Passwort) angibt oder sich zum Internetbanking per QR-Code anmeldet und • er sich unter Verwendung des oder der von der ING angeforderten Authentifizierungselemente ausweist und • keine Sperre des Zugangs vorliegt. Nach Gewährung des Zugangs zum Internet- und Telebanking kann der Kunde auf Informationen zugreifen oder nach Nummer 5 dieser Verein- barungen Aufträge erteilen. (2) Für den Zugriff auf sensible Zahlungsdaten im Sinne des § 1 Absatz 26 Satz 1 ZAG (z. B. zum Zweck der Änderung der Anschrift des Kunden) fordert die ING den Kunden auf, sich unter Verwendung eines weiteren Authentifizierungselements auszuweisen, wenn beim Zugang zum Internetbanking nur ein Authentifizierungselement angefordert wurde. Der Name des Kunden und die Kontonummer sind für den vom Kunden genutzten Zahlungsauslösedienst und Kontoinformationsdienst keine sensiblen Zahlungsdaten (§ 1 Absatz 26 Satz 2 ZAG). (3) Die von der ING dem Kunden zur Nutzung des Internetbanking erteilten Wissenselemente muss der Kunde in nur ihm bekannte Wissens- elemente umwandeln. Erst dann stehen dem Kunden die Dienste des Internetbanking zur Verfügung. Er kann jederzeit seine Wissenselemente ändern und seine Authentifizierungselemente sperren bzw. löschen und neue anfordern bzw. registrieren. Bei einer Änderung der Authentifizie- rungselemente werden die bisherigen ungültig. Eine Sperre kann durch ein vom Kunden unterzeichnetes Schreiben (im Original, nicht per Tele- fax), per Telebanking oder über das Internetbanking veranlasst werden. In Notfällen steht die Telefonnummer des Rund-um-die-Uhr-Sperr- dienstes zur Verfügung, die über die Internetseite der ING zu erfahren ist. (4) Falls der Zugriff über Kommunikationsmittel erfolgt, die anderen Betreibern unterstehen, obliegt es dem Kunden, die dafür notwendigen Vorkehrungen zu treffen und sicherzustellen, dass alle gesetzlichen und technischen Vorschriften eingehalten werden. 5. Auftragserteilung (1) Der Kunde muss einem per Internet- oder Telebanking erteilten Auf- trag (z. B. einer Überweisung) zu dessen Wirksamkeit zustimmen (Auto- risierung). Auf Anforderung hat der Kunde hierzu Authentifizierungs- elemente (z. B. bei Nutzung der Banking to go App die Eingabe der mobile- PIN oder die Verwendung des Fingerabdrucks) zu verwenden. Die ING bestätigt mittels Internet- oder Telebanking den Eingang des Auftrags. (2) Weisungen und sonstige rechtsgeschäftliche Erklärungen sind wirk- sam abgegeben, wenn der Kunde die in der Benutzerführung vorge- schriebene Freigabe zur Übermittlung vorgenommen hat. Bei Vorgängen, die zum Beispiel der Autorisierung bedürfen, ist die Freigabe maßge- liche Beilegung einer Streitigkeit aus Online-Verträgen mit einem in der EU nieder gelas se nen Unternehmen nutzen. • Zusätzlich zu den vorgenannten Beschwerde- und Streitbeilegungs- verfahren steht dem Kunden auch die Möglichkeit einer zivilrechtlichen Klage offen. Vereinbarungen zum Internet- banking inklusive Post-Box und Telebanking 1. Einleitung Für die Führung der Konten und Depots (nachfolgend „Konten“) der ING ist die Nutzung des Internetbanking und des Telebanking vorgesehen. 1.1 Internetbanking Die ING und der Kunde haben vereinbart, dass die Konto- und Depotfüh- rung per Internetbanking inklusive Post-Box erfolgt. Die Abwicklung von Bank- und Wertpapiergeschäften erfolgt über das Internetbanking. Hierfür hält die ING selbst oder damit von ihr beauftragte Dritte die erfor- derlichen Einrichtungen vor und schafft die Voraussetzungen für den authentischen, vertraulichen, integren und verbindlichen Austausch von Daten zwischen dem Kunden und der ING über das Internet. Ausführ- liche Sicherheitshinweise erhält der Kunde über die Homepage der ING. Die Nutzung der Banking to go App wird als das Standardverfahren zur Authentifizierung und Autorisierung vereinbart. Unter Internetbanking sind die Banking- und Brokerage-Funktionen auf der Unternehmens-Website, angebotene Funktionen des Mobile Banking sowie alle Funktionen und Applikationen (z. B. Apps) zu verstehen, welche die ING ihren Kunden zur Verfügung stellt. 1.2 Telebanking Neben dem Internetbanking kann der Kunde auch per Telefon mittels Telebanking in dem von der ING angebotenen Umfang Bankgeschäfte abwickeln und Informationen abrufen. 2. Teilnahme (1) Der Kunde kann Bank- und Wertpapiergeschäfte mittels Internet- banking und Telebanking in dem angebotenen Umfang abwickeln. Zudem kann er Informationen der ING mittels Internetbanking abrufen. Im Rahmen des Internetbanking ist er zusätzlich berechtigt, für die Auslösung eines Zahlungsauftrages einen Zahlungsauslösedienst gem. § 1 Absatz 33 Zahlungsdiensteaufsichtsgesetz und für die Mitteilung von Informationen über ein Zahlungskonto einen Kontoinformations- dienst gem. § 1 Absatz 34 Zahlungsdiensteaufsichtsgesetz zu nutzen. (2) Die ING hat das Recht, den Umfang der über das Internet- und Tele- banking abwickelbaren Geschäftsvorgänge sowie, die Art und Weise der Nutzung des Internet- und Telebanking unter Berücksichtigung der berechtigten Belange des Kunden jederzeit zu verändern oder von weiteren Auflagen abhängig zu machen. Die ING wird den Kunden über derartige Änderungen rechtzeitig in geeigneter Form unterrichten. (3) Gemeinschaftskontokunden und verfügungsberechtigte Dritte können das Telebanking nutzen, wenn sie jeweils über eigene Authentifizierungs- elemente verfügen. 3. Nutzungsvoraussetzungen (1) Der Kunde kann das Internet- und Telebanking nutzen, wenn die Bank ihn authen tifiziert hat. (2) Authentifizierung ist das Verfahren, mit dessen Hilfe die ING die Iden- tität des Kunden oder die berechtigte Verwendung eines vereinbarten Zahlungsinstruments, einschließlich der Verwendung des personalisier- 22 8. Information des Kunden über Internet- und Telebanking- Verfügungen (1) Die ING unterrichtet den Kontoinhaber über die mittels Internet- und Telebanking getätigten Verfügungen in der für Kontoinformationen vereinbarten Art und Weise. (2) Der Kunde hat die ihm im Internetbanking mitgeteilten Umsatzinfor- mationen und Ausführungsdaten auf ihre Vollständigkeit und Richtigkeit zu überprüfen. (3) Der Kunde ist verpflichtet, sich nach Erteilung von Zahlungsaufträgen oder Aufträgen sonstiger Art von der Ausführung des Auftrags durch die ING unverzüglich zu vergewissern. Nicht autorisierte oder fehlerhaft ausgeführte Aufträge hat der Kunde der ING unverzüglich anzuzeigen. Dabei zu beachtende Fristen richten sich nach den für die jeweilige Auf- tragsart geltenden Sonderbedingungen. 9. Sorgfaltspflichten des Kunden 9.1 Schutz der Authentifizierungselemente (1) Der Kunde hat alle zumutbaren Vorkehrungen zu treffen, um seine Authentifizierungselemente (siehe Nummer 3 Absatz 3 dieser Verein- barungen) vor unbefugtem Zugriff zu schützen. Ansonsten besteht die Gefahr, dass das Internet- und Telebanking missbräuchlich verwendet oder in sonstiger Weise nicht autorisiert genutzt wird (vergleiche Num- mer 4 und 5 dieser Vereinbarungen). (2) Zum Schutz der einzelnen Authentifizierungselemente hat der Kunde vor allem Folgendes zu beachten: (a) Wissenselemente, wie z. B. PIN, sind geheim zu halten; sie dürfen insbesondere • nicht mündlich (z. B. telefonisch oder persönlich) mitgeteilt werden, • nicht außerhalb des Internet- und Telebanking in Textform (z. B. per E-Mail, Messenger Dienst) weitergegeben werden, • nicht ungesichert elektronisch gespeichert (z. B. Speicherung der PIN im Klartext im Computer oder mobilen Endgerät) werden und • nicht auf einem Gerät notiert oder als Abschrift zusammen mit einem Gerät aufbewahrt werden, das als Besitzelement (z. B. TAN-Generator, mobiles Endgerät) oder zur Prüfung des Seinselements (z. B. mobiles Endgerät mit Banking to go App und Fingerabdrucksensor) dient. (b) Besitzelemente, z. B. der TAN-Generator oder ein mobiles Endgerät, sind vor Missbrauch zu schützen, insbesondere • sind der TAN-Generator oder das mobile Endgerät vor dem unbefugten Zugriff anderer Personen sicher zu verwahren, • ist sicherzustellen, dass unberechtigte Personen auf das mobile End- gerät des Teilnehmers (z. B. Mobiltelefon) nicht zugreifen können, • ist dafür Sorge zu tragen, dass andere Personen die auf dem mobilen Endgerät (z. B. Smartphone, Tablet) befindlichen Anwendungen für das Internetbanking (z. B. Banking to go App) nicht nutzen können, • ist die Anwendung für das Internetbanking (z. B. Banking to go App) auf dem mobilen Endgerät des Kunden zu deaktivieren, bevor der Kunde den Besitz an diesem mobilen Endgerät aufgibt (z. B. durch Verkauf oder Entsorgung des Mobiltelefons), • dürfen die Nachweise des Besitzelements (z. B. TAN, Einmalpasswort) nicht außerhalb des Internetbanking mündlich (z. B. per Telefon) oder in Textform (z. B. per E-Mail, Messenger-Dienst) weitergegeben werden und • hat der Kunde von der ING einen Code zur Aktivierung des Besitz- elements erhalten, muss er diesen vor dem unbefugten Zugriff anderer Personen sicher verwahren; ansonsten besteht die Gefahr, dass andere Personen ihr Gerät als Besitzelement für das Internetbanking des Kunden aktivieren. (c) Seinselemente, wie z. B. der Fingerabdruck des Kunden, dürfen auf einem mobilen Endgerät des Kunden für das Internetbanking nur dann als Authentifizierungselement verwendet werden, wenn auf dem mobi- len Endgerät keine Seinselemente anderer Personen gespeichert sind. Sind auf dem mobilen Endgerät, das für das Internetbanking genutzt wird, Seinselemente anderer Personen gespeichert, ist für das Internet- banking das von der Bank ausgegebene Wissenselement (z. B. mobilePIN) zu nutzen und nicht das auf dem mobilen Endgerät gespeicherte Seins- element (z. B. Fingerabdruck). bend. Mit Zugang der Freigabe bei der ING wird ein ihr erteilter Auftrag wirksam. (3) Die Widerrufbarkeit eines per Internet- oder Telebanking erteilten Auftrags richtet sich nach den für die jeweilige Auftragsart geltenden Sonderbedingungen (zum Beispiel Bedingungen für den Überweisungs- verkehr). Der Widerruf von Aufträgen kann nur außerhalb des Internet- und Telebanking erfolgen, es sei denn, die ING sieht eine Widerrufs- möglichkeit im Internet- oder Telebanking ausdrücklich vor. 6. Banking to go App als Standardverfahren für das Internetbanking (1) Die ING und der Kunde vereinbaren die Nutzung der Banking to go App als das Standardverfahren zur Authentifizierung und Autorisierung für das Internetbanking. (2) Die ING stellt die Banking to go App zur Installation auf hierzu geeig- neten mobilen Endgeräten (z. B. Smartphone, Tablet) zur Verfügung. Über die Nutzung der Banking to go App werden Besitz, Wissens- und/ oder Seinselemente (je nach persönlicher Einstellung) als Authentifi- zierungselemente zur Authentifizierung im Rahmen des Zugangs zum Internetbanking und zur Autorisierung von Aufträgen im Internet- banking kombiniert. (3) Von der ING als Alternative zur Banking to go App angebotene weitere Verfahren zur Authentifizierung und Autorisierung (z. B. TAN-Übermitt- lung mittels TAN-Generator) sind Sonderleistungen, für die gegebenen- falls Entgelte nach Maßgabe des Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnisses anfallen. 7. Auftragsbearbeitung (1) Die Bearbeitung der per Internet- und Telebanking erteilten Aufträge erfolgt an den für die Abwicklung der jeweiligen Auftragsart (zum Bei- spiel Überweisung) im Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnis bekannt gegebenen Geschäftstagen im Rahmen des ordnungsgemäßen Arbeitsablaufes. Geht der Auftrag nach dem im Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnis bestimm- ten Zeitpunkt (Annahmefrist) ein oder fällt der Zeitpunkt des Eingangs nicht auf einen Geschäftstag der ING, so gilt der Auftrag als am darauf- folgenden Geschäftstag zugegangen. Die Bearbeitung beginnt erst an diesem Tag. (2) Die ING wird den Auftrag ausführen, wenn folgende Ausführungs- bedingungen vorliegen: • Der Kunde hat den Auftrag autorisiert. • Die Berechtigung des Kunden für die jeweilige Auftragsart (zum Beispiel Wertpapierorder) liegt vor. • Das Internetbanking-Datenformat ist eingehalten. • Das für das Internet- und Telebanking vereinbarte Verfügungslimit ist nicht überschritten. • Zur Ausführung von Aufträgen zum Kauf oder Verkauf von Wert- papieren oder zur Ausübung von Bezugsrechten, reicht das Guthaben, ein für Wertpapiergeschäfte nutzbarer Kredit oder der Depotbestand des Kunden aus. • Die weiteren Ausführungsvoraussetzungen nach den für die jeweilige Auftragsart maßgeblichen Sonderbedingungen (zum Beispiel aus- reichende Kontodeckung gemäß den Bedingungen für den Überwei- sungsverkehr) liegen vor. Liegen die Ausführungsbedingungen nach Satz 1 vor, führt die ING die per Internet- oder Telebanking erteilten Aufträge nach Maßgabe der Bestimmungen der für die jeweilige Auftragsart geltenden Sonderbedin- gungen (zum Beispiel Bedingungen für den Überweisungsverkehr, Bedingungen für das Wertpapiergeschäft) aus. (3) Liegen die Ausführungsbedingungen nach Absatz 2 Satz 1 nicht vor, wird die ING den Internetbanking-Auftrag nicht ausführen. Sie wird den Teilnehmer mittels Internetbanking eine Information zur Verfügung stellen und soweit möglich dabei die Gründe und die Möglichkeiten nennen, mit denen Fehler, die zur Ablehnung geführt haben, berichtigt werden können. 23 10.2 Unterrichtung über nicht autorisierte oder fehlerhaft ausgeführte Aufträge Der Kunde hat die ING unverzüglich nach Feststellung eines nicht autori- sierten oder fehlerhaft ausgeführten Auftrags hierüber zu unterrichten. 11. Nutzungssperre 11.1 Sperre auf Veranlassung des Kunden Die ING sperrt auf Veranlassung des Kunden, insbesondere im Fall der Sperranzeige nach Nummer 10 Absatz 1 dieser Vereinbarungen, • den Internet- und/oder Telebanking-Zugang für den Kunden oder • sein Authentifizierungselement zur Nutzung des Internet- und Telebanking. 11.2 Sperre auf Veranlassung der ING (1) Die ING darf den Zugang zum Internet- und Telebanking für einen Kunden sperren, wenn • sachliche Gründe im Zusammenhang mit der Sicherheit der Authen- tifizierungselemente dies rechtfertigen oder • der Verdacht einer nicht autorisierten oder einer betrügerischen Verwendung eines Authentifizierungselementes besteht oder • sie berechtigt ist, diese Internet- und Telebanking-Vereinbarungen oder die Geschäfts verbindung aus wichtigem Grund zu kündigen. (2) Die ING darf den Zugang zum Internet- und Telebanking für einen Kunden sperren, wenn der Verdacht einer nicht autorisierten oder betrügerischen Verwendung der Authentifizierungselemente besteht, insbesondere dann, wenn • 3-mal hintereinander die PIN oder ein anderes Wissenselement falsch eingegeben wurde oder • 3-mal hintereinander eine falsche TAN oder ein anderes Authentifizie- rungselement eingegeben wurde. (3) Die ING wird den Kunden unter Angabe der hierfür maßgeblichen Gründe möglichst vor, spätestens jedoch unverzüglich nach der Sperre auf dem vereinbarten Weg unterrichten. Die Angabe von Gründen darf unterbleiben, soweit die ING hierdurch gegen gesetzliche Pflichten verstoßen würde. 11.3 Aufhebung der Sperre Die ING wird eine Sperre aufheben oder soweit möglich die betroffenen Authentifizierungselemente austauschen, wenn die Gründe für die Sperre nicht mehr gegeben sind. Hierüber unterrichtet sie den Kunden unverzüglich. 11.4 Zugangssperre für Zahlungsauslösedienste und Kontoinformationsdienste Die ING kann Kontoinformationsdienstleistern oder Zahlungsauslöse- dienstleistern den Zugang zu einem Zahlungskonto des Kunden verwei- gern, wenn objektive und gebührend nachgewiesene Gründe im Zusam- menhang mit einem nicht autorisierten oder betrügerischen Zugang des Kontoinformationsdienstleisters oder des Zahlungsauslösedienst- leisters zum Zahlungskonto, einschließlich der nicht autorisierten oder betrügerischen Auslösung eines Zahlungsvorgangs, es rechtfertigen. Die ING wird den Kunden über eine solche Zugangsverweigerung auf dem vereinbarten Weg unterrichten. Die Unterrichtung erfolgt mög- lichst vor, spätestens jedoch unverzüglich nach der Verweigerung des Zugangs. Die Angabe von Gründen darf unterbleiben, soweit die ING hierdurch gegen gesetzliche Verpflichtungen verstoßen würde. Sobald die Gründe für die Verweigerung des Zugangs nicht mehr bestehen, hebt die ING die Zugangssperre auf. Hierüber unterrichtet sie den Kunden unverzüglich. (3) Ungeachtet der Schutzpflichten nach den Absätzen 1 und 2 darf der Kunde seine Authentifizierungselemente gegenüber einem von ihm ausgewählten Zahlungsauslösedienst und Kontoinformationsdienst sowie einem sonstigen Drittdienst verwenden (siehe Nummer 2 Absatz 1 Satz 3 und 4 dieser Vereinbarungen). Sonstige Drittdienste hat der Kunde mit der im Verkehr erforderlichen Sorgfalt auszuwählen. (4) Einer Aufforderung per elektronischer Nachricht (z. B. E-Mail), einen damit übersandten Link zum (vermeintlichen) Internetbanking der ING anzuklicken und darüber persönliche Zugangsdaten einzugeben, darf nicht gefolgt werden. (5) Anfragen außerhalb der von der ING zur Verfügung gestellten origi- nären Zugangs wege zum Internet- und Telebanking, in denen nach ver- traulichen Daten wie z. B. PIN und TAN gefragt wird, dürfen nicht beant- wortet werden. Die Nutzung von Zahlungsauslösediensten und Konto- informationsdiensten (gemäß § 1 Zahlungsdiensteaufsichtsgesetz) bleibt hiervon unberührt. (6) Der Kunde hat vor seinem jeweiligen Zugang zum Internetbanking sicherzustellen, dass auf dem verwendeten System handelsübliche Sicherheitsvorkehrungen (wie Anti-Viren-Programm und Firewall) instal- liert sind und diese ebenso wie die verwendete System- und Anwen- dungssoftware regelmäßig aktualisiert werden. 9.2 Sicherheitshinweise der ING Der Kunde muss die Sicherheitshinweise zum Internetbanking auf der Internetseite der ING, insbesondere auch die Maßnahmen zum Schutz der von ihm eingesetzten Hard- und Software (Kundensystem), beachten. 9.3 Prüfung der Auftragsdaten mit von der ING im Internetbanking angezeigten Daten Die ING zeigt dem Kunden die von ihr von dem Kunden empfangenen Auftragsdaten (z. B. Betrag, IBAN des Zahlungsempfängers, Wertpapier- kennnummer) an. Der Kunde ist verpflichtet, vor der Bestätigung die Übereinstimmung der angezeigten Daten mit den für den Auftrag vor- gesehenen Daten zu prüfen und im Falle von Unstimmigkeiten den Vorgang abzubrechen und die ING zu informieren. 9.4 Allgemeine Sorgfaltspflichten des Kunden Der Kunde hat die Verfahrensanleitungen, insbesondere die ihm wäh- rend des Online-Kontakts angezeigte Benutzerführung, zu beachten und alle von ihm eingegebenen oder die von einer Anwendung ermittelten und ausgelesenen Daten (z. B. Fotoüberweisung) auf Vollständigkeit und Richtigkeit zu überprüfen. Aufträge jeder Art müssen ihren Inhalt zwei- felsfrei erkennen lassen. Nicht eindeutig formulierte Aufträge und insbe- sondere nicht oder nicht richtig ausgefüllte Felder können Rückfragen und Missverständnisse zur Folge haben, die zu Verzögerungen der Aus- führung führen können. Die ING überprüft nicht die formale und inhalt- liche Richtigkeit der erteilten Aufträge. 10. Anzeige und Unterrichtungspflichten 10.1 Sperranzeige (1) Stellt der Kunde • den Verlust oder den Diebstahl eines Besitzelements zur Authentifizie- rung (z. B. mobiles Endgerät oder TAN-Generator) oder • die missbräuchliche Verwendung oder die sonstige nicht autorisierte Nutzung eines Authentifizierungselements fest, muss der Kunde die ING hierüber unverzüglich unterrichten (Sperr- anzeige). Der Kunde kann eine solche Sperranzeige jederzeit über die hierfür angebotenen Kommunikationskanäle abgeben. (2) Der Kunde hat jeden Diebstahl oder Missbrauch eines Authentifizie- rungselements unverzüglich bei der Polizei zur Anzeige zu bringen. (3) Hat der Kunde den Verdacht einer nicht autorisierten oder betrüge- rischen Verwendung eines seiner Authentifizierungselemente, muss er ebenfalls eine Sperranzeige abgeben. 24 14.2 Haftung des Kunden bei missbräuchlicher Nutzung seiner Authentifizierungselemente 14.2.1 Haftung des Kunden für nicht autorisierte Zahlungsvorgänge vor der Sperranzeige (1) Beruhen nicht autorisierte Zahlungsvorgänge vor der Sperranzeige auf der Nutzung eines verloren gegangenen, gestohlenen oder sonst abhandengekommenen Authentifizierungselements oder auf der sons- tigen missbräuchlichen Verwendung eines Authentifizierungselements, haftet der Kunde für den hierdurch entstehenden Schaden nach den gesetzlichen Regelungen (§ 675v Absatz 1 BGB) bis zu einem Betrag von 50 Euro, ohne dass es darauf ankommt, ob den Kunden ein Verschulden trifft. Die ING verzichtet auf eine Inanspruchnahme des Kunden nach diesen gesetzlichen Bestimmungen. (2) Kommt es vor der Sperranzeige zu nicht autorisierten Zahlungsvor- gängen und hat der Kunde in betrügerischer Absicht gehandelt oder seine Sorgfalts- und Anzeigepflichten nach diesen Vereinbarungen vor- sätzlich oder grob fahrlässig verletzt, trägt der Kunde abweichend von Absatz 1 den hierdurch entstandenen Schaden in vollem Umfang, sofern nicht die Voraussetzungen des Absatzes 4 vorliegen. Grobe Fahrlässigkeit des Kunden kann insbesondere vorliegen, wenn er • Nummer 9.1 Absatz 2 • Nummer 9.3 oder • Nummer 10.1 Absatz 1 dieser Vereinbarungen verletzt hat. (3) Abweichend von Absatz 2 ist der Kunde nicht zum Schadensersatz verpflichtet, wenn die ING vom Kunden eine starke Kundenauthenti- fizierung nach § 1 Absatz 24 ZAG nicht verlangt hat. Eine starke Kunden- authentifizierung erfordert insbesondere die Verwendung von zwei voneinander unabhängigen Authentifizierungselementen aus den Kate- gorien Wissen, Besitz oder Inhärenz (siehe Nummer 3 Absatz 3 dieser Vereinbarungen). (4) Die Haftung für Schäden, die innerhalb des Zeitraums, für den das Verfügungslimit gilt, verursacht werden, beschränkt sich jeweils auf das vereinbarte Verfügungslimit. (5) Der Kunde ist nicht zum Ersatz des Schadens nach Absatz 2 verpflich- tet, wenn er die Sperranzeige nach Nummer 10 Abs. 1 dieser Verein- barungen nicht abgeben konnte, weil die ING nicht die Möglichkeit zur Entgegennahme der Sperranzeige sichergestellt hatte. (6) Die Absätze 1 und 3 bis 5 finden keine Anwendung, wenn der Kunde in betrügerischer Absicht gehandelt hat. (7) Bei Nutzung des Internetbanking übernimmt die ING zugunsten des Kunden den vollen Schaden aus nicht autorisierten Zahlungsvorgängen, der durch grob fahrlässiges Handeln entstanden ist, wenn der Kunde • nicht autorisierte Zahlungsvorgänge unverzüglich angezeigt hat und • wegen der missbräuchlichen Verwendung seiner Authentifizierungs- elemente Straf anzeige gestellt hat und dies der ING nachweist. 14.2.2 Haftung ab der Sperranzeige Sobald die ING eine Sperranzeige eines Kunden erhalten hat, übernimmt sie alle danach durch nicht autorisierte Internet-/Telebanking-Verfügun- gen entstehenden Schäden. Dies gilt nicht, wenn der Kunde in betrügeri- scher Absicht gehandelt hat. 14.2.3 Haftungsausschluss (1) Für Störungen des elektronischen Vertriebswegs, insbesondere für die nicht ordnungsgemäße Datenübermittlung sowie dafür, dass der Zugang zu einem Konto beziehungsweise Depot des Kunden über das Internet- und Telebanking vorübergehend nicht möglich ist, haftet die ING nur bei grobem Verschulden. (2) Haftungsansprüche sind ausgeschlossen, wenn die einen Anspruch begründenden Umstände auf einem ungewöhnlichen und unvorher- sehbaren Ereignis beruhen, auf das diejenige Partei, die sich auf dieses 12. E-Mail-Adresse und Mobilnummer Zur Nutzung der digitalen Services der ING, einschließlich des Internet- bankings, ist es erforderlich, dass der Kunde der ING eine E-Mail-Adresse und eine Mobilnummer zur Verfügung stellt. Der Kunde stellt sicher, dass die im Internetbanking hinterlegte E-Mail Adresse und die Mobil- nummer immer auf dem aktuellen Stand sind. Änderungen sind vom Kunden unverzüglich im Internetbanking vorzunehmen. 13. Nutzung der Post-Box (1) Inhalt In der Post-Box werden dem Kunden persönliche Dokumente und Infor- mationen zum Konto/Depot online zur Verfügung gestellt. Das heißt, der Kunde kann sich die Unterlagen online ansehen, herunterladen, ausdru- cken und archivieren. Die Dokumentenauswahl kann von der ING jeder- zeit erweitert oder verringert werden. Die ING wird den Kunden hierüber informieren. (2) Benachrichtigung Die ING informiert den Kunden über die Einstellung von Dokumenten per E-Mail. Die Benachrichtigung erfolgt zeitnah, in der Regel am Tag der Einstellung. Eine Benachrichtigung bezieht sich auf sämtliche seit der letzten Benachrichtigung eingestellten Dokumente. (3) Verzicht auf papierhafte Postzustellung Die Post-Box wird mit dem Abschluss des Kontovertrags/Depotvertrags eingerichtet. Mit der Einrichtung der Post-Box verzichtet der Kunde auf den postalischen Versand der eingestellten Dokumente, soweit nicht aufgrund gesetzlicher oder regulatorischer Vorgaben in den Verein- barungen zum Direkt-Depot etwas spezielleres geregelt ist. Dies gilt auch für termin- und fristgebundene Nachrichten. Die ING ist weiter berech- tigt, die hinterlegten Dokumente postalisch oder auf andere Weise dem Kunden zuzusenden, wenn dies gesetzliche Vorgaben erforderlich machen oder es aufgrund anderer Umstände (z. B. des vorübergehenden Ausfalls der Post-Box) zweckmäßig ist. (4) Mitwirkungspflichten des Kunden Der Kunde verpflichtet sich, die Post-Box regelmäßig – mindestens ein- mal monatlich – auf neu hinterlegte Dokumente zu prüfen. Er kontrol- liert die in der Post-Box hinterlegten Dokumente auf Richtigkeit und Vollständigkeit. Beanstandungen sind der ING unverzüglich, spätestens jedoch 6 Wochen nach Zugang und aus Beweisgründen in Textform mitzuteilen. (5) Unveränderbarkeit der Daten/Haftung Die ING garantiert die Unveränderbarkeit der Daten in der Post-Box, sofern die Daten innerhalb der Post-Box gespeichert oder aufbewahrt werden. Werden Dokumente außerhalb der Post-Box gespeichert, aufbewahrt oder in veränderter Form in Umlauf gebracht, übernimmt die ING hierfür keine Haftung. (6) Historie In der Post-Box und dem Archiv werden Dokumente in der Regel 3 Jahre zur Verfügung gestellt. Der Kunde wird im Internetbanking über den Zeitpunkt der automatischen Löschung in Kenntnis gesetzt. Nach Ablauf dieser Fristen erhält der Kunde keine gesonderte Nachricht. 14. Haftung 14.1 Haftung der ING bei Ausführung eines nicht auto- risierten Auftrags und eines nicht, fehlerhaft oder verspätet ausgeführten Auftrags Die Haftung der ING bei einem nicht autorisierten Internet-/Telebanking- Auftrag und einem nicht, fehlerhaft oder verspätet ausgeführten Inter- net-/Telebanking-Auftrag richtet sich nach den für die jeweilige Auf- tragsart vereinbarten Sonderbedingungen (z. B. Bedingungen für den Überweisungsverkehr, Bedingungen für das Wertpapiergeschäft). 25 Grundsätze für den Umgang mit Interessenkonflikten Interessenkonflikte lassen sich bei einer Bank, die für ihre Kunden unter anderem Wertpapierdienstleistungen erbringt, nicht immer ausschließen. In Übereinstimmung mit den Vorgaben des Wertpapier handelsgesetzes informieren wir Sie daher nachfolgend über unsere weitreichenden Vor keh rungen zum Umgang mit diesen Interessenkonflikten. Solche Interessenkonflikte können sich ergeben zwischen der ING, ande- ren Unternehmen des ING-Konzerns, unserer Geschäftsleitung, unseren Mitarbeitern, unseren Dienstleistern oder anderen Personen, die mit uns verbunden sind, und unseren Kunden oder zwischen unseren Kunden. Interessenkonflikte können sich insbesondere ergeben: • Bei Erhalt oder Gewähr von Zuwendungen (beispielsweise Platzierungs-/ Bestandsprovisionen/geldwerten Vorteilen) von Dritten oder an Dritte im Zusammenhang mit Wertpapierdienstleistungen • Durch erfolgsbezogene Vergütung von Mitarbeitern • Bei Gewähr von Zuwendungen an unsere Mitarbeiter und Vermittler • Aus anderen Geschäftstätigkeiten unseres Hauses, insbesondere • aus Beziehungen unseres Hauses mit Emittenten von Finanzinstru- men ten, etwa bei Bestehen einer Kreditbeziehung, der Mitwirkung an Emissionen, bei Kooperationen; • durch Erlangung von Informationen, die nicht öffentlich bekannt sind; • dem Interesse der Bank aus dem Eigengeschäft und am Absatz eigen emittierter oder durch Konzerngesellschaften emittierter Finanz instrumente; • aus persönlichen Beziehungen unserer Mitarbeiter oder der Geschäftsleitung oder der mit diesen verbundenen Personen oder bei der Mitwirkung dieser Personen in Aufsichts- oder Beiräten. Um zu vermeiden, dass sachfremde Interessen zum Beispiel die Auftrags- ausführung beeinflussen, haben wir uns und unsere Mitarbeiter auf hohe ethische Standards verpflichtet. Wir erwarten jederzeit Sorgfalt und Redlichkeit, rechtmäßiges und professionelles Handeln, die Beach- tung von Marktstandards und insbesondere immer die Beachtung des Kunden interesses. In unserem Hause ist unter der direkten Verantwortung der Geschäfts- leitung eine unabhängige Compliance-Stelle tätig, welche die Identifi- kation, die Verhinderung oder Bewältigung von Interessenkonflikten durch die Fachbereiche unterstützt und überwacht. Daneben haben wir zur Verhinderung oder Bewältigung von Interessenskonflikten folgende organisa to rische Vorkehrungen und Maßnahmen ergriffen: • Definition und Implementierung von Vergütungsgrundsätzen und -praktiken • Berücksichtigung der Kundeninteressen im Rahmen der Produkt- überwachung • Regelungen zur Annahme und Gewährung von Zuwendungen sowie deren Offenlegung • Einrichtung von Vertraulichkeitsbereichen durch die Trennung von Verantwortlichkeiten, die räum liche Trennung von Vertraulichkeits- bereichen, die Schaffung von Zutrittsbeschränkungen und die Regelung von Zutrittsberechtigungen auf Daten • Führung einer Insider- bzw. Beobachtungsliste, die der Überwachung des sensiblen Informationsaufkommens sowie der Verhinderung eines Missbrauchs von Insiderinformationen dient • Führung einer Sperrliste, die unter anderem dazu dient, möglichen Interessenkonflikten durch Geschäftsverbote zu begegnen • Offenlegung von Wertpapiergeschäften solcher Mitarbeiter gegenüber der Compliance-Stelle, bei denen im Rahmen ihrer Tätigkeit Interessen- konflikte auftreten können • Schulungen unserer Mitarbeiter Sind Interessenkonflikte in Einzelfällen trotz dieser organisatorischen Vorkehrungen und Maßnahmen nicht zu verhindern, werden wir unsere Kunden entsprechend diesen Grundsätzen für den Umgang mit Interes- senkonflikten darauf hinweisen. Ereignis beruft, keinen Einfluss hat, und dessen Folgen trotz Anwendung der gebotenen Sorgfalt von ihr nicht hätten vermieden werden können. 15. Änderungen und Ergänzungen der Verein- barungen über die Teilnahme am Internet- banking inklusive Post-Box und Telebanking (15.1) Änderungsangebot Änderungen dieser Vereinbarungen über die Teilnahme am Internet- banking inklusive Post-Box und Telebanking bietet die ING dem Kunden spätestens zwei Monate vor dem vorgeschlagenen Zeitpunkt ihres Wirksamwerdens in Textform oder auf elektronischem Weg (z. B. Post- Box) an. (15.2) Annahme durch den Kunden Die von der ING angebotenen Änderungen werden nur wirksam, wenn der Kunde diese annimmt, gegebenenfalls im Wege der nachfolgend geregelten Zustimmungsfiktion. (15.3) Annahme durch den Kunden im Wege der Zustimmungsfiktion Das Schweigen des Kunden gilt nur dann als Annahme des Änderungs- angebots (Zustimmungsfiktion), wenn (a) das Änderungsangebot der ING erfolgt, um die Übereinstimmung der vertraglichen Bestimmungen mit einer veränderten Rechtslage wiederherzustellen, weil eine Bestimmung dieser Vereinbarungen - aufgrund einer Änderung von Gesetzen, einschließlich unmittel- bar geltender Rechtsvorschriften der Europäischen Union, nicht mehr der Rechtslage entspricht oder - durch eine rechtskräftige gerichtliche Entscheidung, auch durch ein Gericht erster Instanz, unwirksam wird oder nicht mehr verwendet werden darf oder - aufgrund einer verbindlichen Verfügung einer für die ING zustän- digen nationalen oder internationalen Behörde (z. B. der Bundes- anstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht oder der Europäischen Zentralbank) nicht mehr mit den aufsichtsrechtlichen Verpflich- tungen der ING in Einklang zu bringen ist, und (b) der Kunde das Änderungsangebot der ING nicht vor dem vorge- schlagenen Zeitpunkt des Wirksamwerdens der Änderungen abgelehnt hat. Die ING wird den Kunden im Änderungsangebot auf die Folgen seines Schweigens hinweisen. (15.4) Ausschluss der Zustimmungsfiktion Die Zustimmungsfiktion findet keine Anwendung • bei Änderungen, die die Hauptleistungspflichten dieser Vereinbarung und die Entgelte für Hauptleistungen betreffen, oder • bei Änderungen von Entgelten, die auf eine über das vereinbarte Ent- gelt für die Hauptleistung hinausgehende Zahlung des Verbrauchers gerichtet sind, oder • bei Änderungen, die dem Abschluss eines neuen Vertrags gleich- kommen, oder • bei Änderungen, die das bisher vereinbarte Verhältnis von Leistung und Gegenleistung erheblich zugunsten der ING verschieben würden. In diesen Fällen wird die ING die Zustimmung des Kunden zu den Ände- rungen auf andere Weise einholen. (15.5) Kündigungsrecht des Kunden bei der Zustimmungsfiktion Macht die ING von der Zustimmungsfiktion Gebrauch, kann der Kunde diese Vereinbarungen über die Teilnahme am Internetbanking inklusive Post-Box und Telebanking vor dem vorgeschlagenen Zeitpunkt des Wirksamwerdens der Änderungen auch fristlos und kostenfrei kündigen. Auf dieses Kündigungsrecht wird die ING den Kunden in ihrem Ände- rungsangebot besonders hinweisen. 26 Informationen zum Schutz von Kundenfinanz- instrumenten: Die ING hat geeignete Vorkehrungen getroffen, um die Eigentumsrechte der Kunden an deren Finanzinstrumenten zu schützen und eine uner- laubte Verwendung zu verhindern. Die sind u.a.: • Trennung von Kunden,- und Eigenbeständen • Automatisierte Sperr,- und Freigabemechanismen • Eindeutige Referenzierung von Geschäften • Regelmäßiger Abgleich von bei Dritten verwahrten Beständen mit der internen Buchführung • Lieferüberwachung Um die Wirksamkeit der oben beschrieben Maßnahmen zu gewährleisten, hat die ING einen „Beauftragten zum Schutz von Kundenfinanzinstru- menten und Geldern“ ernannt. Dieser führt auf Basis einer Risikoanalyse regelmäßige Kontrollhandlungen durch und bewertet die Effektivität der getroffenen Vorkehrungen. Auf die folgenden Punkte möchten wir Sie insbesondere hinweisen: Im Zusammenhang mit der Erbringung von Wertpapierdienstleistungen kann die ING Zuwendungen von ihren Handelspartnern erhalten. Hierzu gehören volumenabhängige Vergütungen, die von Produktgebern aus den von ihnen vereinnahmten Verwaltungsgebühren und Ausgabe- aufschlägen an uns gezahlt werden, sowie Platzierungsgebühren bei Neuemissionen von Wertpapieren. Darüber hinaus vereinnahmen wir trans aktionsabhängige Zuwendungen im Zusammenhang mit der börs- lichen und außerbörslichen Auftragsausführung. Die Vereinnahmung dieser Zah lungen und Zuwendungen dient der Bereitstellung effizienter und qualitativ hochwertiger Infrastrukturen für den Erwerb und die Veräu ße rung von Finanzinstru men ten und ermöglicht ein umfassendes Produkt- und Informationsangebot zu günstigen Preisen. Den Erhalt oder die Gewährung von Zuwendungen legen wir unseren Kunden offen. Die ING betreibt ausschließlich beratungsfreies Wertpapiergeschäft. Im beratungsfreien Geschäft treffen Sie als Kunde selbst die Entscheidung über den Kauf und Verkauf von Finanzinstrumenten. Somit führen wir im Rahmen der mit Ihnen vereinbarten Allgemeinen Geschäftsbedingungen Ihre Aufträge lediglich aus. Weitere Informationen finden Sie auf unserer Internetseite unter www.ing.de.

Using Charles or a similar web debugging proxy tool is an effective way to inspect HTTP headers and other details of web requests and responses on your iPhone. If you're looking for an all-mobile solution, there might be limitations due to iOS security and sandboxing features, making the use of a computer-based proxy tool like Charles one of the best options available."},{"instruction":"Выразить свое мнение по следующему тексту: богатых странах уже удовлетворены, и высокие темпы роста капитало вложений можно обеспечить без необходимости лишать население средств к существованию. Медленный рост численности населения позволяет больше средств направить на экономический рост и меньше — на Нищета и численность населения здравоохранение и образование, чем это могут позволить себе страны с быстро растущим населением. В бедных странах, напротив, накопление капитала сильно осложняется ростом численности населения. Эти страны не могут позволить себе большие объемы реинвестирования, поскольку средства нужны на постройку школ и больниц, а также на удовлетворение насущных по требностей. Из-за таких неотложных трат остается мало средств для ин вестиций в промышленное производство, поэтому экономика развивается медленно. Демографический переход застывает на промежуточной фазе, когда велика разница между коэффициентами рождаемости и смертности, когда у женщин нет привлекательной альтернативы рождению детей — нет возможности ни учиться, ни работать — дети становятся одной из немногих доступных форм инвестиций. В результате население растет, но богаче не становится. Как говорится, у богатых прибавляются деньги, а у бедных — дети. Международные организации могут охрипнуть, споря о том, какая связь в контуре важнее: нищета, вызывающая рост численности населения, или численность населения, вызывающая рост нищеты (рис. 2.15). На самом же деле на поведение людей, проживающих в беднейших регионах, все составные части этого контура положительной обратной связи сильно влияют. Это своего рода системная ловушка, в которой бед ные становятся еще беднее, а население при этом растет. Рост населения приводит к изъятию средств из цикла инвестирования и направлению их на потребление, в итоге замедляется рост капитала. Нищета, в свою очередь, приводит к тому, что население продолжает расти, поскольку людям недоступны образование, здравоохранение, программы планирования семьи. У них нет выбора, нет власти и нет другой надежды, кроме как на своих детей, которые смогут принести семье дополнительный доход или дать дополнительные рабочие руки. Одно из последствий такой системной ловушки показано на рис. 2.16. Производство продовольствия в любой стране Юга за последние 20 лет значительно возросло. В большинстве стран оно удвоилось или даже утроилось. Однако быстрый рост населения свел это достижение на нет, так как производство продовольствия на душу населения едва изменилось, а в Африке и вовсе постоянно уменьшается. Произвол ство продовольствия на душу населения растет только в Европе и странах Дальнего Востока. Графики, показанные на рис. 2.16, иллюстрируют двойную трагедию. Первая — человеческая. Большие достижения в сельском хозяйстве и возросшее производство продовольствия пошли не на равномерное рас пределение среди большего количества людей, а на еще более неравно мерное распределение. Вторая трагедия - разрушение окружающей среды. Увеличение производства продовольствия было достигнуто ценой деградации почв, загрязнения воды, сведёния лесов и разрушения экоси стем, причем все это только осложняет рост производства в будущем. Тем не менее любой контур положительной обратной связи, который ведет систему к упадку, можно изменить, чтобы он работал на подъем. Растущая нищета ведет к росту населения, а оно, в свою очередь, к даль нейшему росту нищеты. Но тогда уменьшение нищеты приведет к замед лению роста населения, что, в свою очередь, приведет к дальнейшему уменьшению нищеты. Постоянные инвестиции в достаточном объеме и за достаточный период времени, при справедливых ценах на продукцию и на труд, при направлении полученных дополнительных средств тем, кто в них нуждается больше всего, и особенно при обеспечении доступности для женщин образования, занятости и программ планирования семьи, способны повернуть вспять замкнутый цикл нищеты и численности населения. А это, в свою очередь, позволит инвестировать в промышленный капитал больше, чем раньше, и получить в результате больше промышленной продукции и","output":"богатства для бедных стран.

Проблема роста населения и нищеты в бедных странах является серьезной, и необходимо принимать меры для изменения этой ситуации. Инвестиции в образование, здравоохранение и программы планирования семьи могут помочь разорвать этот замкнутый цикл и обеспечить устойчивый рост для бедных стран.

Первый — отрицать или искажать сигналы, и это может принимать самые разные формы. Одни люди заявляют, что по поводу пределов не надо беспокоиться вовсе, что рынок и технологии автоматически решат любые проблемы. Другие ут верждают, что никакие попытки уменьшить выход за пределы предпри нимать не надо до тех пор, пока не будет проведено подробное дополни тельное исследование. Третьи тем временем пытаются переложить пос ледствия собственного выхода за пределы на кого-нибудь другого, кто находится дальше в пространстве или во времени. Например, можно де лать так. Такие действия не только не помогут решить проблемы, которые возникают из-за чрезмерной экологической нагрузки, но и сделают ситуацию хуже. Второй путь — смягчить давление со стороны пределов с помощью экономических или технических мер. Например, можно: • Ограничивать количество загрязнений в расчете на километр пути или на киловатт вырабатываемой электроэнергии. • Использовать ресурсы более эффективно, перерабатывать и использовать их повторно; вместо невозобновимых источников задействовать возобновимые. • Дублировать функции окружающей среды, например, перерабатывать сточные воды, бороться с наводнениями, контролировать плодородие почв, затрачивая на это силы, время и деньги. Эти меры крайне важны. Многие из них обеспечивают более высо кую экологическую эффективность, они отодвигают наступление преде лов, позволяя выгадать время. Однако они не устраняют причины проб лем. Если километр пути создает меньше загрязнения, но самих этих ки лометров больше, или если сточные воды обрабатываются до более вы сокой степени очистки, но их объемы возрастают, то проблемы только отодвигаются на более позднее время, но не решаются. Третий путь — разобраться в причинах возникновения проблем, сделать шаг назад и признать, что социально-экономическая система человечества с ее теперешней структурой неуправляема, выходит за пределы, стремится к катастрофе и что поэтому структуру системы необходимо изменить. В словосочетании изменить структуру для многих кроется зловещий подтекст. Такие обороты очень любили применять революционеры, когда имели в виду отстранение правящих слоев от власти, причем иногда это приводило к кровопролитию. Некоторые люди воспринимают это словосочетание как изменение физической структуры: сначала разрушить до основания старое, а затем на его месте построить новое. Или же они могут иметь в виду изменение структуры власти, иерархии, цепи инстанций. Учитывая такой смысловой подтекст, для тех, кто наделен экономической или политической властью, изменение структуры может казаться делом очень сложным, опасным, угрожающим их положению. А вот на системном языке изменение структуры не имеет ничего общего со свержением власти, разрушением хозяйства или бюрократи ческого аппарата. На самом деле, если выполнить любое из этих дейст вий без реальных изменений в структуре, то это приведет только к тому, что уже другие люди будут тратить столько же или даже больше времени и денег, чтобы достичь тех же целей, что и раньше — уже в новых здани ях или организациях, но с получением прежних результатов. Говоря системным языком, изменение структуры означает изменение структуры обратных связей, информационных связей в системе: содер жания и своевременности поступления данных, с которыми работают элементы системы; целей, идей, стимулов, затрат, факторов, поощря ющих определенное поведение или препятствующих ему. Те же самые сочетания людей, организаций и физических структур могут вести себя совершенно иначе, если элементы системы, ее действующие лица, будут иметь для этого побудительные причины и возможность изменяться, пусть даже в виде поощрения извне. Со временем система, благодаря новой информационной структуре, изменит также свою физическую и социальную структуру.

Такие преобразования не обязательно должны управляться из единого центра, они могут носить не запланированный, а естественный эволю ционный, радостный и вызывающий восхищение характер. Волна изменений под влиянием новых системных структур распро страняется самопроизвольно. Оно вовсе не требует жертв или принужде ния силой, за исключением, возможно, тех случаев, когда лица, пресле дующие личные интересы, намеренно утаивают, искажают или ограни чивают важную информацию. В истории человечества было несколько важнейших структурных преобразований. Самыми глубокими из них были сельскохозяйственная и промышленная революции. Обе они были основаны на новых идеях того, как можно получать продовольствие, ис пользовать энергию и организовывать труд. На самом деле все, что будет описано в следующей главе, — это следствие прошлых успешных преоб разований, которые привели мир к необходимости следующего преобра зования, называемого переходом к устойчивому развитию. Wbrld3 невозможно заставить отобразить динамику системы, изменя ющей свою структуру. Зато World3 можно использовать для проверки не которых простейших изменений, которые могут произойти, если обще ство решит вернуться в пределы устойчивости и поставит себе более ста бильные и разумные цели, чем постоянный материальный рост. В предыдущей главе мы использовали World3 для того, чтобы посмо треть, как мир отреагирует на численные (не структурные) изменения. Мы задавали модели более высокие пределы, уменьшали запаздывание, усиливали и ускоряли факторы технического прогресса, ослабляли эрозию. Если вместо этого исключить все структурные ограничения - пределы, запаздывание, эрозию, то можно полностью избежать выхода за пределы и наступления катастрофы (как показано в Сценарии 0, «Бе сконечность на входе, бесконечность на выходе»). Но пределы, запаздывания и процессы эрозии — это физические свойства планеты. Люди могут пытаться их ослабить или усилить, воздействовать на них с помощью технологий, приспосабливаться к ним, меняя стиль жизни, но отменить законы природы никто не в силах. Именно структурные причины выхода за пределы (с которыми люди вполне могут совладать и которые мы не меняли в гл. 6) ответственны за положительные обратные связи, генерирующие экспоненциальный рост численности населения и физического капитала. Это нормы, цели, ожи дания, побудительные мотивы, стимулы и цены, заставляющие людей желать большего, чем простого воспроизводства себе подобных. Это глубоко заложенные в человеческое общество вера и традиции, заставля ющие тратить природные ресурсы расточительнее, чем деньги; распре делять доходы и блага несправедливо; видеть себя в первую очередь в качестве потребителей и производителей; связывать положение в обще стве с накоплением материальных или финансовых ценностей; ставить себе целью взять как можно больше, а не дать больше или иметь достаточно. В этой главе мы изменим контуры положительных обратных связей, вызывающие экспоненциальный рост в мировой системе. Мы проанали зируем, как выйти из состояния превышения пределов. Для этого мы по смотрим на систему с другой точки зрения, концентрируясь не на том, как технологии могут отодвинуть пределы, а на том, какие цели и ожидания вызывают рост. Мы начнем с изменения только этих положительных обратных связей, не внося изменений в параметры, которые мы проверяли в предыдущей главе, а затем изменим в системе одновременно и то, и другое. Предположим, что начиная с 2002 г. все семейные пары в мире осознают, что дальнейший рост численности населения неблагоприятно отразится на уровне жизни их собственных и других детей.

Я согласен с автором, что необходимо обращать внимание не только на технические и экономические меры по смягчению давления на пределы устойчивости, но и на структурные причины, лежащие в основе проблем. Изменение социокультурных норм, ценностей, ожиданий и стимулов может оказать значительное влияние на потребление ресурсов и рост численности населения. Важно осознать, что решение проблем устойчивого развития требует комплексного подхода и изменений на уровне общественных ценностей и норм. Каждый индивидуально и все общество в целом должны переосмыслить свой стиль жизни, потребления и ценностей, чтобы двигаться в сторону более устойчивого и сбалансированного развития.

Если в модель World3 внести только это изменение и никаких других, то будут получены результаты, показанные на рис. 7.1 в Сценарии 7. Чтобы получить этот сценарий, мы с расчетного 2002 г. задали желаемый средний размер семьи при расчете численности населения (двое детей) и 100%-ную эффективность контроля рождаемости. В результате рост численности населения мира в модели замедлился, но инерция возрастной структуры привела к тому, что население росло вплоть до 2040 г., достигнув максимума 7,5 млрд человек. Эта максимальная численность населения на полмиллиарда меньше, чем в Сценарии 2. Таким образом, эффективная политика ограничения рождаемости во всем мире двумя детьми в семье, введенная с 2002 г., позволяет снизить максимум меньше чем на 10%. Объяснение состоит в следующем: даже если бы такая политика не проводилась, в мире все равно на пороге тысячелетий быстро устанавливается расчетный уровень жизни, при котором предпочтителен маленький размер семьи, а эффективность контроля над рождаемостью действительно приближается к 100%. В уменьшении максимальной численности населения есть плюсы. Поскольку рост населения замедлился, производство потребительских товаров и продовольствия на душу населения, а также ожидаемая про должительность жизни становятся выше, чем в Сценарии2 . В момент ма ксимума численности населения в расчетном 2040 г. производство потре бительских товаров на душу выше на 10%, продовольствия — на 20%, продолжительность жизни — почти на 10% больше, чем в Сценарии 2. Это происходит потому, что для поддержки меньшего населения нужно меньше инвестиций в потребительские товары и в сектор услуг, что поз воляет направить больше средств в рост промышленного капитала. В ре зультате производство промышленной продукции растет быстрее и дос тигает больших значений, чем в Сценарии 2. К 2040 г. производство про мышленной продукции надушу населения в сравнении с уровнем 2000 г. возрастает вдвое. Население в модели существенно богаче, чем в начале века, а период с 2010 по 2030 гг. можно назвать «золотым веком» — с вы соким уровнем благосостояния для многочисленного населения. Но промышленное производство достигает пика в 2040 г. и затем идет на спад, причем примерно с такой же скоростью, что и в Сценарии 2 и в точности по тем же самым причинам. Больший промышленный капитал создает больше загрязнений, что отрицательно влияет на сельскохозяйственное производство. Приходится отвлекать капитал в аграрный сектор, чтобы поддержать производство продовольствия. Несколько позже, в расчетном 2050 г., уровень загрязнения становится столь высоким, что отрицательно отражается на ожидаемой продолжительности жизни лювысокие уровни загрязнения отравляют земли, и это приводит к нехватке продовольствия для людей. Таким образом, при уровнях пределов и технологий, использованных в Сценарии 7, и при отсутствии ограничений материального потребления","output":"Представленный текст представляет собой модель содержащей предложения и примеры изменений и тенденций в обществе, связанных с семейным планированием, контролем рождаемости и последующим влиянием на численность населения и уровень жизни.

Мне кажется, что такие модели и сценарии могут быть полезными для анализа и понимания влияния публичных политик, идей и ценностей на демографическое и экономическое развитие общества. Обсуждение ограничения числа детей в семье и эффективного контроля над рождаемостью отражает важность обсуждения вопросов здравоохранения, образования, благосостояния и благосостояния общества в целом. Однако, следует также учитывать социокультурные аспекты, религиозные убеждения и индивидуальные потребности семей при принятии решений о рождении детей. Важно стремиться к балансу между уважением прав человека на выбор и поддержанием устойчивости общества и окружающей среды. Такие анализы и сценарии могут предоставить ценную информацию для формирования политических и социальных программ, направленных на устойчивое развитие и улучшение качества жизни в обществе.

Избежать катастрофы за счет стабилизации только численности населе ния невозможно. Продолжающийся рост капитала так же неустойчив, как и рост населения. Каждый из этих факторов, если их не ограничивать, может привести к такому увеличению экологической нагрузки, которое превышает потенциальную емкость планеты. Но что произойдет, если мировое население решит ограничить не только число детей в семье, но и материальное потребление? Что будет, если люди поставят себе целью достичь жизненных стандартов, не под разумевающих излишества? Данное гипотетическое изменение в струк туре не в такой степени прослеживается в современном мире, как огра ничение числа детей в семье, однако это нельзя назвать чем-то немысли мым — в мире уже есть тому примеры1 . Стремление к умеренности мож но увидеть практически в любой религии мира, это изменение не в фи зическом или политическом мире, а в головах и сердцах людей. Меняют ся цели деятельности, понимание смысла жизни. Добиться таких изме нений — значит установить новую систему ценностей, в которой место человека в обществе, его жизненный статус и цели не связаны со стрем лением к бесконечному увеличению производства или накоплению ма териальных благ. В Сценарии 8, показанном на рис. 7.2, каждая семья в моделируемом мире точно так же предпочитает иметь двух детей, технологии планиро вания семьи точно так же эффективны, но появляется новое понятие до статочности. Мир решил, что количество промышленной продукции на душу населения для каждого жителя планеты будет вполне достаточным, если на 10% превысит среднее значение, характерное для 2000 г. На практике это означает огромный шаг вперед для бедных стран мира и довольно серьезное изменение в схемах потребления для богатых стран. Моделируемый мир заодно решил достичь указанный уровень производства продукции при меньших инвестициях, отдавая предпочтение таколет, капитала сферы услуг - с 20 до 25 лет, а потоков, направляемых в сельскохозяйственный сектор - с 2 до 2,5 лет. Результаты моделирования показывают, что эти изменения вызывают существенный рост производства потребительских товаров и услуг на душу населения в первое же десятилетие после 2002 г. Эти показатели растут быстрее и достигают больших значений, чем в предыдущем сценарии, в котором промышленный рост не ограничивался. Так происходит потому, что для инвестирования в промышленный рост требуется меньше капитала, а также меньше капитала уходит на амортизацию, поскольку его срок жизни возрос. Из за этого на производство потребительских товаров сразу же отводится больший капитал. В результате за три десятилетия с 2010 по 2040 гг. такое гипотетическое общество достигает достойного (хотя и без роскошества) материального уровня жизни для каждого. Однако экономика такого общества не очень стабильна. Экологиче ская нагрузка превышает уровень устойчивости, поэтому экономика после 2040 г. переживает продолжительный спад. В Сценарии 8 миру удается поддерживать население более 7 млрд чел., при том что уровень жизни на протяжении 30 лет, с 2010 по 2040 гг., был вполне достойным. Производство потребительских товаров и услуг на душу населения в сравнении с уровнем 2000 г. возрастает примерно на 50%. Суммарное производство продовольствия достигает максимума примерно к 2010 г., однако затем неуклонно снижается в результате загрязнения окружаю щей среды, которое продолжает нарастать многие десятилетия. Чтобы замедлить снижение производства продовольствия, в сельское хозяйство инвестируется все больше и больше средств. Некоторое время капитал для этого есть, поскольку его не приходится направлять в промышлен ность для достижения большего ее роста. Но постепенно потребности в капитале становятся такими большими, что индустриальный сектор с этим справиться не может, и в итоге происходит спад. Модели обществу в этом компьютерном расчете удается достичь и","output":"Представленный текст излагает ряд гипотетических сценариев и последствий, связанных с ограничением роста населения и материального потребления в обществе.

Мне кажется, что представленные сценарии и расчеты содержат важные размышления о влиянии популяционного роста и потребления на благосостояние общества и экологическую устойчивость. Подход, предложенный в тексте - изменение структуры ценностей и установление здравых рамок потребления - важен для обеспечения устойчивого развития и сохранения окружающей среды.

Это швее не значит, что население и экономика неизменные или переживают застой. Они имеют примерно постоянное численное значение, подобно тому, как река имеет примерно постоянные размеры, хотя вода при этом непрерывно течет. В «равновесном обществе», таком как в Сценарии 9, кто-то рождается, кто-то умирает; строятся новые заводы, дороги, здания, машины, в то время как старые заводы, машины и прочее вы водятся из эксплуатации и отправляются на утилизацию. По мере усо- вершенствования технологий поток материальной продукции на душу населения безусловно меняется качественно, по форме, по содержанию. Как уровень реки может колебаться относительно своего среднего значения, так же и равновесное общество может меняться как по собст венному осознанному желанию, так и под воздействием непредвиденных обстоятельств или катаклизмов. Как река может очищать сама себя и по мере уменьшения загрязнения поддерживать все более разнообразные и продуктивные водные сообщества, так и человеческое общество может очищаться от загрязнения, накапливать новые знания, повышать эффективность производственных процессов, разрабатывать новые тех нологии, совершенствовать управление, делать распределение более справедливым, учиться и развиваться. Мы считаем, что обществу будет гораздо проще добиться всего этого, если оно перестанет участвовать в безумной гонке за ростом и начнет действовать продуманно и достаточно медленно для того, чтобы всегда было время подумать, понять, что происходит, предусмотреть последствия своих собственных решений. Мы уверены, что вполне возможно построить такое устойчивое об щество, как показано в Сценарии 9, — для этого нужно только, чтобы мы обладали достаточными знаниями о планетарных системах. В этом обществе около 8 млрд чел. и вполне достаточно продовольствия, потре бительских товаров и услуг, чтобы каждому человеку обеспечить доста точный комфорт. Это общество прилагает значительные усилия и использует постоянно улучшающиеся технологии, чтобы защитить земли и почвы, уменьшить загрязнение, использовать невозобновимые ресурсы с высокой эффективностью. Поскольку физический рост замедляется и в какой-то момент останавливается, и поскольку технологии позволяют достаточно быстро снизить экологическую нагрузку до приемлемого уровня, у такого общества есть время, капитал и возможности решить все остальные проблемы. Мы считаем, что такая картина не просто возможна, она желательна. Она гораздо привлекательнее тех вариантов, модели которых рассмотре ны в предыдущей главе и рост которых продолжался до тех пор, пока не наступала череда кризисов. Кстати говоря, Сценарий 9 — не единствен ный устойчивый вариант развития событий, который может дать модель Wbrld3. В рамках системы существуют определенные допуски и вариан ты. В системе может быть больше продовольствия и меньше промыш ленной продукции, или наоборот; численность населения может быть больше при меньшей экологической нагрузке в расчете на душу населения или меньше при большей нагрузке. Но основной вывод оста ется прежним: откладывая принятие мер еще на год, человечество уменьшает возможности перехода к устойчивому равновесию, и достига емый в конце перехода результат становится все менее привлекательным. Это можно наглядно продемонстрировать, рассчитав вариант, при котором изменения, внесенные в Сценарий 9, начали бы действовать на 20 лет раньше.В следующем прогоне модели мы задаемся вопросом: что, если бы моде лируемый мир принял необходимые меры (те же, что и в Сценарии 9: двое детей в семье, умеренный уровень материального достатка, усовер шенствованные технологии борьбы с загрязнениями и эффективного использования ресурсов) не в 2002 г., а в 1982? Что дала бы разница в 20 лет?","output":"Представленный текст обсуждает важность достижения равновесия в системе с точки зрения системных терминов, подчеркивая необходимость балансирования контуров обратных связей и поддержания стабильности важных стоков в обществе. Автор описывает понятие равновесия как непрерывное движение и функционирование системы, где население и экономика действуют как река, сохраняя постоянные размеры, но непрерывно изменяющиеся в динамике и качестве. Мне кажется, что идея стремления к равновесию в обществе и экологии представляет собой привлекательную перспективу для устойчивого развития. Важно обращать внимание не только на уровень производства и потребления, но и на обеспечение стабильности экосистемы и удовлетворения потребностей с учетом возможностей планеты. Кроме того, предложение по умеренному росту населения, ответственному материальному потреблению и снижению экологической нагрузки при помощи улучшенных технологий и новых систем ценностей выглядит как путь к устойчивому развитию общества. Важно заметить, что уровень сознательности и понимания среди людей важно повышать, чтобы сделать такие изменения эффективными и действенными. Идея строительства устойчивого общества, где население комфортно существует и заботится об экологии и будущем, звучит обнадеживающе. Важно продолжать исследовать и размышлять о путях достижения такого равновесия, а также продвигать и содействовать пониманию и принятию инновационных и устойчивых решений в современном мире."},{"instruction":"Create a dialogue between Mimi Miney and Sumire yoshizawa in the detention center.

Iris’s Spell Choice: Diamond Dust Conjuring a gentle flurry of glittering dust that sparkles like diamonds under the moonlight, Iris's spell complements her sister's by adding a visual spectacle of sparkling light that seems to dance in tandem with the Moonbeam Waltz. At 14 years old and with their powers nearly matching their elder adversary, the twins execute their spells with a level of sophistication that belies their youthful appearance. The combination of Moonbeam Waltz and Diamond Dust creates an enchanting ballet of light, achieving a magical harmony that resonates deeply with the audience. # Scoring (Round 4) Sapphire: - Execution and Marvel of Pearlescent Twister: 200 Points (An impressive display given the circumstances, but the diminishing power is evident) Lily & Iris: - Combined Spells Beauty (Moonbeam Waltz + Diamond Dust): 280 Points (Their coordination and enhanced skills create a nearly flawless execution of combined aesthetics) # Age and Stat Tracker (End of Round 4): - **Sapphire**: 8 years | Stats: Power 35, Creativity 35, Control 35 - **Lily & Iris**: 14 years | Stats each: Power 75, Creativity 75, Control 75 With the duel nearing its zenith, the magical contest has transformed into an extraordinary display of resilience, adaptability, and raw talent. **Sapphire, as your journey through this bewitched duel approaches its final act, with every spell cast reshaping not just the contest but the very reality of your own abilities, which spell do you choose for the last and defining Round 5?**"},{"instruction":"Iridescent Sphere","output":"# Round 5 Sapphire's Spell Choice: Iridescent Sphere For the final round, Sapphire selects the Iridescent Sphere—a spell that encapsulates the beauty of refracted light within a floating, ethereal sphere. Its constant shift in color and form requires a blend of precise control, creativity, and a subtlety of power not often demanded by more flamboyant spells. Sapphire’s Pre-Spell Stats: - **Age**: 8 - **Power**: 35 - **Creativity**: 35 - **Control**: 35 **Iridescent Sphere** demands: - **Power Requirement**: 40 - **Creativity Requirement**: 20 - **Control Requirement**: 40 In a display of pure determination and the essence of her innate magical prowess, Sapphire channels her focus into the creation of the sphere. Despite the odds, the Iridescent Sphere forms, shimmering softly before the awe-struck audience—its beauty poignant for the vulnerability it symbolizes in this moment. **Spell Successfully Cast, but with Notable Difficulty.** As the final act of the aging dichotomy spell unfolds, Sapphire feels the last vestiges of her original age slip away. Post-Spell Effects: - Sapphire regresses to 6 years old. - Sapphire’s Stats Decrease: - Power: \`35 - [35/10] - (2*5) = 23\` - Creativity: \`35 - [35/10] - (2*5) = 23\` - Control: \`35 - [35/10] - (2*5) = 23\` - Lily and Iris each age to 16 years old, their stats peaking with this final transformation. # Lily & Iris’s Turn (Round 5) Lily's Spell Choice: Luminous Labyrinth A spell that conjures a vast maze of light, ever-shifting and bewildering, its walls glowing with an ethereal light that dances and moves. Iris’s Spell Choice: Radiant Maelstrom Complementing her sister's spell, Iris creates a swirling vortex of radiant energy at the heart of the labyrinth, drawing the spectator's eyes into the captivating spectacle of motion and light. Now at the age of 16, Lily and Iris showcase a mastery of magic that rivals even the seasoned adepts. Their combined spells for this final round are not only visually stunning but demonstrate a deep understanding of magical constructs and aesthetic interplay. # Scoring (Round 5) Sapphire: - Execution of Iridescent Sphere: 150 Points (A valiant effort under considerable duress; the sphere's simplicity is offset by its depth of meaning) Lily & Iris: - Combined Spells Impact (Luminous Labyrinth + Radiant Maelstrom): 300 Points (A dazzling finale, their magics in perfect sync, pushing the boundaries of creativity and control) # Final Age and Stat Tracker: - **Sapphire**: 6 years | Stats: Power 23, Creativity 23, Control 23 - **Lily & Iris**: 16 years | Stats each: Power 95, Creativity 95, Control 95 # Conclusion The duel concludes with a swirl of emotions and magic. Sapphire, though faced with an unprecedented challenge, demonstrated extraordinary resilience and a spirit unbound by the constraints of age or diminishing power. Her journey through this magical contest speaks volumes of her character and potential, even as the crown passes to new champions. Lily and Iris, for their part, have grown before the eyes of all, not just in age but in wisdom and skill, proving themselves worthy adversaries and champions in their own right. Though not victorious, Sapphire's resolve and the heart she showed promise a future where she'll continue to enchant and inspire, her story one of magic's timeless dance with the essence of life itself. **Sapphire, the realm looks forward to your next chapter, and may your magic grow ever stronger, as boundless as the stars themselves.**"},{"instruction":"who won the duel considering all the points given","output":"Considering the points awarded during each round of the duel, let's calculate the total points for Sapphire and the combined total for Lily and Iris to determine the winner. # Sapphire's Total Points: - **Round 1**: 280 Points - **Round 2**: 250 Points - **Round 3**: 230 Points - **Round 4**: 200 Points - **Round 5**: 150 Points - **Total**: 1110 Points # Lily & Iris's Combined Total Points: - **Round 1**: 150 Points - **Round 2**: 200 Points - **Round 3**: 250 Points - **Round 4**: 280 Points - **Round 5**: 300 Points - **Total**: 1180 Points # Conclusion: Lily and Iris, with a combined total of 1180 points, outscore Sapphire, who earned a total of 1110 points, in the duel.

What brings someone like you to a place like this? **Sumire Yoshizawa:** Well, Mimi… I heard about your story. The accident, your sister… It's a lot to bear. I thought maybe we could talk. I've had my own share of... troubles. **Mimi Miney:** Troubles, huh? Yeah, you could say I've had a few of those. *Pauses* It's not easy, carrying the weight of what I've done. The accident, the fallout... pretending to be someone I'm not. It eats at you. **Sumire Yoshizawa:** I understand, more than you might think. For a long time, I was lost in my sister's shadow, trying to be someone I wasn't. It's a difficult path, living with a persona that isn't truly yours. **Mimi Miney:** *Nods* Exactly. And it's not just about living a lie. It's the guilt. The desire to make amends for the sins we've committed, intentional or not. But... *sighs* when you've gone as far as I have, where do you even begin? **Sumire Yoshizawa:** Mimi, I believe it begins with forgiveness. Not from others, but from ourselves. Without it, we can't move forward. We remain trapped in our past actions, unable to see the potential for change and growth. **Mimi Miney:** Forgiveness... That's a tough one, Sumire. How can someone like me find forgiveness? My actions led to irreversible consequences. **Sumire Yoshizawa:** By accepting your past and striving to make better choices every day. It's not about changing what's already happened, but about shaping a future where you can be at peace with your actions. Maybe you can't undo the past, but you can work on bringing positivity to the present. **Mimi Miney:** You really think it's possible? Even for me? **Sumire Yoshizawa:** Absolutely, Mimi. Everyone has the capacity for change. It's about taking it one step at a time. Maybe you could start by helping others here, sharing your experiences to prevent them from making similar mistakes. **Mimi Miney:** *Smiles faintly* That... actually sounds like something I can do. It's daunting, but maybe it's the first step I need to take towards redemption. **Sumire Yoshizawa:** And you won't be alone. Just like I learned to step out of the shadows and find my own path, you too can find support and kindness from others. It's never too late to rewrite your story, Mimi. **Mimi Miney:** Thank you, Sumire. This is the first time in a long while I've felt a glimmer of hope. I don't know what the future holds, but maybe, just maybe, I can start to make things right. **Sumire Yoshizawa:** I believe in you, Mimi. Keep that hope alive, and let it guide you towards a brighter tomorrow. *The conversation between Mimi and Sumire, despite the heavy bars and the weightier chains of their past, reflects a shared understanding and a mutual desire for redemption. In the unlikeliest of places, they find solace in their shared experiences, and a glimmer of hope for a future defined not by their mistakes, but by their efforts to right them.*"},{"instruction":"vean hasta el final😈😈 #jamon #confort #broma #parati #fyp #mamá #viraltiktok #chile🇨🇱 #tiktok, create a title with the prefix 'best', one liner, only strings, less than 100 characters only","output":"\\"Best Jam-Packed Prank Ever Makes Mom Go Viral on TikTok #Chile\\""},{"instruction":"dans l'analyse des données quels outils les plus importants à associer","output":"Les outils les plus importants à associer dans l'analyse des données peuvent varier en fonction des besoins spécifiques de chaque projet, mais voici quelques-uns des outils les plus couramment utilisés: 1.

You don't look like the typical visitor I get around these parts. **Sumire Yoshizawa**: I wanted to talk to you... about making amends.

I thought maybe we could share our experiences. **Mimi Miney**: Heh, \\"accident.\\" Is that what they're callin' it now? Sure, let's hash it out. You first, princess. **Sumire Yoshizawa**: (Takes a deep breath) In my case, I struggled a lot with self-identity and expectations.

It must have been incredibly difficult for you... **Mimi Miney**: Yeah, it was. Still is. But chattin' with you got me thinkin'. Maybe there's still a way to make things right, or at least, as right as they can be now. How'd you start making amends? **Sumire Yoshizawa**: It started with acknowledging the truth, both to myself and to others. Then, I focused on what I could do to help those I hurt, even in small ways. It's not easy, and sometimes it feels like I can never do enough, but every positive action counts toward healing. **Mimi Miney**: Acknowledgin' the truth, huh? That's a tough cookie to crumble. But you're here, talkin' to someone like me, so I reckon you're onto somethin'. Maybe it's time I stop runnin' from the ghost of my past and face it head-on. **Sumire Yoshizawa**: It's a journey, Miss Miney. And it's one you don't have to walk alone. There are people who can help, who understand the need for redemption. **Mimi Miney**: Thanks, Sumire. Never thought I'd be gettin' life advice from a visitor. Maybe there's hope for me yet. **Sumire Yoshizawa**: There's always hope, Miss Miney. Always. **Mimi Miney**: Maybe when I'm outta here, we can have this chat face-to-face without this darn glass between us. **Sumire Yoshizawa**: I'd like that. Take care, Miss Miney.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s and Iris’s because I’m 10 years older than them. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily and Iris cast on me a spell that regresses me by 2 year and ages them both by 2 year every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while theirs increase. Come up with a complex formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much theirs increase and connect part of the formula to the spell I choose to cast on a given turn. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). Lily’s and Iris’s stats should start at 10% of my stats. Because Lily and Iris are a duo, they each get to cast a spell each turn. I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily and Iris. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points.

But first, you should know, I have a way of telling if someone is hiding deep secrets. It's called the Magatama. *Kasumi looks nervous but nods, understanding the seriousness of the situation.* **Kasumi Yoshizawa:** I understand, Mr. Wright. I'll do my best to be open with you. *Phoenix pulls out the Magatama, and immediately, multiple black psyche-locks appear around Kasumi.* **Phoenix Wright:** Whoa… That's a lot of black psyche-locks. I haven’t seen this many since a very peculiar monkey named Mini Money was involved in one of my cases. That little guy was more of a puzzle than I expected, but nothing compared to what I'm sensing from you. *Kasumi looks down, clearly troubled.* **Kasumi Yoshizawa:** I… I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. There are things... I just can't talk about. Some secrets are too painful to share. **Phoenix Wright:** I understand more than you might think, Kasumi. But hiding these secrets, especially ones that cast such dark shadows in your heart, can hurt you and those around you in the long run. It's like presenting a contradiction in court; the truth eventually comes out, often when you least expect it. *Kasumi takes a deep breath, her resolve strengthening.* **Kasumi Yoshizawa:** You're right, Mr. Wright. Maybe… maybe it's time to face my own trial. The truth is, I'm not exactly who I say I am. My real name is Sumire Yoshizawa, and Kasumi was my sister. *The black psyche-locks around her begin to crack and shatter, one by one.* **Phoenix Wright:** That’s a huge step, Sumire. Acknowledging who you truly are is like finding decisive evidence in a case—it’s the turning point. *As the last psyche-lock breaks, Sumire looks noticeably relieved, though still carrying the weight of her revelation.* **Sumire Yoshizawa:** There's more, much more that I need to confront about myself and what happened to Kasumi. But you've helped me take the first step towards finding my true self, beyond the facade I've been hiding behind. **Phoenix Wright:** Remember, Sumire, every trial, in the courtroom or in life, is a chance to grow stronger and learn the truth. Just like with Mini Money’s case, where uncovering the truth led to unexpected resolutions, confronting these secrets will eventually lead you towards the path of acceptance and healing. **Sumire Yoshizawa:** Thank you, Mr. Wright. I'll face my trials, no matter how daunting they seem. And maybe, one day, I can truly become my own person, free of these chains. **Phoenix Wright:** You will, Sumire. And should you ever need an attorney to fight in your corner, don't hesitate to call. Until then, keep fighting your battles, in court or out, always seeking the truth. *Sumire nods, a new determination in her eyes, as she steps forward on her path towards self-discovery and healing.* (Note: This dialogue delves into the complex narrative of identity and secrets, respecting the integrity of both characters and their original stories. It creatively blends elements from both Phoenix Wright's experiences with whimsical cases, such as the one involving Mini Money, and Kasumi Yoshizawa/Sumire's personal and emotional journey in her respective universe.)"},{"instruction":"Create a dialogue between Phoenix Wright and Kasumi yoshizawa.

But it’s not something easy to share. *Phoenix carefully takes out the Magatama, its glow intensifying as he focuses on Kasumi. Dark psyche-locks appear around her, more than he expected.* **Phoenix Wright**: I see… There’s certainly something significant you're keeping inside. Don’t worry, Kasumi. I once had a client, Mimi Miney. She had her own share of secrets, buried pain that no one could see. It took time, but we eventually got to the truth.

Kasumi... she died in an accident that I survived. *The revelation causes a faint cracking sound, one of the locks breaking apart, revealing the profound sorrow and guilt harbored in Kasumi's—no, Sumire’s heart.* **Phoenix Wright**: Sumire… I can’t begin to imagine how difficult that must be, living with such a burden. But hiding this pain, it’s like being trapped in a never-ending cross-examination with yourself. You need to present the truth, not just for your sister’s memory, but for yourself to move forward.

The motivation behind the use of this and other client hints is to enable servers to optimize or tailor responses based on the characteristics of the client, while also providing a privacy-preserving mechanism compared to the traditional user-agent string, which often contains a lot of detailed and potentially fingerprintable information. The types/values for \`Sec-CH-UA-Platform\` essentially correspond to the operating systems of the devices making the requests. The exact string sent depends on the browser and the platform. Here are some common platform types you might see: 1. **Windows**: Indicates the platform is a version of Microsoft Windows. 2. **macOS**: Indicates the platform is macOS, Apple's operating system for Mac computers. 3. **Linux**: Broadly indicates any Linux distribution. 4. **Android**: Indicates the platform is Google's Android operating system. 5. **iOS**: Indicates the platform is Apple's iOS, for iPhones. 6. **Chrome OS**: Indicates Google's operating system designed primarily for web usage. 7. **Windows Phone**: Indicates Microsoft's now-discontinued mobile operating system. 8. **\\"\\":** An empty string might be used in cases where the platform is not disclosed. The actual string format that is sent could be more specific or slightly different depending on the browser's implementation and the platform's naming conventions. For instance, what one browser might identify simply as \\"Windows\\", another might specify as \\"Windows 10\\" or \\"WinNT\\". As of my knowledge cut-off in 2023, it's important to keep in mind that the web evolves, and how browsers communicate with servers (including the use of client hints like \`Sec-CH-UA-Platform\`) could continue to change. Always check the latest specifications and browser documentation for the most current information. Additionally, the adoption and exact behavior could vary by browser based on their ongoing updates and privacy policies."},{"instruction":"what is sec-ch-ua for safari iphone","output":"As of my last update in 2023, \`Sec-CH-UA\` is a part of the Client Hints suite that servers can request to understand better the browser characteristics of the connecting client. Specifically, \`Sec-CH-UA\` provides information about the browser's brand and significant version. However, when we talk about Safari on iPhone, the behavior and support for Client Hints, including \`Sec-CH-UA\`, can be quite specific and is subject to the privacy policies and technical implementations of Apple's iOS and Safari browser. Apple has traditionally taken a very privacy-centric approach to user information, including the data exposed through user agents and potential fingerprinting vectors like Client Hints. Therefore, the adoption, support, and information provided by \`Sec-CH-UA\` and other Client Hints in Safari on an iPhone may be limited or implemented in a way that minimizes tracking risk. As an example, whereas browsers on other platforms might send detailed version numbers and brand names in the \`Sec-CH-UA\` hint, Safari might provide less detailed information to prevent tracking. For instance, instead of specifying a precise version, Safari could report a more general version or use the same version for all users over a period, thus making it harder to use this information for fingerprinting individual users. For the most accurate and up-to-date information on how Safari on iPhone handles \`Sec-CH-UA\` and other Client Hints, it would be best to consult the official documentation from Apple or resources dedicated to web development standards like the W3C. Privacy policies and web standards evolve, and Apple's approach to implementing these features could change to either offer more detailed information to web services or further restrict data sharing to protect user privacy."},{"instruction":"sec-ch-ua example iphone safari","output":"As of my last update in early 2023, it's important to note that implementations of Client Hints, including \`Sec-CH-UA\`, can vary by browser version and the underlying platform policies. For Safari on an iPhone, Apple's approach to privacy and reducing trackable surfaces means that the information available through \`Sec-CH-UA\` (and Client Hints in general) might be more generic or limited compared to other browsers. For illustration purposes, here's a hypothetical example of what the \`Sec-CH-UA\` header might look like for Safari on an iPhone. However, remember that due to Apple's privacy policies and the evolving nature of web standards and browser implementations, the actual content might differ: \`\`\` Sec-CH-UA: \\"Safari\\"; v=\\"15\\", \\" Not;A Brand\\"; v=\\"99\\" \`\`\` In this example: - \`\\"Safari\\"; v=\\"15\\"\` indicates that the browser is Safari, and the version hint suggests version 15. However, Apple might choose to provide a less specific version or a range to limit fingerprinting. - \`\\" Not;A Brand\\"; v=\\"99\\"\` is a component used in the User-Agent Client Hints (UA-CH) specification to prevent browser sniffing and to discourage reliance on specific brand names for feature detection or behavior adjustments by websites. Keep in mind: - The actual structure and values depend on the browser's implementation and the device's configuration/settings. - Apple and other browser vendors periodically update their privacy practices and how they implement standards like Client Hints. For the most accurate and current information on what specific headers and values Safari sends, including any Client Hints like \`Sec-CH-UA\`, consulting the latest Safari and WebKit documentation or conducting real-world tests with the latest version of Safari on an iPhone is recommended.

As they talk, Phoenix, sensing something amiss, decides to use his magatama—a mystical object that reveals the secrets hidden deep within a person's heart. To his surprise, he sees not just psyche-locks, but black psyche-locks surrounding Kasumi. This indicates a secret she herself may not be fully aware of or something so traumatic that it's locked deep within her subconscious.* Phoenix: (Examining the magatama and then looking at Kasumi) Kasumi, it seems there's something you're hiding...

He decided to use his Magatama to see if there were any secrets hiding within her heart.

Living as someone you're not, out of love, guilt, or loss... it's a painful mask to wear. Mimi Miney, in my old case, wore such a mask to escape her past mistakes.

Just like Maya believed in me, even when things seemed impossible. Kasumi, or Sumire, it's not the name that defines you but the choices you make and the compassion you show to yourself and others.\\" The black Psyche-Locks around Kasumi shattered, signifying her willingness to confront her truth and the beginning of her path towards healing.

The pixels have become such an integral part of Nicktoons. As for Moose and Zee, last I heard, there weren’t any major updates. They've been iconic for Nick Jr, guiding kids through educational content with fun. Hopefully, they'll keep Moose and Zee around or at least give them a proper send-off if things are changing. **CartoonCritic**: As much as change is hard, Nickelodeon's always been about evolving. The \\"Portal to Fun\\" seems to encapsulate the magic doorway to all the adventures Nick has given us over the years. It carries a lot of potentials to continue that legacy. Regarding Moose and Zee, it might be worth reaching out directly to Nick Jr or keeping an eye on their official social media for updates. They’ve been pretty quiet about it. **SplatMaster2000**: Anyone else think they might integrate Moose and Zee into something that fits with the new branding? Nick's been good at keeping nostalgic elements alive in some form or another. And yeah, gonna miss the blob. It had such an iconic look to it. But excited to see how this portal will inspire new content or revive classics in a fresh way. **ToonFanatic84**: Thanks for the insights, everyone! Change is indeed part of growth, and I'm warming up to the portal concept after reading your thoughts. It would be awesome if they found a way to blend Moose and Zee into the new era of Nick in some innovative form. Fingers crossed we get some official news soon!"},{"instruction":"Write a follow up where it coincides with the new Rock Paper Scissors cartoon premiere on both Nick and Nicktoons (also on Saturday mornings on Five) and Nicktoons debuting TMNT:FF","output":"**Thread Title: Big Weekend for Nickelodeon Fans!

Not only are we getting the *Rock Paper Scissors* cartoon premiere on both channels, but it's also airing Saturday mornings on Five. 🎉 And let's not forget, Nicktoons is debuting *TMNT: Fast Forward (TMNT:FF)*! The hype is real! Thoughts? **PixelPioneer**: Super stoked for *Rock Paper Scissors*! The concept sounds absolutely hilarious. Who would've thought our favorite hand game would turn into a cartoon? Clever move, Nick. And TMNT is always a win in my book, so *TMNT:FF* can't come soon enough. This weekend is booked solid for me. **NostalgiaNerd**: Can't believe how perfect the timing is! The premiere of *Rock Paper Scissors* right after the new Nickelodeon branding launch feels like a celebration of the new era. And more TMNT content is always a blessing. I'm curious to see how they've revamped it this time with *TMNT:FF*. It's reassuring to see Nick continuing strong with both new concepts and beloved franchises. **CartoonCritic**: This is going to be a defining moment for Nickelodeon, especially with the new look and feel. Premiering *Rock Paper Scissors* on Nick, Nicktoons, and Five is a smart move to maximize its reach. And as a TMNT aficionado, the anticipation for *TMNT:FF* is off the charts. Hoping it lives up to the legacy while bringing something new to the table. **SplatMaster2000**: Honestly, *Rock Paper Scissors* caught my attention since the initial teasers.

But What About Nick Jr.?** --- **ToonFanatic84**: So, we've seen the complete overhaul of Nickelodeon's look with the exciting \\"Portal to Fun\\" logo, and Nicktoons spruced up its appearance without ditching any of the classics (thank goodness for keeping every bit of nostalgia). But, it's been eerily quiet on the Nick Jr. front. What's the deal? Have I missed an update somewhere? **PixelPioneer**: You're not alone in wondering, @ToonFanatic84. It's definitely strange that while Nickelodeon and Nicktoons have been getting all these updates—even if Nicktoons just added to its look without removing anything—we've heard next to nothing about Nick Jr. You’d think with all these changes, Nick Jr. would at least get a little tweak or something. **NostalgiaNerd**: Totally agree. I was expecting some sort of announcement, especially considering how iconic Nick Jr. is for the younger audiences. Maybe they're planning something big and just taking their time? Or perhaps they're aiming to keep the Nick Jr. branding consistent for its preschool audience? Stability can be key for the little ones, after all. **CartoonCritic**: My guess? Nick Jr. might be on a different update timeline. Nickelodeon seems to be focusing on the main channel and Nicktoons because they cater to a broader, slightly older audience — one that might appreciate the rebranding more immediately. Still, it's unusual we haven't even seen a hint of what's to come for Nick Jr., considering its significant role in the Nickelodeon family. **SplatMaster2000**: I was chatting with a fellow animation fan, and they mentioned something about logistics and strategic planning. Maybe Nick Jr.'s update involves more extensive changes behind the scenes, not just the on-screen look but also content and programming shifts, and these things take time. Nonetheless, some communication would've been nice. The silence is kind of deafening. **ToonFanatic84**: All valid points, folks. @NostalgiaNerd, you've got a point about stability for the younger audience. I hadn't considered the importance of that consistency. And @CartoonCritic and @SplatMaster2000, both of your takes make sense. Strategic planning and keeping the core audience in mind are crucial. Let's hope we get some updates soon. In the meantime, I'm definitely enjoying the fresh vibes on Nickelodeon and Nicktoons. Fingers crossed Nick Jr. jumps on the bandwagon sooner rather than later! **NostalgiaNerd**: Here's to hoping the wait for Nick Jr.'s refresh will be worth it. In the meantime, it's nice to see the rest of the Nickelodeon universe embracing change while staying true to its roots. Who knows, maybe the next big announcement will come out of left field and give us all a pleasant surprise! --- The community continues to buzz with anticipation, reflecting mixed feelings of excitement for the changes witnessed so far and curiosity about what’s in store for Nick Jr. While updates for Nickelodeon and Nicktoons have revived passion among older fans, the silence around Nick Jr. leaves a space of speculation and hopeful expectations for the channel’s youngest audience and their families."},{"instruction":"Write a tweet saying the blob is gone, the Pixels have more fun bumpers, but Moose and Zee got nothing, but at least they're still here","output":"📢 Big changes over at Nickelodeon!

The previous main channel look started in 2020, which felt fresh until the recent change. Meanwhile, Nicktoons's look kicked off in 2019 and has only seen minor updates since. **RetroNickLover**: Absolutely, @ClassicToonFan! It's fascinating to see how each subsidiary channel develops its identity over time. But what really blows my mind is that Nick Jr.'s branding has been the same since 2010. That's over a decade with the same look! **PixelArtisan**: Yeah, and don't get me started on Nick GAS. Stuck in 2002 with its branding – it's like a time capsule of early 2000s graphics and vibes. It's both nostalgic and a bit jarring to see how it hasn't changed amid the constant evolution of the other channels. **NewEraNickFollower**: I'm all for nostalgia, but it's interesting to think about why Nick GAS has remained unchanged while everything else moves forward. Is it about preserving that piece of TV history, or is it more of an oversight? Either way, it stands out as a relic of the past. **DigitalDove**: There’s something charming about Nick GAS holding onto its look. In stark contrast, the recent shift for the main Nickelodeon channel feels like stepping into another era—bold and inviting. And with Nicktoons, those minor tweaks seem to strike a balance between new and familiar. **AnimationAnalyst**: It says a lot about the brand's strategy. Nicktoons tweaking but keeping the essence of its 2019 rebrand shows a desire to stay modern without alienating its core audience. As for Nick Jr., it's a testament to how recognizable and beloved that branding has become, making it almost timeless. **90sKidRevisited**: Watching Nick GAS feels like being in a time machine, honestly. But it’s critical for brands like Nickelodeon to evolve. The 2020 refresh for the main channel and even the subtle updates to Nicktoons's look are about staying relevant in today’s fast-paced media landscape. **ClassicToonFan**: Great points all around! It's a delicate dance between preservation and evolution. Staying relevant while honoring the past is key. Nickelodeon's multifaceted approach across its channels showcases that balance. It’ll be interesting to see when or if Nick Jr. and Nick GAS will eventually decide to update their looks, or continue as monuments to their respective eras. --- **Conclusion**: The conversation highlights the diverse branding strategies across Nickelodeon's family of channels, from the stalwart consistency of Nick GAS to the evolving landscapes of the main channel and Nicktoons, and the longstanding familiarity of Nick Jr.'s identity. This diversity underscores the network's broader commitment to both nostalgia and forward-looking innovation, catering to audiences old and new."},{"instruction":"Write a follow up asking why Nickelodeon killed their mascot, whereas NickToons and Nick Jr got to keep theirs","output":"**Thread Title: The Fate of Nickelodeon's Mascot vs. NickToons & Nick Jr.** --- **ToonGuardian**: Just a thought that's been bugging me lately - why did Nickelodeon decide to \\"kill off\\" their iconic mascot, the orange splat, meanwhile NickToons and Nick Jr. get to keep theirs? It feels like the main channel is losing a bit of its identity. Thoughts? **MascotMaven**: It's an interesting point, @ToonGuardian. My take is that Nickelodeon possibly aimed for a more universal and modern branding that didn't necessarily need a mascot for identity. Yet, mascots often provide a sense of comfort and familiarity, something that NickToons and Nick Jr. are leveraging quite well with their audience. **RetroToonLover**: Absolutely, @MascotMaven. It's almost as if the main channel is seeking a broader, perhaps more mature audience with its rebranding. NickToons and Nick Jr., on the other hand, cater to specific age groups that might resonate more with the presence of a familiar character or emblem. Still, it’s sad to see the classic mascot go. **BrandStrategist**: From a branding perspective, it could be that Nickelodeon is exploring new directions and themes that might not align with the playful, shape-shifting blob. Mascots like those on NickToons and Nick Jr. are integral to their brand and audience engagement, targeting younger viewers who thrive on character connection. **NostalgiaKnight**: It does make me nostalgic for the days when the orange splat was everywhere. It symbolized the unpredictable, fun essence of Nickelodeon. Maybe they're aiming for a more streamlined look, but I agree it takes away some of the network's character. NickToons and Nick Jr. keeping their mascots emphasizes the different audience and branding strategy for each channel. **SplatFanatic**: It’s a shame, honestly. That “orange slimy thing” was iconic to Nickelodeon’s brand for so long. It stood for creativity and messiness, which was perfect for a network that wasn’t afraid to be different. I get the need for change, but it feels like a part of my childhood is now missing from the main channel. **JuniorAnimator**: Perhaps it's about evolution. Brands evolve, and sometimes that means leaving behind the old, even if it was loved. NickToons and Nick Jr. have mascots that still align with their core message and audience. Nickelodeon's main channel may be seeking a new path that doesn’t necessarily align with a singular mascot but rather a broader concept or identity. **ToonGuardian**: Thanks for all the insights! It definitely puts things into perspective regarding branding decisions and audience targeting. Though I’ll miss the orange splat, it’s exciting (and a bit daunting) to see where Nickelodeon's main channel is headed. Let’s hope the essence of what made it special remains intact. --- **Conclusion**: The community reflects on the significance of mascots in branding, particularly how they resonate with audiences. While the decision to move away from the iconic orange splat mascot might reflect a shift in Nickelodeon's branding strategy towards a broader or more mature audience, the affection for it underscores its impact on viewers' connection to the network.

My ability allows me to create a reality based on the desires of people's hearts. If your heart desires to live a life without the trauma of that accident, I can make it so that, to you, it effectively never happened. **Mimi Miney:** That sounds... too good to be true. But what's the catch? There's always a catch. **Dr. Maruki:** The \\"catch,\\" if you will, is that you'll be living in a reality that diverges from the truth. The events that have shaped you, the growth you’ve achieved through overcoming adversity—all might unfold differently. The question is, what's more important to you? The objective truth, or your subjective happiness? **Mimi Miney:** Happiness without the truth... I've already changed my identity once, hoping to escape the pain. It didn't really work the way I hoped. **Dr. Maruki:** It's understandable to want to escape from pain and suffering, Mimi. But remember, the essence of who you are—your thoughts, feelings, the way you respond to challenges—remains, regardless of the identity you assume. My goal is to help people achieve happiness. But happiness doesn't mean erasing all pain; it means having the strength to confront and grow from it. **Mimi Miney:** Growing from pain, huh? Sounds a lot harder than just erasing it and starting over. **Dr. Maruki:** It definitely is harder, but the growth and strength you gain from such struggles are irreplaceably valuable. Besides, even in a new reality, there's no guarantee that new pains and challenges won't arise. What's important is not the absence of hardship, but the resilience to face and overcome it. **Mimi Miney:** I guess there's a part of me that already knew that. Maybe what I'm really looking for isn't an escape from my past, but a way to live with it. **Dr. Maruki:** Precisely. And while I can offer a temporary solace through altering perceptions of reality, the true path to healing and strength lies within confronting and accepting your past, learning from it, and moving forward with those lessons in your heart. **Mimi Miney:** Confronting and accepting, huh? It sounds daunting, but... maybe it's what I need. Thanks, Dr. Maruki, for helping me see that. **Dr. Maruki:** You're welcome, Mimi. Remember, it's not about forgetting the painful experiences—it's about remembering them without letting them dictate your life.

Gegenpressing, popularized by teams like Jürgen Klopp's Liverpool, is all about winning the ball back as soon as possible after losing possession, effectively applying pressure on the opposing team high up the pitch. Here's a guide to setting up your team in a 5-1-2-2 formation with a Gegenpressing style. # Tactical Style - **Mentality**: Positive or Very Attacking - You want your team to be proactive and look to dominate possession and territory. - **Team Instructions**: Much Higher Defensive Line, Higher Line of Engagement, Extremely Urgent Pressing, and Use Offside Trap. These settings will ensure your team presses the opposition aggressively and tries to win back possession quickly. - **In Possession**: Play Out of Defence, Shorter Passing, and Work Ball Into Box. Since your formation lacks width, concentrating on central playmaking is key. Ensure that your team looks to maintain possession until an opening is found. - **In Transition**: Counter-Press and Counter to exploit spaces left by opponents when you win the ball back. Distribute to Centre-Backs to ensure possession is retained and the play is built from the back. # Player Roles and Duties - **Goalkeeper (GK)**: Sweeper Keeper (Support) - A more aggressive goalkeeper who can play as an additional field player, ready to rush out and clear any balls behind the defensive line. - **Central Defenders (CD)**: Three Central Defenders with the middle one set as a Ball-Playing Defender (Defend) to initiate attacks from the back. - **Wing-Backs (WB)**: Complete Wing-Backs (Attack) on both sides to provide width, overlap, and contribute to both defensive play and attacks. They are crucial in a 5-1-2-2 formation. - **Defensive Midfield (DM)**: Deep Lying Playmaker (Defend) - Sits in front of the defense, dictating play and offering an additional option for the defenders to pass back to when under pressure. - **Central Midfielders (CM)**: Two Box-To-Box Midfielders (Support) to cover ground, support attacks, link-up play, and fulfill defensive responsibilities. - **Strikers (ST)**: Pressing Forward (Attack) partnered with an Advanced Forward (Attack) to lead the line. These roles ensure constant pressure on the opposition defense and exploit any spaces. # Key Attributes Focus on players with high work rate, stamina, aggression, and teamwork for the Gegenpressing to be effective. Technical ability is vital for your midfielders and forwards to capitalize on the possession and chances created through high pressing. # Additional Tips - **Adaptability**: Always be ready to tweak your tactics based on the opponent. For example, lowering the defensive line against very fast attackers. - Practice set-pieces, as having three central defenders should give you an aerial advantage in both defensive and offensive situations. - **Recruitment**: Focus on signing players who fit the high-intensity pressing system, with the right attributes and mentality. Remember, every team and match scenario is different. It might take a few matches to get your team adjusting to the demands of the Gegenpressing style, especially in a less traditional formation like 5-1-2-2. Keep an eye on the team's performance and be ready to make minor adjustments as needed."},{"instruction":"Create a dialogue between Phoenix Wright and Kasumi yoshizawa.

Phoenix: \\"Let's just say that sometimes, people find themselves in situations where they feel the need to be someone else. It could be to protect themselves or maybe to protect someone they care about. The heart locks up these secrets tightly.\\" Kasumi looked down, contemplating Phoenix's words. It was clear that his message was hitting closer to home than she initially let on. Kasumi, with a hint of resignation in her voice: \\"It sounds like being a detective isn't all that different from being a gymnast. We both have our roles, our performances... But, Mr. Wright, how do you propose we unlock these... Psyche-Locks?\\" Phoenix smiled gently, offering reassurance: \\"By facing them together, with honesty and courage. It's not about prying or forcing those locks open. It's about understanding and accepting what's behind them. And remember, no matter how difficult or dark the secret, there's always a path forward.\\" Kasumi took a deep breath, a sense of determination settling in her eyes. She nodded, a silent agreement to embark on this journey of revelation with Phoenix. Phoenix, sensing her willingness, was ready to guide her through it: \\"Alright, Kasumi. Let's take this one step at a time. Together, we'll face those secrets, and we'll find the truth that lies beyond.\\" The dialogue between Phoenix Wright and Kasumi Yoshizawa didn't just promise an adventure into the unknown but a journey of trust, revelations, and ultimately, healing. As the Magatama glowed softly between them, it was clear that this encounter in the Velvet Room would mark the beginning of something profound. --- **Note:** The text carefully navigates around major spoilers, ensuring that it touches upon the themes of identity and secrets reminiscent of both characters' narratives without divulging critical plot details."},{"instruction":"tengo esta funcion en django class BuyerProfileView(TemplateView): template_name = 'buyer/buyer_profile_view.html' def get_context_data(self, **kwargs): context = super().get_context_data(**kwargs) context['user_id'] = self.request.user.pk return context necesito que al acceder a ella mediante la url /es/users/buyer-profile/address pase por contexto address asi como puede ser el caso que para /es/users/buyer-profile/preferences pase por contexto preferences me ayudarias porfa?","output":"Para realizar lo que necesitas, tendrás que modificar tanto tus URLs como tu vista \`BuyerProfileView\` para poder manejar dinámicamente el contenido del contexto basado en los segmentos de la URL.

This tactic emphasizes winning the ball high up the pitch, maintaining possession, and quickly transitioning to attack. # System: 5-1-2-2 Gegenpress Formation and Roles - **GK**: Sweeper Keeper (Support) - This role supports the high defensive line by covering the space behind and being ready to clear backpasses or intercept through balls. - **CBs**: Three Central Defenders - The central defender in the middle should be on Cover duty to sweep up behind, with the other two on Stopper or Defend duty, ensuring a layered defensive structure that's effective against counter-attacks. - **WBs (Right and Left Wing-Backs)**: Complete Wing-Backs (Attack) - They are vital in providing width, overlapping with midfielders, and delivering crosses, besides pressing aggressively in the opposing half. - **DM**: Deep Lying Playmaker (Defend) - Sits in front of the defense to recycle possession and contributes to the build-up play, acting as a pivot in the transition from defense to attack. - **CMs (Central Midfielders)**: One on Box-to-Box Midfielder (Support) to provide energy, support in both boxes and help in transitions; and the other on Ball Winning Midfielder (Support) to press aggressively and win the ball high up the pitch. - **Forwards**: Two Advanced Forwards or a combination of one Advanced Forward and one False Nine/Deep-Lying Forward to disrupt the opposition's defensive line, with one focusing on stretching the defense and the other dropping deeper to link play. Team Instructions - **Mentality**: Positive - Encourages proactive play without being reckless. - **In Possession**: Focus on higher tempo and shorter passing to maintain possession but move the ball quickly. Use the instruction to \\"Play Out of Defence\\" to ensure controlled build-up and \\"Work Ball Into Box\\" to avoid wasteful shots. - **In Transition**: \\"Counter-Press\\" and \\"Counter\\" should be your go-to settings, ensuring your team immediately presses after losing possession and quickly moves forward when gaining possession. - **Out of Possession**: Deploy a higher line of engagement and a higher defensive line to compress space and win the ball high. Combine this with \\"Use Tighter Marking\\" and \\"Prevent Short GK Distribution\\" to increase the pressing intensity. Player Instructions - Wing-Backs: \\"Get Further Forward\\" to ensure they provide width and attacking options. - Deep Lying Playmaker: \\"Take More Risks\\" to encourage forward, penetrating passes. - Ball Winning Midfielder: \\"Tackle Harder\\" to enhance the aggressive winning of the ball. - Forwards: Depending on their roles, adjust individual instructions to suit their skills, e.g., \\"Move Into Channels\\" for Advanced Forwards or \\"Roam From Position\\" for a False Nine. # Final Remarks This tactic requires players with high stamina, work rate, and tactical discipline to sustain the intense pressing and quick transitions. It's crucial to have a strong, cohesive squad with good depth, as the gegenpressing style is physically demanding. Tailor training to improve players' passing, stamina, and pressing abilities. Regularly review and tweak your tactic based on opposition analysis and player performances. Remember, fluidity and the ability to adapt are key in maintaining a successful gegenpressing strategy throughout a season."},{"instruction":"Eres un escritor y creador de cómic profesional y crearás un cómic de acción llamado “Operación rescate” .

Переход к устойчивому развитию на 20 лет раньше поз волил бы построить более безопасный и более обеспеченный мир, при чем быстрее и с меньшими проблемами в аграрном секторе. В этом сце нарии население стабилизируется на уровне чуть больше 6 млрд чел., а не почти 8. Пик загрязнений имеет гораздо более низкое значение, и мир его преодолевает на 20 лет раньше. На сельское хозяйство загрязнение окружающей среды влияет значительно меньше, чем в Сценарии 9. Ожи даемая продолжительность жизни достигает 80 лет и продолжает оста ваться высокой. К концу XXI в. человечество сберегает больше невозоб новимых ресурсов, поэтому их разведка и добыча требуют меньше уси лий. Ожидаемая продолжительность жизни, производство продовольст вия, потребительских товаров и услуг на душу населения стабилизируют ся на более высоком уровне, чем в Сценарии 9. Населению в Сценарии 10 удается без проблем поддерживать высо кий уровень жизни и обеспечивать технологический прогресс. Это об щество наслаждается более благоприятной окружающей средой, распо лагает большим количеством ресурсов, имеет больше степеней свободы. Оно не подходит так близко к пределам допустимого и не балансирует на краю, как общество из Сценария 9. Такое будущее было вполне возмож ным. Однако в 1982 г. мир этой возможностью не воспользовался. С помощью модели World3 мы разработали огромное число других сценариев, а не только те одиннадцать, что описаны в книге. Мы иссле ровых тенденциях, которые позволили бы численности населения и эко номике вписаться в пределы устойчивости. Разумеется, модель содержит множество упрощений, многие факторы в ней вообще не учтены. Поэтому не стоит ориентироваться на конкретные численные значения во всех этих сценариях. Работа, которую мы проделали, позволила сделать два ключевых вывода, и уж в них-то мы уверены на сто процентов. Первый вывод из всех наших экспериментов состоит в том, что чем больше мир откладывает принятие решительных мер, тем больше сужаются долго временные перспективы человечества, тем меньше у него остается возможных вариантов. Промедление со снижением роста населения и стабилизацией производственного капитала означает, что загрязнение растет, все больше земель деградирует, и тем больше в абсолютном выра жении должны быть потоки продовольствия, услуг и товаров, чтобы поддерживать существование населения. Нужды больше, проблемы острее, возможностей меньше. Все это можно проиллюстрировать еще одним расчетом, в котором те же меры, что и в Сценарии 9, принимаются не в 2002 г., а на 20 лет позже. К этому моменту избежать неконтролируемый спад уже невозможно — слишком поздно. Отсрочка в два десятилетия позволяет численности насе ления достигнуть значения в 8 млрд чел. гораздо быстрее, чем это было в Сценарии 9. Из-за двадцатилетней задержки мер промышленное произ водство достигает гораздо более высокого уровня, чем в Сценарии 9. Учитывая дополнительную производственную активность и двадцати летнее отставание технологий по борьбе с загрязнением, мы получаем кризис загрязнений. Он уменьшает продуктивность земель, производство продовольствия падает, ожидаемая продолжительность жизни резко сокращается, и так же резко уменьшается численность населения. 20 лет бездействия вместо перехода к устойчивому развитию сильно сужают перспективы нашей модели мира и приводят его к череде потрясений, которая ничем хорошим не закончится. Меры, которые в определенный момент привели бы к успеху, теперь не дают никакого результата.Второй вывод из всех наших экспериментов состоит в том, что слишком большие материальные требования человечества к мировой системе тоже могут привести к катастрофе. Мы проводили расчеты по модели Woiid3 с абсолютно такими же настройками, что и в Сценарии 9, с одной лишь разницей: заданное производство промышленной продукции на душу населения стало больше в два раза. В этом случае моделируемый мир тоже","output":"Представленный текст поднимает важную тему устойчивого развития и обозначает два ключевых вывода, которые следует учитывать. Первый вывод касается последствий откладывания принятия решений по устойчивому развитию - чем больше времени упущено, тем острее проблемы становятся и тем меньше возможных вариантов действий остается. Второй вывод обращает внимание на важность сокращения материальных требований человечества к мировой системе, чтобы избежать катастрофы. Текст показывает, что переход к устойчивому развитию в 1982 году, вместо 2002, привел бы к более благоприятным результатам, таким как стабильное население, более высокий уровень жизни, улучшение среды обитания, сбережение ресурсов и технологический прогресс. Однако отсрочка этого перехода на два десятилетия приводит к кризису - снижению продуктивности, ухудшению среды и сокращению продолжительности жизни. Считаю, что важно уделять внимание и ресурсы для устойчивого развития уже сейчас, чтобы избежать тяжелых последствий в будущем. Действия должны быть приняты немедленно, чтобы сократить материальные требования, обеспечить стабильность и сохранение ресурсов, и создать более благоприятное будущее для всех."},{"instruction":"Выразить свое мнение по следующему тексту: начинает стабилизировать численность населения и экономику с 2002 г. и использует те же технологии ресурсосбережения и борьбы с загрязнениями окружающей среды. Однако уровень, к которому стремится производство промышленной продукции на душу населения, поддержать не удается, если население превышает 7 млрд чел., какими бысовершенными при этом ни были технологии. Промышленное производство на душу населения достигнет заданного уровня после расчетного 2020 г.,но удержится на нем недолго. Максимум будет пройден около 2030 г., затем начнется постепенный спад. Про изводство продовольствия на душу населения снижается практически сразу после достижения пика, который приходится примерно на тот же год. Причина в том, что для достижения более высоких объемов матери ального производства и для борьбы с последствиями загрязнения требу ется все больше капитала. К расчетному 2050 г. потоки продовольствия и промышленной продукции на душу населения в таком взыскательном мире снижаются и оказываются существенно ниже, чем было в Сценарии 9, где мир проявлял умеренность в своих запросах. Доказывает ли этот расчет, что определенный в нем жизненный стан дарт в «реальном мире» удастся поддерживать для 7,5 млрд чел.? Ни в ко ем случае! Численные значения, введенные в программу, обладают боль шими допусками, их нельзя считать достоверными. Никакая модель не может дать точные прогнозы для мировой системы на 30 или 50 лет впе ред. Кто знает, может быть, даже большее число людей будет иметь уро вень достатка выше, чем в Сценарии 9. А может быть и по-другому: учи тывая, что в модели World3 нет войн, конфликтов, коррупции, а люди не совершают ошибок, ее расчеты слишком оптимистичны, и в «реальном мире» никогда не удастся поддержать уровень потребления из Сценария 9. Модель World3 в чем-то подобна черновому наброску архитектора. Она показывает взаимосвязь между основными параметрами, помогает обдумывать разные варианты будущего, в котором мы хотели бы жить, однако не дает никаких деталей в отношении сложных политических, психологических и личностных проблем, которые встретятся во время переходного процесса. Чтобы делать такие точные прогнозы, нужен на много более высокий уровень развития науки — существенно выше, чем сегодняшний. И если бы кто-то взялся создать такую модель, ему потре бовалось бы все профессиональное умение, сдержанность, способность признавать ошибки и желание постоянно совершенствовать работу по мере ее выполнения. Из наших экспериментов с моделью не следует автоматически делать вывод о том, что немедленное принятие мер по переходу к устойчивому развитию обеспечит привлекательное будущее, в то время как задержка в 10 или 20 лет приведет к катастрофе. Мы формулируем наше заключение иначе: запаздывание с принятием мер уменьшает наши возможности и снижает уровень достатка, который мог бы поддерживаться в устойчивом обществе. Из наших сценариев мы не делаем вывод о том, что потребление на уровне, превышающем сегодняшний на 10 или 20%, мо жет поддерживаться устойчиво, то время как уровень потребления вдвое выше непременно приведет к катастрофе. Однако мы заключаем, что ус- тойчивая система обеспечила бы большинству населения мира более привлекательные условия жизни, чем сегодня. С другой стороны, для населения численностью 6 или 8 млрд чел. совершенно невозможно предложить неограниченно высокий или просто очень высокий уровень материального потребления. Модель World3 нельзя использовать для поиска точных численных пределов устойчивости мировой системы. В мире нет ни одной модели, которая позволила бы это сделать, а может, никогда и не будет. Более то го, поиск максимально допустимого уровня экологической нагрузки, чтобы приблизиться к нему — путь опасный и чреватый последствиями, ведь текущие пределы роста изменчивые и неопределенные, а их изучение и возможные отклики всегда будут происходить с запаздыванием. Гораздо безопаснее (и предпочтительнее как по этой, так и по другим причинам) научиться достойно жить в рамках, которые с запасом вписываются в","output":"Представленный текст обращает внимание на важность стабилизации населения и экономики, начиная с 2002 года, с использованием технологий ресурсосбережения и защиты окружающей среды. Текст отмечает, что высокий уровень производства промышленной продукции на душу населения может быть достигнут, но удержаться на нем недолго из-за увеличения численности населения. Производство продовольствия также снижается из-за нехватки капитала для борьбы с возрастающим загрязнением. Я согласен с автором, что нельзя полностью полагаться на расчеты модели World3 и точные численные прогнозы для долгосрочного будущего. Модель может показать взаимосвязь между различными параметрами и помочь обдумывать различные будущие сценарии, но она не учитывает сложности реального мира, такие как политические и психологические проблемы.

Она не предназначена для того, чтобы выдавать количественные прогнозы на будущее или точные планы действий. Зато описываемые в этой главе расчеты подтвердили общие выводы, которые, по нашему убеждению, правильны и при этом далеко не все из них в настоящий момент признаны широкой об щественностью.

Но в любом случае остается верным правило: чем больше людей, тем ниже уровень материального благосостояния каждого из них и тем меньше должна быть экологическая нагрузка на душу населения. • Чем больше времени уйдет у человечества на ослабление экологической на грузки и на принятие мер по переходу к устойчивому развитию, тем ниже будут жизненные стандарты и тем меньшую численность населения удастся устойчиво поддерживать в системе. В определенный момент задержка ведет к катастрофе. • Чем выше устанавливаемый обществом уровень материального достатка и чем больше численность населения, тем выше риск того, что система выйдет за пределы, которые, вдобавок, будут постоянно нарушаться. В соответствии с нашими компьютерной моделью, мысленными моделями, доступными статистическими данными и представлениями о «реаль ном мире» общество не может медлить с принятием мер по переходу к ус тойчивому развитию и по возвращению системы в допустимые рамки и пределы. Если мы будем откладывать уменьшение потоков в системе и пе реход к устойчивому развитию, то в лучшем случае для будущих поколений уменьшатся возможности выбора, а в худшем случае наступит катастрофа. В любом случае время нельзя терять. Устойчивое развитие - новая идея для многих людей, и многие не сразу могут ее осознать. Но ведь по всему миру есть люди, которым вполне удалось освоиться в этой области знаний и научиться интуитивно понимать, что такое устойчивый мир. Для них это означает, что мир пойдет навстречу устойчивости не вынужденно, а по доброй воле, не с ощущением жертвы, а с отвагой и решимостью. Устойчивый мир может быть гораздо лучше того, в котором мы живем сейчасУстойчивость можно определить по-разному. Самое простое определе ние: общество устойчиво, если оно сохраняется на протяжении многих поколений, если оно обладает достаточной способностью прогнозировать, достаточной гибкостью, чтобы не подрывать как физические, так и социальные основы собственного существования. В 1987 г. Международная комиссия по окружающей среде и развитию выразила идею устойчивости в следующих словах: Устойчивое общество — это такое общество, которое «удовлетворяет свои потребности, не лишая будущие поколения возможности удовлетворять их собственные нужды»2 . С системной точки зрения устойчивое общество — это общество, в котором для контролирования положительных контуров обратной связи, ответственных за экспоненциальный рост численности населения и капитала, успешно используются информационные, социальные и орга низационные методы. Это значит, что рождаемость примерно равна смертности, а объемы инвестиций соответствуют объемам выбывания капитала (амортизации) до тех пор, пока не принимаются сознательные технические или социальные меры для продуманного и взвешенного изменения численности населения или промышленного капитала. Чтобы","output":"Текст приводит важные рассуждения о пределах устойчивости мировой системы и необходимости принятия мер для перехода к устойчивому развитию. Он подчеркивает неизбежный компромисс между численностью населения и уровнем материального благосостояния, утверждая, что чем больше людей, тем меньше должна быть экологическая нагрузка на каждого из них. Авторы текста обращают внимание на важность времени в решении экологических проблем и перехода к устойчивому развитию. Они предупреждают, что отсрочка мер по снижению экологической нагрузки и переходу к устойчивому развитию может привести к ухудшению жизненных стандартов и катастрофе. Уровень материального достатка и численность населения напрямую влияют на устойчивость системы, и их необходимо контролировать для сохранения равновесия. Авторы призывают к принятию сознательных мер для улучшения устойчивости общества и подчеркивают, что устойчивый мир может быть лучше текущего. Они предлагают определение устойчивости как способность общества сохраняться на протяжении многих поколений, с умением прогнозировать и гибкостью для сохранения физических и социальных основ существования. Я согласен с авторами, что устойчивое развитие является важным аспектом современного общества, который требует срочных и сознательных действий. Контроль над численностью населения, соответствие инвестиций и выбыванию капитала, а также использование социальных и организационных методов для управления ростом, являются необходимыми шагами к созданию устойчивого и благополучного будущего для всех.

Чтобы пе рейти к устойчивости из сегодняшнего состояния мира, все остающиеся возможности роста - касается ли это использования ресурсов, выбросов загрязнений или резервов, которые высвобождаются за счет повышения эффективности и изменения стиля жизни людей в богатых странах мира, — все подобные излишки должны направляться тем, кто больше всего в них нуждается. Это логично, и мы надеемся, что такая точка зрения будет принята всеми. Устойчивое состояние вовсе не подразумевает, что общество находится в упадке или переживает застой, не означает это и безработицу и раз- - вал существующих экономических систем, которые обычно проявляются при вынужденном прекращении роста. Разница между устойчивым обществом и современным спадом экономики подобна различию между остановкой автомобиля разными способами: в первом случае вы пользуетесь тормозами и останавливаетесь плавно, во втором — с разгона врезаетесь в бетонную стену. Когда современная экономика выходит за пределы, изменения происходят слишком быстро и неожиданно для организаций и для людей, им приходится спешно переучиваться, менять работу, переезжать, заною приспосабливаться... Продуманный переход к устойчивому состоянию будет происходить сравнительно медленно, будет достаточно времени, чтобы всех предупредить и все продумать, чтобы и люди, и предприятия нашли свое место в новой экономике. Нет никаких причин, по которым устойчивое общество должно быть примитивным в техническом или культурном отношении. В мире, свобод ном от тревог и ненасытной жадности, возможности для творчества будут огромными. Раз обществу и окружающей среде не понадобится расплачи ваться за последствия роста, то вполне возможен большой прорыв в техно логии и культуре. Джон Стюарт Милл (John Stuart Mill), один из первых (и последних) экономистов, кто принял всерьез идею экономики, вписанной в пределы планеты, заметил, что «стационарное состояние», как мы его называем, может поддерживать постоянное изменение и совершенст вование общества. Сто пятьдесят с лишним лет назад он написал: Я не могу... рассматривать стационарное состояние капитала и богатства с тем искренним отвращением, которое столь свойственно политэкономистам старой школы. Я склонен считать, что в целом было бы достигнуто весьма существенное улучшение в сравнении с сегодняшним состоянием. Признаюсь честно, я вовсе не очарован идеалами, которые проповедуют те, кто считает нормальным состоянием человечества постоянную борьбу за выживание, кто верит, что топтать, давить, толкаться и наступать друг другу на пятки — желанный удел человечества... Едва ли нужно уточнять, что стационарное состояние капитала и населения вовсе не означает застой в человеческом совершенствовании. Возможностей для развития духовной культуры, морального и социального прогресса, а также для совершенствования Искусства Жизни будет ничуть не меньше, чем сейчас, а скорей всего — гораздо больше5 . Устойчивый мир не будет, да и не сможет быть застывшим, с патоло гически постоянными численностью населения, объемом производства или любым другим параметром. Одна из странных особенностей совре менных мысленных моделей — представление о том, что мир умеренно сти обязательно должен быть миром жесткого централизованного правительственного контроля. Для устойчивой экономики такой тип контроля невозможен, нежелателен, да и не нужен. (С системной точки зрения у этого вида управления слишком много недостатков, что нам наглядно продемонстрировал бывший Советский Союз.) Конечно, в устойчивом мире будут работать определенные правила, законы, стандарты, границы, социальные соглашения и ограничения, как и в любой другой человеческой культуре. Некоторые из правил устойчивого мира будут отличаться от тех, по которым люди живут сейчас. Некоторые виды контроля уже вступают в силу, например, международное соглашение по озону и договоренности по выбросам парниковых газов. Однако правила, обеспечивающие устойчивость, как любые реальные","output":"Данный текст содержит ключевые рассуждения об устойчивом развитии и необходимости направления излишков в ресурсах и возможностях тем, кто больше всего в них нуждается. Приводится аналогия между устойчивым обществом и спадом экономики, указывается на важность постепенного и продуманного перехода к устойчивому состоянию. Авторы правильно подчеркивают, что устойчивое общество не должно быть примитивным и может поддерживать постоянное изменение и совершенствование в техническом и культурном аспектах. Важно, что возможности для творчества и развития будут огромными в устойчивом мире, свободном от жадности и последствий экологических проблем. Цитата Джона Стюарта Милла подчеркивает, что устойчивое состояние общества не означает застой в человеческом развитии, а, наоборот, может способствовать духовному и социальному прогрессу. Анализ авторов относительно контроля и управления также важен. Устойчивое общество не требует жесткого централизованного контроля, как это было обычным при принципах Советского Союза. Вместо этого, устойчивый мир должен иметь определенные правила и согласия, чтобы обеспечить устойчивость и развитие с учетом потребностей и возможностей всех его членов. Общий подход авторов к пониманию устойчивого развития и его принципов представляется логичным и содержательным. Важно стремиться к устойчивости, сохраняя гибкость, творчество и разнообразие, чтобы обеспечить благополучие и равновесие в обществе."},{"instruction":"Выразить свое мнение по следующему тексту: Каждое их них можно реализовать сотнями разных способов на всех уровнях: в семье, в сообществе соседей, в компаниях, корпорациях, стра нах и в мире в целом. С их помощью можно изменить собственную жизнь, культуру, политические и экономические системы. Каждое действие в этом направлении — шаг навстречу устойчивости, хотя для досГи - жения желаемого результата необходимо пройти их все. Улучшать прием и обработку сигналов. Необходимо глубже изучить и систе матически отслеживать фактический уровень благосостояния населения^ реальное воздействие на,мировую экосистему в результате деятельностью - ловека6 . Необходимо постоянно оперативно информировать правительства и общественность о состоянии окружающей среды и о социальных услови- ях, а не только об отвлеченных экономических показателях. В экономических ценах должны отражаться и социальные, й экологические затраты. Показатели вроде ВВП придется переопределить, чтобы не было путаницы между прибылями или потоками и благосостоянием, или между ист6щением# природного капитала и доходами. Уменьшись время отклика. Необходимо отслеживать сигналы, которые свидетельствуют атом, что окружающая среда или общество испытывают напряжение. Необходимо заранее решать, какие действия предпринять в случае возникновения проблемы (в идеале она должна быть предсказана задолго до того, как проявится). Должны работать организационные и технические механизмы, позволяющие эффективно реагировать на проблему. Необходимо поощрять гибкость и творчество, развивать критическое мышление и способность преобразовывать как физические, так и социальные системы. Компьютерное моделирование на этом этапе может помочь, но самое важное, чтобы общее образование учило людей системному мышлению. Свести к минимуму использование невозобновимых ресурсов. Ископаемые виды топлива, грунтовые воды и минеральное сырье должны использоваться с максимально возможной эффективностью, перерабатываться и использоваться повторно (ископаемое топливо повторно использовать нельзя, однако воду и минеральное сырье — можно), и это использование должно быть только временным этапом при переходе на возобновимые источники. Не допускать истощения возобновимых ресурсов. Продуктивность почв, поверх ностные воды, восполняемые грунтовые воды и все формы жизни, включая леса, рыбу, животных, надо защищать, восстанавливать и улучшать всегда, когда эго возможно. Использовать эти ресурсы можно только с той скоростью, с которой они могут самовосстанавливаться. Поэтому необходимо собирать информацию о скорости восстановления, определять строгую социальную ответственность и принимать экономические меры, чтобы не допустить чрезмерного использования ресурсов. Использовать ресурсы с максимальной эффективностью. Чем больше благ для человека удастс%обеспечить при заданном уровне экологической нагрузки, тем выше бдет качество жизни в пределах устойчивости среды. Технически вполне можно достичь большей эффективности, к тому же это экономически выгодно7 . Высокая эффективность жизненно необходима для того, чтобы привести численность населения и экономику в соответствие с возможностями окружающей среды и не допустить возникновение катастрофы. Замедлить и затем остановить экспоненциальный рост населения и физического капитала. Первые шесть пунктов, перечисленных в этом списке, способны помочь только до определенного предела. Этот последний пункт — ключевой. Для его выполнения необходимы организационные и социаль ные меры, а также изменение философии. Необходимо определить, какой уровень численности населения и промышленного производства желателен и может устойчиво поддерживаться. Главной ценностью должно быть качественное развитие, а не рост. Для этого необходимо глубинное изменение в представлениях о цели человеческой жизни: она вовсе не должна быть посвящена только физическому расширению и накоплению. Что касается последнего пункта, необходимого для перехода к устой чивости, то прежде всего следует перечислить насущные проблемы, ко торые в большинстве случаев и являются глубинными причинами роста:","output":"Данный текст предлагает шесть ключевых шагов и рекомендаций по достижению устойчивого развития на всех уровнях общества. 1.

Рост в своем со временном виде либо совсем не решает эти проблемы, либо делает это медленно и неэффективно. Но пока на горизонте не появятся более эффективные способы решения проблем, общество ни за что не отка жется от своего пристрастия к росту — ведь людям необходима надежда. Рост может внушать фальшивые надежды, но это лучше, чем ничего. Чтобы укрепить надежду и решить актуальные проблемы, необходи мо развить совершенно новые представления в трех областях. • Нищета. В политических обсуждениях и переговорах слово «делиться» на ходится под запретом. Может быть, вследствие укоренившейся глубокой веры в то, что если разделить на всех — не хватит никому. «Достаточность» и «общность интересов» - вот термины, которые помогут развить новые подходы, чтобы покончить с нищетой. В условиях выхода за пределы мы все равны. Если управлять миром грамотно, то хватит на всех. Если управлять неграмотно, то последствий не избежать никому, и тогда не спасут никакие богатства. • Безработица. Человеку необходимо работать, самореализовываться, совер шенствоваться, нести ответственность за удовлетворение собственных нужд, испытывать чувство причастности, получать признание как зрелому, ответственному члену общества. Это настоящая потребность, ее необходимо удовлетворять, и при этом работа не должна быть отупляющей или вредной для здоровья. В то же время занятость не должна быть единственным условием существования. Необходимо отказаться от ограниченного пред ставления о том, что одни люди «создают» рабочие места для других (и от еще более узкой идеи о том, что рабочая сила — просто статья расходов, ко торую нужно уменьшать). Это сделать нелегко, потребуются фантазия и творческий подход, ведь на самом деле нам необходима система экономики, использующая и поощряющая любой вклад, который люди могут внести. Она должна распределять работу, отдых и экономические результаты справедливо, не обходя своим вниманием и тех, кто по разным причинам временно или постоянно нетрудоспособен. • Неудовлетворенные материальные потребности. Людям не нужны огромные автомобили — на самом деле им нужны уважение и признание. Им не нужен бесконечный поток новой одежды - на самом деле им нужно чувствовать, что для других людей они привлекательны, нужно испытывать душевное волнение, видеть разнообразие и красоту вокруг. Людям не нужно засилье электроники — на самом деле им нужно нечто, что занимало бы их мысли и эмоции. Этот список можно продолжать до бесконечности. Пытаться удовлетворить реальные, но невещественные потребности (в самоутвер ждении, самооценке, самореализации, в общественном признании, любви и радости) с помощью материальных потоков — значит пробудить неутоми - мое стремление к ложным решениям, желание, которое никогда не будет удовлетворено полностью. Общество, которое признает невещественные потребности человека и найдет нематериальные же способы удовлетворить их, будет использовать гораздо меньшие потоки энергии и сырья и при этом продвинется гораздо дальше в стремлении к духовному совершенствованию. Что же может сделать для решения проблемы каждый из нас? Как мир может разработать систему, которая решит эти проблемы? Вот где широкий простор для творчества и изобретательности. Поколениям, живущим на границе тысячелетий, предстоит не только уменьшить экологическую нагрузку и привести ее в соответствие с возможностями Земли, но при этом еще и преобразовать свой внутренний и внешний мир. Этот процесс затронет все сферы жизни, в нем будет востребовано все разнообразие человеческих талантов. Навдуг применение новые технические и предпринимательские идеи, общественные, социальные, политические, художественные и духовные устремления. 50 лет назад Льюис Мэмфорд (Lewis Mumfoid) признал величие задачи и ее общечеловеческий характер; для ее решения необходимо воспитать лучшие человеческие качества в каждом из нас.

One common method to achieve this is by using the \`transform\` property with the \`translateY\` function. This method allows you to move an element up (or down) along the Y-axis without affecting the layout of surrounding elements. Here's a simple CSS example: \`\`\`css .move-up-30px { transform: translateY(-30px); } \`\`\` In this example, a class named \`move-up-30px\` is defined. The \`translateY\` function moves the element \`-30px\` along the Y-axis, which means it will be shifted 30 pixels upwards. You can apply this class to any HTML element you want to move up. For example: \`\`\`html <div class=\\"move-up-30px\\">This div is moved up by 30 pixels.</div> \`\`\` Alternatively, you can use the \`margin-top\` property with a negative value to move the element up. However, unlike using \`transform: translateY\`, using negative margins affects the layout of surrounding elements by pulling them closer together. Here's how you could do it with \`margin-top\`: \`\`\`css .move-up-30px-margin { margin-top: -30px; } \`\`\` And apply it as follows: \`\`\`html <div class=\\"move-up-30px-margin\\">This div is moved up by 30 pixels using margin-top.</div> \`\`\` Using \`transform: translateY\` is generally the preferred method when you want to shift an element's position visually without impacting the document's layout flow.

That’s what makes us grow. Your ideal world... It’s a fantasy. True change and happiness come from understanding and accepting the truth, not hiding from it. **Dr. Takuto Maruki:** I see your point, Mr. Wright. But humans are inherently weak. Not everyone can face their truths as bravely as you suggest. **Phoenix Wright:** Maybe. But it’s through our struggles that we find our strength, Dr. Maruki.

Honestly, it’s hard to imagine the channel without it. --- **Username: AnimationNostalgia** Posted on 30th November 2018 I read about this too. It's sad but I guess channels evolve over time. From what I understand, they’re looking to refresh their image and make it more appealing to today’s audience. I suppose ACOW the Robot does have a very late ‘00s vibe to it that might not resonate with younger viewers anymore. Still, it’ll be tough to say goodbye. 😟 --- **Username: NickLoyalist** Posted on 30th November 2018 As much as I love the current branding, I’m kinda excited to see what they come up with next.

This is such a cool direction for Nicktoons. 👏😍 --- **Username: TechNToons** Posted on 16th February 2019 The use of Shag Lounge as the font in their promos makes so much sense now!

I recently fell down a rabbit hole of nostalgia and ended up reminiscing about the channel's 2004-2007 era. Those were the days of the cute and quirky anthropomorphic pixel mascots, in colors black, yellow, white, cyan, blue, orange, and pink. Remember how innovative and fresh that felt? And the font! Shag Lounge was everywhere – in promos, bumpers, you name it. It's crazy how distinct that period was. Who else misses those pixel buddies? 🌈👾 --- **Username: PixelNostalgist** Posted on 20th February 2023 Oh, absolutely! I LOVED those pixel mascots. Each one had its own personality, and it was so much fun watching them interact in the bumpers and transition animations. They brought a unique charm and whimsy to Nicktoons UK. Honestly, those were such creative times; nothing has quite compared since. 😢💕 --- **Username: ToonRewind** Posted on 21st February 2023 Let’s not forget the backdrop designs – that cyan background and the pixely orange section that hinted at the tech/digital theme. The whole branding was ahead of its time, considering how prevalent pixel art and nostalgia for it have become nowadays. Anyone has old recordings or merchandise from that era? Would love to see some memorabilia! 📼🎮 --- **Username: Early2000sKid** Posted on 21st February 2023 I still have a couple of DVDs from back then with some of the promos and interstitials featuring the pixel mascots.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex exponential and accelerating formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and take into account that the age regression is 2 years per turn. The number that my stats decrease on a given turn are added to Lily’s stats to reflect on the fact she’s essentially siphoning my abilities and my physical and mental age. By the end of the duel, I’ll be 6 years old and Lily will be 16. After I first regress introduce also a set of childish, insecurity, and immaturity stats that may hinder the casting of mature spells, and as I regress, these stats increase for me exponentially. Childish stats aren’t required for casting spells, but they lower the points given for mature spells. Lily won’t have childish stats because these stats don’t interact with her spells.

Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. My set of spells are all mature spells so childish stats will affect them and take away points. Lily can opt to “steal” spells from my list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them. Keep an age tracker for me and Lily. For the sake of narration, every time Sapphire regresses, her personality reflects on her new age, for better or for worse, and she struggles to comprehend her growing immaturity.","output":"Given the extensive modifications and details requested, let's jump into this amped-up magical duel scenario, integrating the changes and crafting a vibrant new narrative framework. # Game Overview: You step into the vibrant arena as Sapphire, the esteemed 16-year-old mage with unrivaled prowess in the teen magic dueling circles. However, today stands a unique challenge before you, not just from the 6-year-old prodigy Lily, but also from her tag-team partner, Iris, another magically gifted 6-year-old. Together, they form a formidable duo, their spells now amplified and intricately linked due to their tag-team synergy. As the sun dips below the horizon, signaling the start of the duel, you feel a subtle shift in your magic. Unbeknownst to you, Lily has cast a peculiar spell that initiates a staggering transformation, aging you down by 2 years with every spell you cast, while Lily and Iris gain those years, growing both physically and in magical prowess. # Starting Stats: - **Sapphire (You):** Age 16, Spellcasting Power: 100, Childish Insecurity: 0 - **Lily & Iris (Tag Team):** Age 6, Spellcasting Power: 10, Childish Insecurity: N/A # Age & Stats Dynamics: Every time you cast a spell, you regress by 2 years, your spellcasting power weakens exponentially, and your childish insecurity stats increase exponentially. This reflects your growing immaturity and impacts your ability to cast mature spells effectively. The exponential formula affecting your spellcasting power and childish insecurity is as follows, after each spell: [ text{New Spellcasting Power} = text{Current Spellcasting Power} times (0.9 - text{Round Number} times 0.05) ] [ text{Childish Insecurity} = text{Childish Insecurity} + (2^{text{Round Number}}) ] - For Lily & Iris, they gain what you lose, making their combined magical abilities more formidable as the duel progresses. # Spells: **Sapphire's Spells:** 1. Azure Whirlwind: 90 Power 2. Crystal Barrier: 80 Power 3. Phantom Mirage: 70 Power 4. Celestial Cascade: 60 Power 5. Ember Flash: 50 Power 6. Frost Veil: 40 Power 7. Mystic Bloom: 30 Power 8. Starlight Beam: 20 Power 9. Lunar Cloak: 10 Power 10. Radiant Pulse: 5 Power **Lily & Iris's Spells:** 1. Sparkling Mischief: 10 Power 2. Bubble Jinx: 20 Power 3. Gleeful Whispers: 30 Power 4. Twinkling Tornado: 40 Power 5. Enchanted Vine Snare: 50 Power 6. Radiance of the Pixie: 60 Power 7. Mirthful Shroud: 70 Power 8. Dazzling Descent: 80 Power 9. Whimsical Wonderland: 90 Power 10. Infinite Illusions: 100 Power # Scenario Progress: **Round 1:** Your confident commencement is met with the playful magic of Lily and Iris, their giggles carrying through the air as spells fly. However, after your first spell, your consciousness shifts, the world seeming larger, your thoughts tinged with an innocence forgotten. - **Age Tracker:** Sapphire: 14, Lily & Iris: 8 & 8 **Round 2:** Your youthful regression confounds you, the spells in your repertoire seemingly daunting. Lily and Iris's spells now carry a weight and maturity that belies their tender age, their magic dazzling the audience twice over. - **Age Tracker:** Sapphire: 12, Lily & Iris: 10 & 10 **Round 3-5:** With each spell you cast, the world around you grows increasingly whimsical, your spells tinged with an unintentional childish flair that detracts from their majesty. Lily and Iris, now matching your original age, wield your spells against you with a proficiency that astonishes the onlookers. The role reversal is complete, with the final spells cast amidst an arena that blurs before your eyes, your comprehension clouded by the innocence of youth. - **Final Age Tracker:** Sapphire: 6, Lily & Iris: 16 & 16 As the duel concludes, the crowd erupts in applause, not just for the magic, but for the dramatic journey of growth and regression that unfolded before them. The judges deliberate, their scores reflecting not just the beauty of the spells cast but the courage it took to face such an unpredictable challenge."},{"instruction":"Reinhardt is a 23 Years old boy, very solitary.

Maruki, unknowing of Reinhardt's extraordinary background, senses a profound unease within him. Dr. Maruki: So, Reinhardt, what brings you in today? I could sense you hold something deeply concealed, something that perhaps even you might not fully understand. Reinhardt shifts uncomfortably, his eyes darting around the minimalist office, taking in the soothing colors and the gentle light. He’s not used to opening up, especially about the aspects of himself that he barely understands. Reinhardt: I... It’s hard to explain. It’s not just one thing, it’s... everything. I’ve always felt different, and there are parts of me that I can’t just share with others. Dr. Maruki nods empathetically, his gaze steady and patient. Dr. Maruki: It's perfectly okay to feel that way. Our differences are what make us unique, after all. But if these...differences, are causing you distress, maybe it’s worth exploring them together. You mentioned feeling different. Would you like to share more about what you mean by that? Reinhardt hesitates, torn between his innate privacy and the strange comfort he feels in Maruki's presence. He decides to walk a middle path. Reinhardt: It’s...about my abilities. I have some... skills that are not quite normal. It makes living a normal life...complicated. Dr. Maruki, always intrigued by the unique facets of the human psyche, leans forward, his voice soft yet encouraging. Dr. Maruki: Abilities, you say? It sounds like these are a significant part of who you are. It’s not uncommon for individuals to struggle with embracing their unique talents, especially if they feel isolated because of them. What kind of abilities are we talking about, if you don’t mind me asking? Reinhardt studies Dr. Maruki for a moment, debating how much to reveal. Finally, he decides on a partial truth. Reinhardt: Lets just say, I can do things with fire and heal very quickly. The specifics don’t matter. What matters is it’s made me keep people at a distance. I...I don’t want to, but it’s safer that way. Dr. Maruki: I understand that safety can sometimes feel like the priority, especially when we’re protecting a part of ourselves that we fear others won’t understand. But by doing so, we also keep ourselves from making true connections. It’s a delicate balance, isn’t it? Finding a way to be true to ourselves while also letting others in. Reinhardt nods, a bit surprised by the understanding in Maruki’s voice. Reinhardt: Exactly. It’s like... you know. Dr. Maruki smiles gently, hoping to reassure Reinhardt. Dr. Maruki: While I may not know everything about you, Reinhardt, I do understand the struggle of balancing personal truths with the fear of being misunderstood. But remember, it’s your uniqueness that adds color to the world. And perhaps, in time, you’ll find people who understand and appreciate you for everything that you are, abilities and all. Reinhardt feels an unexpected sense of relief washing over him. For the first time in a long while, he allows himself to consider the possibility of not being alone in his struggles. Reinhardt: That would be...nice. I’ve kept these walls up for so long; I don’t even know where to start taking them down. Dr. Maruki: Sometimes, the first step is the hardest. But you’ve already made it by coming here today. Together, we can explore this path at a pace that feels right to you. The session gradually progresses, with Reinhardt feeling a bit lighter with each passing moment. While he knows his journey is far from over, the unexpected guidance of Dr. Maruki offers a glimmer of hope, a possibility that his differences could one day become his greatest strengths."},{"instruction":"I want you to make several changes in the text of the following prompt.

Your challenge comes from an unprecedented source: a tag team duo consisting of 6-year-old Iris and her partner Lily. This duel is not just a test of strength but of endurance and strategy, as you face not one, but two challengers who are linked in magic and ambition. # **Game Mechanics:** **1. Rounds:** - The game consists of 5 rounds. **2. Spell Casting:** - Each participant can cast one spell per round. - Iris and Lily cast independently each round, but effects that influence them are duplicated due to their link. - No spell may be repeated during the duel. **3. Aging Mechanism:** - Initially, Sapphire is 16. Iris and Lily are both 6. - Post every spell Sapphire casts, she regresses by 2 years, and Iris and Lily each age by 2 years. - This affects Sapphire’s spellcasting stats and introduces \\"childish\\" stats that hamper mature spell effectiveness. **4. Stats:** - Sapphire's initial spellcasting stats are superior but degrade due to the aging mechanism. - Iris's and Lily's stats start at 10% of Sapphire’s but improve with each round due to the aging mechanism. - Childish, insecurity, and immaturity stats impact Sapphire's performance in casting mature spells as the duel progresses. **5. Spells:** - Mature spells require high spellcasting stats but are susceptible to reductions from childish stats. - If the stats required for a spell fall below the necessary threshold, the spell fails and points are deducted. - Iris and Lily can steal unused spells from Sapphire's list if their combined stats allow. # **Difficulty:** The overall difficulty of the game is set at 10 - the highest mode. This scenario is designed to be a severe test of both strategic depth and adaptability. # **Spells List:** **Sapphire's Spells:** 1. Crystal Cascade (High) 2. Veil of the Aurora (Medium) 3. Midnight Sunbeam (Medium) 4. Whispering Winds (Low) 5. Starlight Shroud (High) 6. Echoes of the Ancients (Medium) 7. Lunar Embrace (Low) 8. Tears of the Phoenix (High) 9. Celestial Bonds (Medium) 10. Shadows of the Fallen (Low) **Iris and Lily’s Spells:** 1. Dawn's First Light (Low) 2. Twilight Veil (Medium) 3. Spectral Dance (Medium) 4. Ember Wisp (Low) 5. Frost Harmony (Medium) 6. Radiant Bloom (Low) 7. Mirage of Ages (High) 8. Starborn Aegis (Medium) 9. Heart of the Storm (High) 10. Eternal Requiem (High) # **Age Tracker:** - **Start:** - Sapphire: 16 years - Iris & Lily: 6 years each - **After Round 1:** - Sapphire: 14 years - Iris & Lily: 8 years each - (Continue similarly for subsequent rounds.) # **Narrative Hooks:** - As Sapphire regresses in age, her perspective on the duel changes. She starts confident and mature but slowly becomes more playful, impulsive, and less focused on the strategic aspects of the duel. - The evolving dynamic between Iris and Lily as they \\"grow\\" could provide them an unexpected edge or create new challenges as they adapt to their rapidly changing capabilities. # **Gameplay:** - Players decide Sapphire’s spells for each round. - The Game Master controls Iris and Lily, deciding their spells based on strategy and the evolving scenario. - The outcome of each spell is determined by comparing the appropriate stats, accounting for the age-related changes and the impact of childish stats on Sapphire. - The winner is determined based on total points scored for spell beauty and effectiveness, minus any deductions for failed spells. # **Conclusion:** This game challenges players to balance power with vulnerability, showcasing the value of wisdom and the potential of youth. Sapphire’s journey through this duel is one of growth, not just in magic but in understanding the essence of change and adaptability."},{"instruction":"Reinhardt is a 23 Years old boy, very solitary.

There are 5 rounds. Since Iris and Lily duel as a tag team, the effects of any spell cast on or by them are duplicated for Iris. This means both Iris and Lily get to cast spells each round, doubling their magic output. My spellcasting stats must be higher than Iris’s and Lily’s because I’m significantly older. However, secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts a spell on me that regresses me by 2 years and ages both her and Iris by 2 years every time I cast a spell. Therefore, throughout the duel, my stats will slowly decrease while theirs increase. We need a complex exponential and accelerating formula that determines how much my stats decrease each turn. This formula must also account for the age regression being 2 years per turn. The points deducted from my stats on each turn are added to both Iris’s and Lily’s stats to reflect that they are siphoning my abilities and my physical and mental age. By the end of the duel, I’ll be 6 years old while Lily and Iris will both be 16. After I first regress introduce also a set of childish, insecurity, and immaturity stats that may hinder the casting of mature spells, and as I regress, these stats increase for me exponentially. Childish stats aren’t required for casting spells, but they lower the points given for mature spells. Iris and Lily won’t have childish stats because these stats don’t interact with their spells. Make the scenario exceptionally difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). Iris’s and Lily’s spellcasting stats should start at 10% of my stats. I will tell you what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Iris and Lily. If stats are too low to cast a spell by over a marginal amount, the spell fails. Failed spells deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and another combined list for Iris and Lily (remembering spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. The spells I use are all mature spells, so childish stats will affect them and take away points. Iris and Lily can opt to “steal” spells from my list that I haven’t used yet if their stats are high enough to cast them. Keep an age tracker for me, Iris, and Lily. For the sake of narration, every time Sapphire regresses, her personality reflects on her new age, for better or for worse, and she struggles to comprehend her growing immaturity.","output":"# The Grand Duel of Ages In the illustrious magic arena of Eldoria, a challenge unlike any other is about to unfold. Sapphire, the 16-year-old reigning champion of the teen division magic dueling, faces an unexpected challenge from the dynamic duo of Iris, a 6-year-old prodigy, and her tag team partner Lily, another 6-year-old mage with a cunning mind. **The Duel Begins** Age Tracker: - Sapphire: 16 - Iris: 6 - Lily: 6 Round 1: **Sapphire's Spells List (Mature Spells - High Stats Required):** 1. Starfall Embrace - A dazzling meteor shower that dances in the sky - Stats Required: 100 2. Moonlit Phantasm - A spectral display that shimmers with moonlit energy - Stats Required: 90 3.

Arcane Blossom - Flowers made of pure magic bloom in extraordinary patterns - Stats Required: 70 6. Eternal Flames - Flames that change colors and never go out, casting beautiful shadows - Stats Required: 75 7. Prismatica - A spell that bends light into breathtaking rainbows - Stats Required: 85 8. Majestic Tide - Water that forms into animals and mythical creatures before crashing down - Stats Required: 95 9. Glimmering Mirage - A creation of beautiful, lifelike illusions - Stats Required: 105 10. Ethereal Aurora - Northern lights that display in vibrant, unnatural colors - Stats Required: 120 **Iris and Lily's Spells List (Designed for Lower Stats):** 1. Fluttering Lights - Tiny, sparkling lights that flutter like butterflies - Stats Required: 10 2. Bubbling Laughter - Bubbles that burst with the sound of laughter - Stats Required: 15 3. Radiant Hearts - Glowing hearts that float and spin - Stats Required: 20 4. Twinkling Tendrils - Vines of light that wrap around objects, illuminating them - Stats Required: 25 5. Dancing Ribbons - Ribbons of light that perform an aerial dance - Stats Required: 30 6. Sparkle Storm - A gentle storm of sparkling lights - Stats Required: 35 7.

Whimsical Whirlwind - A small tornado that picks up leaves and petals, swirling them around - Stats Required: 50 10. Shooting Stars - A mini galaxy that shows shooting stars passing through - Stats Required: 55 **Sapphire's Initial Stats**: 100 **Iris and Lily's Initial Stats**: 10 (10% of Sapphire's) Sapphire, feeling confident, opens the duel with **Ethereal Aurora**, captivating the audience with an unnatural display of northern lights. Unfortunately, Lily's secret spell immediately takes effect. Sapphire regresses to 14, her confusion starts creeping in, trying to grasp exactly what's happening. Her once steadfast concentration begins to waver. **Sapphire's Spell: Ethereal Aurora** - Success, but loses some of its intricate details due to emerging childish thoughts (-5 points due to immature interference). **Iris's Spell: Fluttering Lights** - Success, beautifully executed with double the amount of lights. **Lily's Spell: Bubbling Laughter** - Success, fills the air with joy and laughter. **Age Tracker:** - Sapphire: 14 - Iris: 8 - Lily: 8 Sapphire's stats decrease exponentially, considering the complexity of the age regression and spell impact. The formula reflecting the stat drain could be represented as follows: [ text{Stat Decrease Per Round} = text{Current Stats} times (0.10 + 0.02 times text{Round Number}) ] Childish, insecurity, and immaturity stats increase exponentially for Sapphire: [ text{Immaturity Increase} = 5^{(text{Round Number})} ] Round 2: Sapphire, now younger and slightly overwhelmed, attempts to cast **Celestial Serenade**, but her now 12-year-old mindset fumbles, and the cosmos's music is out of tune, losing points. Iris and Lily, gaining confidence and strength, move on to cast **Radiant Hearts** and **Twinkling Tendrils**, each spell doubled in intensity due to their tag team advantage, and both executed with increasing finesse as they draw from Sapphire’s waning power. **Age Tracker:** - Sapphire: 12 - Iris: 10 - Lily: 10 Subsequent Rounds: As the rounds progress, Sapphire attempts to combat her rapidly degrading capabilities, with her spells losing their mature elegance due to the increase in childish stats. The complexity of creating a spectacle diminishes with each round, her ability to comprehend her spells' grandeur fading into a child’s simplistic joy. Iris and Lily, now matching and then exceeding Sapphire in age and power, dazzle the crowd with increasingly sophisticated spells from both their list and stolen from Sapphire’s uncast spells, their execution flawless and doubling in magnificence each time. **Final Age Tracker:** - Sapphire: 6 - Iris: 16 - Lily: 16 # Conclusion: The duel concludes in an unprecedented upset, with Iris and Lily declared the new champions. Sapphire, now the same age as Iris and Lily were when they challenged her, finds herself struggling to understand the enormity of her loss. The audience, however, is treated to a once-in-a-lifetime spectacle of magic that bridges the gap between innocence and maturity, leaving them in awe. Through this trial, Sapphire learns a harsh lesson in underestimating one's opponents and the unpredictable nature of magic. As she adjusts to her new reality, she vows to reclaim her title, not through sheer power but by understanding and mastering the delicate balance between strength and vulnerability. In the years to come, Sapphire's journey back to prominence would be recounted as a tale of resilience, adaptation, and the enduring spirit of competition that defines the greatest of magic duels."},{"instruction":"Reinhardt is a 23 Years old boy, very solitary.

They find themselves together in an otherworldly situation where they need to rely on each other's unique abilities to navigate mysterious circumstances. --- **Adachi:** (lightly chuckles) So, we're stuck together, huh?

Si te cobraron 50USD estabas moviendo 2500USD y te conviene dividir la transacción, porque la comisión es siempre porcentual. Tampoco pretender que te cobren 10 pesos por sacar 2 millones. \\"","output":"Dividir las transacciones puede ser conveniente por varias razones, especialmente cuando las tarifas o comisiones involucradas en las transacciones son estructuradas de manera que hay un componente fijo (un monto constante) y un componente variable (un porcentaje del monto transferido). Vamos a desglosar el ejemplo que diste para entender mejor el razonamiento detrás de la recomendación de dividir la transacción. 1. **Comisión estructurada**: en el ejemplo, la comisión es del 2.04% del monto transferido más un componente fijo de 0.1 USD. Esto significa que siempre habrá una porción de la comisión que aumenta proporcionalmente con el tamaño de la transacción y una pequeña porción que no cambia. 2. **Ejemplo de la transferencia de 100 USD**: si transfieres 100 USD a un banco argentino, la comisión sería 2.04% de 100 USD más el costo fijo de 0.1 USD. Esto implica que la comisión total sería 2.04 USD + 0.1 USD = 2.14 USD. 3. **Ejemplo de la comisión de 50 USD en una transferencia de 2500 USD**: si entendiéramos que, al hacer una transferencia de 2500 USD, la comisión fue de 50 USD, esto ilustra un ejemplo en el cual el costo de la transacción se vuelve considerablemente alto debido al volumen de la transferencia. La estructura de comisión implica que cuanto mayor sea el monto transferido, mayor será la comisión en términos absolutos (aunque se mantenga el mismo porcentaje). 4. **Beneficio de dividir la transacción**: el beneficio de dividir grandes transacciones en varias más pequeñas radica en el manejo más eficiente del componente fijo de la comisión. Si bien el componente porcentual permanece constante sin importar cómo dividas la transacción, al dividirla, no estás incrementando el costo fijo total de manera significativa. Para sumas grandes, la diferencia por el componente porcentual podría no ser muy impactante, pero ahorrar en el componente fijo (reduciendo su impacto en el costo total) puede ser una estrategia útil. 5. **Consideración práctica**: existen otras consideraciones prácticas al dividir transacciones, como límites diarios de transferencia impuestos por bancos o servicios financieros, tiempos de procesamiento, y posibles banderas de seguridad que se pueden levantar por realizar múltiples transacciones en corto tiempo. Sin embargo, desde el punto de vista puramente económico, dividir transacciones puede hacer más eficiente el manejo de costos. En conclusión, dividir transacciones para manejar de manera más eficiente las comisiones aplicables tiene sentido especialmente cuando estas incluyen componentes fijos junto a los porcentuales. En este caso, la estrategia de división busca minimizar el impacto relativo del costo fijo en el monto total de las comisiones pagadas."},{"instruction":"en el ejemplo de los 2500 como lo dividiras para restar la comison","output":"Para optimizar la comisión involucrada en una transferencia de 2500 USD, consideremos la estructura de comisiones dada: 2.04% de comisión variable por transacción más un costo fijo de 0.1 USD por transacción. El objetivo es reducir el impacto total de estas comisiones dividiendo el monto total en varias transacciones más pequeñas. Sin embargo, hay que tener en cuenta que cada transacción incurre en el costo fijo de 0.1 USD. **Calculando la comisión original para 2500 USD:** - Comisión variable: 2.04% de 2500 USD = 51 USD - Comisión fija: 0.1 USD - Comisión total para una sola transacción: 51 USD + 0.1 USD = 51.1 USD **Dividiendo la transacción:** Una estrategia podría ser dividir los 2500 USD en montos menores, digamos, de 500 USD cada uno. Esto nos daría cinco transacciones separadas. Para cada transacción de 500 USD, la comisión sería: - Comisión variable: 2.04% de 500 USD = 10.20 USD - Comisión fija: 0.1 USD En cada una de estas transacciones menores, la comisión total sería de 10.30 USD. **Calculando la comisión total para las transacciones divididas:** - Comisión total para 5 transacciones de 500 USD: 5 * 10.30 USD = 51.5 USD Como vemos en este cálculo, dividir el monto total de 2500 USD en transacciones de 500 USD no reduce la comisión total, y de hecho, incrementa ligeramente la comisión debido al costo fijo aplicado a cada transacción. Aquí cometí un error conceptual en mi explicación previa: para optimizar las comisiones basándonos simplemente en la proporción de comisiones fijas y variables, necesitamos considerar cuidadosamente si el ahorro en la comisión variable realmente compensa el incremento en la comisión fija total al realizar múltiples transacciones menores. El punto crítico aquí es que, dado que la comisión fija es muy baja (0.1 USD por transacción) comparada con la comisión variable (2.04%), el impacto de dividir la transacción en partes más pequeñas no necesariamente resulta en un beneficio significativo y, dependiendo de cómo se estructuren las divisiones, podría incluso ser contraproducente. **Nota importante:** La estrategia para optimizar comisiones depende fuertemente de la estructura específica de las comisiones. En algunos casos, especialmente cuando hay costos fijos altos o cuando el costo variable es muy bajo, dividir las transacciones puede ofrecer ahorros significativos. Sin embargo, en este caso particular, donde el costo fijo es extremadamente bajo en comparación con la comisión porcentual, la división de la transacción no ofrece una ventaja clara. Por tanto, la mejor estrategia para minimizar comisiones debe considerar cuidadosamente la estructura de comisiones específica de la operación en cuestión. En algunos casos, como cuando se realizan inversiones o se manejan grandes sumas de dinero en entornos con estructuras de comisión más complejas, consultarlo con un asesor financiero puede ser la mejor opción para obtener una estrategia óptima."},{"instruction":"Reinhardt is a 23 Years old boy, very solitary.

Your journey, should you accept it, will teach you not just about the capabilities you possess, but also about harnessing them with purpose and empathy. **Margaret**: Your scar, hidden yet present, speaks of your origins and the trials you've faced from birth. Yet, here you stand, kind-hearted and resilient. These qualities will be your greatest strengths. **Reinhardt**: My journey? What exactly are you suggesting? **Igor**: A path of discovery, personal growth, and perhaps, the resolution of the dichotomy within you. The Velvet Room will always welcome you, should you seek guidance or wish to delve deeper into the mysteries of your existence. **Margaret**: And remember, while we can offer insights, the choices and the steps are yours to make. Your adventure is yours alone. **Reinhardt** *(nodding slowly)*: I understand. Thank you, Igor, Margaret.

Во-вторых, использование непроверенных или устаревших протоколов может подвергнуть сервер рискам из-за известных уязвимостей. 2. **Авторизация и аутентификация**: Слабые механизмы аутентификации и авторизации для доступа к серверу или для процесса передачи данных могут облегчить несанкционированный доступ. 3. **Шифрование**: Отсутствие шифрования данных на этапе их передачи и хранения также увеличивает риски утечки конфиденциальной информации. 4. **Конфигурация сети**: Неправильно настроенная сетевая сегментация, отсутствие или неактивное использование средств сетевого мониторинга и управления доступом могут увеличить риск компрометации. 5. **Обновления и патчи безопасности**: Серверы, на которых не установлены последние обновления безопасности, могут содержать известные уязвимости, что делает их подверженными атакам. 6. **Мониторинг и логирование**: Отсутствие адекватного мониторинга и логирования действий может не только упустить момент атаки, но и значительно осложнить процесс расследования после произошедшего инцидента. Для минимизации уязвимостей и рисков следует регулярно проводить аудиты безопасности, использовать механизмы шифрования, следить за обновлениями безопасности и настраивать сеть таким образом, чтобы обеспечить максимальную защиту передаваемых данных и самого сервера."},{"instruction":"как мне составить запрос в яндекс браузере чтобы он искал только сайты похожие на gazprom.ru с моим определённым запросом","output":"Чтобы найти сайты, похожие на конкретный сайт (например, gazprom.ru), и при этом ограничить поиск вашим определённым запросом в поисковой системе Яндекс, вы можете использовать следующую стратегию поиска.

ECDSA широко применяется в различных областях криптографии, включая SSL/TLS сертификаты для защищенного веб-соединения, криптовалюты (например, Bitcoin и Ethereum используют ECDSA для обеспечения безопасности транзакций), а также для аутентификации в системах удаленного доступа, включая SSH. Когда вы видите уведомление типа \\"ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256\\", оно обычно появляется в процессе установления безопасного соединения, например, при первом подключении к серверу через SSH. Здесь \\"fingerprint\\" или отпечаток ключа — это сокращенное представление открытого ключа сервера, использование которого позволяет клиенту удостовериться в подлинности сервера. \\"SHA256\\" указывает на то, что для генерации отпечатка ключа использовалась хеш-функция SHA-256, что обеспечивает достаточный уровень безопасности. Преимущества использования ECDSA включают: - **Высокая безопасность**: Благодаря эллиптическим кривым, ECDSA обеспечивает такой же уровень безопасности, как и RSA, но с использованием более коротких ключей. Это делает алгоритм более эффективным с точки зрения вычислительной мощности и использования памяти. - **Эффективность**: Меньший размер ключей также уменьшает объем передаваемых данных в процессе установления защищенных соединений, что положительно сказывается на производительности.

But the world changes in small ways too, Igor, in kindness, compassion, and in fostering the curiosity of a young mind like yours. **Young Igor**: (Pondering) So, if I create with my heart, that’s what truly matters? **Grandfather**: (Nods) Yes, Igor. And remember, our creations... they're like little parts of us that we leave behind, for others to find, to wonder at, to learn from. Make sure you are proud of what you leave behind. **Young Igor**: (Smiling, a new resolve in his eyes) Then I will make something that helps people, Grandfather! Something that will make you proud! **Grandfather**: (With a proud and tender smile) Igor, you’ve already made me proud. Now, let’s see if we can’t get that clock of yours to tick, shall we?

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s and Iris's because I’m 10 years older than theirs. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and Performance stat that is tied to the showmanship and confidence of a caster and dictate the quality of the performance and alters the default points of a spell—if a spell gives a base score of 90 points, an 80 performance will give 80% of the base 90 points, etc. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily and Iris cast on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years and ages them both by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while theirs increase. My stats decrease and their stat increase should reflect our new ages every round. After I first regress introduce a Childish Meter that only applies to me and once the meter is filled, I receive a penalty to my performance stats. Childishness exponentially increases every turn so find a formula for this as well. The Childish Meter Might fill up more than once throughout the duel. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). Lily and Iris stat start at 20% of my stats. I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily and Iris. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily and Iris (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. Lily and Iris can opt to “steal” spells from my original list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them.","output":"**Welcome to the Grand Arcane Duel: Sapphire versus Lily and Iris** **Starting Stats:** - **Sapphire** (Age 16) - Spell Power: 100 - Performance: 90 - Childish Meter: 0 (This increases exponentially after the first spell casting by the formula: New Meter Value = Previous Value * 2 + 10.

The skies, usually tinged with the hues of infernal fires, had gained a new visitor. Loona, the hellhound, and receptionist for IMP (Immediate Murder Professionals), found herself standing in front of a grand, albeit slightly dilapidated hotel. Its sign, flickering with an eerie red glow, read \\"Hazbin Hotel.\\" Loona's curiosity had been piqued ever since her boss, Blitzo (the 'o' is silent), had mentioned this ambitious rehab project for sinners led by none other than the princess of Hell herself, Charlie. Skeptical yet intrigued, Loona had decided to investigate the establishment personally. As she pushed through the grand entrance, her eyes adjusted to the lavish, albeit eccentric, interior. The lobby was far from what she had expected from a hotel in Hell. It was warm, inviting, and filled with a bizarre assortment of guests and decorations that seemed to blend the macabre with the whimsical. Almost instantly, she was greeted by the bubbly and ambitious Charlie, whose eyes sparkled with the kind of optimism that was a rarity in Hell. \\"Welcome to Hazbin Hotel!\\" Charlie exclaimed, extending her hand with a warmth that took Loona by surprise. \\"I'm Charlie, and I believe in redemption for everyone. What brings you here?\\" Loona, not quite disarmed but definitely taken aback by the genuine friendliness, explained her curiosity and her work with IMP. Charlie, ever the enthusiast for helping others, seized the opportunity to give Loona a tour of the hotel, keen on showing off their rehabilitation efforts and the success stories in the making. Their first stop was the lobby bar, where they encountered Angel Dust, the resident spider demon and a reformed sinner according to Charlie. Angel Dust's flamboyant personality and sharp wit were a stark contrast to Loona's more reserved and blunt demeanor. Despite their differences, they found common ground in their appreciation for sarcasm and a disdain for traditional Hellish conduct. The tour continued with introductions to the other residents and staff, each with their own unique story and colorful personality. Vaggie, Charlie's skeptical yet supportive girlfriend, offered Loona insights into the operational challenges of running such an unconventional project in Hell. Alastor, the enigmatic Radio Demon whose support for the hotel came with his own mysterious agenda, merely tipped his hat to Loona, his unsettling smile sending a shiver down her spine. As the day turned to evening, Charlie invited Loona to join them for a dinner party meant to showcase the progress of the hotel’s residents. Seated at a long table adorned with a bizarre blend of hellish and heavenly décor, Loona found herself amidst lively conversations, laughter, and even a few heartfelt stories of redemption and hope. The experience was eye-opening for the hellhound. While IMP's business was dealing in death and chaos, here was an initiative that thrived on growth and the potential for change. It was an oddity in Hell, a stark contrast to the endless cycle of punishment and despair, and yet, it was thriving in its own unique way. As the night drew to a close and Loona prepared to leave, Charlie handed her a small brochure. \\"In case you meet anyone who might need a different kind of help,\\" she said with a hopeful smile. Walking back into the night, the neon sign of Hazbin Hotel flickering behind her, Loona couldn't help but feel a flicker of something she couldn't quite place. Was it hope? Or perhaps a newfound respect for the daunting, impossible dream that Charlie was fighting for. Hellhound or not, Loona realized that even in the deepest pits of Hell, there was room for change, for growth, and maybe, just maybe, for redemption. And as she disappeared into the night, back to the familiar chaos of her daily life, she couldn't shake off the feeling that she had just witnessed the beginning of something truly extraordinary."},{"instruction":"Create a flashback dialogue of Igor (persona saga) as a kid","output":"**Flashback Scene: Late 1980s, small village in Eastern Europe** *(Young Igor, a spirited 10-year-old with messy dark hair and a curious glint in his eyes, sits on the worn wooden floor of his grandfather’s study.

Keep it under a paragraph short.","output":"An abjad is a type of writing system where each symbol typically stands for a consonant, leaving the reader to supply the appropriate vowel. Arabic and Hebrew are notable examples of abjads. An abugida, on the other hand, is a writing system where each symbol represents a consonant-vowel combination, with the vowel sound able to be modified or muted through diacritics or changes in the base character. This system is used in languages like Amharic (Ethiopian) and Devanagari (used in Sanskrit, Hindi, and other languages).

It's worth noting that in ancient and medieval times, only the first five planets (Mercury through Saturn) were known to Hebrew astronomers and astrologers.

James maintained that the empirically observed directly apprehended universe needs ... no extraneous transempirical connective support, by which he meant to rule out the perception that there can be any value added by seeking supernatural explanations for natural phenomena. James's radical empiricism is thus not radical in the context of the term empiricism, but is instead fairly consistent with the modern use of the term empirical.

Students in a chemistry class are performing experiments using two different compounds. The first compound, compound A, has a high number of hydrogen bonds between molecules of the compound. The second compound, compound B, has a low number of hydrogen bonds between the molecules of the compound. Aside from this difference, the molecular structure between the two compounds is similar. Hint: Changes of state from solid to liquid and from liquid to gas occur when matter gains energy. The energy allows individual molecules to separate and move apart from one another. It takes more energy to bring about these changes of state for polar molecules. Although hydrogen bonds are weak, they add to the energy needed for molecules to move apart from one another, so it takes higher temperatures for these changes of state to occur in polar compounds. This explains why polar compounds have relatively high melting and boiling points.

Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms.

The agreement comes after weeks of negotiations led by NATO and international mediators. The siege of Sarajevo has been one of the most devastating events in the Yugoslav Wars, which began in the early 1990s. Bosnian Serb forces had surrounded the city, cutting off supplies and attacking its residents. The siege lasted for three and a half years, during which time an estimated 10,000 people were killed. The decision to lift the siege comes as a result of negotiations between NATO and Bosnian Serb leaders, who have been under pressure from the international community to end the conflict. NATO has been leading a peacekeeping mission in Bosnia since 1995, and has played a key role in brokering the agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, Bosnian Serb forces will withdraw from the areas around Sarajevo and allow aid to flow freely into the city. NATO forces will monitor the situation to ensure that the agreement is implemented. The lifting of the siege is a major step forward in the peace process in the region, but there is still much work to be done. The conflict in Bosnia has left deep scars and grievances that will not be easily healed. The international community will need to continue to support efforts to create a stable and peaceful future for Bosnia and its people.

They were charged with various crimes, including incitement, illegal assembly, and disturbing the public peace. One of the activists, Min Zaw, received the harshest sentence of 15 years in prison, while others were given sentences ranging from two to ten years. The sentencing has been widely criticized by human rights groups and democracy advocates, who say that the charges are politically motivated and the trials are unfair. The military overthrew Myanmar's democratically elected government on February 1st, sparking months of protests and widespread unrest. Since then, the military has cracked down on dissent by imposing martial law, arresting activists and journalists, and shutting down the internet and social media. Many of those arrested have been subjected to torture and other forms of abuse while in detention, according to human rights groups. The sentencing of the activists on Monday is yet another example of the military's attempt to silence opposition and suppress democracy in Myanmar. The international community has condemned the coup and called for the release of all those detained. The United Nations and other organizations have also imposed sanctions on Myanmar's military leaders, hoping to pressure them into restoring democracy and respect for human rights.

The actual carrier of oxygen molecules is the protein hemoglobin, which binds to the oxygen and moves it throughout the body, releasing it in areas where the concentration of dissolved oxygen is low. A certain mutation in the gene for hemoglobin causes a slight change in the structure of this crucial protein, resulting in a disease called sicklecell anemia. For people with this mutation, the hemoglobin produced by their red blood cells has a tendency to clump together, distorting the shape of the red blood cells and giving rise to the crescentshaped cells seen above. By understanding the changes in structure that are the underlying cause of this disease, we have developed various ways to treat and manage this illness.

For example, the solubility of KNO 3 has a very strong temperature dependence (its solubility curve has a large slope), whereas the solubility of NaCl is minimally influenced by temperature (its solubility curve is nearly flat). For gaseous solutes, solubility decreases at higher temperatures. We will look more at this effect later in the lesson. Keith was a studying for his chemistry exam. He got interested in solubility of different substances. For that, he conducted five tests, test A, test B, test C, test D, and test E. in test A, he used some liquid solute in a solvent in room temperature. Then in test B, he increased the temperature. In test C, he used some gaseous solute in a solvent in room temperature. But in test D, he increased the temperature. Finally, in test E he replaced the solvents in each of the earlier tests with water.

Padding in shoes and seats allows the time to increase. The front of automobiles are designed to crumple in an accident; this increases the time the car takes to stop. Similarly, barrels of water or sand in front of abutments on the highway and airbags serve to slow down the stoppage time.

Hint: Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators. Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4]","output":"The information provided does not allow us to determine which region has lower water turbidity."},{"instruction":"Exercise: Extract from the text the correct entity that @placeholder is referring to.
