One particular time I was refinishing a section of ceiling. I had laid in the wiring and insulation by myself and all that remained was nailing a number of heavy 4ftx8ft gypsum wallboard panels onto the rafters of the 8 ft ceiling. I had arranged for a paid assistant to help me since the height of the ceiling and the weight of the wallboard was more than I could handle. When the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a “rage” of determination. Using a six foot ladder, three 2x4s and my head(literally) I hefted the heavy wallboard, Using leverage I placed them one by one on the overhead rafters, held and braced them with my head, glued and nailed them there all by myself. About a half hour after I finished, I was standing there smugly trying to figure how I did it so easily when there was a knock at the door. Of course it was the assistant with a lot of excuses. He seemed surprised when I told him I was finished. He looked up at the ceiling and said \\"how in the world did you get those up there by yourself?\\" I said, \\"Oh, believe me, You helped more than you will ever know!\\" I learned a lot from that. Anger has its place in your life. You have to control it and use it directly to solve a problem. To this day I do not know how I accomplished what I did the way I did it. But, if I hadn't been so angry I would never have attempted it at all. Life is full of little lessons. Pay attention to them and learn.

Unifying what is now modern Vietnam in 1802, he founded the Nguyn Dynasty, the last of the Vietnamese dynasties. - The Nguyn dynasty (Hán-Nôm: , \\"Nguyn triu\\") was the last ruling family of Vietnam. Their rule lasted a total of 143 years. It began in 1802 when Emperor Gia Long ascended the throne after defeating the Tây Sn dynasty and ended in 1945 when Bo i abdicated the throne and transferred power to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. During the reign of Emperor Gia Long, the nation officially became known as \\"Vit Nam\\" (), but from the reign of emperor Minh Mng on, the nation was renamed \\"i Nam\\" (, literally \\"Great South\\"). Their rule was marked by the increasing influence of French colonialism; the nation was eventually partitioned into three, Cochinchina became a French colony while Annam and Tonkin became protectorates which were independent in name only. - Vietnam, officially the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRV), is the easternmost country on the Indochina Peninsula in Southeast Asia. With an estimated 90.5 million inhabitants , it is the world's 14th-most-populous country, and the eighth-most-populous Asian country. Vietnam is bordered by China to the north, Laos to the northwest, Cambodia to the southwest, Thailand across the Gulf of Thailand to the southwest, and the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia across the South China Sea to the east and southeast. Its capital city has been Hanoi since the reunification of North and South Vietnam in 1976. - The Lý dynasty (Hán Nôm: ), sometimes known as the Later Lý dynasty, was a Vietnamese dynasty that began in 1009 when Lý Thái T overthrew the Early Lê dynasty and ended in 1225, when the queen Lý Chiêu Hoàng (then 8 years old) was forced to abdicate the throne in favor of her husband, Trn Cnh. During Lý Thánh Tông's reign, the official name of Vietnam became i Vit. - Lý Thánh Tông (born Lý Nht Tôn , ruled 10541072) was the posthumous title of the third emperor of the Lý dynasty of Vietnam. Like his father, he was considered as one of the most talented and benevolent emperors in Vietnamese history. - Indravarman VI , Ba Dich Lai , Chang - pa - ti - lai , Virabhadravarman , or Ngauk Klaung Vijaya was the son of Jaya Simhavarman V. He took the name Indravarman when crowned in 1432 . In order to maintain i Vit neutrality , he gave up the important province of Indrapura . Maspero lists Nauk Glaun Vijaya as the son of Jaya Simhavarman V , which may be the same individual , but states he did not assume his father 's reign after his death in 1441 . Instead , a nephew , Maha Vijaya , ascended the throne . - i Vit ( , literally Great Viet) is the name of Vietnam for the periods from 1054 to 1400 and 1428 to 1804. Beginning with the rule of Lý Thánh Tông (r. 10541072), the third emperor of the Lý Dynasty, until the rule of Gia Long (r. 18021820), the first emperor of the Nguyn Dynasty, it was the second-longest used name for the country after \\"Vn Lang\\".

The anonymous buyer, believed to be an individual collector who lives in the United States, made the winning bid in a fiercely contested nine-minute auction at Sotheby's in Manhattan. Eight bidders were joined by 500 coin collectors and dealers in an auction house audience seemingly devoid of celebrity bidders, while an additional 534 observers followed the bidding on eBay. As auction houses prepare for their fall seasons in an uncertain economy, the sale price \\"suggests that the marketplace for important items is enormously strong,\\" said David Redden, a vice chairman at Sotheby's, who was the auctioneer. \\"This is an astonishing new record for a coin,\\" he said. In an unprecedented move, the auction proceeds were split by the U.S. Mint and a London coin dealer, Stephen Fenton, who had won that right in court after having been arrested by Secret Service agents for trying to sell the coin in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan in 1996.

Scared: Tulisa Contostavlos, pictured here at the Academy Awards, called police after men were spotted outside her house. English Defence League boss Tommy Robinson was questioned by police after he was spotted outside the home of Tulisa Contostavlos with a cameraman. Mr Robinson - real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon - was confronted by police officers and had his car searched after the former X Factor judge dialled 999. Friends of the star have said she feels 'victimised' by their activities and is still too scared to return to the £6million Hertfordshire home. However the men, who claim they were filming a documentary, were not arrested, and police decided that no crimes had occurred, the Sunday People reported. Mr Robinson had used her house as the backdrop for a video six days earlier in a video asking viewers for money. At the end of the video, he jokingly adds that the money could let the EDL 'buy a house like this', before walking towards it as if to go inside. The former N-Dubz member reportedly. tried to ignore the activity but eventually felt compelled to call the. police once she spotted the men outside her gated home late at night. A friend of Miss Constostavlos said: 'She's really shaken up - she has no idea why the EDL targeted her. 'She's absolutely not a supporter of the EDL, but she's never said anything publicly about them, so feels pretty victimised.' Four police cars and a dog unit were called to the house on September 11, while Miss Consostavlos's PA Gareth Varey confronted the men. A Hertfordshire Police spokesman confirmed that they had been called to the incident. He said: 'We were called at 10.23pm to reports of suspicious behaviour of two men in a vehicle outside a property. Scroll down for video. Filming: A video uploaded to YouTube shows EDL leader Stephen Lennon gesturing towards the star's house. Spotted: At the end of the video he walks towards the gated house as if to go inside. 'Both men were spoken to. As a precaution, we also searched the area. We were satisfied no crimes had occurred.' Mr Robinson, who tweeted pictures of the officers questioning him and searching his car, later said: 'It was just me and a camera guy who is making a documentary.' He then said that Mr Varey had 'started piping up cos we was [sic] making a 3 min vid in a lay by outside'. After the news emerged this morning, Mr Robinson tweeted 'Worst idea I've ever had!'

Some of the video the two men made outside the star's house had been uploaded to Youtube, and shows the EDL leader begging viewers for donations to pay legal fees. Mr Robinson tells his audience that he desperately needs money to pay a legal bill he said he had already run up trying to challenge police restrictions on one of the EDL's controversial marches. In a bizarre sign-off at the end of the video, Robinson addressed the camera and jokes: 'Please give us some money - so we can by a house like this.' He then adds: 'Who lives in a house like this?' before walking towards it as if to go inside.

Television stations showed hundreds of police wearing helmets and holding shields and batons facing off with student-led protesters, who have occupied key roads and streets in Hong Kong’s business district for more than two weeks. The two sides have been locked in a stalemate after the government called off negotiations last week. It was not immediately clear what caused Tuesday night’s standoff, but local television reports said it began when police arrested a protester. Some demonstrators then tried to take over a tunnel in front of the government headquarters near the entrance to the office of the city’s leader. The reports said police used pepper spray to try to disperse the protesters but then retreated, leaving the tunnel in the hands of the protesters, who were building barricades to expand the occupied area. Earlier, police cleared barricades from the pro-democracy protest zones, signalling authorities’ growing impatience with the activists. Officers used electric saws and bolt-cutters to take down bamboo scaffolding in the Admiralty area, after a mob of masked men stormed some of the barricades the day before. Police also removed metal barricades from another protest camp on a road in the nearby Causeway Bay shopping area to free up a lane for traffic. Police said they would continue to take down barriers, and said officers arrested 23 men on Monday when masked men and taxi drivers led a crowd of several hundred who tried to charge the protest zone. The protesters want China’s government to drop plans for a pro-Beijing committee to screen candidates in the territory’s first direct elections, promised for 2017. They also demand that Hong Kong’s Beijing-backed leader, Leung Chun-ying, resign. Leung has said there is “almost zero chance” that China’s government will change its rules for the 2017 election. The demonstrations have posed an unprecedented challenge to the government. Organisers say as many as 200,000 people thronged the streets for peaceful sit-ins after police used teargas on 28 September to disperse unarmed protesters. Numbers have since dwindled and the remaining demonstrators, sensing that the earlier actions were aimed at testing their defences, are braced for possible further police moves to clear out their camps.

In the mine A:","output":"Title: The Mystery of the Bald-Headed Bear Genre: Adventure, Mystery, Drama Plot: Act 1: Introduction The movie opens with a pan shot of a small, remote mountain town of Baldwood. The town is named after the abundant bald cypress trees, but it has a hidden secret that only a handful of the older townsfolk know - the legend of the Bald-Headed Bear. The bear is believed to have magical powers that can bring prosperity to the town if anyone finds it. People seldom discuss the bear in public, dismissing it as a baseless myth. Chet, a young and adventurous geologist, moves to Baldwood to study the town's extensive network of mines, which hold a rich history but have run dry of useful resources. Chet has an insatiable curiosity and a strong belief that there's more to the mines than meets the eye. Upon arrival, he hears whispers about the Bald-Headed Bear, piquing his interest more than ever. Act 2: The Hunt Begins Chet befriends a local old miner, Daniel, who has deep knowledge of the mines and their history. After gaining Daniel's trust, Chet slowly uncovers the truth about the Bald-Headed Bear. Daniel reveals that the mines were not only used for mining but were also a place where the townsfolk attempted to find and capture the legendary bear. With Daniel's guidance, Chet starts investigating the mines, seeking clues about the bear's possible whereabouts. The townsfolk express concern over Chet's meddling, but he is undeterred, convinced that the bear could hold answers to the town's economic problems and hold the key to prosperity once more. Act 3: Discoveries and Betrayal As Chet delves deeper into the mines, he finds an unknown tunnel that leads to an ancient chamber with paintings of the Bald-Headed Bear on the walls. The chamber points towards the bear's hidden lair inside the mines, revealing the magical elements associated with it. Chet's findings excite the town, but they also attract unwanted attention. An ambitious entrepreneur, Mr. Wellington, learns of the bear's existence and believes capturing it could make him wealthy and powerful. He manipulates some of the townsfolk into disclosing information about the bear and its whereabouts, intent on capturing the creature before anyone else. Act 4: The Climax As Chet and Daniel draw closer to the bear's lair, they notice that someone else seems to have tracked the creature too. They soon realize that Mr. Wellington is after the bear for his own selfish reasons. A race against time begins as Chet and Daniel scramble to find and protect the bear before Mr. Wellington. They finally reach the Bald-Headed Bear's lair, only to find Mr. Wellington cornering the creature. It turns out that the bear has a unique ability to find rare minerals and resources, hence its mythical association with prosperity. Chet courageously intervenes, saving the bear from Mr. Wellington's clutches. Act 5: Resolution Chet returns the Bald-Headed Bear to the townsfolk and convinces them to let the creature live in peace in their community. The bear, grateful for Chet's help, leads the town to find a new mineral vein filled with valuable resources. This newfound wealth revitalizes Baldwood, making it prosperous and reuniting the community. Chet, now a local hero, decides to stay in Baldwood, continuing his work as a geologist and forming a bond with the bear. The movie ends on a heartwarming note, as the Bald-Headed Bear, now a symbol of unity and hope for the townsfolk, roams free and protected in the forests surrounding Baldwood."},{"instruction":"Next question: what is the name of cricket stadium in chennai?","output":"To find the name of the cricket stadium in Chennai, I will perform the following steps: Step 1: Recall my knowledge about popular landmarks in Chennai, particularly cricket stadiums.

About 22 million people die from air pollution each year. Breathing polluted air increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. Breathing bad air also increases the chances of dying from other diseases. Children are most likely to be affected by air pollution. That’s because their lungs are still developing and growing. Children also take in more air for their size than adults do. Some air pollutants damage the environment as well as the health of living things. The type of damage depends on the pollutant.

Cardboard boxes can be obtained for free from membership warehouse stores, liquor stores, furniture stores, discount stores, copy shops, toy stores, or grocery stores. Cardboard tubes can be salvaged from paper towels, wrapping paper, mailing tubes, and bolts of fabric. It is important to pick appropriate materials for your cat. For example, if your cat likes to chew cardboard, don't use tape or glue. Pick the materials according to whether you want to be able to disassemble some or all of the boxes after you are finished or whether you want some or all of the boxes to be permanently connected. Think about a shape that would fit well in your house and would provide comfort and entertainment to your cat. Decide whether you want different \\"rooms\\" to have different purposes: you might build an observation deck, for instance, and designate one room for sleeping and hiding, and one room for snacking. Take the future location of your structure into account. If it is by a window, you will want the cat structure to have plenty of windows, and you will want to build it so that it does not block your light. You might choose to build next to a wall that will provide support, or it may be freestanding, in which case you will need to reinforce your structure. Experiment with different ways of arranging the boxes: Put some boxes inside of others. Connect two or more groups of boxes using single, long boxes as tunnels or bridges. Make steps using a series of smaller boxes. Experiment with different size windows, doors, and trap doors. Draw windows, doors, or trap doors first before cutting. Do not build your jungle gym more than four levels high. The higher you build your jungle gym, the wider the base should be in each direction. Make an exit plan. While designing your jungle gym, make an \\"emergency hatch\\" so that you can access your cat without completely tearing apart and destroying the jungle gym. This is important when you need to give your cat medicine or take them to the vet. If you have multiple cats, you will want to be able to remove them in case they are fighting inside their new space. If your cats are new or if they are needy, they may decide they are trapped and need to be rescued. Design multiple exits in each box so your cats cannot corner one another. Use cardboard tubes as support posts in vertical structures. Cardboard tubes can also be used to create see-saws; fold one or two in half and place inside another for stability, then tape the tube to the bottom of a long, narrow box with holes cut into it. Kittens especially will be entertained by the unexpected rocking as they move from one end to another. It is easiest to do this in the room where the play equipment will stay. After it is assembled, it can be difficult to maneuver play equipment around corners, up or down stairs, or through doorways. Connect the boxes by building tunnels out of smaller boxes, and by gluing and taping everything in place. Make it sturdy. If you build the play equipment more than a couple of boxes high, you will need to reinforce the first couple of levels with something like cut pieces of cardboard. Cut cardboard to fit along the sides of each box and wedge it into the corners. Reinforce the floors and roof of the boxes with flat pieces of cardboard. Check for safety before you let your cats play on the structure. Try kicking and shaking your structure to test its sturdiness. Place objects the weight of your cat or cats together in each section of the structure to make sure it will hold them easily. Add soft surfaces to make the play equipment comfortable for your cat. Use materials that can be removed for cleaning. Cat size pillows can be made from old socks, potholder mitts, pillowcases, hand towels, shirts, or curtains. Sew up all but one side of your cloth, then stuff with cotton or other washable material and sew closed. Stuff socks with catnip, or tie knotted rope so it dangles. Be sure to avoid toxic materials and choking hazards. Add a flutter \\"curtain\\" over a window or doorway for your cat to bat. If your cat likes mirrors, try gluing one to a box's inside wall. Your cat might not instantly be attracted to its new toy. Catnip placed inside could break the ice. Put familiar toys or blankets inside the entrance room to encourage your cat to explore. Try temporarily placing your cat's food dish inside the cat house. If the structure isn't appealing where it is, try moving it nearer a window or under a sunbeam. Cats may ignore a structure for days or even weeks before they try it out. Give them time. Watch your cats as they enjoy their jungle gym to learn what they like and what elements of your design work best. Eventually each cardboard jungle gym will start to sag and wear out. Use your observations to design your next cat jungle gym.","output":"The article provides tips on creating a cardboard jungle gym for cats using sturdy boxes of different sizes and cardboard tubes.

Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization. But apprehension over whether future U.S. presidents would uphold a nuclear deal reached by Trump could reinforce the North Korean demand for early concessions. John Delury, a North...

Given these facts, what contains most of the energy used by people worldwided among the following options: - heat - Light - coal - grasses - Cooking - glucose - A computer - gasoline","output":"Among the options given, if we take a broader perspective, glucose and grasses (in the form of derived agricultural products) contain most of the energy used by people worldwide. 1. Glucose: It's a simple sugar (monosaccharide) and an essential component of many carbohydrates. More importantly, it's the primary source of energy for our body's cells. Through a metabolic process called cell respiration, the body converts glucose into a usable form of energy (ATP). Almost every species on earth uses glucose for energy. The food we eat, whether it comes directly from plant-based sources or indirectly from animal-based sources, eventually breaks down into glucose in our body. Therefore, if we consider the energy used within the human body itself, much of that could be attributed to glucose. 2. Grasses: While not directly consumed, grasses or more specifically, grains (which botanically are a type of grass) supply most of the world's dietary energy. Major grains including rice, wheat, and corn, collectively provide over 50% of the caloric intake of humans worldwide. They are the primary source of carbohydrates which our body breaks down into glucose for energy. These crops have been cultivated for thousands of years and are a dietary staple in most societies. Therefore, much of the 'physical' energy that humans consume for sustenance and survival can be traced back to these grasses. Contrasting with above, heat, light, coal, and gasoline are sources of energy, but they are used mainly for industrial, transportation, and household purposes (like heating, running machinery, vehicles, electric supply etc.), not directly for human physiological functions or food. Cooking is a process that uses energy (generally in the form of heat) rather than a source of energy. A computer and other electronic devices also consume energy, specifically electrical energy, but it's minor in comparison to the global energy consumption. However, if the perspective of the question extends to all forms of energy, including industrial and transportation energy, then the answer would be different. As of current statistics, coal, followed by gasoline (or more broadly, oil), would constitute the greatest part of the energy mix. Rest of the options, like heat and light, are types of energy but not energy resources. They are usually the output or result of using an energy resource."},{"instruction":"Given the question: - Air goes into the lungs - The lungs remove oxygen from the air - Oxygen diffuses from alveoli in the lungs to the bloodstream - Hemoglobin in red blood cells attaches to the oxygen - Red blood cells carry oxygen all around the body What might be the last step of the process? The answer is:","output":"The last step of the process is the delivery of oxygen to body cells and tissues, where it is used for cellular respiration. During cellular respiration, cells convert oxygen and nutrients (mainly glucose) into carbon dioxide, water, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the main source of energy for cells.

Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening.

The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker.

Known as \\"America's sweetheart of song\\", her signature tunes were \\"Shine On, Harvest Moon\\", \\"Ten Cents a Dance\\" and \\"Love Me or Leave Me\\". Her other popular recordings included \\"Button Up Your Overcoat\\", \\"Mean to Me\\", \\"Exactly Like You\\" and \\"Shaking the Blues Away\\". As a young girl in Nebraska, Etting had wanted to be an artist; she drew and sketched everywhere she was able. The couple moved to New York in 1927, where Etting made her Broadway debut in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1927. Irving Berlin had recommended her to showman Florenz Ziegfeld. Etting nervously prepared to sing for Ziegfeld at the audition. However, he did not ask her to sing at all; only to walk up and down the room. She was hired on that basis because Ziegfeld did not hire women with big ankles. While the original plan for the show was for Etting to do a tap dance after singing \\"Shaking the Blues Away\\", she later remembered she was not a very good dancer. At the show's final rehearsal, Flo Ziegfeld told her, \\"Ruth, when you get through singing, just walk off the stage\\". Etting also appeared in Ziegfeld's last \\"Follies\\" in 1931. She went on to appear in a number of other hit shows in rapid succession, including Ziegfeld's Simple Simon and Whoopee!. Etting was not originally signed to perform in Simple Simon; she became part of the cast at the last minute when vocalist Lee Morse was too intoxicated to perform. Ziegfeld asked Etting to replace Morse; she hurried to Boston, where the show was being tried out prior to Broadway. When Etting arrived, songwriters Rodgers and Hart discovered that the song \\"Ten Cents a Dance\\" was not written for Etting's voice range. The three spent the night rewriting the song so Etting could perform it. Toward the end of Simple Simon's Broadway run, Etting persuaded Ziegfeld to add \\"Love Me Or Leave Me\\" to the show though the song was originally written for Whoopee!. She had recorded the song in 1928, but Etting's new version of it was impressive enough to earn her a Vitaphone contract to make film shorts. In Hollywood, Etting made a long series of movie shorts between 1929 and 1936, and three feature movies in 1933 and 1934. She described the short films as either having a simple plot to allow for her to sing two songs or with no plot at all. The idea was to have Etting sing at least two songs in the film. While she received a marquee billing for Roman Scandals, Etting had only two lines in the film and sang just one song. Etting believed she might have had more success in full-length films if she had been given some acting lessons. Her perception was that the studios viewed her only as a vocalist. She later recalled, \\"I was no actress, and I knew it. But I could sell a song\\". In 1936, she appeared in London in Ray Henderson's Transatlantic Rhythm. Etting quit the show because she and the other performers had not been paid. Etting was first heard on radio station WLS when she was living in Chicago. Her appearance drew so much fan mail, the station signed her to a year's contract for twice weekly performances. She had her own twice weekly 15 minute radio show on CBS in the 1930s. By 1934, she was on NBC with sports announcer Ted Husing doing the announcing and Oldsmobile sponsoring her program.

Solti recorded throughout his career for the Decca Record Company. He made more than 250 recordings, including 45 complete opera sets. During the 1950s and 1960s Decca had an alliance with RCA Victor, and some of Solti's recordings were first issued on the RCA label.Solti was one of the first conductors who came to international fame as a recording artist before being widely known in the concert hall or opera house. Gordon Parry, the Decca engineer who worked with Solti and Culshaw on the Ring recordings, observed, \\"Many people have said 'Oh well, of course John Culshaw made Solti.' This is not true. He gave him the opportunity to show what he could do.\\"Solti's first recordings were as a piano accompanist, playing at sessions in Zurich for the violinist Georg Kulenkampff in 1947. Decca's senior producer, Victor Olof did not much admire Solti as a conductor (nor did Walter Legge, Olof's opposite number at EMI's Columbia Records), but Olof's younger colleague and successor, Culshaw, held Solti in high regard. As Culshaw, and later James Walker, produced his recordings, Solti's career as a recording artist flourished from the mid-1950s. Among the orchestras with whom Solti recorded were the Berlin Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony, London Philharmonic, London Symphony and Vienna Philharmonic orchestras. Soloists in his operatic recordings included Birgit Nilsson, Joan Sutherland, Régine Crespin, Plácido Domingo, Gottlob Frick, Carlo Bergonzi, Kiri Te Kanawa and José van Dam. In concerto recordings, Solti conducted for, among others, András Schiff, Julius Katchen, Clifford Curzon, Vladimir Ashkenazy and Kyung-wha Chung.Solti's most celebrated recording was Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen made in Vienna, produced by Culshaw, between 1958 and 1965.

Your task is to summarize them. Input: The National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB) is out with its “Hot Wheels” list of the most stolen cars in the United States during 2016. The list is led by Honda Motor Co. Ltd.’s (NYSE: HMC) Accord. However, thieves have not been snatching new models. The 1997 Accord is the most stolen version. In fact, of the 10 most stolen cars, seven are 2008 or earlier models. Another example of this is that the second most stolen car is the Honda Civic — the 1998 model. Third on the list is the 2006 model of Ford Motor Co.’s (NYSE: F) full-sized pickup. The list closely matches the top 20 best-selling cars of today. As a matter of fact, the overlap of the 10 most stolen cars to the top 20 selling cars of the first half is a match of nine out of 10. These are the Civic, Accord, Ford full-size pickup, Chevy full-size pickup, Camry, Altima, Corolla, Dodge full-size pickup and Jeep Cherokee/Grand Cherokee. The NICB commented: While Honda Accords and Civics dominate this annual list, they are older, pre-“smart key” production models. Since the introduction of smart keys and other anti-theft technology, Honda thefts have fallen precipitously. As the list of top 25 most stolen 2016 model year vehicles shows, there were only 493 thefts of Accords last year. Technology is working, but complacency can defeat it. While thefts are down dramatically since their all-time high in 1992, thousands of vehicles continue to be stolen each year because owners leave their keys or fobs in the vehicles and that invites theft. New age car technology has proven at least one of its advantages.

Tracking Device: A tracking device emits a signal to the police or to a monitoring station when the vehicle is stolen. Tracking devices are very effective in helping authorities recover stolen vehicles. Some systems employ “telematics,” which combine GPS and wireless technologies to allow remote monitoring of a vehicle. If the vehicle is moved, the system will alert the owner and the vehicle can be tracked via computer.

Far too many thefts occur because the vehicle is left unlocked and the key or fob is inside. Taking the time to lock it up every time you leave it can save a whole lot of headache and expense in the long run.”Vehicle theft is a severe economic hardship for its victims—especially if a vehicle is uninsured.

The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history. - The Euphrates (Sumerian: : \\"Buranuna\\", : \\"Purattu\\", : \\"al-Furt\\", : \\"Prt\\", : \\"Yeprat\\", : \\"Perat\\", ) is the longest and one of the most historically important rivers of Western Asia. Together with the Tigris, it is one of the two defining rivers of Mesopotamia. Originating in eastern Turkey, the Euphrates flows through Syria and Iraq to join the Tigris in the Shatt al-Arab, which empties into the Persian Gulf. - The Arabian Peninsula, simplified Arabia (\\"\\", « Arabian island ») is a peninsula of Western Asia situated northeast of Africa on the Arabian plate.

The capital, and largest city, is Baghdad. The main ethnic groups are Arabs and Kurds; others include Assyrians, Turkmen, Shabakis, Yazidis, Armenians, Mandeans, Circassians, and Kawliya. Around 95% of the country's 36 million citizens are Muslims, with Christianity, Yarsan, Yezidism, and Mandeanism also present. The official languages of Iraq are Arabic and Kurdish. - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - The Tigris and Euphrates, with their tributaries, form a major river system in Western Asia. From sources in the Taurus mountains of eastern Turkey they flow by/through Syria through Iraq into the Persian Gulf.

Title: Looper Movie plot: In 2044, the United States has suffered economic collapse, causing severe social decay and growth in organized crime. In addition, a strange mutation has occurred in 10% of the population, giving them minor telekinetic powers, manifested by their ability to float small objects. They are referred to as TKs. Thirty years into the future in 2074, time travel is invented, but is immediately outlawed. However, because by that point tracking technology has rendered it nearly impossible to dispose of bodies secretly, crime bosses turn to time travel to send their targets to the past (the movie's present) to be killed by \\"loopers\\": hired guns paid in silver to kill whoever is sent to them. The victims have bags over their heads, and silver bars strapped to their backs. This comes at a price: The severe sanctions on time travel mean that crime bosses eventually need to end a looper's contract, and also eliminate any traces of their working relationship, so they send his older version back to be killed by his younger self, referred to as \\"closing the loop\\", which each looper must do himself. They're paid in gold for this, to live the rest of their lives in comfort.Joseph \\"Joe\\" Simmons (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), 25, works for a mafia company in Kansas City as a looper.

Abe also controls the \\"Gat Men,\\" his muscle, led by Kid Blue (Noah Segan). Gat men are so named for their magnum revolvers, which have greater range and accuracy than a looper's 'blunderbuss' shotgun; a weapon designed strictly for close quarters.While at the club one evening, another looper announces that he has just closed his loop.

Womanhood is a mindset, and it can encompass a range of experiences, personal growth, and self-awareness. Empowered women are active participants in their life journey, and they continuously push the boundaries of what it means to be a woman in today's society. In this article, we will explore different ways to nurture a woman's mindset, personal growth, and overall well-being. 1. Being a Woman is a Mindset The first step in embracing your womanhood is to understand that being a woman is a mindset. Recognize that this mindset encompasses both physical and emotional traits, and it calls for openness, courage, and resilience in the face of life's challenges. Tell yourself that being a woman means embracing these qualities, and be proud of who you are. 2. Read Coming-of-Age Books by and about Women Reading coming-of-age books can provide valuable insights into the lives and experiences of other women.

So, pick up a few books, immerse yourself in the lives of inspiring women, and learn from their struggles and triumphs. 3. Learn Appropriate Social Skills and Behaviors Developing social skills and displaying appropriate behavior are essential parts of embracing womanhood.

Make it a point to learn and practice these skills, as they will shape the way you interact with people and the world around you. 4. Act with Confidence A major aspect of embracing womanhood involves acting with confidence. Confidence allows you to express yourself authentically, make decisions in line with your values, and feel secure in your identity. To cultivate confidence, consider surrounding yourself with supportive individuals, take advantage of opportunities to challenge yourself, and be unapologetically you. 5. Learn About the World Expanding your knowledge of the world around you can have a profound impact on your personal growth and understanding of yourself as a woman. Travel, engage with diverse communities, or educate yourself on global issues to build a stronger connection with the world and develop a more comprehensive view of your own place within it. 6. Take Part in a Coming-of-Age Ritual Partaking in a coming-of-age ritual can provide a symbolic transition into womanhood. Consider creating your own ritual or engage in cultural or religious practices that resonate with you. Coming-of-age rituals can serve as a reminder of your personal growth and provide an opportunity to reflect on your journey thus far. 7. Make Goals for Yourself and Live Up to Them Setting and working towards personal goals is an essential part of embracing your womanhood. Reflect on your values and aspirations, and identify goals that will help you develop personally, professionally, and emotionally. Ensure that your goals align with your overarching vision of yourself as a woman, and commit to taking small steps each day to bring you closer to realizing these ambitions. Conclusion Embracing womanhood necessitates a mindset that encompasses personal growth, self-awareness, and a dedication to experiencing life to the fullest. By reading about the experiences of other women, honing social skills, acting with confidence, learning about the world, taking part in coming-of-age rituals, and setting personal goals, you can cultivate an empowered sense of womanhood that will shape your life for years to come."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: - You plant vegetable seeds in the ground - You water the seeds - You wait for the seeds to sprout - You keep the area free of pests and weeds while the plants grow - You thin out the plants as they get bigger to give them space to grow Answer:","output":"The final step of the process is harvesting the fully-grown vegetables.

Adeolokun and Finlay Bealham added touchdowns after the break, while Shane O'Leary kicked a total of 15 points. The result effectively ended Munster's hopes of a semi-final play-off place. They are seventh in the table and face a battle to secure a berth in the Champions Cup next season. Connacht, who leapfrogged Glasgow, completed a season double over their Irish interprovincial rivals for the first time, and a spot in the last four of the competition now appears certain. Victory came as a boost to Pat Lam's men after Ulster ended their six-match unbeaten run in the competition, followed by a 33-32 defeat by Grenoble in the last eight of the European Challenge Cup. A stray Munster hand in the ruck allowed O'Leary to put Connacht ahead after eight minutes, but Zebo - Munster's record try-scorer - went over on his 100th appearance. Although O'Leary reduced the deficit to one point with a penalty, Munster's superb driving maul left Connacht scrambling backwards, and hooker Sherry touched down. With Anthony Foley's side down to 14 men after James Cronin saw yellow, Connacht made their numerical advantage count. The superb Bundee Aki burst through Munster's scrambled defensive line before moving the ball to Finlay Bealham, who sent Adeolokun racing under the posts. O'Leary's easy conversion brought Connacht within a point again. Foley's men found themselves under severe pressure at the scrum and, when Billy Holland was sent to the sin-bin, Connacht made no mistake with a two-man advantage in the pack. Referee Ben Whitehouse marched Munster under the posts for a penalty try that O'Leary converted for a six-point half-time lead. When Robbie Henshaw dropped a cute kick in behind Munster, Adeolokun profited from an awkward bounce to touch down, although O'Leary missed the conversion. Ultan Dillane's powerful carry put Connacht on the front foot deep in opposition territory and, when the ball was recycled, Bealham ran over. O'Leary followed up the conversion with a penalty with the last kick of the game. Connacht: R Henshaw; N Adeolokun, B Aki, P Robb, M Healy; S O'Leary, K Marmion; D Buckley, T McCartney, F Bealham; U Dillane, A Muldowney; S O'Brien, E McKeon, J Muldoon (capt).

Jack scored 5 points more than Jon, and Tom scored 4 less than the points of Jon and Jack together. How many points did they score altogether? Thoughts? Step-by-step reasoning:","output":"Sure, let's solve the problem step-by-step: 1. Jon scored 3 points. 2. Jack scored 5 points more than Jon. Since Jon scored 3 points, we can calculate Jack's points as follows: Jack's points = Jon's points + 5 Jack's points = 3 + 5 Jack's points = 8 3. Tom scored 4 less than the points of Jon and Jack together. We need to first find the total points of Jon and Jack together: Jon and Jack's points = Jon's points + Jack's points Jon and Jack's points = 3 + 8 Jon and Jack's points = 11 4. Now, we can calculate Tom's points as follows: Tom's points = (Jon and Jack's points) - 4 Tom's points = 11 - 4 Tom's points = 7 5. Finally, to find the total points scored by the three of them, we can add their individual points together: Total points = Jon's points + Jack's points + Tom's points Total points = 3 + 8 + 7 Total points = 18 So altogether, Jon, Jack, and Tom scored 18 points in the basketball game."},{"instruction":"What are the keywords in the following sentence: firefighters work to extinguish a fire at a home as they battle a wildfire","output":"The keywords in the sentence are: 1. firefighters - they are the people who put out fires and help keep us safe. 2. work - what the firefighters are doing to put out the fire. 3. extinguish - to put out or stop a fire from burning. 4. fire - the hot, dangerous thing that the firefighters are trying to put out. 5. home - the place where people live, which is on fire right now. 6. battle - like a big, tough fight the firefighters are having against the fire. 7. wildfire - a big, out-of-control fire that usually happens in forests or grasslands."},{"instruction":"Please capitalize where necessary: we help you to secure your rights in connection with:","output":"Step 1: Identify the first word of the sentence.

While concentration is indeed important for studying, the question asks for an action. 3. settle down: This option is a phrasal verb that means to prepare oneself to work, study, or engage in a specific activity. This option seems like the most fitting so far since it describes an action one takes before studying in a library. 4. read books: This option is a common activity in a library, but it does not answer the question specifically about studying. 5. concentrate: This option is the base form of the verb \\"concentrate,\\" which means to focus attention. Similar to the first option, it's related to studying, but there could be a better answer. After analyzing each option, I conclude that the most suitable one for the given question is \\"settle down,\\" as it refers to an action that one takes before studying in a library."},{"instruction":"You are considering whether to buy a product.

The answer to this question is:","output":"The given review would likely have a mixed effect on the chances of me buying the product. On one hand, the review praises the movie itself, referring to it as a \\"great classic war movie\\" and mentioning that it brought back memories of boot camp. These positive remarks about the film's content may pique my interest and make me more inclined to purchase the product. Additionally, the fact that it is a Deluxe Edition might suggest that it includes additional features or enhancements, which is often an appealing factor for potential buyers. On the other hand, the reviewer states that they \\"could not tell the difference between the DVD version and the Blu-ray version.\\" This comment creates some reservation, as one of the primary reasons for purchasing a Blu-ray version of a movie is to enjoy better image and audio quality compared to a standard DVD. If there is no noticeable difference in quality between the two versions, I might be deterred from purchasing the Blu-ray edition and might opt for the DVD version instead, considering it could be more cost-effective. In summary, it can be said that the review has both positive and negative aspects, making the decision to purchase the Blu-ray not straightforward. An individual's preference on the importance of improved visual and audio quality, as well as their attachment to the film, may ultimately determine whether the review would increase or decrease their likelihood of buying this particular product."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence about this data: Angola, Indiana, isPartOf, Steuben County, Indiana; Angola, Indiana, elevationAboveTheSeaLevel, 324.0; Angola, Indiana, isPartOf, Pleasant Township, Steuben County, Indiana; Angola, Indiana, populationDensity, 524.5 (inhabitants per square kilometre); Angola, Indiana, areaTotal, 16.55 (square kilometres)","output":"Based on the given data, here is the generated sentence: \\"Angola, Indiana, situated at an elevation of 324.0 meters above sea level, is part of both Steuben County, Indiana, and Pleasant Township within the same county.

In a speech celebrating the birthday of the Prophet Muḥammad, which coincided with New Year's Day, he said they had no time to lose. \\"I say and repeat, again, that we are in need of a religious revolution. You imams are responsible before Allah. The entire world is waiting on you. The entire world is waiting for your word ... because the Islamic world is being torn, it is being destroyed, it is being lost. And it is being lost by our own hands,\\" el-Sisi said. \\"We need a revolution of the self, a revolution of consciousness and ethics to rebuild the Egyptian person -- a person that our country will need in the near future,\\" the President said. El-Sisi, himself a pious man, was elected in May after leaving the military to run for the office. A former defense minister, he led the ouster of Mohamed Morsy -- the Islamist who was Egypt's first democratically elected President -- and has long positioned himself as a more secular option, and defender against extremist views. \\"It's inconceivable that the thinking that we hold most sacred should cause the entire Islamic world to be a source of anxiety, danger, killing and destruction for the rest of the world. Impossible that this thinking -- and I am not saying the religion -- I am saying this thinking,\\" el-Sisi said. He continued: \\"This is antagonizing the entire world. It's antagonizing the entire world! Does this mean that 1.6 billion people (Muslims) should want to kill the rest of the world's inhabitants -- that is 7 billion -- so that they themselves may live? Impossible!​\\" While el-Sisi's speech included some powerful language, H.A. Hellyer, a nonresident fellow at the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution and research associate at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, said the President has made similar statements in the past. \\"There is little to suggest (el-Sisi) is interested in some sort of Lutheran reformation of Islam. By all accounts, he's quite comfortable with the prevailing leadership of the Azhari establishment. \\"If anything, he wants to empower it further in order to push forward a counternarrative against radical Islamism. The real question is: How credible can such a state-empowered counternarrative be?\\" Hellyer said. On Tuesday, the President visited the main Coptic cathedral in Cairo to attend a Christmas mass and make a short speech. He is the first president to attend such a mass since the revolution. \\"We will build our country together. We will accommodate each other. We will love each other,\\" el-Sisi said in that speech. Highlights:","output":"1. The Egyptian President asked Muslim leaders to help fight against extremism. 2. He wants a \\"religious revolution\\" and for people to be more aware and have better morals. 3. The President is against bad thinking causing harm to others, not the religion itself. 4.

The question and answer pair are described below.","output":"Question: Why are people not necessarily working for a tan as they walk? Answer: People are not necessarily working for a tan as they walk because there are various reasons for walking and obtaining a tan may not be the primary intention for everyone. Walking is a basic form of transportation, a means to improve overall health and fitness, and a social or recreational activity. While it is true that exposure to sunlight during walking may lead to tanning as a side effect, it isn't always the main motivation for walking. Here are some reasons why people walk: 1. Transportation: Walking is a natural and eco-friendly mode of transportation. People may walk to reach their destinations, whether it's a short distance to a nearby store or as part of their daily commute to work or school. 2. Health and Fitness: Walking is a low-impact physical activity that promotes overall health and well-being. It helps to build cardiovascular endurance, improve muscle strength and flexibility, maintain a healthy weight, and reduce the risk of various health issues like obesity, diabetes, and heart diseases. 3. Mental Health: Walking has been associated with mental health benefits such as reduced stress, alleviated symptoms of depression and anxiety, and improved cognitive function. Taking a walk can be a healthy coping mechanism that allows people to clear their minds and enjoy the therapeutic effects of nature and fresh air. 4. Social Interaction: People often walk as part of a social activity, like walking with friends, family members, or even pets. It provides an opportunity to engage in conversation, share experiences, and stay connected with loved ones. 5. Recreation: Walking can be a leisurely activity or a part of hobbies like birdwatching, photography, or exploring new places. People may walk to admire the beauty of their surroundings and gain new experiences. In summary, walking serves multiple purposes, and though tanning can happen due to sun exposure, it is not necessarily the primary goal for everyone who walks."},{"instruction":"What is the sentiment of the following review?

He invited the chieftains of the former satrapy of Gandhara, in the north of what is now Pakistan, to come to him and submit to his authority. Omphis(Indian name Ambhi Kumar), the ruler of Taxila, whose kingdom extended from the Indus to the Hydaspes (Jhelum), complied, but the chieftains of some hill clans, including the Aspasioi and Assakenoi sections of the Kambojas (known in Indian texts also as Ashvayanas and Ashvakayanas), refused to submit. Ambhi hastened to relieve Alexander of his apprehension and met him with valuable presents, placing himself and all his forces at his disposal. Alexander not only returned Ambhi his title and the gifts but he also presented him with a wardrobe of \\"Persian robes, gold and silver ornaments, 30 horses and 1000 talents in gold\\". Alexander was emboldened to divide his forces, and Ambhi assisted Hephaestion and Perdiccas in constructing a bridge over the Indus where it bends at Hund (Fox 1973), supplied their troops with provisions, and received Alexander himself, and his whole army, in his capital city of Taxila, with every demonstration of friendship and the most liberal hospitality. On the subsequent advance of the Macedonian king, Taxiles accompanied him with a force of 5000 men and took part in the battle of the Hydaspes River. After that victory he was sent by Alexander in pursuit of Porus, to whom he was charged to offer favourable terms, but narrowly escaped losing his life at the hands of his old enemy. Subsequently, however, the two rivals were reconciled by the personal mediation of Alexander; and Taxiles, after having contributed zealously to the equipment of the fleet on the Hydaspes, was entrusted by the king with the government of the whole territory between that river and the Indus. A considerable accession of power was granted him after the death of Philip, son of Machatas; and he was allowed to retain his authority at the death of Alexander himself (323 BC), as well as in the subsequent partition of the provinces at Triparadisus, 321 BC. In the winter of 327/326 BC, Alexander personally led a campaign against these clans; the Aspasioi of Kunar valleys, the Guraeans of the Guraeus valley, and the Assakenoi of the Swat and Buner valleys. A fierce contest ensued with the Aspasioi in which Alexander was wounded in the shoulder by a dart, but eventually the Aspasioi lost. Alexander then faced the Assakenoi, who fought in the strongholds of Massaga, Ora and Aornos. The fort of Massaga was reduced only after days of bloody fighting, in which Alexander was wounded seriously in the ankle. According to Curtius, \\"Not only did Alexander slaughter the entire population of Massaga, but also did he reduce its buildings to rubble\\". A similar slaughter followed at Ora. In the aftermath of Massaga and Ora, numerous Assakenians fled to the fortress of Aornos. Alexander followed close behind and captured the strategic hill-fort after four bloody days.

Just weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in declared the beginning of a new era of peace during a historic summit held in the demilitarized zone of the inter-Korean border, Pyongyang has put further dialogue and cooperation on hold until its demands are met. President Moon will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the upcoming Trump-Kim summit and the North’s sudden conditions set for continued dialogue and cooperation. Most of North Korea’s anger last week, expressed in official statements and reports carried by the state news agency KCNA, seemed to be directed at the U.S. It criticized the Max Thunder joint military exercise that is currently underway, and U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton’s demands for the North’s unilateral nuclear disarmament. North Korea in particular objected to Bolton’s insistence that North Korea follow the Libyan model, which involved the rapid and total dismantlement of that country’s nuclear program, but it was also followed by the overthrow of the country’s leader Moammar Gadhafi some years later. Unless the U.S. eased up on its uncompromising stance, Pyongyang indicated it would pull out of the June 12 meeting in Singapore between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump to negotiate an end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. President Trump later said the Libya model does not apply to North Korea and that Kim Jong Un would remain in power and “be very rich” if he makes a deal to end his country’s nuclear program. North Korea denounced South Korea, as well, for the joint military drills, calling the Seoul government...

Consider the effectiveness and appropriateness of each option. Upon examining each option: - Sleep: Provides the body and mind a chance to recuperate, restore energy, and promote overall well-being. - Sit down: Offers a temporary break, but may not provide enough rest for the body to fully recover from fatigue. - Sit on a chair: Similar to sitting down, it gives momentary relief but may not address the overall fatigue. - Have a rest: This option is less specific and might be effective depending on the type and duration of rest one chooses (e.g., napping, meditating, or simply relaxing). - Lie on the floor: Can provide temporary relief, but might be uncomfortable and less effective than sleep. Considering these evaluations, sleep is the most appropriate and effective choice for addressing full-body fatigue at the end of the day because it allows the body and mind to recover and restore energy throughout the night.

As he drove toward the Murrah Federal Building in the Ryder truck, McVeigh carried with him an envelope containing pages from The Turner Diaries – a fictional account of white supremacists who ignite a revolution by blowing up the FBI headquarters at 9:15 one morning using a truck bomb. McVeigh wore a printed T-shirt with the motto of the Commonwealth of Virginia, Sic semper tyrannis (\\"Thus always to tyrants\\", according to legend what Brutus said as he assassinated Julius Caesar, also shouted by John Wilkes Booth immediately after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln) and \\"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants\\" (from Thomas Jefferson). He also carried an envelope full of revolutionary materials that included a bumper sticker with the Thomas Jefferson slogan, \\"When the government fears the people, there is liberty. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.\\" Underneath, McVeigh had written, \\"Maybe now, there will be liberty!\\" with a hand-copied quote by John Locke asserting that a man has a right to kill someone who takes away his liberty.McVeigh entered Oklahoma City at 8:50 am. At 8:57 am, the Regency Towers Apartments' lobby security camera that had recorded Nichols's pickup truck three days earlier recorded the Ryder truck heading towards the Murrah Federal Building.

A. swim B. jog C. excercise D. work out E. rock climb The best answer is Answer:","output":"The best answer to getting in shape when there is no land nearby is A. Swim. Swimming is a full-body workout that helps to improve cardiovascular fitness, muscle strength, and flexibility. It is an ideal exercise for people of all ages and fitness levels, as the water provides natural resistance without putting excess strain on the joints. When there is no land nearby, swimming becomes the most accessible and effective exercise option due to its low-impact nature and ability to engage various muscle groups. It does not require any special equipment, aside from a swimming pool or open body of water. Here are some reasons why swimming is the best answer: 1. Full-body workout: Swimming works various muscle groups within your body, including your arms, legs, back, and core muscles. This can help you achieve better overall fitness, as you are engaging multiple parts of your body while performing the exercise. 2. Cardiovascular fitness: Swimming is a cardio exercise, which means it can help to improve your heart health, endurance, and overall fitness levels. By consistently swimming as a form of exercise, you can reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke. 3. Low-impact exercise: Unlike jogging or other land-based exercises, swimming is gentle on your joints and muscles, making it an ideal option for those with joint issues or physical limitations. The buoyancy of the water helps to support your body weight, preventing excessive stress on your joints. 4. Weight loss: Swimming can help you burn a significant number of calories, depending on the intensity and duration of your swim. As an aerobic activity, swimming can also help you lose weight and maintain a healthy body weight when combined with a balanced diet. 5. Mental health benefits: Swimming can also provide mental health benefits, such as reducing stress and improving mood. Being immersed in water has a soothing effect on the body, and the repetitive nature of swimming can create a meditative state, allowing you to relax and find relief from any mental tension or stress. The other options listed - B. Jog, C. Exercise, D. Work out, and E. Rock climb - can also be effective in helping you get in shape. However, when there is no land nearby, these options may be less feasible or accessible, making swimming the best choice in such circumstances."},{"instruction":"Sentence: \\"This building got taller and wider than that one.\\" Pick from options: would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?

Between 255-246 BCE, the governor of Bactria, Sogdiana and Margiana (most of present-day Afghanistan), one Diodotus, took this process to its logical extreme and declared himself king. Diodotus II, son of Diodotus, was overthrown in about 230 BC by Euthydemus, possibly the satrap of Sogdiana, who then started his own dynasty. In c. 210 BC, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent Seleucid empire under Antiochus III. While victorious in the field, it seems Antiochus came to realise that there were advantages in the status quo (perhaps sensing that Bactria could not be governed from Syria), and married one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son, thus legitimising the Greco-Bactria dynasty. Soon afterwards the Greco-Bactrian kingdom seems to have expanded, possibly taking advantage of the defeat of the Parthian king Arsaces II by Antiochus.

David Cameron must increase the minimum wage because many poor voters no longer believe in capitalism, Tory MPs warn today. Echoing Ed Miliband’s critique of predatory capitalism, the Conservative group Renewal, which campaigns for the Tories to broaden their appeal with working class voters, today warns the Prime Minister that he must do more for the North or risk losing the next election. Robert Halfon, the MP for Harlow has already won the nickname ‘the most expensive MP in Parliament’ after persuading Chancellor George Osborne to freeze fuel duty to help voters who are feeling the squeeze. Today he calls for the National Minimum Wage, currently £6.31 an hour for the over 21s to be raised - a move being considered by the Low Pay Commission and the Chancellor. He said: ‘It was a big mistake for the Conservative Party to oppose the minimum wage. We must right that wrong by at least increasing it in line with inflation. We should not make the same mistake. ‘We must move on to ensure that everyone, in the north and the south, on low wages as well as high, can benefit from the proceeds of growth. If we say that the Conservative Party is on the side of hard working people then we have to really mean it.’ Renewal announced that they will now begin work on a project called ‘Renewing Capitalism’, to come up with ‘new ways to create a genuinely competitive economic environment in which the consumer and the low-paid are protected, competition is cherished and anti-competitive, monopolistic behaviour is cracked down on’. They will also explore ideas to create wealth in parts of the country that have been struggling to share in prosperity since the 1980s, notably deindustrialised towns in northern England. David Skelton, founder of the group, said: ‘The Conservative Party needs to come to terms with the fact that many people, particularly the low paid, don’t think that capitalism is working for them. ‘We need to do more to show that capitalism can work for everybody in every part of the country. Being pro market isn’t the same as being pro big business. 'Where there are instances of abuse - in either the public or the private sector - Conservatives should come down hard to protect the consumer.’ Chancellor George Osborne is now considering the move as the Conservatives court voters. That critique is a stark echo of Labour leader Ed Miliband’s view that Britain needs a ‘new kind of economy’. The Labour leader is due to make a speech later this week in which he will spell out more ideas about what aides say is his determination to temper the excesses of traditional Anglo-Saxon market economies and create a society more like that of Germany or Scandinavia where businesses and unions work more closely together. A Conservative spokesman said: ‘The government is helping hardworking families across Britain and offering them financial security by letting people earn £10,000 before they pay tax, cutting fuel duty and freezing council tax. ‘Ambitious projects like HS2 and the electrification of local rail services in the North - key elements of our long-term economic plan - are vital to Britain’s recovery.’ Highlights:","output":"- Tory group Renewal calls for an increase in the minimum wage as many poor voters no longer believe in capitalism. - Robert Halfon, MP for Harlow, urges National Minimum Wage to be raised in line with inflation to win over working-class voters. - Conservative group Renewal launches a project called \\"Renewing Capitalism\\", focusing on creating a competitive economic environment and protecting the consumers and the low-paid. - David Skelton, founder of Renewal, acknowledges that many people, particularly the low-paid, do not think capitalism is working for them and that more needs to be done to show its benefits for everyone. - Chancellor George Osborne is considering the minimum wage increase as the Conservatives aim to court voters."},{"instruction":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: When tea and coffee were first introduced to Europe in the 18th century, people had different ideas about their use.Some said that tea and coffee were harmful to humans and they could cause people to die.

Mr Swinney said a \\"fiscal framework\\" needed to link Scotland's budget to economic performance. But the prime minister has insisted \\"unprecedented devolution on taxes\\" was being sent to Holyrood. David Cameron made his comment during clashes with the SNP's Westminster leader Angus Robertson at PMQs in the House of Commons. In the Scottish Parliament, Mr Swinney said the Scottish government should be given \\"flexibility and choice to pursue its own distinct policies\\". Scotland's deputy first minister was speaking as he led a debate on Westminster's Scotland Bill. The bill is the legislation drawn up to deliver the recommendations of the Smith Commission, which was set up after the \\"No\\" vote in the independence referendum last September. The commission was intended to deliver the pledges made in the Vow, a last minute pledge by the three main Unionist parties exactly a year ago to give Scotland widespread new powers over tax and welfare. Mr Swinney told MSPs that the Smith Commission did not meet the promises of the Vow and the Scotland Bill did not at present fully implement the recommendations of the commission. He called for the UK government to \\"move significantly\\" when the Scotland Bill returns to Westminster for its Report Stage and outlined areas where the bill \\"fell short\\" such as social security, employment programmes and the Crown estate. The MSP also complained that the bill allowed UK ministers to veto proposed changes to Universal Credit and energy schemes. Mr Swinney said there must be a \\"fiscal framework\\" to ensure further devolution provides the right incentives, linking the Scottish government's budget to Scottish economic performance. He told the chamber: \\"We should retain the rewards of our success, as we will bear the risks. \\"When the Scottish economy outperforms that of the rest of the UK, our spending power should increase.\\" Mr Swinney added: \\"I want to make very clear again that the Scottish government will not recommend that this parliament gives consent to the bill without an agreed fiscal framework that is fair to Scotland. \\"I would have no hesitation to refuse to recommend a proposal that did not provide us with the ability to use our powers properly and flexibly to support the people of Scotland, to address our own priorities and to improve our economy.\\" Scottish Labour's democracy spokeswoman Claire Baker said her party wanted the devolution of the work programme, which seeks to get the long-term unemployed into work. She said the Scotland Bill needed to be stronger and did not meet her expectations. Ms Baker said her party would put forward amendments to the bill at Westminster and was committed to making sure the Scottish Parliament became one of the strongest devolved parliaments in the world. The debate followed clashes at prime minister's questions when Mr Robertson said the \\"Vow\\", made in the closing days of the independence referendum campaign last year, had not been delivered by the Tory government in Westminster. He added that even former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown said delivery was \\"falling short\\". Mr Cameron said: \\"We have delivered on all of the promises that we made. He said: \\"We said we would introduce a Scotland Bill, we introduced a Scotland Bill. \\"We said unprecedented devolution on taxes, there has been unprecedented devolution on taxes. \\"We said that we would provide those welfare powers, we have given those welfare powers.\\" Mr Cameron said the SNP should stop talking about processes and \\"start telling us what taxes you are going to put up, what welfare changes you are going to make\\". Summary:","output":"The finance secretary said it would not be good to make a deal that reduced Scotland's budget. They want a \\"fiscal framework\\" that connects Scotland's budget to how well their economy is doing. The prime minister says they are already giving a lot more power to Scotland. The debate is about the Scotland Bill, which would give Scotland more control over tax and welfare.

The word \\"hated\\" conveys a strong negative sentiment towards the movie. It indicates that the critic either did not enjoy the movie or found some aspects of it deeply disappointing or uncomfortable, which consequently led to negative self-reflection or self-dislike. A more elaborate interpretation would suggest that, by saying \\"hated myself,\\" the critic might have experienced either one or more of the following: 1. Regret or frustration for deciding to watch the movie, possibly due to time wasted or disappointment in the film’s content, plot, or execution. 2. Discomfort or emotional distress caused by the movie’s subject matter, which elicited a sense of self-loathing or even guilt in the critic. 3. Negative identification with the film or its characters, which contributed to the critic's unfavorable personal response to the movie. 4. Dissonance between the critic's personal values, beliefs, or tastes, and the movie's themes, messages, or stylistic choices, which resulted in a negative experience for the critic. Independently of the other potential reasons behind the critic's words, it is quite clear that their view of the movie is decidedly negative.

Born on March 23, 1921, in Kingston-Upon-Thames, Surrey, England, Donald Campbell was the son of Sir Malcolm Campbell, a prominent record setter in auto racing and water speed contests. Donald Campbell followed in his father's footsteps and dedicated his life to breaking and setting speed records on both land and water. His famous powerboat, the Bluebird K7, was instrumental in helping him achieve these records. The Bluebird K7 was a jet hydroplane, powered by a turbojet engine and specifically designed for breaking speed records on water. Coniston Water, a lake in the county of Cumbria, England, was the chosen location for Campbell's attempt to surpass the existing water speed record in September 1956. On September 19, 1956, Donald Campbell, piloting his Bluebird K7, achieved an average speed of 225.6 mph across the measured kilometer course, smashing the previous record and officially setting a new world water speed record. This accomplishment was not just a one-off event; Campbell continued to break records throughout his career. In fact, he broke the water speed record several times, with his best achievement being a speed of 276.33 mph (444.71 km/h) on December 31, 1964, at Lake Dumbleyung in Western Australia. His record-setting feats were not limited to water; Donald Campbell also pursued land speed records. On July 17, 1964, Campbell set a new land speed record of 403.10 mph (648.73 km/h) in his Bluebird CN7, making him the only person in history to hold both land and water speed records simultaneously. Unfortunately, Donald Campbell's record-breaking endeavors came to a tragic end on January 4, 1967. While attempting to set a new water speed record and exceed 300 mph (483 km/h) on Coniston Water, the Bluebird K7 flipped and crashed. Campbell lost his life in the accident. Despite the tragic end to his career, Donald Campbell's legacy lives on as an inspiration to all those who strive to push the limits of human achievement and continue the pursuit of speed records across land and water."},{"instruction":"Do clothing retail stores require their employees to wear that company's clothing at work? How do clothing store employees feel when a customer tries on a lot of clothes but leaves without buying anything? Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"1.

(March 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In late 1944, the remnants of a platoon of German Panzergrenadiers from the GroÃdeutschland Division are caught in an ambush by American troops. In their retreat, they find a German bunker manned by elderly Pvt. Mirus (John Carlisle) and young Pvt. Neumann (Andrew-Lee Potts) who had been left to defend the bunker under orders from Area Command to wait until relieved. Schenke confronts Heydrich about why the group didn't counter-attack the Americans, claiming that there couldn't have been that many of them. Mirus expands on the history of the area, revealing that victims of the Black Plague were massacred on the orders of a stranger, who influenced the townspeople to turn against one another. Low on ammunition, the men are haunted by bad dreams, memories and the feeling that something about the area just isn't right. As the night proceeds, strange tunnels are found beneath the bunker and the situation in the bunker becomes increasingly tense. Pvt. Schenke (Andrew Tiernan) wants to explore the tunnels but Lt. Krupp (Simon Kunz) orders against it. Later, Mirus sneaks down into the tunnels and a curious Pfc. Kruezmann (Eddie Marsan) follows him. When they are discovered to be missing, Lt. Krupp believes they've deserted and orders a pursuit. Interrogation of Neumann reveals that Mirus had been wandering off into the tunnels for several weeks and treats the tunnels as his property, as if something is down there that Mirus doesn't want him to know about. Cpl. Baumann (Jason Flemyng) discovers a set of plans for the complex while Cpl. Ebert (Jack Davenport) finds a danger sign. Exploring further, Ebert comes to a mine shaft where he hears movement and a pile of sand nearly falls on top of him. Terrified, he is suddenly stabbed from behind.

Here are possible answers to this question: - friend's house - bicycle - space shuttle - kitchen - disneyland I believe the correct choice is \\"space shuttle\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"The correct choice is indeed \\"space shuttle,\\" and there are several reasons why food on space shuttles is typically freeze-dried or dehydrated. 1. Weight and space constraints: Space shuttles have limited space and must also adhere to strict weight limitations. Therefore, it is essential to minimize the total mass of the spacecraft, including the food carried onboard. Freeze-drying and dehydration processes remove most of the water content from food, making it significantly lighter compared to its fresh or prepared counterparts. 2. Long shelf life: Space missions, especially those that venture beyond Earth's orbit, can span several months or even years. Food stored on these missions must have a long shelf life to remain edible throughout the mission's duration. Freeze-dried and dehydrated foods can last for years, eliminating the need for constant food resupplies and ensuring that astronauts always have access to nutritious meals. 3. Preservation of nutrients: Freeze-drying and dehydration processes help to preserve the food's nutritional content. Since astronauts require a balanced and nutritious diet to maintain their overall health during their time in space, it is crucial that their food retains its vitamins, minerals, and other essential nutrients. Freeze-dried and dehydrated foods can offer this nutritional stability without compromising on taste and quality. 4. Ease of preparation: In the microgravity environment of a space shuttle, preparing food can be a challenging task. Freeze-dried and dehydrated foods simplify this process, as they require only the addition of water to transform them back into a meal. This method of preparation is convenient, efficient, and minimizes the risk of spills, which can damage equipment and create a hazard in microgravity. 5. Reduced waste: Food waste management is a significant concern on space missions due to space and disposal constraints. The fact that freeze-dried and dehydrated foods are packaged in a compact, vacuum-sealed form helps to minimize waste production. Additionally, their lengthy shelf life ensures that most, if not all, of the food carried will be consumed, further reducing the potential for waste. In conclusion, the correct answer to the question is \\"space shuttle\\" because freeze-dried and dehydrated foods offer numerous advantages, including weight and space reduction, long shelf-life, preserved nutritional content, ease of preparation, and reduced waste. These benefits make such foods ideally suited for consumption on space missions, where physical, practical, and logistical challenges necessitate unique dietary solutions."},{"instruction":"A new scientific report claims that puberty begins as early as the age of 6.

Hypothesis: West of the III you can see what's left of Louis XIV's fortifications. Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Options: [+] yes; [+] it is not possible to tell; [+] no;","output":"Yes, the premise does entail the hypothesis. The premise states that the Barrage Vauban, which is part of the fortifications Vauban built for Louis XIV, spans the Ill to the west. The hypothesis claims that west of the Ill, one can see what's left of Louis XIV's fortifications. Since the Barrage Vauban is part of those fortifications and is located to the west of the Ill, the hypothesis is valid and supported by the premise. To further elaborate, the Barrage Vauban is a bridge, weir, and defensive work constructed on the River Ill in the city of Strasbourg, France. It was designed by the famous military engineer Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban, who played a significant role in shaping the military infrastructure of France under the reign of King Louis XIV. Vauban designed many fortifications, citadels, and other defensive structures to protect France from external threats. The Ill river, a 213-kilometer-long tributary of the Rhine River, flows through the city of Strasbourg, and it is in this context that the Barrage Vauban was built to serve several purposes. Firstly, as a weir, it allowed for the control and regulation of the water flow in the river, providing essential benefits for the city's water management. Secondly, as a bridge, it provided a vital crossing point for people and goods to move between the two sides of the river. And finally, as a defensive work, the structure contributed to the city's overall fortifications, adding an extra layer of protection against potential invaders. The hypothesis asserts that if one were to look to the west of the Ill, they would see remnants of the fortifications that Louis XIV had built, including the Barrage Vauban. As the Barrage Vauban is indeed located west of the Ill and is part of the king's fortifications, the hypothesis statement is accurate and directly linked to the initial premise. In conclusion, the premise does entail the hypothesis. West of the Ill, the Barrage Vauban stands as a significant part of the fortifications built under Louis XIV's reign. It serves as a testament to the elaborate and strategic military infrastructure designed by Vauban for the protection and advancement of the French kingdom during that time."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Article: Great white sharks! Just hearing that name _ . In reality, these big fish have more to fear from us than we do from them. For many years, people killed countless great white sharks in the waters around the United States. But thanks to conservation efforts, great whites are making a comeback in the U.S. Two recent studies show that the population of these sharks is rising along the east and west coast. Why is the growing population of a killer fish something to celebrate? \\"When you fish too many of them, you start to lose balance in the environment,\\" says shark researcher Tobey Curtis. As the biggest killer, sharks help keep the populations of fish, seals, and other creatures they eat from growing too large. In spite of their importance, great white sharks had long been hunted for their meat and their fins . Then, in 1997, the U.S. government passed a law that didn't allow the hunting of great whites. Afterwards, the numbers of these sharks in the U.S. waters started to increase. The law wasn't the only thing that has helped great whites. Conservationists have also played a part in the sharks' comeback. The research group OCEARCH is using a method called tagging to help change people's attitudes about great white. They let the public follow each shark as it travels the world's oceans. OCEARCH also gives each tagged shark a name to help people form a closer connection with the big fish. The group's most well-known shark is named Katharine. She was tagged last year near Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Since then, thousands of people have tracked Katharine's movements on Twitter and the OCEARCH website. This helps people see sharks in a new way. Chris Fischer, the founder of OCEARCH believes learning to appreciate great whites will encourage people to do more to protect them. Question: The main purpose of the passage is to _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"inform us that great whites are making a comeback\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer \\"inform us that great whites are making a comeback\\" is correct. The main purpose of the passage is to inform readers about the increasing population of great white sharks in the United States due to conservation efforts and legal protections, and to discuss the importance of these sharks to the balance of the ecosystem. The passage also highlights the role of OCEARCH in changing people's perceptions of sharks and fostering a connection to these creatures."},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to Turkish: Of the seven countries, Croatia is farthest along in the accession process.","output":"Step 1: Identify the main components of the sentence: - \\"Of the seven countries\\" -> \\"Yedi ülke içinde\\" - \\"Croatia\\" -> \\"Hırvatistan\\" - \\"is farthest along\\" -> \\"en ileride\\" - \\"in the accession process\\" -> \\"katılım sürecinde\\" Step 2: Rearrange the components in the correct order according to Turkish grammar: - \\"Yedi ülke içinde\\" -> stays at the beginning - \\"Hırvatistan\\" -> stays in the second position - \\"en ileride\\" -> stays in the third position - \\"katılım sürecinde\\" -> goes after \\"en ileride\\" Step 3: Combine the rearranged components to form the translated sentence: \\"Yedi ülke içinde Hırvatistan en ileride katılım sürecinde.\\" Justification: I identified the main components of the sentence and translated each component to Turkish.

Since Tom is retired, he often has plenty of time to go fishing, and he even has a small cabin by the lake. The two men are planning to spend several days at the cabin cooking, fishing, chopping firewood to make fires and just general outdoor activities. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Is Tom's chance of getting sick while at the cabin higher or lower than Mark's? Hint: Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. Many people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common. A:","output":"Given the information provided in the paragraph and the hint, it is likely that Tom's chance of getting sick while at the cabin is higher than Mark's. This is because Tom is in the old age group, being retired, and probably over 65 years old. At this stage in life, stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses decline, along with a reduction in the number of brain cells. Most importantly, the immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. While both Tom and Mark could be exposed to similar risks during their outdoor activities, Tom's age-related weakened immune system makes him more susceptible to illness compared to Mark, who has just graduated high school and is presumably much younger."},{"instruction":"exhibitors from over 100 overseas companies, have advanced world-class technologies and products in it and networking fields.

Bill wanted to pick up a stranger, preferably a responsible one with kids. Where might he look for one? Options: - bus station - paradise - train station - park - sea What is the step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the answer: park?","output":"To arrive at the answer, consider each option provided and evaluate them based on the given criteria: find a stranger who is responsible and has children. 1. Bus station: While it is possible to meet a stranger at a bus station, there is no specific indication that the people there are responsible or have children. Bus stations are usually crowded and chaotic, making it difficult to determine someone's personal life. Additionally, this location is often associated with transportation rather than family-related activities. 2. Paradise: This option is likely a figurative or abstract idea rather than a physical location. It does not offer any information about whether this location would attract responsible people with children. So, it is not an appropriate choice. 3. Train station: Similar to a bus station, a train station is a place where people gather for transportation purposes. While strangers can be found at a train station, there is no way to determine whether they are responsible or have children, as these locations cater to various demographics and purposes. 4. Park: A park is a public recreational area that is often associated with family activities. Parents with their children frequently visit parks to enjoy the outdoors, relax, and participate in activities like picnicking and playing sports. It is the most suitable option for meeting a stranger who is responsible and has children, as it is a place where families spend time together in a relaxed and secure environment. 5. Sea: The sea, as a vast body of water, is not a specific enough location to search for a stranger. It also does not provide any context for meeting people who are responsible and have kids, as it is not a social gathering point like a park or a community event. In conclusion, based on the provided options, the park is the most logical choice as it is a place where families gather for relaxation and leisure purposes. This environment increases the likelihood of finding a stranger who is responsible and has children."},{"instruction":"Write the next sentence.

This triggers the production of vitamin D, which occur next in the liver and then the kidneys. Once it is in your body, vitamin D helps promote calcium absorption, helps with the remodeling and growth of bones, is involved with making your immune system function properly, and helps with cell regulation and cell growth. Vitamin D also prevents softening of the bones, brittle bones, and rickets in children. So many people assume they are not deficient, but in fact many of us are deficient. There are groups of people who are particularly at risk for vitamin D deficiency, though it is something everyone should be aware of. People who are more at risk include: Elderly adults Infants Those with darker-toned skin Those with limited to no exposure to the sun Anyone with conditions that limit fat absorption, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) People with excess weight or who are obese Those who have undergone gastric bypass surgery There are some risks involved with both low and high levels of vitamin D. Low levels of vitamin D might increase the risk of pancreatic and colon cancer. Low levels are also associated with an increased risk of autoimmune diseases, pre-diabetes, Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and high blood pressure. Having too much vitamin D can also cause health issues. It can cause weight loss, anorexia, and a dangerously high heart rate. There are a number of medications, such as Cerebyx and Luminal, that can decrease your vitamin D levels. If you are taking these, ask your doctor if you need to take supplements to increase your levels. Some medications decrease the absorption of the vitamin D in your body, which include Questran, Xenical, and Colestid. Ask your doctor about possible interactions with these medications. As a general rule, make sure you wait at least two hours after you take these medicines to take your vitamin D supplements. Summary:","output":"Sunlight exposure triggers vitamin D production in the skin cells, which plays a crucial role in various bodily functions such as calcium absorption, bone remodeling and growth, immune system functionality, and cell growth regulation.

In Montreal, there have been large reductions in sulfur oxides produced by manufacturing plants after a recent referendum. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which area is more likely to have acid rain? Hint: One result of air pollution is acid rain. Acid rain is precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, Beijing is more likely to have acid rain compared to Montreal. This conclusion can be reached through the understanding of the factors contributing to acid rain formation and the recent developments in both cities. Acid rain is formed mainly due to the presence of sulfur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the atmosphere. When these chemicals combine with water, it creates a weak solution of sulfuric acid and nitric acid in the precipitations. Acid rain has an acidic pH and is extremely destructive to the environment, wildlife, and infrastructure. In Beijing, new coal-fired power plants have opened over the last few months. Coal-fired power plants are among the major sources of sulfur oxides (SOx), which are one of the primary precursors to acid rain. As a result, the increased number of coal-fired power plants in Beijing will lead to elevated levels of SOx, increasing the likelihood of acid rain formation in the area. On the other hand, Montreal has experienced significant reductions in sulfur oxides produced by manufacturing plants following a recent referendum. This reduction in SOx emissions suggests that the risk of acid rain in Montreal has decreased. Though nitrogen oxides (NOx), which are mainly released from motor vehicle exhaust, can also contribute to acid rain formation, the information provided does not indicate any recent significant increase in NOx levels in Montreal. Considering these factors, it can be concluded that Beijing, with its recent increase in coal-fired power plants and consequent release of sulfur oxides, is more likely to have acid rain compared to Montreal, where efforts have been made to reduce sulfur oxide emissions from manufacturing plants."},{"instruction":"Review: The video quality is awful.

We all have had the experience of reveling in the beauty and innocence of fairytales. May it be Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty... fairytale is a word which cannot be new to us. But have you ever traveled ages back to the earliest of times and uncovered the fascinating facts about these stories? Well, if not, then here are some mystical finds I discovered when I undertook this journey. A fairytale or fairy story is a fictional tale that usually features folkloric characters (such as fairies, talking animals). A fairytale often stars transformed princes, princesses, animals, as in \\"fairytale ending\\" where the humble but heroic princes defeat the wicked enemies or as in \\"fairytale romance\\" where after much ado the beautiful princesses marry their Prince Charming. One distinct feature of fairytales is that, they take place \\"once upon a time\\". The history of the fairytale is particularly difficult to trace. The oral tradition of the fairytale came long before the written page. The oldest known fairytales stem from ancient Egypt around 1,300 B.C and now, after traveling through various periods of time, they have grown and matured in various aspects and have become the most popular genre of stories for young children. The most famous authors of fairytales are the Grimm Brothers whose works include Cinderella, Rapunzel, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and many more; The Grimm Brothers collected their tales from farmers and edited them to suit their audience. But whatever may the form be, fairytales are after all fairytales! G. K. Chesterton said, \\"Fairytales do not tell children the dragons exist; they tell the dragons can be killed.\\" This quote has great weight. Every child believes in fairies, dragons, etc. They do not need fairytales to tell them that. Instead fairytales tell that good always succeed over evil. So fairytales are necessary for young minds. Fairytales are narrated to... Question: By saying \\"Fairytales do not tell children the dragons exist; they tell the dragons can be killed.\\", G. K. Chesterton meant _ . - the dragons are evil things - good always win over evil - every child believes the existence of the dragon - every child can know how to kill a dragon from the fairytale The answer to this question is:","output":"- good always win over evil"},{"instruction":"What happens next in this paragraph?

The current entrance in the north-east occupies the approximate location of the main gatehouse constructed by Gundulf and then rebuilt during 1249–1250. It was pulled down in the 1870s when the enclosure was converted into a municipal garden. An engraving from 1735 by the Buck brothers gives some indication of the gatehouse's form: the gate was an archway between two towers projecting from the curtain wall. It was reached by a stone causeway across a ditch, rather than a drawbridge. A tower containing a postern gate was located in the north-west corner of the enclosure, built at the close of the 14th century to guard the bridge over the Medway. The tower and postern no longer stands, but 19th-century antiquary and engineer G. T. Clark made some notes on the structure while it was still standing and commented that it had mechanisms to lift supplies for the castle from the river. The western part of the stone outer wall, a stretch facing the river, dates from when Gundulf built the first wall enclosing the castle. In the 19th century a revetment was added to strengthen the decaying wall. Like the keep, it was constructed using Kentish Ragstone. This part of Gundulf's wall was 4.5 feet (1.4 m) thick at the base, narrowing to 2 feet (0.61 m) at the top; it rose to a height of around 22 feet (6.7 m). Four embrasures were added to this part of the wall in the 13th century, although the builders imitated Norman design. At the northern end of the 12th-century stretch of western wall are the remains of a building, probably a hall, dating from the 13th century. Although no longer standing, it is known it had a vaulted undercroft.In the south Gundulf's wall survived into the modern period, although has now been dismantled. The current wall is a 19th-century replacement. At the eastern end of this wall, near the southern corner of the castle, is a two-storey rounded tower 30 feet (9.1 m) in diameter dating from the early 13th century. It was built to fill the breach in the curtain wall caused when John's army besieged...

Though clerics, they were inaccurately called \\"lay cardinals\\" and were permitted to marry. Teodolfo Mertel was among the last of the lay cardinals. When he died in 1899 he was the last surviving cardinal who was not at least ordained a priest. With the revision of the Code of Canon Law promulgated in 1917 by Pope Benedict XV, only those who are already priests or bishops may be appointed cardinals. Since the time of Pope John XXIII a priest who is appointed a cardinal must be consecrated a bishop, unless he obtains a dispensation.\\" Answer: Answer:","output":"According to Pope John XXIII, one cannot ascend to a cardinal position without first holding the office of a bishop. This requirement was established to ensure that those appointed as cardinals have the necessary ecclesiastical experience, knowledge, and authority to hold such a significant position within the Catholic Church. The context provided gives a historical background of cardinals appointed in various times. In the past, there were cases where individuals who had only received first tonsure and minor orders, but were not yet ordained as deacons or priests, were appointed as cardinals. These clerics were inaccurately referred to as \\"lay cardinals,\\" and they were even allowed to marry. Teodolfo Mertel, who died in 1899, was one of the last lay cardinals, marking the end of an era when cardinals were not necessarily ordained priests. The revision of the Code of Canon Law in 1917, promulgated by Pope Benedict XV, brought about a significant change in the criteria for appointing cardinals. The revised law stated that only those who are already priests or bishops may be appointed as cardinals. This notable shift in policy aimed to ensure that cardinals would have the appropriate clerical background and qualifications to effectively carry out their responsibilities within the Church. Continuing this progression, Pope John XXIII further refined the requirements for becoming a cardinal. He determined that a priest who is appointed a cardinal must be consecrated a bishop unless a dispensation, or exemption, is granted. This decree reinforces the importance of having an experienced and authoritative figure in the cardinal position, as bishops possess the highest order of the sacrament of Holy Orders and are entrusted with the administration of the sacraments and the governance of the Church. In conclusion, Pope John XXIII made it a requirement for a priest to be consecrated as a bishop first before ascending to a cardinal position, unless a dispensation is obtained. This rule highlights the importance of having experienced, knowledgeable, and authoritative individuals in the cardinalate to ensure that the complex duties and responsibilities of the position are effectively carried out. The historical progression, from having \\"lay cardinals\\" to requiring cardinals to be bishops, demonstrates the evolving nature of Catholic Church leadership and the criteria associated with its highest-ranking officials."},{"instruction":"Read this: Nearly all polychaetes have parapodia that function as limbs, while other major annelid groups lack them.

Part of the river below Leeds is canalised, and is known as the Aire and Calder Navigation. - The Aire and Calder Navigation is a river and canal system of the River Aire and the River Calder in the metropolitan county of West Yorkshire, England. The first improvements to the rivers above Knottingley were completed in 1704 when the Aire was made navigable to Leeds and the Calder to Wakefield, by the construction of 16 locks. Lock sizes were increased several times, as was the depth of water, to enable larger boats to use the system. The Aire below Haddlesey was bypassed by the opening of the Selby Canal in 1778. A canal from Knottingley to the new docks and new town at Goole provided a much shorter route to the River Ouse from 1826. The New Junction Canal was constructed in 1905, to link the system to the River Don Navigation, by then part of the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation. - The Cathedral and Metropolitical Church of Saint Peter in York, commonly known as York Minster, is the cathedral of York, England, and is one of the largest of its kind in Northern Europe.

The term is used to contrast with offices at state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government and also to supranational government which deals with governing institutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government. In federal states, local government generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions. - The Liverpool City Region is an economic and political area of England centred on Liverpool, which also incorporates the local authority districts of Halton, Knowsley, Sefton, St Helens, and Wirral.

Throughout these changes, Yorkshire has continued to be recognised as a geographical territory and cultural region. The name is familiar and well understood across the United Kingdom and is in common use in the media and the military, and also features in the titles of current areas of civil administration such as North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and East Riding of Yorkshire. - The West Riding of Yorkshire is one of the three historic subdivisions of Yorkshire, England. From 1889 to 1974 the administrative county, County of York, West Riding (abbreviated: \\"County of York (W.R.)\\") (the area under the control of West Riding County Council), was based closely on the historic boundaries. The lieutenancy at that time included the City of York and as such was named West Riding of the County of York and the County of the City of York. - A metropolitan borough is a type of local government district in England, and is a subdivision of a metropolitan county. Created in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972, metropolitan boroughs are defined in English law as metropolitan districts.

Metropolitan boroughs have been effectively unitary authority areas since the abolition of the metropolitan county councils by the Local Government Act 1985. However, metropolitan boroughs pool much of their authority in joint boards and other arrangements that cover whole metropolitan counties, such as combined authorities. - Elmet was an independent Brittonic kingdom covering a region of what later became the West Riding of Yorkshire in the Early Middle Ages, between about the 5th century and early 7th century. Although its precise borders are unclear, it appears to have been bounded by the River Sheaf in the south and the River Wharfe in the east. It adjoined Deira to the north and Mercia to the south, and its western boundary appears to have been near Craven, which was possibly a minor British kingdom. As such it was well to the east of other territories of the Britons in Wales and the West Country (\\"i.e.\\" Cornwall and Dumnonia), and to the south of those in the \\"Hen Ogledd\\" (\\"Old North\\"). As one of the southeasternmost Brittonic regions for which there is reasonably substantial evidence, it is notable for having survived relatively late in the period of Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain. - The Pennines , also known as the Pennine Chain or Pennine Hills, are a range of mountains and hills in Northern England separating North West England from Yorkshire and North East England. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - Municipal boroughs were a type of local government district which existed in England and Wales between 1835 and 1974, in Northern Ireland from 1840 to 1973 and in the Republic of Ireland from 1840 to 2002. Broadly similar structures existed in Scotland from 1833 to 1975 with the reform of royal burghs and creation of police burghs. - The Leeds and Liverpool Canal is a canal in Northern England, linking the cities of Leeds and Liverpool.

Although there is no agreement on how a city is distinguished from a town in general English language meanings, many cities have a particular administrative, legal, or historical status based on local law. - A non-metropolitan county, or colloquially, shire county, is a county-level entity in England that is not a metropolitan county. The counties typically have populations of 300,000 to 1.4 million. The term \\"shire county\\" is, however, an unofficial usage. Many of the non-metropolitan counties bear historic names and most end in the suffix \\"-shire\\" such as Wiltshire or Staffordshire. Of the remainder, some counties had the -shire ending and have lost it over time; such as Devon and Somerset. \\"Shire county\\" is, strictly, a dual-language tautology since the French-derived \\"county\\" means the same as the older Anglo-Saxon word \\"shire\\". - A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighbourhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement. - Yorkshire and the Humber is one of nine official regions of England at the first level of NUTS for statistical purposes. It comprises most of Yorkshire (South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, the East Riding of Yorkshire including Hull, the shire county of North Yorkshire and the City of York), North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire. It does not include Middlesbrough or Redcar and Cleveland (which are in the ceremonial county of North Yorkshire but not in the shire county). The population in 2011 was 5,284,000. - Malham is a village and civil parish in the Craven district of North Yorkshire, England. Before 20th century boundary changes, the village was part of the Settle Rural District, in the historic West Riding of Yorkshire. In the \\"Domesday Book\\", the name is given as Malgun, meaning \\"settlement by the gravelly places\\". In 2001 the parish had a population of approximately 150. Malham parish increased in size geographically (to include Malham Moor) and so at the 2011 Census had a population of 238. - An administrative county was an administrative division in England and Wales and Ireland from 1888 to 1974, used for the purposes of local government. They are now abolished, although in Northern Ireland their former areas are used as the basis for lieutenancy. - The metropolitan counties are a type of county-level administrative division of England. There are six metropolitan counties, which each cover large urban areas, typically with populations of 1.2 to 2.8 million. They were created in 1972 and are each divided into several metropolitan districts or boroughs. - Market town or market right is a legal term, originating in the Middle Ages, for a European settlement that has the right to host markets, distinguishing it from a village and city. A town may be correctly described as a \\"market town\\" or as having \\"market rights\\", even if it no longer holds a market, provided the legal right to do so still exists. - Bradford is in the Metropolitan Borough of the City of Bradford in West Yorkshire, England, in the foothills of the Pennines west of Leeds, and northwest of Wakefield. Bradford became a municipal borough in 1847, and received its charter as a city in 1897. Following local government reform in 1974, city status was bestowed upon the wider metropolitan borough. - Northern England, or North of England, also known as the North or the North Country, is the northern part of England and one the country's three principal cultural areas, along with the Midlands and Southern England. Geographically, the area roughly spans from the River Trent and River Dee to the Scottish border in the north. - Wharfedale is one of the Yorkshire Dales in England. It is the upper valley of the River Wharfe. Towns and villages in Wharfedale (downstream, from west to east) include Buckden, Kettlewell, Conistone, Grassington, Hebden, Bolton Abbey, Addingham, Ilkley, Burley-in-Wharfedale, Otley, Pool-in-Wharfedale, Arthington, Collingham and Wetherby. Beyond Wetherby, the valley opens out and becomes part of the Vale of York. - North Yorkshire is a non-metropolitan county (or shire county) and larger ceremonial county in England. It is located primarily in the region of Yorkshire and the Humber but partly in the region of North East England. - Skipton was a rural district in the West Riding of Yorkshire from 1894 to 1974. It was named after Skipton, which constituted an urban district on its southern border. - A County town is usually the location of administrative or judicial functions within the county, or it has been established over time as the \\"de facto\\" main town of a county. The concept of a county town eventually became detached from its original meaning of where the county administration or county hall is based. In fact, many county towns are no longer part of the administrative county. For example, Nottingham is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of Nottinghamshire. Many county towns are classified as cities, but all are referred to as county towns regardless of whether city status is held or not. - Canals and navigations are human-made channels for water conveyance (supply), or to service water transport vehicles. In the vernacular, both are referred to as 'canals', and in most cases, the engineered works will have a series of dams and locks that create areas of low speed current flow. These areas are referred to as\\" 'slack water levels',\\" often just called 'levels'. The main difference between them is that a navigation parallels a river and shares part of its waters, its drainage basin and leverages its resources by building dams and locks to increase and lengthen its long stretches of \\"deep enough\\" slack water levels while staying in its valley. In contrast, a canal cuts across a drainage divide atop a ridge (however humble), generally requiring an external water source above the highest elevation. Many canals have been built at elevations towering over valleys and others water ways crossing far below. Cities need a lot of fresh water and many canals with sources of water at a higher level can deliver water to a destination where there is a lack of water. The Roman Empire's Aqueducts were such water supply canals. - North East England is one of the nine regions of England that are classified at the first level of NUTS for statistical purposes. It covers Northumberland, County Durham, Tyne and Wear, and the Tees Valley. The region is home to three large conurbations: Teesside, Wearside, and Tyneside, the latter of which is the largest of the three and the eighth most populous conurbation in the United Kingdom. There are only three cities in the region; Newcastle upon Tyne is the largest city in the region with a population of just under 280,000, followed by Sunderland, both of which are located in the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear. The city of Durham is the county town of County Durham. Other large settlements in the region include Darlington; Gateshead; Hartlepool; Middlesbrough; South Shields; Stockton-on-Tees; Alnwick and Washington. - Airedale is a geographic area in Yorkshire, England, corresponding to the river valley of the River Aire (pronounced \\"air\\"). - Loidis, from which Leeds derives its name, was anciently a forested area of the Celtic kingdom of Elmet. The settlement certainly existed at the time of the Norman conquest of England and in 1086 was a thriving manor under the overlordship of Ilbert de Lacy. It gained its first charter from Maurice de Gant in 1207 yet grew but slowly throughout the medieval and Tudor periods. The town had become part of the Duchy of Lancaster and reverted to the crown in the medieval period, so was a Royalist stronghold at the start of the English Civil War. - The City of Bradford is a local government district of West Yorkshire, England, with the status of a city and metropolitan borough. It is named after its largest settlement, Bradford, but covers a far larger area which includes the towns of Keighley, Shipley, Bingley, Ilkley, Haworth, Silsden and Denholme. Bradford has a population of 528,155, making it the fourth-most populous metropolitan district and the sixth-most populous local authority district in England. It forms part of the West Yorkshire Urban Area conurbation which in 2001 had a population of 1.5 million and the city is part of the Leeds-Bradford Larger Urban Zone (LUZ), which, with a population of 2,393,300, is the fourth largest in the United Kingdom after London, Birmingham and Manchester. - In geography, a confluence is the meeting of two or more bodies of water. Also known as a \\"conflux\\", it refers either to the point where a tributary joins a larger river, (main stem), or where two streams meet to become the source of a river of a new name, such as the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania creating the Ohio River. - Ribblesdale is one of the Yorkshire Dales in England. It is the dale or upper valley of the River Ribble in North Yorkshire. Towns and villages in Ribblesdale (downstream, from north to south) include Selside, Horton-in-Ribblesdale, Stainforth, Langcliffe, Giggleswick, Settle, Long Preston and Hellifield. Below Hellifield (sometimes below Settle) the valley of the river is generally known as the Ribble Valley. 'skipton' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'shares border with'?

Answer the above question based on the context below: Presley's physical attractiveness and sexual appeal were widely acknowledged. \\"He was once beautiful, astonishingly beautiful\\", in the words of critic Mark Feeney. Television director Steve Binder, no fan of Presley's music before he oversaw the '68 Comeback Special, reported, \\"I'm straight as an arrow and I got to tell you, you stop, whether you're male or female, to look at him. He was that good looking. And if you never knew he was a superstar, it wouldn't make any difference; if he'd walked in the room, you'd know somebody special was in your presence.\\" His performance style, as much as his physical beauty, was responsible for Presley's eroticized image. Writing in 1970, critic George Melly described him as \\"the master of the sexual simile, treating his guitar as both phallus and girl\\". In his Presley obituary, Lester Bangs credited him as \\"the man who brought overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to the popular arts in America\\". Ed Sullivan's declaration that he perceived a soda bottle in Presley's trousers was echoed by rumors involving a similarly positioned toilet roll tube or lead bar.While Presley was marketed as an icon of heterosexuality, some cultural critics have argued that his image was ambiguous. In 1959, Sight and Sound's Peter John Dyer described his onscreen persona as \\"aggressively bisexual in appeal\\". Brett Farmer places the \\"orgasmic gyrations\\" of the title dance sequence in Jailhouse Rock within a lineage of cinematic musical numbers that offer a \\"spectacular eroticization, if not homoeroticization, of the male image\\". In the analysis of Yvonne Tasker, \\"Elvis was an ambivalent figure who articulated a peculiar feminised, objectifying version of white working-class masculinity as aggressive sexual display.\\"Reinforcing Presley's image as a sex symbol were the reports of his dalliances with various Hollywood stars and starlets, from Natalie Wood in the 1950s to Connie Stevens and Ann-Margret in the 1960s to Candice Bergen and Cybill Shepherd in the 1970s.

The \\"beans\\" are the basis of chocolate, as well as Mesoamerican foods, such as \\"mole\\" and \\"tejate\\". - Palm oil (also known as dendê oil, from Portuguese) is an edible vegetable oil derived from the mesocarp (reddish pulp) of the fruit of the oil palms, primarily the African oil palm \\"Elaeis guineensis\\", and to a lesser extent from the American oil palm \\"Elaeis oleifera\\" and the maripa palm \\"Attalea maripa\\". - The Aztec people were certain ethnic groups of central Mexico, particularly those groups who spoke the Nahuatl language and who dominated large parts of Mesoamerica from the 14th to 16th centuries. The Nahuatl words \\"aztecatl\\" (singular) and \\"aztecah\\" (plural) mean \\"people from Aztlan\\", a mythological place for the Nahuatl-speaking culture of the time, and later adopted as the word to define the Mexica people. Often the term \\"Aztec\\" refers exclusively to the Mexica people of Tenochtitlan (now the location of Mexico City), situated on an island in Lake Texcoco, who referred to themselves as \\"Mxihcah Tenochcah\\" or \\"Clhuah Mexihcah\\" . - Flavor (or flavour; see spelling differences) is the sensory impression of food or other substance, and is determined primarily by the chemical senses of taste and smell. The \\"trigeminal senses\\", which detect chemical irritants in the mouth and throat as well as temperature and texture, are also important to the overall Gestalt of flavor perception. The flavor of the food, as such, can be altered with natural or artificial flavorants which affect these senses. - Rancidification, the product of which can be described as rancidity, is the process which causes a substance to become rancid, that is, having a rank, unpleasant smell or taste. Specifically, it is the hydrolysis and/or autoxidation of fats into short-chain aldehydes and ketones which are objectionable in taste and odor. When these processes occur in food, undesirable odors and flavors can result. In some cases, however, the flavors can be desirable (as in aged cheeses). In processed meats, these flavors are collectively known as warmed-over flavor. Rancidification can also detract from the nutritional value of food, and some vitamins are highly sensitive to degradation. Akin to rancidification, oxidative degradation also occurs in other hydrocarbons, e.g. lubricating oils, fuels, and mechanical cutting fluids. - The palm kernel is the edible seed of the oil palm fruit. The fruit yields two distinct oils: palm oil derived from the outer parts of the fruit, and palm kernel oil derived from the kernel. - Chocolate is a typically sweet, usually brown food preparation of \\"Theobroma cacao\\" seeds, roasted and ground, and often flavored with vanilla. It is made in the form of a liquid, paste, or in a block, or used as a flavoring ingredient in other foods. Cacao has been cultivated by many cultures for at least three millennia in Mesoamerica. The earliest evidence of use traces to the Mokaya (Mexico and Guatemala), with evidence of chocolate beverages dating back to 1900 BCE. In fact, the majority of Mesoamerican people made chocolate beverages, including the Maya and Aztecs, who made it into a beverage known as \\"xocoltl\\" , a Nahuatl word meaning \\"bitter water\\". The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor. - A saturated fat is a type of fat in which the fatty acids all have single bonds. - Theobroma is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae, that is sometimes classified as a member of Sterculiaceae. It contains roughly 20 species of small understory trees native to the tropical forests of Central and South America. The generic name is derived from the Greek words (\\"theos\\"), meaning \\"god,\\" and (\\"broma\\"), meaning \\"food\\". It translates to \\"food of the gods.\\" - Mesoamerica was a region and cultural area in the Americas, extending approximately from central Mexico to Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and northern Costa Rica, within which pre-Columbian societies flourished before the Spanish colonization of the Americas in the 15th and 16th centuries. It is one of six areas in the world where ancient civilization arose independently, and the second in the Americas along with Norte Chico (Caral-Supe) in present-day northern coastal Peru. - Theobroma cacao is the taxonomic classification for the plant also called the cacao tree and the cocoa tree, which is a small (tall) evergreen tree in the family Malvaceae, native to the deep tropical regions of Central and South America. Its seeds, cocoa beans, are used to make cocoa mass, cocoa powder, confectionery, ganache and chocolate. - Copra is the dried meat, or dried kernel, of the coconut used to extract coconut oil. The earliest evidence of the extracting and use of coconut oil from copra is in early Tamil literature from the 1st century AD. The word originated from the Malayalam word \\"koppra\\". Coconut oil is extracted from it and this has made copra an important agricultural commodity for many coconut-producing countries. It also yields coconut cake, which is mainly used as feed for livestock. - Palm kernel oil is an edible plant oil derived from the kernel of the oil palm \\"Elaeis guineensis\\". It should not be confused with the other two edible oils derived from palm fruits: palm oil, extracted from the pulp of the oil palm fruit, and coconut oil, extracted from the kernel of the coconut. - Vanilla is a flavoring derived from orchids of the genus \\"Vanilla\\", primarily from the Mexican species, flat-leaved vanilla (\\"V. planifolia\\"). The word \\"vanilla\\", derived from the diminutive of the Spanish word (\\"vaina\\" itself meaning sheath or pod), is translated simply as \\"little pod\\". Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican people cultivated the vine of the vanilla orchid, called \\"tlilxochitl\\" by the Aztecs. Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés is credited with introducing both vanilla and chocolate to Europe in the 1520s. - The melting point (or, rarely, liquefaction point) of a solid is the temperature at which it changes state from solid to liquid at atmospheric pressure. At the melting point the solid and liquid phase exist in equilibrium. The melting point of a substance depends on pressure and is usually specified at standard pressure. When considered as the temperature of the reverse change from liquid to solid, it is referred to as the freezing point or crystallization point. Because of the ability of some substances to supercool, the freezing point is not considered as a characteristic property of a substance. When the \\"characteristic freezing point\\" of a substance is determined, in fact the actual methodology is almost always \\"the principle of observing the disappearance rather than the formation of ice\\", that is, the melting point. - Coconut oil, or copra oil, is an edible oil extracted from the kernel or meat of mature coconuts harvested from the coconut palm (\\"Cocos nucifera\\"). It has various applications. Because of its high saturated fat content, it is slow to oxidize and, thus, resistant to rancidification, lasting up to six months at without spoiling. - Guatemala (, or ), officially the Republic of Guatemala, is a country in Central America bordered by Mexico to the north and west, the Pacific Ocean to the southwest, Belize to the northeast, the Caribbean to the east, Honduras to the east and El Salvador to the southeast. With an estimated population of around 15.8 million, it is the most populated state in Central America. A representative democracy, Guatemala's capital and largest city is Nueva Guatemala de la Asunción, also known as Guatemala City. - The coconut tree (\\"Cocos nucifera\\") is a member of the family Arecaceae (palm family) and the only species of the genus \\"Cocos\\". The term coconut can refer to the whole coconut palm or the seed, or the fruit, which, botanically, is a drupe, not a nut. The spelling cocoanut is an archaic form of the word. The term is derived from the 16th-century Portuguese and Spanish word \\"coco\\" meaning \\"head\\" or \\"skull\\", from the three indentations on the coconut shell that resemble facial features. - Compound chocolate is a product made from a combination of cocoa , vegetable fat , and sweeteners . It is used as a lower - cost alternative to true chocolate , as it uses less - expensive hard vegetable fats such as coconut oil or palm kernel oil in place of the more expensive cocoa butter . It may also be known as ' compound coating ' or ' chocolatey coating ' when used as a coating for candy . Often used in lower - grade candy bars , compound chocolate is designed to simulate enrobed chocolate on a product . Cocoa butter must be tempered to maintain gloss and coating . A baker tempers chocolate by cooling the chocolate mass below its setting point , then rewarming the chocolate to between 31 and 32 ° C ( 88 and 90 ° F ) for milk chocolate , or between 32 and 33 ° C ( 90 and 91 ° F ) for semi-sweet chocolate . Compound coatings , however , do not need to be tempered . Instead , they are simply warmed to between 3 and 5 ° C ( 5.4 and 9.0 ° F ) above the coating 's melting point . - Cocoa butter, also called theobroma oil, is a pale-yellow, edible vegetable fat extracted from the cocoa bean. It is used to make chocolate, as well as some ointments, toiletries, and pharmaceuticals. Cocoa butter has a cocoa flavor and aroma. Its best-known attribute is its melting point, which is just below human body temperature. 'compound chocolate' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'has part'?

A solitary figure walks down the street holding an umbrella. We enter the Wax Museum with various tableaux of crimes of the past, and then enter the workshop where Prof. Henry Jarrod (Vincent Price) is working on a sculpture. His business partner, Matthew Burke (Roy Roberts) enters and walks partially upstairs when he is hailed by Jarrod. He tells Jarrod he's there to study the account books.

The monologue provides an overview of a universal human journey from birth to death, expressed as seven stages of life. The seven stages of life mentioned in the monologue are as follows: 1. Infant: The first stage begins at birth, where a person enters the world as an infant. Helpless and dependent on others, the infant is described as \\"mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.\\" At this stage, individuals require constant care and nurturing to ensure their survival and development, as they are unable to attend to their own needs. 2. Schoolboy: The second stage of life is characterized by the educational experiences of a school-going child; this phase forms the foundation of their intellect and understanding. In this stage, the individual is depicted as a reluctant learner who is \\"whining\\" and carries a satchel, going to school. Here, children expand their knowledge, make friends, and begin to comprehend societal norms. 3. Lover: The third stage represents the period of adolescence and early adulthood when individuals typically fall in love and experience the emotional rollercoaster of romantic relationships. Jaques uses the metaphor of a lover sighing like a furnace, composing ballads and verses for their beloved. The lover stage is marked by idealism, passion, and an intense focus on personal relationships. 4. Soldier: In the fourth stage of life, individuals enter adulthood and experience the responsibility and commitment to protect or defend. They strive for honor and recognition within society. Jaques describes the soldier as someone who is ready to make sacrifices and fight for their beliefs, illustrated by the phrase \\"seeking the bubble reputation, even in the cannon's mouth.\\" This stage is characterized by courage, ambition, and competitiveness. 5. Justice: The fifth stage symbolizes the phase of middle age wherein individuals hold positions of authority, responsibility, and wisdom in society. Jaques refers to this stage as the time when a person plays the role of a \\"justice,\\" demonstrating fairness and maturity in their decision-making. This stage may involve careers, parenting, or contributing to the community in various ways. 6. Pantaloon: As the individual enters the sixth stage, they transition into old age. The pantaloon is a character from Italian comedy, often portrayed as a foolish elderly individual. In this stage, individuals are depicted as weak, fragile and often ridiculous, with a \\"lean and slippered\\" shank. The effects of physical aging become more pronounced, with a loss of vitality, a weakened body, and faded strength. 7. Second Childhood/Childishness: The seventh and final stage of life represents the period of senescence, with child-like dependency re-emerging due to mental and physical deterioration. The monologue describes this stage as one where an individual becomes \\"sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.\\" It resonates the cyclic nature of human life as people return to a state of reliance upon others, just as they began their journey in infancy. Through Jaques' words in \\"As You Like It,\\" Shakespeare paints a vivid and thought-provoking picture of life's progression from infancy to old age. This portrayal of the seven stages of life continues to resonate with audiences today due to its timeless insights and enduring themes of human experience."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: On 15 September 1918 Lee Duncan, an American soldier, rescued a half-starved shepherd and her five puppies from a bombed dog's kennel on the battle fields ofprefix = st1 /France.Duncanchose two of the dogs, a male and female, while members of his group took the mother and the others back to camp. The only survivors over the next few months were the two pups Duncan had claimed, naming them 'Rin Tin Tin' and 'Nannette' after tiny French puppets the French children would give to the American soldiers for good luck. When the war ended, Duncan made special arrangements to take his pups back to his home in Los Angeles, but during the Atlantic crossing, Nannette became ill and died, shortly after arriving inAmerica. In 1922, Duncan and Rin Tin Tin attended an LA dog show, his dog performing for the crowd with an impressive high jump. After the show,Duncanreceived 350 for Rin's performance. That was the beginning of Rin Tin Tin's later involvement in many films and television series It happened that Warners had difficulty shooting an exterior scene with a wolf as they got into a low budget. Duncanquickly approached the director and told them that his dog could do the scene in one take. True to his word, Rin did the scene in one take. As a result, he and his dog were hired for the entire shoot of \\"Man From Hells River\\". The film was a hit and Rin Tin Tin became a box-office star. It was the first American dog movie star. It made 26 pictures for Warners while starring in his own live 1930s radio show \\"The Wonder Dog\\". At the peak of his popularity, Warners kept 18 trained stand-ins to reduce any stress on their dog star. The star dog was worthy of the honor of having its private _ to prepare daily lunches for him.

While the text does mention that a non-governmental project can organize space travel and obtain some level of success (reaching 400 feet into space), it doesn't allow for a direct comparison of the quality or capability between SpaceX and NASA. We would require more specific and detailed information to evaluate and compare them. Let's break down the reasoning: 1. Understand the statement: In this context, \\"as good as\\" implies a comparison in terms of quality or capabilities between SpaceX and NASA. 2. Analyze the given text: The text tells us that a privately-owned spacecraft was able to succeed in space travel, although it was only about 400 feet into space. However, it does not mention the company SpaceX or NASA specifically, nor does it give enough details that would allow us to make a comparative judgement of their quality or capabilities. 3. Determine the statement's truthfulness based on the text: As stated above, the text simply does not provide enough information to make a reliable judgement on the statement. So, in conclusion, there's insufficient information in the provided text to determine whether the statement \\"SpaceX is as good as NASA\\" is true or false."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: FINAL EXAM Question 1.

A. bike path B. schoolyard C. netherlands D. street E. university The best answer is Answer:","output":"E. University The best answer to the question, \\"Where can I ride my bicycle in order to take graduate classes?\\" is E. University. Riding your bicycle to a university that offers graduate classes would be the most appropriate and suitable choice. A university is an educational institution that typically offers both undergraduate and graduate programs, providing a wide range of courses and degree options. These institutions are specifically designed for higher education and research. Attending a university that offers graduate classes means you can obtain the advanced education you are looking for, easily bike to and from the university, and immerse yourself in the academic environment. While the other options presented might be feasible locations for bicycle riding, they do not necessarily provide the opportunity to attend graduate classes. A. Bike path - Bike paths are designated routes for bicycles, which can often be found in parks or alongside roads. While you may enjoy a scenic and safe route to ride your bicycle, you will not find graduate classes on a bike path. B. Schoolyard - A schoolyard typically refers to the grounds belonging to a school, often an elementary or primary school. While you may be able to ride your bicycle there, it's unlikely that you'll find graduate classes at this level of education. C. Netherlands - The Netherlands is a country in Northwestern Europe known for its picturesque landscapes and an extensive network of bicycle paths, making it an ideal location for cycling enthusiasts. However, simply riding your bicycle in the Netherlands does not guarantee access to graduate classes. You would need to specifically ride your bike to a university within the country that offers such classes for this option to be valid. D. Street - Streets are public roads within cities or towns that are navigable by vehicle, bicycle, or pedestrians. While you can ride your bicycle on the street, the street itself does not provide graduate classes. Therefore, the best answer is E. University. This choice ensures that you can both ride your bicycle to a destination with a plethora of degree options while obtaining the graduate education you desire."},{"instruction":"I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Out of fear, Oskar never fights back. In the evenings, however, he sits in the courtyard rehearsing knife attacks on his tormentors. One evening, Oskar notices a new girl about his age and her father moving into into #15, the apartment next door to his. Oddly, the first thing they do is to cover the windows with cardboard. What Oskar doesn't know is that Håkan(Per Ragnar) is not Eli (Lina Leandersson)'s father... he is her renfield... and Eli is a vampire. It is Håkan's job to bring Eli fresh blood, which he gets by killing other humans. First he anesthetizes them with halothane, then he strings them up by the feet, slits their necks, and catches the blood in a jug, leaving the bodies to be discovered the next day. Unfortunately for Eli, Håkan is having problems securing blood for her. On his first kill after moving into the new apartment, he either lost or forgot the jug filled with blood. Consequently, Eli is beginning to get hungry.One evening, as Oskar is in the courtyard stabbing a tree in lieu of his tormentors, he notices Eli watching him. She's not very friendly, as she tells him right off that she can't be friends with him. The next evening, they run into each other again in the courtyard. Oskar notices that Eli is not wearing a coat even though it's the dead of winter in Stockholm. What's more, she's not even cold. And she smells bad. Still, Oskar shares with her his Rubik's cube and shows her how to work it. After Oskar has gone inside, Eli goes hunting. She waits in the shadows under a bridge.

Ordinary plates have white text on black background . Ordinary plates have black text on white background .","output":"No, the two sentences do not have the same meaning because they describe opposite color schemes for the text and background of ordinary plates. The first sentence indicates that \\"Ordinary plates have white text on black background.\\" This suggests that the plates usually have a black base or material color (the background), and the text, letters, or design elements on them are colored white. It essentially describes a situation where the lettering is lighter than the plate color itself, creating a contrast through which the text can be more easily read or noticed. On the other hand, the second sentence states that \\"Ordinary plates have black text on white background.\\" It implies that the ordinary plates in discussion typically have a white base color or material (the background), and the text, symbols or design elements are colored black. This is the opposite situation, where the letters or symbols are darker than the plate color, again to create contrast and improve readability. This difference in description might stem from varying cultural, manufacturing, or design preferences. For instance, in license plate design, some regions use white text on a black background, while others use the opposite – black text on a white background. The choice can depend on a variety of factors like visibility, aesthetic preferences, regional or national laws, and existing color-coding systems. Therefore, while they both describe color schemes for text and background on 'ordinary plates' (the subject of the sentences), the actual descriptions are not identical because they denote different color combinations. It's important to note these distinctions as they can impact both function and visual effect."},{"instruction":"Review: *Contains spoilers due to me having to describe some film techniques, so read at your own risk!* I loved this film. The use of tinting in some of the scenes makes it seem like an old photograph come to life. I also enjoyed the projection of people on a back screen. For instance, in one scene, Leopold calls his wife and she is projected behind him rather than in a typical split screen. Her face is huge in the back and Leo's is in the foreground. One of the best uses of this is when the young boys kill the Ravensteins on the train, a scene shot in an almost political poster style, with facial close ups. It reminded me of Battleship Potemkin, that intense constant style coupled with the spray of red to convey tons of horror without much gore. Same with the scene when Katharina finds her father dead in the bathtub...you can only see the red water on the side. It is one of the things I love about Von Trier, his understatement of horror, which ends up making it all the more creepy. The use of text in the film was unique, like when Leo's character is pushed by the word, \\"Werewolf.\\" I have never seen anything like that in a film. The use of black comedy in this film was well done. Ernst-Hugo Järegård is great as Leo's uncle. It brings up the snickers I got from his role in the Kingdom (Riget.) This humor makes the plotline of absurd anal retentiveness of train conductors against the terrible backdrop of WW2 and all the chaos, easier to take. It reminds me of Riget in the way the hospital administrator is trying to maintain a normalcy at the end of part one when everything is going crazy. It shows that some people are truly oblivious to the awful things happening around them. Yet some people, like Leo, are tuned in, but do nothing positive about it. The voice over, done expertly well by Max von Sydow, is amusing too. It draws you into the story and makes you jump into Leo's head, which at times is a scary place to be. The movie brings up the point that one is a coward if they don't choose a side. I see the same idea used in Dancer in the Dark, where Bjork's character doesn't speak up for herself and ends up being her own destruction. Actually, at one time, Von Trier seemed anti-woman to me, by making Breaking the Waves and Dancer, but now I know his male characters don't fare well either! I found myself at the same place during the end of Dancer, when you seriously want the main character to rethink their actions, but of course, they never do! Now, what is this review like?

Vice Minister of Health Gao Qiang told reporters in Beijing that the \\"public health care system in China is insufficient.\\" The Vice Minister of Health also suggested that the government would pick up the costs of care to earthquake victims, many of whom have little or no insurance: \\"The government should be responsible for providing medical treatment to them,\\" he said.\\" Answer: Answer:","output":"The widening gap between prosperous urban dwellers and struggling rural people in China can be exemplified by the disparity in access to quality health care experienced by those living in the earthquake-affected area in Sichuan province. This region, which has been largely neglected and untouched by China's rapid economic development, exemplifies the stark contrast between the affluent and well-developed urban areas and the impoverished, undeveloped rural regions. One of the primary reasons behind this disparity is the vast difference in the allocation of resources and infrastructure development. While urban areas have seen significant investments in health care facilities, cutting-edge medical technology, and well-trained health care professionals, rural areas such as Sichuan have been left behind, with limited access to even basic health care services. In many cases, people in rural regions have no other option but to travel long distances to seek medical care in urban centers, which is not only an impediment to regular health check-ups and preventive care but also a financial burden. This lack of access to essential health care services in rural areas is further exacerbated by China's uneven distribution of wealth and income. The income gap between prosperous urban dwellers and struggling rural people has widened over the years, creating a scenario where those residing in rural regions are disproportionately affected by the disparities in health care services. This socioeconomic disparity makes it challenging for rural people to afford even basic medical expenses, such as doctor visits and medications, let alone cover the costs of critical medical treatments and procedures. Furthermore, the lack of insurance coverage for many rural residents adds to their vulnerability in the face of health emergencies. As Vice Minister of Health Gao Qiang mentioned, many earthquake victims had little to no insurance available to help them cover the costs of medical treatment. This highlights the inadequacy of China's current public health care system, which often leaves rural populations without adequate safety nets in times of need. In conclusion, the example of poor health care infrastructure and limited access to essential medical services in the earthquake-hit Sichuan region highlights the widening gap between prosperous urban dwellers and struggling rural people in China. It demonstrates the urgent need for policymakers and the Chinese government to address these disparities and invest in the development of a comprehensive and equitable health care system that caters to the needs of all citizens, regardless of their geographic location or socioeconomic status. By doing so, the government can work towards ensuring better health outcomes and improved overall wellbeing for its people, thereby closing the gap between the urban rich and the rural poor."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Acrocercops albofasciella - Acrocercops albofasciella is a moth of the Gracillariidae family.

Guantanamo is where people who have done bad things are kept far away from others, so they can't hurt them anymore. But, sometimes, these people weren't being treated fairly. They didn't get proper chances to tell their side of the story to anyone. So, they couldn't prove if they were innocent or if they didn't deserve to be treated so badly. One day, a wise judge came along and decided that the policy in Guantanamo wasn't good. The judge gave a big legal blow, like a superhero, to the policy and made it weak. This was important because it was a step towards making sure that everyone in Guantanamo was treated fairly and had an equal chance to speak up.

Today, we are going to talk about a situation that happened in a place called Belfast. Belfast is a city found in a country called Northern Ireland. Something not nice happened there recently, and I am going to tell you about it in a simple way, so it's easy to understand. In Belfast, there was a playground where kids like you go to have fun and play with their friends. But sadly, two people did something really bad. They used a gun called a shotgun and fired it at the playground. This is very dangerous and not allowed because it can hurt the children playing there. The good news is that there are people called police officers who are here to protect us from such harmful actions. When the police found out about what these two people did, they took action and caught them. The bad people were then taken to a place called court. A court is a place where a group of grown-ups called judges and lawyers try to figure out if someone did something bad or not. They also decide what should be done to those who break the rules or do harmful things. So, in this case, the two people who fired the shotgun at the playground were taken to court. They had to explain their actions. The lawyers and judges needed to decide if the two people who did this wrong thing should be punished. Punishing them could mean that they have to say sorry, pay some money, or even spend some time away from their families in a place called jail. It's important to remember that we should always try to be good and kind to others. Doing dangerous things or trying to hurt someone is not okay, and that's why there are rules and places like courts to stop people from doing bad things. Remember, kids, always be thoughtful and kind toward others, and never use dangerous things like guns.

Last week, it was Trump's firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and an apparent Democratic victory in a special congressional election in Pennsylvania — a sign of a possible wave in the November midterm elections. This week, it was a series of presidential tweets criticizing the Russia probe, followed by a controversial Trump statement of congratulations for newly re-elected Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump also added former U.S. attorney Joseph diGenova to his legal team. DiGenova has alleged that elements of the FBI and the Department of Justice have been out to frame Trump in connection with the Russia probe. Trump ignored shouted questions Tuesday from reporters at the White House who asked whether he wanted to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the Russia probe. Earlier, House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, told reporters at the Capitol that he had received \\"assurances\\" that firing Mueller was \\"not even under consideration.\\" The latest back and forth over the Mueller investigation came after several days of presidential tweets complaining about the probe, including one blasting it as a \\"total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest.\\" The tweets sparked new fears that Trump might try to have Mueller fired. Some Republicans warned that an attempt to fire Mueller could put Trump's presidency in jeopardy. \\"I think anything directed at firing Mr. Mueller blows up the whole town, and that becomes the end of governing and the presidency as we know it,\\" cautioned Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. The renewed focus on the Russia probe came in the wake of last week's firing of Tillerson. That, in turn, raised the prospect of more administration changes. What can put the presidency at risk? - administration changes - firing Mueller - presidential tweets - not enough information Answer:","output":"The presidency can be at risk due to several factors mentioned in the given context: 1. Administration changes: Frequent changes in the administration can create instability, leading to a lack of continuity and loss of confidence in the president's decision-making capabilities. In the given example, Trump's firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the potential for more administration changes raised concerns. 2. Firing Mueller: Any attempt to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the Russia probe, could put Trump's presidency in jeopardy. As Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina cautioned, such a move could \\"blow up the whole town\\" and lead to the end of governing and the presidency as we know it. 3. Presidential tweets: President Trump's tweets, especially those criticizing the Russia probe and labeling it a \\"total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest,\\" sparked fears that he might try to have Mueller fired. These tweets can create controversies and add to the turmoil surrounding the presidency. While not explicitly mentioned, other factors can put the presidency at risk as well, such as loss of public support, impeachment proceedings, and critical international or domestic events."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Lee taught science for years and had a natural aptitude for the subject. Given the context: How would Lee feel afterwards? OPT: (a). like a smart person. (b). like a stupid person. (c). naturally curious. Answer:","output":"Based on the context provided, it is clear that Lee has a strong background and passion for science, as evidenced by their years of teaching experience and their natural aptitude for the subject. It is reasonable to infer that Lee would feel a sense of accomplishment, pride, and satisfaction from their work. Given this, the most likely answer to the question of how Lee would feel afterwards is: (a) Like a smart person. The reasoning behind this choice is as follows: - Lee's years of experience teaching science and their natural aptitude for the subject suggest that they have a deep understanding of the material and a high level of expertise. This would likely lead them to feel confident in their knowledge, and therefore, smart. - Teaching is generally seen as a rewarding and fulfilling profession, allowing individuals to make a difference in the lives of their students and help shape the future generation. As a result, Lee would likely develop a positive self-image for their contribution to their students' learning and, by extension, feel smart for their role in educating others on a subject they're passionate about. However, it is important to note that the context provided does not entirely exclude the other options: (b) Like a stupid person: This response may apply if Lee encountered some challenges during their years of teaching, or if they compare themselves to other teachers or scientists who may know more about a particular topic. It's possible that self-doubt could lead Lee to underestimate their abilities or feel inadequate in some way. Regardless, this option is less likely given the context provided. (c) Naturally curious: This option is plausible, as many people who are passionate about a subject like science tend to have a deep sense of curiosity, always seeking to learn and discover new things. This could be an innate part of Lee's personality, which may have led them to pursue a career in science education in the first place. While it is certainly possible that Lee feels naturally curious, this option does not directly address the question of how they would feel about their teaching experience and expertise in the subject. Therefore, option (a) remains the most fitting choice based on the given context."},{"instruction":"ABS will buy the society of Norwegian engineering Safetec Nordic Say this using Spanish.","output":"First, I need to translate the sentence \\"ABS will buy the society of Norwegian engineering Safetec Nordic\\" into Spanish.

FilmNation Entertainment acquired the rights to the 2015 Bill Condon-directed film based on what 2005 novel? Answer:","output":"FilmNation Entertainment acquired the rights to the 2015 Bill Condon-directed film \\"Mr. Holmes,\\" which is based on the 2005 novel \\"A Slight Trick of the Mind\\" by Mitch Cullin. The story revolves around an aged Sherlock Holmes who grapples with the decline of his mental faculties and memory while attempting to solve a final, unsolved case that has haunted him for years. \\"A Slight Trick of the Mind\\" is a unique take on the iconic detective, exploring themes of aging, memory, and the nature of relationships. The novel employs a non-linear narrative that switches between three time periods: the late 1940s, where Sherlock Holmes is in his nineties and retired in Sussex; the early 1900s, when he solves the case of a woman who has amnesia; and a trip to Japan in 1947, where Holmes is exposed to the devastation caused by the atomic bombings. In the 2015 adaptation \\"Mr. Holmes,\\" Sir Ian McKellen portrays the legendary detective in his later years. The film focuses on Holmes' struggle with the deterioration of his once impeccable memory and the desperation to complete his final case before time runs out. The story is a touching and poignant portrayal of a character that has been immortalized in popular culture, and it delves into the more human and vulnerable aspects of the famous sleuth. The decision by FilmNation Entertainment to acquire the rights to \\"A Slight Trick of the Mind\\" and adapt it into \\"Mr. Holmes\\" demonstrates a continued interest in Sherlock Holmes stories and a willingness to explore new and innovative adaptations of classic literature.

The reviewer does acknowledge the strengths of the book, such as being well-written, providing extensive research, and being informative on the topic of stress. However, the primary focus of the review is on the disappointment and dissatisfaction with the book's lack of practical strategies to overcome stress-related disorders. The reviewer expected a significant portion of the book to be dedicated to those strategies, but it fell short of meeting those expectations. The dissatisfaction is further accentuated by the reviewer's mention of their therapist recommending the book and their subsequent strong negative reaction (\\"I could have strangled him!\\").

Other options are incorrect because: - \\"CNN\\" focuses on the news network rather than the city or people affected. - \\"King\\" refers to Rodney King himself, but the sentence should refer to a larger group. - \\"Oh my God\\" is not a relevant choice as it's a quote from King and doesn't represent a group or location. - \\"Race and Rage\\" is not fitting as it does not refer to a specific location or group of people. - \\"Rodney King\\" is again referring to the individual, not the larger affected population. - \\"United States\\" is too broad; while the entire country was affected by this event, the immediate impact was primarily on Los Angeles and its police department."},{"instruction":"Let's think step by step!

Options: - (A) the blood cells - (B) the heart - (C) Energy. - (D) the main element - (E) heat energy - (F) light energy - (G) the nucleus - (H) sensory neurons The thinking starts now:","output":"Step 1: Understand the question. The question is asking which option breaks up into two lighter elements when an animal divides into two parts. Step 2: Identify the process of an animal dividing into two parts. The process of an animal dividing into two parts is called cell division, and more specifically, in this context, we are talking about mitosis. Step 3: Analyze the options. Now let's go through each option to see which one fits the context of mitosis. - (A) the blood cells: Blood cells are not involved in the process of cell division that results in two lighter elements. - (B) the heart: The heart is an organ, and the process refers to cell division, so it's not the correct answer. - (C) Energy: While energy plays a role in the process of cell division, it doesn't break up into two lighter elements. - (D) the main element: This term is not specific enough to be related to the process of cell division. - (E) heat energy: Heat energy is not involved in the process of cell division that results in two lighter elements. - (F) light energy: Light energy is not involved in the process of cell division that results in two lighter elements. - (G) the nucleus: The nucleus does divide during mitosis, with its genetic material separating into two identical sets, which form two daughter nuclei. - (H) sensory neurons: Sensory neurons are a type of cell but are not specifically involved in the process of cell division that results in two lighter elements. Step 4: Determine the correct answer. Based on the analysis, the correct answer is (G) the nucleus, as it is the structure within the cell that divides during the process of mitosis into two lighter elements."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"Beside David and Goliath, Daniel in the lions' den, and the building of Noah's ark, one curious sculpture shows Saint Eugenia, tonsured and disguised as a monk, opening her robe to convince a skeptical friar that she's a woman.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"The statue of Saint Eugenia is the most popular.\\"?","output":"Step 1: Analyze the premise The premise given provides information about various sculptures, such as David and Goliath, Daniel in the lions' den, the building of Noah's ark, and Saint Eugenia.

Judges voted 5-3 to halt a lower court's order that Gavin Grimm, 17, be allowed to use the boys' bathroom. They will consider the case again in the autumn. Mr Grimm who was born female, filed the lawsuit after his school board in Virginia adopted a policy that required students to use a private toilet or one that corresponds to the sex listed on their birth certificate. An appeals court ruled earlier this year that the ban was discriminatory and violated Title IX, a federal law which prohibits gender discrimination at schools that receive federal funding. The issue has gone back and forth between several different courts which have made opposing decisions. As the Supreme Court is yet to rule definitively on the matter, it has set things back to the way they used to be, ahead of its eight justices beginning to hear the case in autumn 2016. Mr Grimm appealed to the court not to discuss the matter, local media report, but its actions are exactly what the school board asked for. A number of places in the US - most recently North Carolina - have passed laws requiring transgender people to use a public toilet that corresponds to the sex listed on their birth certificate. The North Carolina law in particular has been sharply criticised as discriminatory and several companies have stopped doing business in the state as a result. Some people have said that allowing transgender people to choose their restroom could lead to women and children being attacked. They said they feared that predatory men could pose as transgender people and use legal protections as a cover. What is a summary of this text?","output":"The US Supreme Court is to reconsider the case of Gavin Grimm, a 17-year-old transgender male, who was banned from using the boys' bathroom at his school in Virginia. The school board had adopted a policy that elicited disagreements among various courts, ruling that students must use a bathroom corresponding to their birth certificate sex or a private one. Currently, the highest court has set things back to the initial way before a definite ruling. Meanwhile, some states have made it a law for transgender individuals to use the bathroom corresponding to their birth certificate sex, with North Carolina being criticized for their law, causing some companies to cease business operations within the state. Critics argue that allowing bathroom choice could pave the way for potential attacks by predatory individuals pretending to be transgender."},{"instruction":"How is \\"Firstly for the economic stakes it induces.

Is Emirates the best airline? Why? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"Task: To find out why Emirates airlines is not a member of any leading alliances and determine if it is the best airline or not. Also, to check if the questions are the same. Step 1: Research the reasons behind Emirates airlines not joining any leading airline alliances. Justification: This will help understand their rationale for staying independent, which could be related to their business strategies, growth plans, or other reasons they've stated. Step 2: Compare Emirates with other airlines on various parameters such as services, operational efficiency, awards, and customer satisfaction. Justification: Making a comparative analysis will provide a better perspective on the overall performance of Emirates against its competitors, helping to determine if it is the best in the industry. Step 3: Analyze if the factors that make Emirates the best (or not) are related to their decision to avoid joining any alliances. Justification: This will help to draw a correlation between their strategy for staying independent and their overall performance in the industry. Step 4: Assess if the questions are the same. Justification: This will answer the user's inquiry on whether both questions are essentially the same or not. My findings: Emirates has chosen to stay out of major airline alliances mainly due to their strategy focused on organic growth, control over their brand and customer experience, and maintaining flexibility in decision-making. They have built a strong brand identity and don't wish to dilute it by joining an alliance. Instead, they have entered into codeshare agreements with individual airlines on a case-by-case basis. As for whether Emirates is the best airline, it certainly ranks high on various parameters. They are known for excellent customer service, luxurious inflight experience, and they have won several awards in the past as well. However, the term \\"best\\" can be subjective, as it depends on what aspects are most important to a person. The questions \\"Why is Emirates not a member of any leading alliances\\" and \\"Is Emirates the best airline\\" are two distinct inquiries. The first question addresses their membership in airline alliances, while the second one aims to determine their standing in the industry based on performance. However, the answer to the second question could provide insights into their strategy for not being a part of any alliances, but the questions themselves are not the same."},{"instruction":"French Open champion Anastasia Myskina of Russia must face an early exit in the Wismilak International Tennis Tournament in Bali after losing to Maria Elena Camerin of What best summarizes the content of the above article?

On the one hand were the decimation of the population by the Black Death of 1348 and subsequent years of epidemics — and on the other, the series of wars and riots that followed. Among these were the War of the Union, a citizen revolt against the excesses of the monarchy, led by Valencia as the capital of the kingdom — and the war with Castile, which forced the hurried raising of a new wall to resist Castilian attacks in 1363 and 1364. In these years the coexistence of the three communities that occupied the city—Christian, Jewish and Muslim — was quite contentious. The Jews who occupied the area around the waterfront had progressed economically and socially, and their quarter gradually expanded its boundaries at the expense of neighbouring parishes. Meanwhile, Muslims who remained in the city after the conquest were entrenched in a Moorish neighbourhood next to the present-day market Mosen Sorel. In 1391 an uncontrolled mob attacked the Jewish quarter, causing its virtual disappearance and leading to the forced conversion of its surviving members to Christianity. The Muslim quarter was attacked during a similar tumult among the populace in 1456, but the consequences were minor. Now answer this question: When did Valencia suffer from the Black Death?","output":"Valencia suffered from the Black Death in 1348."},{"instruction":"Plants on hills keep dirt in place during a rain storm. Plant roots grow into the dirt and keep the dirt from moving. Why do roots grow into the dirt? Pick the answer from these options Choices: + to release gases; + to release water; + to absorb energy; + to absorb nutrients;","output":"Root systems are a critical aspect of a plant's anatomical structure. They serve a multitude of functions that are all geared towards the survival and growth of the plant. The primary reason roots grow into the dirt, or more accurately the soil, is to absorb nutrients. So the correct answer from the given choices is: \\"to absorb nutrients\\". To elaborate a bit further, roots not only absorb nutrients from the soil but also play key roles in a plant's ability to intake water. The network of root hairs has the function of penetrating the soil structure and extending the root's collective reach. As the roots grow deeper and wider into the soil, they encounter various minerals and water molecules. Intercellular structures within the root system facilitate the uptake of these water molecules and dissolved nutrients, which are essential for sustaining the plant's metabolic processes. The nutrients absorbed by the roots include nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and trace elements like zinc, copper, iron, and magnesium among others. These play critical roles in different biochemical processes like photosynthesis, respiration, and cellular division, which contribute to the plant's growth, development, and overall health. In addition, roots also have the function of anchoring the plant in place, providing physical support and holding it upright. This is especially crucial on hills and slopes where the risk of soil erosion is high. Here the roots not only help the plant itself but also mitigate erosion by binding the soil together, thereby preventing it from being carried away during a rainstorm. To summarize, the primary and most direct answer to why roots grow into the dirt is to absorb nutrients, which are essential for the plant's survival and growth. However, it should also be noted that they serve other important functions as well, including water absorption, providing physical support, and helping prevent soil erosion."},{"instruction":"Article: Handball is a hugely popular sport in Europe and Asia, and it is one of the fastest and most exciting sports in the world.It combines basketball and soccer with the attracting saves of water polo.

Context: Surely the best thing about colomba, the Easter equivalent to panettone, is the sugared, toasted almond topping that covers the whole thing and crumbles when you cut it, so you sort of have no choice but just to pick up the crusty sugary bits and eat those on their own. I’d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape — it’s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination — and texture — wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness. But when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker. Field recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations.

It is a sensationalistic interpretation of the beatnik culture of the \\"Beat Generation\\" (and is sometimes considered one of the very last films noir to be produced.) The movie was also shown under the title \\"This Rebel Age\\". - In theatre, a monologue (from , from \\"mónos\\", \\"alone, solitary\\" and \\"lógos\\", \\"speech\\") is a speech presented by a single character, most often to express their mental thoughts aloud, though sometimes also to directly address another character or the audience. Monologues are common across the range of dramatic media (plays, films, etc.), as well as in non-dramatic media such as poetry. Monologues share much in common with several other literary devices including soliloquies, apostrophes, and aside. There are, however, distinctions between each of these devices. - Prose is a form of language that exhibits a grammatical structure and a natural flow of speech, rather than a rhythmic structure as in traditional poetry. Where the common unit of verse is based on meter or rhyme, the common unit of prose is purely grammatical, such as a sentence or paragraph. - Spoken word is an oral art that focuses on the aesthetics of word play and intonation and voice inflection. It is a 'catchall' that includes any kind of poetry recited aloud, including hip-hop, jazz poetry, poetry slams, traditional poetry readings and can include comedy routines and 'prose monologues'. - A poetry slam is a competition at which poets read or recite original work. The performances are then judged by a panel typically of five judges, often selected from the audience, or sometimes judged by audience response. The judges usually give each poem a score on a scale of 010 (zero being the worst, ten being the best). The highest and lowest scores are dropped and the middle three are kept. The highest score one can receive is a 30 and the lowest is a zero. - Storytelling is the social and cultural activity of sharing stories, often with improvisation, theatrics, or embellishment. Stories or narratives have been shared in every culture as a means of entertainment, education, cultural preservation and instilling moral values. Crucial elements of stories and storytelling include plot, characters and narrative point of view. The term 'storytelling' is used in a narrow sense to refer specifically to oral storytelling and also in a looser sense to refer to techniques used in other media to unfold or disclose the narrative of a story. - In a modern sense, comedy (from the , \\"kmidía\\") refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, and stand-up comedy. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter. - A short story is a piece of prose fiction that can be read in one sitting. Emerging from earlier oral storytelling traditions in the 17th century, the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization. At its most prototypical the short story features a small cast of named characters, and focuses on a self-contained incident with the intent of evoking a \\"single effect\\" or mood. In doing so, short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components to a far greater degree than is typical of an anecdote, yet to a far lesser degree than a novel. While the short story is largely distinct from the novel, authors of both generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques. - A novel is a long narrative, normally in prose, which describes fictional characters and events, usually in the form of a sequential story. - The Beat Generation is a literary movement started by a group of authors whose work explored and influenced American culture and politics in the post-World War II era. The bulk of their work was published and popularized throughout the 1950s. Central elements of Beat culture are rejection of standard narrative values, spiritual quest, exploration of American and Eastern religions, rejection of materialism, explicit portrayals of the human condition, experimentation with psychedelic drugs, and sexual liberation and exploration. - A pen name (\\"nom de plume\\", or \\"literary double\\") is a pseudonym (or, in some cases, a variant form of a real name) adopted by an author and printed on the title page or by-line of his or her works in place of their \\"real\\" name. A pen name may be used to make the author's name more distinctive, to disguise his or her gender, to distance an author from some or all of his or her previous works, to protect the author from retribution for his or her writings, to combine more than one author into a single author, or for any of a number of reasons related to the marketing or aesthetic presentation of the work. The author's name may be known only to the publisher, or may come to be common knowledge. - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form. - In grammar, inflection or inflexion sometimes called accidence is the modification of a word to express different grammatical categories such as tense, case, voice, aspect, person, number, gender, and mood. The inflection of verbs is also called \\"conjugation\\", and one can refer to the inflection of nouns, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, determiners, participles, prepositions, postpositions, numerals, articles etc, as \\"declension\\". - William Seward Burroughs II ( / broz / ; also known by his pen name William Lee ; February 5 , 1914 -- August 2 , 1997 ) was an American novelist , short story writer , satirist , essayist , painter , and spoken word performer . A primary figure of the Beat Generation and a major postmodernist author who wrote in the paranoid fiction genre , he is considered to be \`\` one of the most politically trenchant , culturally influential , and innovative artists of the 20th century '' . His influence is considered to have affected a range of popular culture as well as literature . Burroughs wrote eighteen novels and novellas , six collections of short stories and four collections of essays . Five books have been published of his interviews and correspondences . He also collaborated on projects and recordings with numerous performers and musicians , and made many appearances in films . He was born into a wealthy family in St. Louis , Missouri , grandson of the inventor and founder of the Burroughs Corporation , William Seward Burroughs I , and nephew of public relations manager Ivy Lee . Burroughs began writing essays and journals in early adolescence , but did not begin publicizing his writing until his thirties . He left home in 1932 to attend Harvard University , studied English , and anthropology as a postgraduate , and later attended medical school in Vienna . In 1942 Burroughs enlisted in the U.S. Army to serve during World War II , but was turned down by the Office of Strategic Services and Navy , after which he picked up the drug addiction that affected him for the rest of his life , while working a variety of jobs . In 1943 while living in New York City , he befriended Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac , the mutually influential foundation of which grew into the Beat Generation , which was later a defining influence on the 1960s counterculture . Much of Burroughs 's work is semi-autobiographical , primarily drawn from his experiences as a heroin addict , as he lived throughout Mexico City , London , Paris and... - Jazz poetry is poetry that \\"demonstrates jazz-like rhythm or the feel of improvisation\\". The genre also includes poems written about jazz music, musicians, or the jazz milieu. During the 1920s, several poets began to eschew the conventions of rhythm and style; among these were Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, and E. E. Cummings. The significance of the simultaneous evolution of poetry and jazz during the 1920s was apparent to many poets of the era, resulting in the merging of the two art forms into jazz poetry. Jazz poetry has long been something of an \\"outsider\\" art form that exists somewhere outside the mainstream, having been conceived in the 1920s by African Americans, maintained in the 1950s by counterculture poets like those of the Beat generation, and adapted in modern times into hip-hop music and live poetry events known as poetry slams. - An author is narrowly defined as the originator of any written work and can thus also be described as a writer (with any distinction primarily being an implication that an author is a writer of one or more major works, such as books or plays). More broadly defined, an author is \\"the person who originated or gave existence to anything\\" and whose authorship determines responsibility for what was created. The more specific phrase published author refers to an author (especially but not necessarily of books) whose work has been independently accepted for publication by a reputable publisher , versus a self-publishing author or an unpublished one . - A poetry reading is a public oral recitation or performance of poetry. - Paranoid fiction is a term sometimes used to describe works of literature that explores the subjective nature of reality and how it can be manipulated by forces in power. These forces can be external, such as a totalitarian government, or they can be internal, such as a character's mental illness or refusal to accept the harshness of the world he or she is in. - Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, \\"poiesis\\", \\"making\\") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of languagesuch as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metreto evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning. - Literature, in its broadest sense, is any single body of written works. More restrictively, it is writing considered as an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage. Its Latin root \\"literatura\\"/\\"litteratura\\" (derived itself from \\"littera\\": \\"letter\\" or \\"handwriting\\") was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature). Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre).

The story begins when an enigmatic and timid, young woman named Estelle walks into Spirit's Haven one stormy evening. She approaches the bar and nervously orders a glass of red wine. Al notices her trembling hands and the look of deep sadness in her eyes. As a man of inherent intuition, Al senses that it's not just refuge from the storm she's seeking but solace from the turmoil her life has suddenly become.

This mansion, surrounded by mystic bayous, once belonged to her grandmother but disappeared mysteriously a decade ago. Al's curiosity is piqued as he discovers a connection to the very same mansion that his own grandmother had mentioned countless times during his childhood. Seeing the opportunity to solve the mysteries of his own past while aiding Estelle, Al embarks on a quest to uncover the truth behind the lost mansion. Along the way, the pair discovers a hidden world intertwined with voodoo, spirits, and a dark history that spans centuries. They enlist the help of locals, historians, and a team of paranormal investigators to delve deeper into the otherworldly realm that surrounds them.

His parents were both of Ulster Scottish descent, the father having emigrated from Milford, County Donegal, Ireland, in 1783. One of eleven siblings, Buchanan was the oldest child in the family to survive infancy. In March 1860, the House created the Covode Committee to investigate the administration for evidence of offenses, some impeachable, such as bribery and extortion of representatives in exchange for their votes. The committee, with three Republicans and two Democrats, was accused by Buchanan's supporters of being nakedly partisan; they also charged its chairman, Republican Rep. John Covode, with acting on a personal grudge (since the president had vetoed a bill that was fashioned as a land grant for new agricultural colleges, but was designed to benefit Covode's railroad company). However, the Democratic committee members, as well as Democratic witnesses, were equally enthusiastic in their pursuit of Buchanan, and as pointed in their condemnations, as the Republicans. The committee was unable to establish grounds for impeaching Buchanan; however, the majority report issued on June 17 exposed corruption and abuse of power among members of his cabinet, as well as allegations (if not impeachable evidence) from the Republican members of the Committee, that Buchanan had attempted to bribe members of Congress in connection with the Lecompton constitution. (The Democratic report, issued separately the same day, pointed out that evidence was scarce, but did not refute the allegations; one of the Democratic members, Rep. James Robinson, stated publicly that he agreed with the Republican report even though he did not sign it.) Buchanan claimed to have \\"passed triumphantly through this ordeal\\" with complete vindication. Nonetheless, Republican operatives distributed thousands of copies of the Covode Committee report throughout the nation as campaign material in that year's presidential election.

Given these facts, what does water do for a root among the following options: - Makes it taste bad - it needs them - Helps it sprout - nutrients - Protects it from being eaten - Regrows it - It remains dormant - Kills it A:","output":"Among the options given, \\"Helps it sprout\\" and \\"it needs them\\" are the most correct in terms of what water does for a root. Water is essential for a seed to germinate into a plant. It softens the coat of the seed, allowing the embryonic plant inside to break through and sprout, or start to grow. This includes the growth of roots, which absorbs water and nutrients from the soil to help the plant to grow. Without water, the seed would remain dormant, unable to sprout. So, essentially, a root needs water to sprout and grow. This continues even after the plant is fully grown, as the roots continue to absorb water to sustain the plant's life processes. This, however, does not mean that water provides nutrients to the root. Nutrients are derived from the soil, but it is water that helps to absorb and transport these nutrients to different parts of the plants. Thus, it's not appropriate to say that water makes a root taste bad, protects a root from being eaten, regrows it, remains dormant, or kills it. Over watering can cause roots to rot and die, but adequate water is essential for a root and plant's survival and growth."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: During the film opening, we see a man, presumably Einstein (Walter Mathau) playing a violin, as another man walks past a poster advertising Boyd's comet.

He comments that she's babbling when she tries to tell him a story. The scene cuts back and forth with a group of elderly men arguing about whether time exists. Meg and James are in his convertible when it develops engine trouble. We see Einstein discussing with his friends (the elderly men), whether there are 'accidents' and he says, \\"I do not believe God plays dice with the universe.\\"Catherine and James pull into a garage, where Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) is arguing with his boss, Bob (Tony Shalhoub), about the car they hear coming into the shop, what make and model it is and what the trouble with it is, based on what they can hear.

There are a certain number of factors that determine whether or not you are eligible for unemployment compensation. If the following applies to you, then you are considered unemployed and are eligible for unemployment insurance and benefits.","output":"First and foremost, you must be either partially or totally unemployed through no fault of your own. This means that if you have been let go from your job, it must have been due to lack of work or business closure, rather than for misconduct or quitting voluntarily. In the case of partial unemployment, your work hours must have significantly reduced due to circumstances beyond your control. Additionally, you must have a qualifying base period of employment to establish eligibility. In Ohio, the base period is determined by looking at the first four out of the last five completed calendar quarters before the start of your unemployment claim. For instance, if you file your claim in July 2021, your base period would comprise of the four quarters between April 2020 and March 2021. Within this base period, you must have worked in at least two quarters and earned a minimum pre-determined amount, which is subject to adjustment each year based on average weekly wages in the state. Moreover, you must be able and available to work during the entire period of your unemployment. This means meeting the physical and mental requirements essential for your line of work, as well as being prepared to accept suitable job offers. Suitability is typically determined by factors such as prior skills and experience, previous wage level, commuting distance, and the working environment. It is also crucial to actively seek employment, making genuine efforts to find a new job by conducting job searches, submitting applications, attending job interviews, and networking with potential employers. Furthermore, you may be required to participate in reemployment services provided by the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services (ODJFS). These services aim to assist claimants in re-entering the workforce, offering resources such as job search assistance, skills assessment, training, and workshops. Failure to participate in these services without good cause may result in disqualification from receiving unemployment benefits. To calculate the amount of unemployment compensation you are entitled to receive, Ohio utilizes a formula based on your earnings during the base period. A weekly benefit is calculated by taking the average of your earnings in the two highest-earning quarters of your base period, then dividing that amount by 26. The maximum amount of benefits that can be collected each week is currently capped at around 50% of the state's average weekly wage. Once your weekly benefit is determined, you can receive payments for a maximum of 26 weeks within a 12-month benefit period, provided that you continue to meet the eligibility requirements. In conclusion, calculating the amount of unemployment in Ohio depends on meeting specific eligibility criteria, such as job separation through no fault of your own, sufficient earnings and employment within a base period, being able and available to work, and participating in reemployment services. Once these qualifications are met, a calculation based on your earnings during the base period determines the weekly benefit amount and the duration of the compensation."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

In 1992, well before the advent of social media, Superman was killed and comic books went flying off the shelves. In 2007, social media like Facebook and Twitter were in their infancy when Captain America died. And now -- due in part to the abundance of social media and the intense interest in Spider-Man's alter ego, Peter Parker -- a firestorm has erupted, after Marvel revealed that Parker will die, and the role of Spider-Man will be taken over by his archenemy, Doctor Octopus. The just-released \\"Amazing Spider-Man\\" #700 marks the end of one of the most popular comic book series of all time after 50 years. All parties involved maintain that the changes are quite permanent, and next month the saga begins anew with the release of \\"The Superior Spider-Man\\" #1, with the Doc, Otto Octavius, stepping into the Spidey suit. Otto believes that with the combination of his intelligence and Parker's inherited memories and spider powers, he can be an uber-Spider-Man. He can live Parker's life better than Peter could -- from fighting crime to getting back together with on-again, off-again girlfriend Mary Jane Watson. When issue #700 was leaked early, fan reaction -- both positive and negative -- went into overdrive, with a few death threats directed at the issue's writer, Dan Slott.

The answer to this question is:","output":"The missing first step of the following process is: 1. You inhale, or breathe in, through your nose or mouth. To provide a detailed explanation of the entire breathing process, it begins with the inhalation. The overall process is called respiration, and below are the steps involved: 1. You inhale, or breathe in, through your nose or mouth. This step introduces air, rich in oxygen, to your respiratory system. Your nostrils or mouth provide an entrance for the air to go into your body. Through the process of inhalation, you take in fresh air that contains life-sustaining oxygen. 2. Your diaphragm moves down. The diaphragm is a sheet of muscles found beneath the lungs, and it plays a crucial role in the respiration process. As you inhale, your diaphragm contracts and moves downward, which increases the space in your chest cavity for the lungs to expand. 3. Your lungs have more room. As your diaphragm moves down, your lungs can expand due to the increase in space within the chest cavity. The thoracic cavity expands, and the ribcage moves outward and upward, allowing the lungs to draw in even more air. 4. Your lungs fill with air. With the increased space, your lungs can now fill up with the oxygen-rich air. This air travels through the respiratory system, including the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles, and finally reaches the alveoli – small air sacs where gas exchange takes place. 5. Gas exchange occurs. In the alveoli, oxygen is transferred from the air to the blood in the capillaries. At the same time, carbon dioxide – a waste product produced by cellular respiration – is transferred from the blood to the alveoli, preparing it to be exhaled. 6. You exhale. After the gas exchange process is completed, you exhale or breathe out the carbon dioxide-filled air that your body doesn't need. This process is a result of the relaxation of your diaphragm and the intercostal muscles. Your ribcage moves back to its original position, and your diaphragm moves back up, reducing the volume of the chest cavity and pushing the air out of your lungs. 7. Carbon dioxide is exhaled. As you exhale, carbon dioxide leaves your body through your mouth or nose, completing the gas exchange process within your respiratory system. 8. You start the process over again. The entire process is a cycle that repeats itself, depending on your body's needs and activity level. This continuous exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide is an essential function for sustaining life and maintaining healthy cellular functions within the human body."},{"instruction":"Q:Question: What does Rapture meaning in a theological sense? I found the following answer on Google: Denominations such as Roman Catholics , Orthodox Christians , Lutheran Christians, and Reformed Christians believe in a rapture only in the sense of a general final resurrection, when Christ returns a single time. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","output":"Yes, the answer you found on Google is generally correct, but it could use some elaboration. In a theological sense, the term \\"rapture\\" typically refers to the belief held by certain Christian denominations that, at the Second Coming of Christ, faithful believers will be suddenly caught up or \\"raptured\\" to meet the returning Christ in the air, resulting in their physical removal from the earth. This event is seen as preceding a period of tribulation and the eventual return of Christ with his followers to establish his millennial kingdom on earth. The concept of the rapture is primarily associated with certain evangelical and fundamentalist Protestant denominations, which interpret certain passages in the New Testament (such as 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17) to support this belief. However, as the answer you found on Google states, other denominations like Roman Catholics, Orthodox Christians, Lutheran Christians, and Reformed Christians interpret these scriptures differently and do not hold to a belief in a separate rapture event. Instead, they believe in a general resurrection of the dead and the final judgment, with Christ returning only once at the end of time to establish his eternal kingdom. So, to summarize, the answer you found is correct in stating that some denominations like Roman Catholics, Orthodox Christians, Lutheran Christians, and Reformed Christians believe in a rapture only in the sense of a general final resurrection and a single return of Christ. The concept of an additional, separate rapture event is specific to certain evangelical and fundamentalist Protestant beliefs."},{"instruction":"On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"send so good but can't access menu on s7.\\" Answer:","output":"2"},{"instruction":"the best way to get to know institut sankt joseph is to visit!

It often requires critical thinking, analysis, and contextual knowledge to address appropriately. Here's an example of a grad-school level question in the field of Cognitive Psychology and its related explanation: Question: How do top-down and bottom-up processes interact to influence attention, perception, and memory in the context of the Biased Competition Model, and how can their roles be investigated through various cognitive tasks and neuroscientific methods? Explanation: This question asks the responder to examine two critical processes in cognitive psychology: top-down and bottom-up processes. The question also provides a framework for the answer, 'the Biased Competition Model,' which suggests that attention influences neural processes by biasing the competitive selection of cells representing various stimuli. Top-down processes refer to the influence of higher-order cognitive processes, such as expectations, goals, or previous knowledge, on the individual's attention, perception, and memory. These processes are often driven by context and may involve the modulation of more basic sensory processing based on current goals, needs, or experiences. For example, when searching for a particular object in a cluttered environment, top-down expectations about the object's features can guide attention to focus on objects with those features, making it easier to locate the target. Bottom-up processes, on the other hand, are stimulus-driven and based on the physical properties of the environment or sensory input. These processes involve the initial processing of sensory information to extract relevant features, patterns, and representations. These features can capture attention based on their saliency, such as a bright color or a sudden movement in the environment, which then influences the perception and memory of the event. In the context of the Biased Competition Model, the interaction between top-down and bottom-up processes can be understood as a dynamic balance between these influences, with attention biasing the neural representation of competing stimuli according to their relevance or significance. For example, top-down goals or expectations may prioritize processing of task-relevant stimuli, while bottom-up saliency may still influence attention if a highly conspicuous, unexpected event occurs. Various cognitive tasks and neuroscientific methods can be employed to investigate the roles of top-down and bottom-up processes in attention, perception, and memory. Experimental tasks that manipulate the balance between top-down and bottom-up factors can help isolate their individual contributions. For instance, visual search tasks might compare the effects of task-relevant cues (top-down) versus stimulus saliency (bottom-up) on search efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, Stroop tasks or flanker tasks can be used to assess the impact of top-down attentional control on processing interfering distractors or task-irrelevant stimuli. Neuroscientific methods, like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or electroencephalography (EEG), can provide insights into the neural mechanisms underlying these processes. Examining brain areas involved in attentional control, such as the frontal and parietal cortices, can help determine how top-down and bottom-up processes modulate neural activation patterns and connectivity during attention, perception, and memory tasks. In conclusion, the interaction between top-down and bottom-up processes shapes attention, perception, and memory through a dynamic competition for neural resources, as described by the Biased Competition Model. Investigating their roles using cognitive tasks and neuroscientific methods can contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between these processes and their influence on cognition."},{"instruction":"I heard that Sasha decided they needed to get in shape for an upcoming athletic tournament.

It is one of the busiest day in terms of traffic according to Elsa , my sister in law who used to wait for black friday to shop early for her christmas gift ... I told her how to ease her burden in shopping during such particular day . Question: Why would she be burdened by this day of shopping ?","output":"Your sister-in-law, Elsa, might be burdened by shopping on Black Friday for a variety of reasons. Some of these reasons include large crowds, time constraints, financial pressures, and the overall stress of finding the perfect holiday gifts. 1. Large Crowds: One of the most significant factors contributing to the burden of shopping on Black Friday is the massive crowds that flock to stores. The feeling of being surrounded by a large number of people can be overwhelming, resulting in a stressful shopping experience. Navigating the crowded aisles, standing in long lines, and competing with other shoppers for limited quantities of discounted items can be physically and mentally exhausting. 2. Limited Time: Many shoppers feel pressure to find the best deals and purchase items quickly before they sell out on Black Friday. With limited time available to research and compare products, shoppers may feel rushed and struggle to make confident decisions. Additionally, shoppers who prioritize doorbuster deals may have to wake up early and sacrifice sleep, contributing to exhaustion and a lowered tolerance for stress. 3. Financial Pressures: Black Friday often comes hand-in-hand with expectations of deep discounts and spending, which can create financial stress for shoppers. Budgeting for holiday gifts is essential, but the allure of attractive deals can make it challenging to stick to that budget. The worry about overspending, combined with the desire to buy thoughtful gifts, can increase pressure during the shopping experience. 4. Gift Selection: Finding the perfect present for everyone on your list can be a daunting task even without the added pressures of Black Friday shopping. The challenge of selecting appropriate gifts, balancing the needs and wants of recipients, and dealing with the potential disappointment of not finding the ideal item can all contribute to a sense of burden during the shopping process. 5. High Expectations: There's a sense of anticipation and expectation associated with Black Friday, and the pressure to save money and score the best deals can be immense. The fear of missing out (FOMO) on the perfect deal or item can be a significant source of burden for shoppers, who may feel like they've failed if they don't meet their shopping goals. To ease the burden of shopping on Black Friday, consider these tips: 1. Plan ahead: Research deals, sales, and items of interest in advance, and create a prioritized shopping list to stay organized and focused. 2. Set a budget: Establish a budget before shopping and stick to it to avoid financial stress. 3. Shop online: Avoid the stressful in-store atmosphere by taking advantage of online deals and sales. 4. Opt for alternative shopping days: Consider shopping on days other than Black Friday, such as Small Business Saturday or Cyber Monday, for potentially less crowded experiences. 5. Pace yourself: Remember that shopping for holiday gifts is a process that doesn't need to be completed in a single day. Give yourself permission to take breaks and continue shopping at a more leisurely pace if needed."},{"instruction":"What are the indicators of a developing country? What are the attributes of a developed country? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"First, let's analyze and answer the two questions separately. 1. What are the indicators of a developing country? There are numerous factors that can indicate that a country is in the developing stage. However, we can outline some key indicators: a. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita: Developing countries typically have lower GDP per capita, which indicates the average economic output per person. b. Poverty Rate: A higher poverty rate is often found in developing countries, where a significant proportion of the population lives below the poverty line. c. Human Development Index (HDI): Developing countries generally have lower HDI scores, which combine income, education, and health indicators. d. Literacy Rate: Developing countries tend to have lower literacy rates, reflecting lower levels of education and a less skilled workforce. e. Health Care Access: Access to healthcare is often limited in developing countries, with fewer hospitals, clinics, and medical professionals available. f. Infrastructure: Developing countries often have inadequate infrastructure, including insufficient transportation networks, energy production, and sanitation systems. 2. What are the attributes of a developed country? Attributes of a developed country include: a. Higher Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita: In developed countries, the average income per person and overall economic output are higher. b. Lower Poverty Rate: There is a smaller proportion of the population living below the poverty line in developed countries. c. Higher Human Development Index (HDI): Developed countries typically have higher HDI scores, which indicate better living conditions, access to education, and healthcare. d. Higher Literacy Rate: Developed countries tend to have better education systems, resulting in a higher literacy rate and a more skilled workforce. e. Better Health Care Access: Developed countries generally have more comprehensive healthcare systems, with greater access to hospitals, clinics, and medical professionals. f. Advanced Infrastructure: Developed countries boast well-developed infrastructure, such as efficient transportation networks, reliable energy production, and effective sanitation systems. Now, let's analyze whether these two questions inquire about the same information: The two questions are related, as they both explore the features of countries in different stages of development. However, they focus on opposite ends of the development spectrum. The first question asks for indicators of a developing country, while the second question asks for attributes of a developed country. Although the information is connected, the questions inquire about distinct aspects of country development."},{"instruction":"Q:Information: - Raiders of the Lost Ark is a 1981 American action adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg, with a screenplay written by Lawrence Kasdan, from a story by George Lucas and Philip Kaufman.

After one last rally, 6 more people enrolled. As the days passed, half of the class eventually dropped, and half of the remaining students graduated. How many are still enrolled?. Me: Hmmm, let me think. I think this is the detailed solution:","output":"1. The class initially had 8 students enrolled. 2. 8 more people showed interest through advertising. 3. A fourth of these (8/4 = 2) dropped out. So, 8 - 2 = 6 more actually enrolled. 4. The total number of students enrolled now is 8 (initial) + 6 (from advertising) = 14. 5. Then, 2 more students got frustrated and left. So, 14 - 2 = 12 students remained. 6. The class rallied successfully, and enrollment increased 5 times the amount of students currently enrolled, which means 5 * 12 = 60 new students. 7. However, 2 of these new students had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts, leaving 60 - 2 = 58 new students. 8. The total number of students now is 12 (original remaining) + 58 (new after the rally) = 70 students. 9. After one last rally, 6 more people enrolled.

Keep a basket of cat toys near the desk for your cat to play with. You could even set up a kitty condo or play area near your computer so that it's near you and you can keep an eye on it as it plays. Rotate toys for added interest. Keep the cat's interest by only putting out one or two toys at a time. Try tying a string to your office door handle to provide your cat with the opportunity to bat it around. You can also try battery-operated toys. These can be particularly helpful if you need to focus on work but your cat likes a lot of play time. Every time your cat threatens to jump up on your workspace, grab the pointer and start playing laser tag across the floor. You can lead your cat away from your work area and into the ecstasy of play. There are even some automated laser toys that will occupy your cat without you needing to be an active participant. Set up a comfy space for your cat that is near your but not right next to your keyboard. Very often your cat just wants to be near you while you work or play on the computer. Indeed, the longer you're stuck there, the more it wants your attention and will be likely to put itself right in your face to get it. By placing a bed or comfy sleep spot near you as you work or play on the computer, your cat may be satisfied enough that it can see you to avoid feeling the need to attack your keyboard. If you have a laptop, your cat may like the warmth of the computer. Try using a heated bed to keep them warm and off the keys. The comfort zone may not work with a kitten.

The lyrics of the song reflect a nostalgic longing for simpler, more innocent times. It tells of the narrator's memories of dancing to a song from an older era, the so-called \\"Crocodile Rock.\\" The song's uniqueness also comes from its sense of humor derived from its style, which can be seen as a parody of 1950s and '60s rock and roll. The \\"bopping\\" and \\"rocking\\" expressed in its lyrics are activities associated with that period's rock and roll dance scene. \\"Crocodile Rock\\" is also known for being a musical shift for Elton John. It was the first song on which he plays his piano in a rock and roll style with an upbeat rhythm, thus making it qualitatively different from his earlier, somewhat mellower compositions. This single is part of the album \\"Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player\\", which also achieved number one on the Pop Albums chart. This is an additional indicator of Elton John's growing popularity and success in the music industry, showcasing his ability to perform and excel in a variety of musical styles. Even today, \\"Crocodile Rock\\" remains one of Elton John's most recognizable and beloved songs, enjoyed by fans across multiple generations. In many ways, it symbolizes his versatility as an artist and his enduring influence in popular music over several decades.

Entailment implies that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also be true. Basically, the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis. To analyze the given statements, we need to break them down and clarify their meanings. Premise: Well yeah, we didn't think about it, you know. The premise suggests that the speaker and potentially others involved in a collaborative effort did not consider or reflect upon a certain aspect or element of a situation. On the basis of the provided context, it appears that this lack of consideration is being acknowledged. Hypothesis: We didn't think about it. The hypothesis essentially restates the idea put forth in the premise: that the speaker and perhaps others failed to think about something. The primary focus is on the omission of thought or consideration regarding a particular subject. With these interpretations, we can now assess whether the premise entails the hypothesis. It is evident that the premise and the hypothesis convey the same message: that the individuals involved did not give thought to a specific matter. The hypothesis can be seen as a simplified, more direct version of the premise. Given this understanding, it can be concluded that the premise does entail the hypothesis. If the premise is true (i.e., the speaker and others did not think about the subject), then the hypothesis, which also posits that they did not think about it, must also be true.

HGH is considered a wonder drug for children. It helps many children with growth problems every year. However, some athletes are now taking the drug. HGH helps add muscle in adults and recent research by the World Anti-Doping Agency shows that HGH may improve the sportsman's time by 5% when he takes part in short, fast races. Some athletes say that HGH surely makes them stronger. It also helps them to recover more quickly from injuries. Although it is _ by most professional sports, HGH is almost impossible to test for. The drug is completely natural and it will only show in tests for around 24 hours after taking it. Testing is usually done only during competitions, but athletes use HGH during training, so it is very difficult to know who has used the drug. This makes it very attractive for some athletes. Scientists are developing a new test which will find the drug in the body for up to two weeks. But it isn't going to be easy. Everybody has different levels of natural HGH in their body. For this reason, scientists are warning athletes of the possible problems with the drug. Research shows that HGH increase the risk of cancer. But is this enough to stop athletes from taking it?

In the past quarter, they sent home some 742 million in remittances . Overall, the money guest workers send back makes up half of the republic's government budget. The Alauddin Valley is in the Fann Mountains in eastern Tajikistan. The place long held an attraction for Russian writers and adventurers. Later, during the Soviet era, it was a popular tourist destination. Yet establishing a strong relationship with the people of the mountainous region is not easy. Men are seldom seen in the area. Nearly every family has at least one breadwinner working in Russia, if not more. The farm work falls to the women, who divide it up among themselves. Each summer, the village chooses the most experienced and skilled women to take all of the cows (up to 300 of them) to the summer pastures high up on in the mountains. The women spend four months there with their children since there is no one to leave the children with. They milk the cows and prepare products for the winter: cheese, butter and so on. These fermented goods get them through the winter when snow and avalanches cut off all contact with civilization. Residents here generally have two questions for visiting Russians.

This trilingual text contains, alongside texts in Latin and Old High German (teudisca lingua), the oldest written variety of Gallo-Romance (lingua romana) clearly distinct from Latin, the ancestor of Old French. The town was also called Stratisburgum or Strateburgus in Latin, from which later came Strossburi in Alsatian and Straßburg in Standard German, and then Strasbourg in French. The Oaths of Strasbourg is considered as marking the birth of the two countries of France and Germany with the division of the Carolingian Empire. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What were the Germans called in Old French?","output":"In Old French, the term used to refer to the Germans was \\"alemand\\" or \\"allemand.\\" This term is derived from the Latin word \\"Alemanni,\\" which was the name of a Germanic tribal confederation that occupied the region around Strasbourg beginning in the 3rd century AD. In modern French, the term has evolved into \\"Allemand\\" used for both the German language and the people."},{"instruction":"Where are files likely to be hanging?

Common character ideas include: robots, astronauts, literal statues (e.g. “The Thinker”), and mimes. For ideas or inspiration, look through pictures of living statues online, or go to an area of a nearby city in which living statues frequently perform. Start by visiting costume stores or novelty shops to find the necessary wigs and clothing for your costume. If you’d like to custom make your own costume, you can visit a fabric store to purchase an appropriate color and style of fabric, and then sew your own costume. If you have the option, choose a cotton fabric for your costume. Cotton holds its color well, even if you’re performing in rain or snow. To flesh out your appearance as a human statue, you can accessorize with objects to wear and hold. Look for objects that match your overall theme: if you’re a robot, hold an imitation computer; if you’re a statue, hold a book to “read”; if you’re a pirate, hold a plastic sword and hook. Sometimes just going shopping will be enough to inspire the costume, character, and actions you choose to perform. Yard sales, thrift shops and antique shops are best. You’re bound to find something odd that will spark your inspiration. Other helpful places for props are home improvement stores (if you’re looking for mechanical items) and fabric and craft stores. Items found at these types of stores may spark your creativity and give you ideas of how to accessorize your statue character. Many living statues cover themselves completely in makeup, to give them the appearance of being a statue, robot, or other non-human character. Depending on your natural skin tone, white makeup works best; copper and silver are other popular face-paint colors. You should be able to find costume makeup at a costume or hobby store, or through most online retailers. If using a white or non-metallic color, use water based cake-makeup as opposed to oil based. If you use oil, dust it with a finishing powder so it doesn’t smudge. In order to draw attention to your eyes, you may want to line them in brown or black with regular eyeliner. Adding extra makeup (like lipstick or blush) on top of your solid base may be necessary, but keep it minimal unless the makeup is an essential part of your costume. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article provides guidance on how to create and portray a living statue or character for performance purposes. It offers advice on finding inspiration, choosing costumes and accessories, and applying appropriate makeup to enhance the character's appearance.

Premise: For Columns 5 through 8, the only amounts that change in lines 1 and 2, compared to columns 1 through 4, are outbound attributable cost and inbound revenue. Hypothesis: Columns 5 through 8 and all sharing the same color. The premise is focused on the difference in specific amounts between columns 5-8 and 1-4. It implies that there is a shift in outbound attributable costs and inbound revenue between these two sets of columns, but it does not provide any information about the color-coding or other visual features of these columns. On the other hand, the hypothesis revolves around a visual aspect of the columns (columns 5 through 8 sharing the same color) and doesn't provide any insight about the content or specific amounts of the columns. The hypothesis mainly focuses on the format and presentation of the data. There is no clear logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise deals with the specific differences in amounts, while the hypothesis pertains to a visual aspect of the columns. Consequently, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. Both the premise and hypothesis might be true independently of each other, but there is no direct relation between their truth values. Therefore, verifying or falsifying one does not provide conclusive evidence for the truth or falsity of the other.

Which group had a greater decline in stamina? Hint: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease. Answer:","output":"Based on the provided information and the hint, it can be inferred that Group B, consisting of individuals over the age of 65, would experience a greater decline in stamina compared to Group A. The factors contributing to this decline are closely associated with the aging process. As mentioned in the hint, during late adulthood, there are several physiological changes and increased risks that can affect an individual's overall health and well-being. These factors include: 1. An increased risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and other age-related conditions. 2. A general decline in strength and stamina, often attributed to the loss of muscle mass, reduced lung capacity, and lower metabolic rates. 3. Impairment of senses, such as vision and hearing, as well as deteriorating reflexes, which can affect an individual's ability to carry out activities that demand physical coordination and endurance. 4. A weaker immune system, leading to increased vulnerability to illnesses and a longer recovery period. 5. Higher prevalence of chronic conditions such as arthritis and neurological conditions like Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, Group A, composed of people under the age of 35, are considered early and middle adults. These individuals typically do not exhibit the same level of age-related issues faced by older adults and generally have better stamina. Their bodies are still in a phase of growth and development, and they are likely to have more functional capacity compared to those belonging to Group B. To summarize, Group B, consisting of individuals over 65 years of age, would have a greater decline in stamina as a result of the various age-related physiological changes and increased health risks that come with late adulthood. Consequently, this group would be the most affected by the loss of strength, stamina, and overall resilience when compared to their younger counterparts in Group A."},{"instruction":"Question: What key details about maksym kokosha can be extracted from the following bio?

Answer:","output":"The best answer to the question \\"Mutations are what to evolution?\\" is \\"essential.\\" Mutations play a crucial role in the process of evolution, as they are the primary source of the variation in genetic material within a population. This genetic diversity is essential for species to adapt, survive, and evolve in response to changing environmental conditions. Mutations occur when there is a change in the sequence of DNA nucleotides. These changes can be caused by a variety of factors, including errors in DNA replication, exposure to specific chemicals or radiation, and certain types of viral infections. Although some mutations may be harmful or neutral in their effect on an organism, others can provide a selective advantage. These beneficial mutations become more prevalent within a population over time due to the process of natural selection, which favors individuals with traits that enhance their reproductive success. Evolution, at its core, is driven by genetic variation. In the absence of mutations, each generation of offspring would be identical to its parents, and there would be no room for adaptation or the development of new traits. This is why mutations are considered essential for the evolution process. The other answer choices presented, such as \\"plants growth,\\" \\"optional,\\" \\"competition,\\" \\"dangerous,\\" \\"non-essential,\\" \\"voluntary,\\" and \\"allow growth,\\" do not fully encapsulate the fundamental relationship between mutations and evolution. It is important to note that not all mutations are beneficial. Some mutations can be harmful, leading to decreased survivability or reproductive capabilities. However, natural selection often acts to remove these detrimental mutations from a population over time. Therefore, the broader evolutionary process continues with the help of mutations, shaping the diversity and adaptability of species over generations. In this context, the best answer to the question remains \\"essential,\\" emphasizing the critical role of mutations in driving evolutionary change."},{"instruction":"Is the following statement true? \\"Menstruation refers to the menstrual cycle of a women, that is fertility at a certain time.\\" Let's think first. Step-by-step reasoning process:","output":"The statement is partially true, but it requires some clarification. Let's break it down step-by-step: 1. Menstruation and menstrual cycle: Menstruation is a part of the menstrual cycle in women, but they are not the same thing. The menstrual cycle is a regular biological process that most women experience to prepare the body for a potential pregnancy. Menstruation, also known as a period, is the stage of the menstrual cycle where the uterus sheds its lining accompanied by bleeding. So, menstruation is a specific phase of the overall menstrual cycle. 2. Fertility and menstrual cycle: The menstrual cycle plays a crucial role in determining a woman's fertility. The cycle consists of several phases, including the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase. The ovulation phase is the time when a mature egg is released by the ovary and becomes available for fertilization. This is the period of peak fertility, which usually occurs around the 14th day of a 28-day menstrual cycle. 3. Menstruation and fertility: Menstruation, as mentioned earlier, is a period of uterine lining shedding and bleeding. During this phase, a woman is not usually fertile as the egg released during ovulation has not been fertilized and is being expelled along with the lining. So, menstruation itself is not a fertility period. In conclusion, the statement is not entirely accurate because menstruation does not represent fertility but rather is a part of the menstrual cycle. It is the ovulation phase of the menstrual cycle that indicates a woman's fertile period."},{"instruction":"Una din slăbiciunile etichetei este faptul că consumatorii nu sunt conştienţi de aceasta, iar în această privinţă sunt de acord cu dl Wijkman şi, prin urmare, aceasta nu este deosebit de atractivă nici pentru producători. Translate to English","output":"One of the weaknesses of the labeling system is that consumers are not aware of it, and in this regard, I agree with Mr. Wijkman, and therefore, it is not particularly attractive for manufacturers either. The labeling system is an essential element in the commercialization of products, as it aims to inform consumers about the characteristics, qualities, and origin of a product. However, its effectiveness can be significantly impeded by various factors. One such factor is the lack of awareness among consumers regarding the existence of these labeling systems. This lack of awareness can negatively affect both consumers and producers. Consumer awareness plays a vital role in the success of a labeling system. If consumers are unaware of the labels, they will not be able to make informed decisions when purchasing products. Consequently, the intended purpose of the labeling system in promoting transparency in the market and facilitating consumer choice is compromised. The lack of awareness of the labeling system can be attributed to numerous sources, including insufficient marketing and promotion efforts, complex labeling information, and a scarcity of educational programs aimed at increasing consumer knowledge. For manufacturers and producers, an ineffective labeling system creates a scenario where the investment made in obtaining certifications, conducting tests, and implementing necessary measures to be included in a labeling system does not yield the expected benefits. This lack of incentives for manufacturers may result in a reduction in the number of companies willing to apply and adhere to environmentally friendly or socially responsible principles. Consequently, this might lead to a decline in overall quality and sustainability in the market. Given these repercussions, it is essential to address the issue of consumer awareness regarding the labeling system to ensure its effectiveness for all stakeholders involved. There are multiple strategies that can be employed to improve consumer awareness of the labeling system: 1. Improving marketing and promotional efforts: This includes investing in advertising, social media campaigns, and public relations activities that aim to increase the visibility and understanding of the labeling system in the eyes of consumers. 2. Simplifying labeling information: The complexity of labeling systems can often overwhelm consumers and create difficulties in understanding the meaning and implications of various labels. Streamlining and simplifying the labeling information can enhance consumers' understanding and awareness. 3. Implementing educational programs: Developing and incorporating educational programs and initiatives that focus on the importance of label information and how to interpret the data can significantly boost the overall awareness of consumers. 4. Collaboration with retailers: Working closely with retailers can ensure that labeling information is prominently displayed and easily accessible for consumers. Retailers can also be trained to provide additional information on the labeling system to their customers. By adopting these strategies and maintaining an ongoing commitment to improving consumer awareness, the weaknesses of the labeling system can be mitigated, and it can serve as an influential tool for both consumers and manufacturers."},{"instruction":"Tämä hanke on erittäin myönteinen, ja meidän on siksi kannatettava sitä sekä pyrittävä eteenpäin, jotta ratkaisemme tekniset ongelmat.

They attribute this to the product's poor quality. The customer seems particularly upset by the eraser's thickness, which is only a quarter of an inch. They indicate that the bulk of the product is made up of the wooden handle, which they believe is an aesthetic feature that doesn't enhance the actual functionality of the eraser. Additionally, the customer also isn't fond of the eraser's white color. They observe that it starts to look dirty once it has been used on colored chalk, contributing to their overall dissatisfaction. Furthermore, the key function of an eraser which is to erase well failed to perform as expected.

The only problem is that many people thought that the man in question, Ben Kravit, a 28-year-old from Dallas, Texas, was actually actor Paul Rudd. That is until Rudd's publicist revealed it was not the actor in the video, and someone who knows Kravit revealed his identity to the website Jezebel, leading to what Kravit describes as a 'pretty crazy day.' Scroll down for video. Hero: Ben Kravit (above) broke up an anti-gay assault at Dallas/Fort Worth Airport last Thursday. Mistaken identity: When a video of his heroic deed went viral, many started to believe it was Paul Rudd seen in a plaid shirt (above circled in red) breaking up the fight. No help: Kravit (above circled in red) has said workers at the airport and TSA agents were no help and seemed to do little to stop the fight from happening. Now, everyone wants to know more about Kravit, a brand manager who works for Dr. Pepper Snapple and is engaged to a woman who is no doubt the envy of many these past few days. It all began last Thursday when video surfaced of a man berating a fellow traveler at the airport for wearing a pink shirt. Then, when the anti-gay attacker was approached by someone in a cowboy hat asking what was wrong, he screamed, 'Queers! That’s what I’m upset about. This fa**ot right here.' Seconds later he started to kick the man in the pink shirt, while also grabbing his hair and slapping at him. That is when Kravit, the man in the cowboy hat and a few other model citizens stepped in to subdue the aggressor and stop the assault. The whole time, a passenger named Andrew Kennedy was filming the melee, which has now been viewed close to four million times on YouTube.

Good sport: Said Kravit (above with his fiancee) of the experience, 'It was certainly fun to be a part of for a day, and something my friends and I will look back on and laugh about for many years' And that is when people watching the video started to wonder if Rudd, the star of films including Clueless, Anchorman and This Is 40 was responsible for taking down the homophobe. 'It seemed like every blog and website out there was running with it,' said Kravit. 'I have gotten the doppelgänger about [Rudd] before, but nothing like today. It was certainly fun to be a part of for a day, and something my friends and I will look back on and laugh about for many years.' As for why he jumped to action, the young man said, 'I know people can get agitated at airports, but the incendiary and ignorant comments he was making were out of control. I was really surprised no police or security was there to separate the two, but then when it got physical my instinct was to stop and protect the victim.' He added, 'It was really unfortunate that people think such discriminatory things, let alone verbally and physically assault someone over it.

Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2] I am facing a new situation today: High lake had a lot of fresh and salt water mixing, therefore presented layers of stratified water.The water was poor in nutrients.Low lake had no such problems and it was a very abundant and prolific fishing spot.

Step 2: Analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. - The premise states that there was a semirational period (a time when a person is not completely rational) during an event involving excitement or danger centered around the individual. - The hypothesis suggests that the person in question enjoys or flourishes in situations involving excitement and danger. Step 3: Determine if the premise entails the hypothesis. - The premise describes a particular instance when the individual experienced a semirational state during a dangerous or exciting event. However, it does not provide information regarding whether the individual generally thrives on excitement and danger. Conclusion: The premise does not entail the hypothesis, as it only provides information about a specific instance and not about the person's general tendencies or preferences regarding excitement and danger."},{"instruction":"Question: What is the German name of Hitler's book about his life?

It is a general statement and expresses a concern about harm that could come to a large number of people. Yet, it doesn't specify who these individuals might be, nor does it rank the severity or significance of potential risks. The second statement, on the other hand, implies a more personal risk. The use of \\"we\\" indicates the speaker believes they and their group are also at risk in the situation. The declaration that it's the \\"worst thing\\" suggests the speaker is more concerned about themselves and their group being harmed or killed, potentially more so than others. Although the two sentences are related, the conclusion is not an absolute one derived directly from the initial premise. We should take into account the context of the situation that is being referred to; the perspective, bias, or subjective feelings of the speaker; and the rationale for such a conclusion. Also, the gradation from the \\"bad\\" (the abstraction of lots of people might be killed) to the \\"worst\\" (the personalization of we might die) is not a standard progression, but a manifestation of the individual's perception of risk and fear. In other words, this conclusion reflects not just an interpretation of the given facts, but also the speaker's personal priorities, emotions, and fears. While it's a plausible conclusion to draw, it is not the only one or even the most objective one. A person with different priorities or emotions might have heard the same premise and concluded, for example, that the worst thing is not the potential for their own death, but the potential for so much loss of life generally, regardless of who exactly might die. So, while you could logically conclude that the risk of personal harm or death could be included in the prediction that \\"Lots of people might be killed in the process,\\" stating that \\"The worst thing is that we might be the ones to die, too\\" is more of a subjective statement that reflects personal fear and self-preservation instinct, rather than a strict logical conclusion. An objective logical conclusion from the initial statement would stick closer to the specific content provided, simply asserting that a situation bears a high risk for many casualties."},{"instruction":"I say to the government, to the people of this country and certainly to members of parliament that it is our duty and responsibility to ensure that we are not led down the garden path by ideologies put forward by extremely passionate interventionists, if I can use the term used by the member for Broadview-Greenwood.

Puerto Rico (Spanish for \`\`Rich Port''), officially the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (Spanish: Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico, lit. \`\`Free Associated State of Puerto Rico'') and briefly called Porto Rico, is an unincorporated territory of the United States located in the northeast Caribbean Sea, approximately 1,000 miles (1,600 km) southeast of Miami, Florida.","output":"Yes, based on the given text, it is true that Puerto Rico is part of the United States. The text states that Puerto Rico is an \\"unincorporated territory of the United States\\" and is positioned in the northeast Caribbean Sea, approximately 1,000 miles southeast of Miami, Florida. To further understand this association, it is important to look at the historical and political context behind Puerto Rico's status. The island of Puerto Rico was discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1493, and later became a Spanish colony. After the conclusion of the Spanish-American War in 1898, Puerto Rico, along with Guam and the Philippines, was ceded to the United States under the terms of the Treaty of Paris. Consequently, Puerto Rico came under US jurisdiction as an unincorporated territory. In 1917, the Jones-Shafroth Act granted U.S. citizenship to Puerto Ricans, which meant that they became subject to U.S. laws and regulations, and Puerto Ricans were allowed to travel freely between the island and mainland. However, they do not have the same representation in the U.S. government as the residents of the states. For instance, Puerto Rico has a single, non-voting representative in the U.S. Congress, and its residents cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections. The political status of Puerto Rico was further clarified in 1952 when it became a commonwealth. This allowed the island to have a certain degree of autonomy and self-government, while still being under U.S. sovereignty. Under the commonwealth status, Puerto Rico has its own constitution, a governor elected by the island's residents, and a local legislature. Puerto Rico's status has been a topic of debate and the subject of numerous referendums. Some Puerto Ricans support the idea of becoming a fully incorporated U.S. state, which would provide them with equal representation in the United States Congress, the right to vote in presidential elections, and access to federal programs and funding. Others advocate for full independence or retaining the current commonwealth status. In conclusion, based on the provided text and the historical and political context, Puerto Rico is indeed a part of the United States as an unincorporated territory, with its inhabitants holding U.S. citizenship and the island subject to U.S. federal law. However, Puerto Rico's commonwealth status also grants it some autonomy and self-governance, which opens up ongoing debates and discussions about its ultimate political relationship with the United States."},{"instruction":"Math problem: Solve 3*t + 116214 = 116166 for t.

We need to find the value of 't' in this equation: 3*t + 116214 = 116166 First, we need to get rid of the 116214 on the left side, so we can find out what 't' is. To do that, we will subtract 116214 from both sides of the equation: 3*t + 116214 - 116214 = 116166 - 116214 This simplifies to: 3*t = -48 Now we just have 3 times 't' equals -48. To find the value for 't', we will divide both sides of the equation by 3: (3*t) / 3 = (-48) / 3 This simplifies to: t = -16 So, the solution of the math problem, or the value of 't' is -16."},{"instruction":"Write the last sentence in this story.

To provide a detailed analysis of the sentence, let us break down its components and their respective functions: 1. Subject: \\"John\\" - The subject of the sentence is John, a proper noun, referring to the person doing the action. 2. Verb: \\"laid\\" - The verb 'to lay' is a transitive verb (i.e., it requires a direct object) and is used in the past tense here as \\"laid.\\" This term describes the action that John took on placing an object, the book, onto another object, the table. 3. Direct Object: \\"the book\\" - The direct object of the verb \\"laid\\" is \\"the book,\\" which receives the action of laying. It consists of the definite article \\"the\\" and the common noun \\"book,\\" indicating a specific (singular) book that John interacted with. 4. Preposition: \\"on\\" - The preposition \\"on\\" communicates the relationship between the action (laying) and its location (the table).

Stream of consciousness reasoning: When considering the outcome of a coin toss, we may instantly think about the two possible results: heads or tails. On the surface, it might seem like it should be easy to predict which side the coin will land on since there are only two options. However, when we delve deeper into the mechanics of a coin toss, we realize that numerous factors come into play, such as the initial force applied to the coin, the angle of the toss, air resistance, and the surface on which the coin lands. All these unpredictable variables contribute to the coin's trajectory and final result. Statistical probabilities may suggest that there is a 50-50 chance of getting either heads or tails, but in reality, each individual toss is subject to random, uncontrollable factors. Therefore, it becomes clear that despite our best efforts to analyze or predict the outcome of a coin toss, it is not possible to tell which side the coin will land on with absolute certainty."},{"instruction":"Write a dialog with this premise \\"Paul will help Hiram with homework.\\".","output":"Paul: Hi Hiram!

The group of teens, aged 15-17, were arraigned in Genesee County district courtroom. They are accused of throwing a 6-pound rock off an overpass near Flint, Michigan, on October 18, fatally injuring 32-year-old Kenneth White. White was riding home from work when he was struck in the face, head and chest by the rock that crashed through the windshield of the van in which he was a passenger. Police said this is the rock that was thrown off the overpass. \\"There's no words to describe it,\\" Kenneth White Sr, White's father, told CNN affiliate WNEM . \\"I've buried my mother, my father, and my oldest brother in the last four years and this is the hardest thing I've ever done in my life.\\" White was engaged to be married and leaves behind a 5-year-old son.

I try to explain. He's so young, he's only 5, he doesn't understand.\\" Genesee County Sheriff Robert Pickell confirmed to CNN that based on their investigation, officials believe Kyle Anger, 17, threw the rock that killed White, but all five boys are being charged with the same counts. The maximum penalty is life in prison. Anger and Alexzander Miller, 15; Mark Sekelsky, 16; Mikadyn Payne, 16; and Trevor Gray, 15, were arraigned Tuesday and pleaded not guilty, according to Gray's attorney, Erwin Meiers. \\"To propel the size of boulder down from the Dodge Road overpass to a 70 mph vehicle that's headed southbound, you ought to know -- a reasonable person would know -- that that is creating a high risk of great bodily harm, or in this case, death,\\" said David Leyton, the county prosecutor, at a news conference on Monday. The five teenagers are being charged as adults, with one count of second-degree murder each. They are also being charged with conspiracy to commit murder, six felony counts each of malicious destruction of property and two other lesser charges. \\"Although the charges are all the same, the kids are all different,\\" Mark Sekelsky's lawyer, Frank Manley, told CNN affiliate WNEM . \\"The actions that kids may have become involved in are all different.

The teenagers include Kyle Anger, Alexzander Miller, Trevor Gray, Mikadyn Payne and Mark Sekelsky. >>Slideshow: Mid-Michigan mug shots<< All five of them were arraigned in front of a judge on Tuesday, Oct. 24 where not-guilty pleas were entered. They were charged with one count of second-degree murder (which is punishable by up to life in prison), one count of conspiracy to commit second-degree murder, six felony counts of malicious destruction of property and two misdemeanor counts of malicious destruction of property. “I don’t think this was a deliberate attempt to take somebody’s life. It was a willful and wanton act that resulted in somebody’s death. These people should have known better,” Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton said. “Under Michigan law that is second-degree murder.” >>Read more: Why defense attorney thinks all five teenagers were charged with second-degree murder<< The teenagers range in age from 15-17. The charges stem from the Oct. 18 incident that killed 32-year-old Kenneth White of Mt. Morris. \\"These particular individuals knowingly created a very high risk of death or great bodily harm, knowing that death or such harm would be the likely result of such actions,\\" Leyton said. Police said White was riding in a vehicle that night when he was struck in the head and chest by \\"a very large rock\\" thrown from the Dodge Road overpass in Genesee County's Vienna Township. Investigators believe that rock was thrown by Kyle Anger. White was a passenger in a van driven by his friend, Genesee County Sheriff Robert Pickell said. The driver saw a large rock coming at the van and said the rock entered the passenger side through the windshield, Pickell said. After the rock entered the van the driver said he passed four vehicles parked on the shoulder of the road before he could pull over, Pickell said. \\"Detectives discovered several vehicles on the shoulder of the roadway with flat tires and other damage to the vehicles,\\" Pickell said. Leyton said White died from blunt force trauma to the head and chest. He sustained lacerations and abrasions to the head and face, a skull fracture, an injury to the brain, fracture to his facial skeleton, a huge laceration to his chest, and a broken clavicle and upper ribs, Leyton said. The rock that struck White was thrown from the north end of the overpass and was about 5 inches wide, 8 inches long and weighed six pounds, Pickell said. Prior to the incident that killed White, the suspects threw a tire off of the Farrand Road overpass, Pickell said. Afterwards, officials said the five went to McDonald's to eat. White was the father of four children, according to his obituary. \\"I just don't understand how somebody could just go out like that and think it's fun. I mean, you take somebody's child away from them. You take their father away from them. You take their brother away from them,\\" said Kenny White, victim's father. He said the punishment is a far cry from the pain and suffering his family has had to endure. \\"They can't give it the way I want it. So we'll just go with what they got to do with it. You know what I'm saying? I can't give them enough punishment. You know, because even if they spend 30 years in prison, they get to wake up every single day. They still get phone calls from their parents. They still get visitors. My son don't get none of that no more. That was taken away from him for something stupid,\\" Kenny White said. A judge denied bail for all five teenagers. They are set to appear in court again on Nov. 2. \\"It's a murder case and there was no anticipation that anybody was going to be let out today,\\" said Frank Manley, defense attorney. Manley is representing Mark Sekelsky. He cautions the community against painting all of the teens with the same brush. \\"Although the charges are the same, the kids are all different. The actions that the kids may have become involved in are all different. So even though the charges were read exactly the same, my anticipation is that there will be a distinction once the evidence comes forward,\\" Manley said. Manley said the fact that a man lost his life weighs heavy on the Sekelsky family. \\"I can only speak to the parents of my child who are devastated,\\" Manley said. All five of the teenagers attended Clio High School. Clio Area Schools Superintendent Fletcher Spears III released this statement on Oct. 24 regarding the incident: Clio Area Schools joins with the entire community in expressing our heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of Kenneth White in the wake of his tragic death on October 18, 2017. This is an extremely difficult time for our entire community. Whether we knew Mr. White, those who are being charged and their families, or have driven this same stretch of road countless times, many of us have a personal connection with this senseless tragedy. This is a stark reminder that we need to impress upon all of our young people that actions have consequences: and sometimes those consequences can be tragic. Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with Mr. White’s family, as well as his many friends during this difficult time. As a District, we are also working to provide support to those in our school and community who have been impacted by this tragedy. Due to privacy requirements, imposed by federal law, we cannot provide any information regarding the students involved. Why would somebody do this? TV5 spoke to a psychotherapist about why the teenagers would do something like this. \\"Thinking wow that teenagers can get to that point where they lose their focus of what really are intended consequences of the choices that they're playing,\\" Dr. Thomas Haller said. Haller has been a psychotherapist for more than 20 years. He said something like this is typically the result of mob mentality. \\"Everything is focused through this filter of what will my friends think and how will they view what I'm doing or not doing. And so they lose the focus of outside and how it's affecting somebody else,\\" Haller said. Haller hopes this case will encourage parents to talk to their teens about peer pressure. \\"You have to help yourself stay true to you and not play to the notion that I have to have my friends like everything I do,\\" Haller said.

His teacher alerts astronomer Dr. Marcus Wolf, who realizes that the object is a comet on a collision course with Earth. Wolf dies in a car accident before he can alert the world.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose resting or sleeping happens, how will it affect the person is infected with more bacteria. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Resting or sleeping can have both direct and indirect effects on a person infected with bacteria. While sleep itself won't eliminate bacteria, it plays a critical role in the overall function of the immune system and the body's ability to respond to infections. Here's an explanation of how rest or sleep may affect the process of bacterial infection: 1. Direct effects: a) Improved immune response: Sleep has been shown to improve the immune system's ability to respond to infections. During sleep, the body releases various cytokines - proteins that help regulate the immune system. These cytokines are crucial for fighting off infections and reducing inflammation. b) Enhanced recovery of damaged cells: During deep sleep stages, the body increases the production of growth hormone, which aids in cell repair and regeneration. This process can be helpful in repairing cells damaged by bacterial toxins. c) Improved emotional well-being: Chronic stress can impair immune function and increase susceptibility to infections. Rest and sleep can help alleviate stress, which in turn may benefit a person's overall immune health. 2. Indirect effects: a) Supporting overall health: Rest and sleep play a crucial role in maintaining overall health, including metabolism regulation, mental health, and cardiovascular health. All of these factors contribute to a person's ability to fight off infections. b) Encouraging healthy habits: Getting adequate rest and sleep can lead to healthier lifestyle choices, such as regular exercise and a well-balanced diet, all of which can indirectly boost immune function and support the body in fighting infections. While resting or sleeping is an essential part of recovery and maintaining overall health, it is not a direct weapon against bacterial infections. A person with a bacterial infection should seek appropriate medical care and follow their healthcare provider's recommendations, which may include the use of antibiotics or other treatments, in conjunction with a healthy lifestyle and adequate rest."},{"instruction":"A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person that the hooker steal a car from?, using the article: Dave Walsh is a bank employee whose day begins badly when he gets fired from his dream job and dumped by his fiancée Sara Goodwin the day after their engagement party was crashed by his best friend, Jack.

This has primarily been driven by growing concerns about the environment, animal welfare, and health. Many studies have highlighted the advantages of plant-based diets in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, preserving biodiversity, and lowering the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, obesity, and type-2 diabetes. On the other hand, critics argue that plant-based diets may lead to nutritional deficiencies and may not be as enjoyable or fulfilling as a traditional diet including animal products. Hypothesis: A well-planned plant-based diet can provide adequate nutrition, improve overall health, and significantly reduce the environmental impact of food production, resulting in a more sustainable and healthier lifestyle for individuals who adopt it. To support this hypothesis, the following points can be further investigated and discussed: 1. Nutritional adequacy: Research on the availability of essential nutrients in plant-based diets, including protein, iron, calcium, and vitamin B12, and methods to ensure they are consumed in sufficient quantities. 2. Health benefits: Review of studies linking plant-based diets to improved health outcomes, such as reduced risk of chronic diseases, increased longevity, and enhanced immune function. 3. Environmental sustainability: Analysis of the environmental advantages of plant-based diets in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, land and water use, and preservation of biodiversity. 4. Accessibility and affordability: Examination of the availability and cost of plant-based foods in different regions, as well as the influence of social and cultural factors in the adoption of plant-based diets. 5. Enjoyment and satisfaction: Evaluation of strategies and resources for maintaining a satisfying, diverse, and enjoyable plant-based diet, including recipes, meal plans, and support networks.

In the event of an overbooking situation, our airline commits to treating all passengers fairly, in accordance with both the applicable guidelines set forth by the US Department of Transport and our own internal policies and procedures for assigning boarding priority. To handle each unique circumstance in the most equitable manner possible, we closely follow Part 250 of US Department of Transport regulations, which specifically addresses the rights of bumped passengers. There are several steps involved in managing an overbooking situation. First and foremost, we strive to accommodate all passengers by seeking volunteers who are amenable to changing their travel plans in exchange for certain incentives. Such offers might include an alternative flight, ticket vouchers, or other benefits that would appeal to the affected individual. By approaching the issue in this manner, we hope to minimize any inconvenience or disruption to our valued customers, while still ensuring that everyone is treated equitably. If, however, we are unable to secure enough volunteers, it may become necessary to involuntarily deny boarding to some passengers. In these cases, we adhere strictly to our boarding priority policies and procedures, which consider a range of factors, such as passengers with special needs, families traveling together, and frequent flyers, among others. Through these guidelines, we are able to systematically assess each passenger's boarding priority and make impartial decisions about who may be bumped. Additionally, our airline recognizes its responsibility to provide appropriate compensation to passengers who have been denied boarding as a result of an overbooking scenario. We follow the US Department of Transport's rules outlined in Part 250, ensuring that affected passengers receive the required compensation, whether monetary or otherwise, based on the length of the delay and the ticket's proportion of the total journey. This measure is taken to mitigate the impact of the inconvenience experienced by the bumped passengers. In summary, our airline is committed to handling any overbooking situations that may arise with the utmost fairness and consistency, keeping in line with both Part 250 of US Department of Transport regulations and our own policies and procedures governing boarding priority.

First, let us consider the ingredients and preparation of sangria. Sangria is traditionally a Spanish beverage made by combining red wine, chopped fruit, a sweetener such as sugar or honey, and a small amount of liquor (commonly brandy). In some variations, it may also include sparkling water or soda to provide fizz. This mixture of ingredients creates a fruity, sweet, and mildly alcoholic drink that has an invigorating flavor profile perfect for warm weather. Consequently, the inherent qualities of sangria align with the sought-after characteristics of a beverage well-suited for hot environments. Secondly, the premise itself states that sangria serves as a \\"thirst-quenching refresher\\". Generally, the concept of refreshment is linked to beverages and foods that deliver satisfying, cooling, and rejuvenating effects. In the case of sangria, it is typically served cold or over ice, contributing to its refreshment properties. This cool temperature, combined with the light and fruity nature of the beverage, adds further support to the hypothesis that sangria is well-suited for hot environments where thirst-quenching refreshments are in high demand. Additionally, it is important to consider the cultural context in which sangria typically appears. As a beverage originating from Spain, which is a region known for its hot and sunny Mediterranean climate, sangria has cultural roots in a warm-weather locale. Spain, and its neighboring country Portugal, have an extensive history of enjoying sangria during social gatherings, parties, and outdoor events held in sunny, warm environments. Therefore, sangria is already intrinsically linked to hot environments through its cultural origins and traditional consumption contexts. Finally, it is crucial to underline that the premise specifies the popularity of sangria as a refresher \\"especially in summer.\\" This statement inherently bolsters the hypothesis, as it underlines the connection between sangria and hot environments. Summer is characterized by warm temperatures and sunny days, consequently supporting the idea that sangria is a beverage perfectly suited for such climates. Taking all these factors into account, it becomes clear that the hypothesis \\"Sangria is suited for hot environments\\" is indeed true. The unique combination of ingredients, refreshing properties, cultural context, and the explicit association with summertime all provide strong evidence for the suitability of sangria as a thirst-quenching refresher in hot environments."},{"instruction":"Q:Title: Perelman misguided Review: I think this book fails because Perelman doesn't understand what education is.

Possible A: winch, ship, ground, construction site, suspension bridge Why is \\"ship\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"The term \\"marine grade\\" typically refers to materials that are designed to resist corrosion from the sea or saltwater. This is an essential characteristic for materials used in maritime environments, as saltwater is highly corrosive, and prolonged exposure can severely degrade most materials. Hence, you'd potentially need \\"marine grade steel cable\\" aboard your ship, as ships spend most of their operational time in seawater and thus need materials that can stand up to this harsh environment. On a ship, the steel cable can be used in various components and mechanisms such as anchoring, mooring, towing, or lifting. While it is possible to use marine-grade steel on winches, construction sites, or suspension bridges, the phrase \\"aboard your..\\" hints towards a mode of transport, further leading towards a ship as the correct common-sense answer given the choices. On the other hand, the terms \\"ground\\" and \\"construction site\\" generally do not align well as transport uses. Using marine-grade steel cable on a suspension bridge might not be a wrong idea, especially if the bridge is in a coastal area, but the term \\"aboard\\", which refers to being on or in a vehicle (i.e., a ship, plane, or vehicle), makes \\"ship\\" the most suitable answer."},{"instruction":"How is Mahatma Gandhi viewed in Europe and USA?

Following Egypt's defeat by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War, Nasser resigned, but he returned to office after popular demonstrations called for his reinstatement.

Most of the population is Jola. The Jola are very distinct from other major ethnic groups in Senegal by their language, egalitarian society, freedom from political hierarchy, and lack of slavery. Their traditions have persevered because of their independent spirit as well as their geographical isolation. This ethnic group accounts for 80 to 90% of the residents of Basse Casamance, but only 6 to 8% of the total population of Senegal. They are the largest ethnic group in Carabane, followed by Wolofs, Lebous, and Serers (including Niominka fishermen). Manjacks also live on the island, some of whom came from Saint-Louis and Gorée at the time of the first colonization. Two communities from neighbouring countries, one from Guinea (the Susu people) and the other from Guinea-Bissau, have settled on the other side of the island at a distance from the village. There are also seasonal workers who come to fish: Ghanaians, Guineans, and Gambians.The indigenous population was originally animist, but while the fetishes and sacred groves dedicated to initiation rites such as boukout survive as cultural icons of Casamance, the monotheistic belief systems of Catholicism and Islam have become the most widely held in Carabane.

The Jola account for 80 to 90% of Basse Casamance's population and 6 to 8% of Senegal's total population. Their traditions have persevered because of their independent spirit and geographical isolation. 2. Wolofs: The Wolofs are the second-largest ethnic group in Carabane. They are part of the larger Senegalese population and follow Islam as their religion. Wolof and Serer fishermen have been practicing Islam since the 19th century. 3. Lebous: The Lebous are another significant ethnic group in Carabane. Although the article does not provide extensive details about them, they are mentioned as one of the major groups in the area. 4.

If I do bad freshman year and do good sophomore year how do colleges look at that? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Possible answers: 1. no. 2. yes.","output":"1. no. While both questions are related to college admissions and the consideration of grades from various years of high school, the two questions are not paraphrases of each other. They focus on different aspects of the college admissions process. Let's break down the questions and analyze their differences. Question 1: \\"Do colleges look at freshman grades?\\" This question aims to find out whether or not colleges consider grades from a student's freshman year when reviewing applications. The main concern here is about the importance of these specific grades in college admissions decisions. Answer: Yes, colleges do look at freshman grades during the admissions process. The degree of importance given to these grades might vary among colleges and universities, but generally, freshman year performance is a part of the overall evaluation along with grades from other high school years. Admissions officers look for trends in academic performance, potential growth, and the student's capacity for improvement as they review academic records. High school transcripts provide a more comprehensive picture of a student's academic accomplishments, thereby highlighting their strengths and achievements over the four-year period. Question 2: \\"If I do bad freshman year and do good sophomore year how do colleges look at that?\\" This question focuses on a particular scenario where a student's academic performance differs significantly between freshman and sophomore years. The main concern here is understanding how colleges would perceive this change in academic performance and whether it will have any impact on their chances of admission. Answer: If there is a noticeable improvement in your academic performance from freshman to sophomore year, colleges will likely view it in a positive light. Demonstrating growth and the ability to bounce back from a rough start can be beneficial in the college admissions process. Admissions officers tend to appreciate resilience, determination, and hard work. However, it is essential to maintain a strong academic record throughout your high school career, as consistency in performance is generally valued by college admissions committees. Doing well in your remaining junior and senior years and continuing the upward trend in academic performance will strengthen your application and demonstrate your commitment to achieving academic success. In conclusion, while both questions are related to the weight of high school grades in college admissions, they tackle different aspects. The first question asks about the consideration of freshman grades, while the second question focuses on the implications of varying grade patterns across different years. Therefore, the two questions are not paraphrases of each other."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

His working visit to China and discussions with Oinghua students \\"help promote\\" Sino-U.S. relations, Bush said in response to a student's question about what he would do to promote Sino-U.S. relations. \\"Many people in my country are very interested in China,\\" he said, adding that these Americans have learned more about China's culture and the Chinese people. He said that he would keep encouraging such contacts and exchanges between the two countries. Bush said that he would describe back home what he has seen here and that China as a great nation not only has a \\"great history\\" but also an \\"unbelievably exciting future.\\" The president said that the 2008 Olympic Games would make a significant opportunity for the rest of the world to understand China, which enables more people to come to China and feel the modernization taking place, and many more people will see it on the television.

Which one is it? Options: - Sentence A: \\"though he's deaf, he often reads books\\" - Sentence B: \\"though he's blind, he often reads books\\" Reason slowly and give your answer.","output":"Sentence B: \\"though he's blind, he often reads books\\" is the nonsensical option in its literal interpretation. Reasoning: Sentence A states that a deaf person often reads books. There is no contradiction here because deafness affects the hearing ability, not the ability to read. Deaf people can read books just as well as hearing people can. Sentence B, however, implies that a blind person often reads books. This sentence appears to be nonsensical at first because blindness affects an individual's ability to see, which should hinder their ability to read traditional printed books. However, it's worth mentioning that blind people can still access literature through alternative formats such as braille (tactile reading system) or audiobooks."},{"instruction":"Article: When you know what type you are, you can begin to understand how you might fit into the world around you. If you're an INTJ and you're a salesman, you might be rethinking your line of work! There are plenty of everyday uses for this test. Consider it when you're learning. How do you take in and perceive facts and concepts? Consider it in your relationships. How do you mix with other personality types? Consider it for personal growth. Knowing your tendencies is the only way you can recognize them and begin branching out. Or harnessing your power! No single personality type is superior to another. The MBTI seeks to identify natural preferences, not abilities. When determining your type, look at it from the perspective of what you tend to do, not what you think you should do. Recognizing your own preferences is a useful tool in self-development. This is a fascinating concept -- quite clearly a trendy, fascinating concept: millions of people take it every year. So get to asking your friends! It may even help you relate to each other. An ESFJ and an INTP might make for an interesting conversation when it comes to personality type. Find people who are different than you and sit down to talk about the test. And find someone who is the same -- did you know you were the same or were you surprised? Sometimes it's hard to tell. If you're unhappy with your results, don't sweat it. This is a very prominent test, yes, but there is so much more to you than your MBTI results. It's like saying, \\"Oh. You're an Aquarius, huh? You'll never be punctual and caring!\\" No. It doesn't work like that. And in fact, your results may fluctuate throughout your life. That's partly because your environment determines a lot about you.

Take a wheat grass or chlorophyll supplement. Eliminate stress Try a detox Stay hydrated Exercise regularly Consult your doctor if body odor is a permanent problem.","output":"Title: Improving Gut Health to Reduce Body Odor: A Comprehensive Guide Introduction Body odor is an issue that can affect anyone and make social interactions uncomfortable. Over time, it can significantly impact one's self-confidence. What most people don't realize is that the source of body odor often lies within our own bodies, particularly in our gut. In this article, we will explore different ways to promote gut health and ultimately combat unpleasant body odors. 1. Try Wheatgrass or Chlorophyll Supplements Wheatgrass and chlorophyll are natural supplements that have been found to promote gut health and help reduce body odor. Wheatgrass is a rich source of vitamins, minerals, and enzymes that aid in the detoxification process. Chlorophyll, on the other hand, is a green pigment found in plants that helps improve digestion by increasing the production of beneficial gut bacteria. Incorporating these supplements into your daily routine can have a significant impact on eliminating unpleasant odors. 2. Reduce Stress Stress can have a negative impact on gut health, resulting in an imbalance of gut bacteria, leading to body odor. Engaging in activities that reduce stress, such as yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises, can help maintain a healthy gut bacteria balance and prevent body odor. 3. Detoxify Your Body Toxins in your body can contribute to bad odors. Incorporating a detox plan can help eliminate these toxins and keep your gut healthy. Detoxifying can be as simple as incorporating more fresh fruits and vegetables into your diet or trying out juice cleansing programs. It is essential to consult your doctor before starting a detox program to ensure it is safe and effective for you. 4. Stay Hydrated Drinking plenty of water throughout the day is crucial in maintaining gut health. Water helps flush out toxins and waste from your body, keeping the digestive system functioning optimally. A well-hydrated body is less likely to produce offensive odors, as the toxins are effectively eliminated. 5. Exercise Regularly Incorporating regular exercise into your routine promotes overall health, reduces stress, and keeps your digestive system functioning well. When you exercise, you sweat, which is a natural detoxification process that removes toxins from your body and keeps the gut healthy. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise per day to experience these benefits. 6. Consult Your Doctor If body odor becomes a persistent problem despite trying these natural remedies, it is important to consult your doctor. Your healthcare provider can help determine any underlying causes and offer personalized solutions to address the issue. Conclusion In conclusion, body odor is often a reflection of our internal health, particularly gut health. Through focusing on improving your gut health with supplements, reducing stress, detoxification, staying hydrated, exercising regularly, and consulting your doctor when necessary, you can tackle body odor and feel more confident in social situations. Remember to always consult your doctor before starting any new health routine to ensure safety and effectiveness."},{"instruction":"Q: Given an trivia question precisely answer the question with a word/phrase/name.

It was recognised as the Royal County of Berkshire because of the presence of Windsor Castle by the Queen in 1957 and letters patent issued in 1974. Berkshire is a county of historic origin and is a home county, a ceremonial county and a non-metropolitan county without a county council. Berkshire County Council was the main county governance from 1889 to 1998 except for the separately administered County Borough of Reading. - Gentry (from Old French \\"genterie\\", from \\"gentil\\", \\"high-born, noble\\") are \\"well-born, genteel and well-bred people\\" of high social class, especially in the past. \\"Gentry\\", in its widest connotation, refers to people of good social position connected to landed estates (see manorialism), upper levels of the clergy, and \\"gentle\\" families of long descent who never obtained the official right to bear a coat of arms. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - The River Thames is a river that flows through southern England. At , it is the longest river entirely in England and the second longest in the United Kingdom, after the River Severn. It also flows through Oxford (where it is called Isis), Reading, Henley-on-Thames and Windsor. The lower reaches of the river are called the Tideway, derived from its long tidal reach up to Teddington Lock. It rises at Thames Head in Gloucestershire, and flows into the North Sea via the Thames Estuary. The Thames drains the whole of Greater London. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Maidenhead is a large town and unparished area in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, in Berkshire, England. It lies south of the River Thames, but at Maidenhead, the river runs north-south and so the town is in fact on its west bank. The town has a population in 2011 of 67,404. Its urban area (including the adjoining suburban villages of Bray, Holyport, Pinkneys Green, Taplow (Buckinghamshire) Cox Green, White Waltham and Woodlands Park) has a population of just under 90,000. The mainline railway station was set to be the terminus of the Crossrail line until the announcement was made that Reading was to be the new terminus. - A great hall is the main room of a royal palace, nobleman's castle or a large manor house or hall house in the Middle Ages, and continued to be built in the country houses of the 16th and early 17th centuries, although by then the family used the great chamber for eating and relaxing. At that time the word \\"great\\" simply meant big, and had not acquired its modern connotations of excellence. In the medieval period the room would simply have been referred to as the \\"hall\\", unless the building also had a secondary hall, but the term \\"great hall\\" has been predominant for surviving rooms of this type for several centuries, to distinguish them from the different type of hall found in post-medieval houses. Great halls were found especially in France, England and Scotland, but similar rooms were also found in some other European countries. - Letters patent (always in the plural) are a type of legal instrument in the form of a published written order issued by a monarch, president, or other head of state, generally granting an office, right, monopoly, title, or status to a person or corporation. Letters patent can be used for the creation of corporations or government offices, or for the granting of city status or a coat of arms. Letters patent are issued for the appointment of representatives of the Crown, such as governors and governors-general of Commonwealth realms, as well as appointing a Royal Commission. In the United Kingdom they are also issued for the creation of peers of the realm. A particular form of letters patent has evolved into the modern patent (referred to as a utility patent or design patent in United States patent law) granting exclusive rights in an invention (or a design in the case of a design patent). In this case it is essential that the written grant should be in the form of a public document so other inventors can consult it to avoid infringement and also to understand how to \\"practice\\" the invention, i.e., put it into practical use. - The manorial courts were the lowest courts of law in England during the feudal period. They had a civil jurisdiction limited both in subject matter and geography. They dealt with matters over which the lord of the manor had jurisdiction, primarily torts, local contracts and land tenure, and their powers only extended to those who lived within the lands of the manor: the demesne and such lands as the lord had enfeoffed to others, and to those who held land therein. Historians have divided manorial courts into those that were primarily seignorial based on feudal responsibilities and those based on separate delegation of authority from the monarch. There were three types of manorial court: the court of the honour; the court baron; and the court customary, also known as the halmote court. - In England, an unparished area is an area that is not covered by a civil parish (a small administrative division of local government, not to be confused with an ecclesiastical parish). Most urbanised districts of England are either entirely or partly unparished. Many towns and some cities in otherwise rural districts are also unparished areas and therefore no longer have a town council or city council. Some cities and towns which are unparished areas in larger districts (i.e. not districts of themselves) have charter trustees to maintain a historic charter, such as city status (an example being in Bath) or simply the mayoralty of a town. - In England, a civil parish is a territorial designation which is the lowest tier of local government below districts and counties, or their combined form, the unitary authority.

Historically, a parish often covered the same geographical area as a manor (its association with the parish church remaining paramount). - A non-metropolitan county, or colloquially, shire county, is a county-level entity in England that is not a metropolitan county. The counties typically have populations of 300,000 to 1.4 million. The term \\"shire county\\" is, however, an unofficial usage.

The economics books Marx was reading at the time can be seen in the library, as can the window seat where Marx and Engels would meet. The first Trades Union Congress was held in Manchester (at the Mechanics' Institute, David Street), from 2 to 6 June 1868. Manchester was an important cradle of the Labour Party and the Suffragette Movement.At that time, it seemed a place in which anything could happen—new industrial processes, new ways of thinking (the Manchester School, promoting free trade and laissez-faire), new classes or groups in society, new religious sects, and new forms of labour organisation. It attracted educated visitors from all parts of Britain and Europe. A saying capturing this sense of innovation survives today: \\"What Manchester does today, the rest of the world does tomorrow.\\" Manchester's golden age was perhaps the last quarter of the 19th century. Many of the great public buildings (including Manchester Town Hall) date from then. The city's cosmopolitan atmosphere contributed to a vibrant culture, which included the Hallé Orchestra. In 1889, when county councils were created in England, the municipal borough became a county borough with even greater autonomy. Although the Industrial Revolution brought wealth to the city, it also brought poverty and squalor to a large part of the population. Historian Simon Schama noted that \\"Manchester was the very best and the very worst taken to terrifying extremes, a new kind of city in the world; the chimneys of industrial suburbs greeting you with columns of smoke\\". An American visitor taken to Manchester's blackspots saw \\"wretched, defrauded, oppressed, crushed human nature, lying and bleeding fragments\\".The number of cotton mills in Manchester itself... answer the following question: What were five new things that were happening in Manchester at the time?

New ways of thinking: The Manchester School emerged, promoting free trade and laissez-faire economic policies. 3. New classes or groups in society: The industrial growth in Manchester led to the emergence of new social classes and groups, including the working class and the industrial bourgeoisie. 4. New religious sects: Manchester's diverse and rapidly changing population contributed to the rise of various religious sects in the city. 5. New forms of labor organization: With the growth of the working class, new forms of labor organization emerged, such as trade unions.

Options: - health - skin irritation - park - become wet - dry skin Let's think now! Step-by-step reasoning:","output":"Washing hands after certain activities is highly recommended because it helps maintain good hygiene and prevents the spread of germs and illnesses. Therefore, keeping up this habit can keep you in good health. Step-by-step reasoning: 1. Washing hands frequently is a good habit that can help remove dirt, germs, and bacteria from our hands. 2. These germs and bacteria can cause infections and diseases if they enter our body through our mouth, nose, or eyes, or if we touch something contaminated and then touch our face. 3. By washing hands regularly, especially after certain activities like using the bathroom, handling raw food, or touching surfaces in public spaces, we can reduce the chance of coming into contact with these harmful germs and bacteria. 4. Reducing the likelihood of coming into contact with germs and bacteria means we are less likely to experience illnesses and infections. 5.

Answer the above question based on the context below: After the breakup of the Pixies, Santiago went into a depression for the first couple of years but remained on good terms with bandmate Black Francis (who soon adopted the name Frank Black). Black, who was recording his 1993 debut album, Frank Black, contacted Santiago to ask whether he would contribute lead guitar. Santiago agreed, and he and Mallari drove from their home in Florida to Los Angeles. The couple ended up moving into Black's old apartment in L.A. on a whim. Santiago played lead guitar on a number of Frank Black's solo albums, including Teenager of the Year (1994), and contributed lead guitar to Steve Westfield's 1994 album Mangled. He also formed The Martinis a year later with Mallari. Their recorded output by the end of the 1990s comprised a single song, the self-recorded \\"Free\\" (1995), which appeared on the film soundtrack of Empire Records. The band played live only occasionally until 2001.In the mid-1990s, Santiago began to explore audio editing software. After composing for several independent films, including Crime and Punishment in Suburbia in 2000 (where he collaborated again with Black), Santiago co-scored the Fox Network TV series Undeclared with Michael Andrews. He continued to contribute lead guitar to albums, collaborating with Charles Douglas on his 2004 album Statecraft.

Jean continued, \\"The technology to do this film really wasn't even around five years ago. For example, there was this joke I once pitched and David Silverman, the director, started drawing and as I was pitching it, it went into the film and it was cut a day later.

It feels like plenty, but apparently it's not nearly enough. After years of suffering headaches and poor digestion I spoke to a neurologist about my regular headaches and a nutritionist about my poor digestion, and both told me I should be drinking up to three liters of liquid a day for my body to function at its best. I decided to conduct an experiment. What would happen if I drank the recommended amount every day for a month? The photograph of me taken the day I started this trial demonstrates perfectly and rather frighteningly what a lack of hydration does to a face. I am 42, but have to admit I look more like 52 in this picture, which is shocking. There are dark shadows under and around my eyes, which make me look exhausted, a profusion of wrinkles and strange reddish blotches, and my skin lacks any luster . It looks dead.

According to the Statewide University Police Association union, the veteran officer could be fired because he refused to use his Taser on a student out of fear for the student's health. VIDEO: CSU Monterey Bay officer refused to shoot student with Taser SUPA President Jeff Solomon said terminating an college campus officer who put a student's safety first is inexplicable. The student and officers were not injured during the incident. \\"Our officer said and felt that there was no need for the level of force that was applied, and my understanding was that's why he didn't deploy his Taser,\\" Solomon said. Marina police, however, said that's not what happened, and claim the officer \\"froze.\\" According to police reports, the incident happened in February on Petersburg Court. The CSUMB officer and three Marina police officers responded to a call about a suicidal student. Solomon said the CSUMB officer successfully defused the situation and was able to help the student calm down. He left to get the student a cup of water after the student asked for one. While he was gone, the three Marina police officers began physically restraining the student, the student became distraught again, and the Marina officers told the returning CSUMB officer to use his Taser, Solomon said. The officer refused. The lack of action prompted Marina police to file a \\"failure to act\\" complaint. Marina Police Chief Edmundo Rodriguez said the failure to act is what led the Marina police to have to intervene. Rodriguez said the student had a knife and was non-compliant. Solomon said he believes the Marina police made the complaint out of fear of their own actions. The student's father told SUPA, \\"It defies logic and is extremely disappointing that, at a time when law enforcement is under fire for using more force than necessary, an officer is being terminated for attempting to use civilized methods to resolve a situation.\\" The university's spokeswoman said she can't comment on the pending investigation, but said the case is \\"more complex\\" than what was detailed in the SUPA press release. The officer, whose name has not been released, is a 20-year law enforcement veteran who has been with the University Police for the past eight years. SUPA said this is his first disciplinary offense. ||||| Stun gun (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto) A California State University Monterey Bay police officer is on paid administration leave because he declined to tase a reportedly suicidal student, the officer’s union said. Marina police — which also responded and filed the complaint — said the officer in actuality froze, standing silent while three Marina officers struggled with the student. On Thursday, both agencies pointed to the other alleging, respectively, excessive force and lacking action. The news comes amid fresh protests spurred by officer-involved fatalities across the country. In the past two weeks, grand juries have failed to indict a pair of white officers who killed Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, with a gun; and Eric Garner in New York City with a chokehold. Both were black men. In Salinas, four Latino men were killed this year by Salinas police officers, none of whom have Latino surnames. Tension mounted and spilled over in May following the death of Carlos Mejia, who was wielding a pair of pruning shears when officers fatally shot him. A man was killed nearby during an ensuing protest and an officer trying to help him was hospitalized after a thrown bottle knocked him out cold. Back in February, however, the CSUMB officer didn’t use his Taser, according to Jeff Solomon, Statewide University Police Association president. SUPA represents all CSU police officers. On that point, Marina Police Chief Edmundo Rodriguez can agree. “He just stood there,” Rodriguez said. But from there the accounts of the February incident on Petersburg Court somewhat diverge. According to Solomon, the CSUMB officer — a 20-year law enforcement veteran — arrived solo to a report of a suicidal man at the campus housing building on Petersburg Court. There, he found a man suffering a mental health crisis, Solomon said. “[The student] had superficial cuts to his arms and wrist,” Solomon said. “But we have very specific training in crisis intervention and our officer was able to talk him down.” Rodriguez, on the other hand, said the CSUMB officer initially declined assistance from Marina police but later asked their help in forcing entry to the apartment. Walking into the room, the officers encountered a bloody scene, Rodriguez said. “We saw blood everywhere,” he said. “On the carpet, on the floor. His wrists had been slashed. There was a bloody knife on the floor and a hammer on the bed.” Scorched marks on the sweatshirt the man was wearing led the Marina officers to believe he’d tried to set himself on fire, Rodriguez said. Although there were knives spread throughout the house, the student was no longer armed, Solomon said. “[The officer] got him to sit on the bed, [the student] wasn’t confrontational,” Solomon said. But the knife was still unsecured, Rodriguez emphasized. Solomon said the CSUMB officer then obliged the man’s request for a glass of water. Mid-errand, the man stood up and asked the CSUMB officer to hurry, Solomon said. Rodriguez, however, said the CSUMB officer actually left the room to either take or make a phone call. Doing so put the Marina officers in the awkward position of having to “take over” an incident that properly belonged to the CSUMB officer. When the CSUMB officer returned he found the three Marina officers struggling with the student. Solomon blamed the Marina police officers for “escalating the situation,” whereas Rodriguez claimed they were trying to prevent the man from accessing the knife or leaving the room. “He was already a danger to himself,” Rodriguez said. All three Marina police officers then fired their Tasers, Solomon said. Once the Taser cartridges were expelled, the officers then “dry stunned” the student — applying the Taser gun directly to his body. Solomon described the man as “150 pounds soaking wet.” When ordered to use his Taser, the CSUMB officer refused, but turned the device over to a Marina sergeant for use, Solomon said. Ultimately, the student wasn’t injured in the struggle, he said. Rodriguez said he doesn’t know whether the CSUMB officer turned his Taser over to the Marina sergeant. That would be strange, he added. “He was just standing there,” Rodriguez said. “One officer was pleading with him to engage, to help them.” Eventually, the three Marina officers were able to subdue the student and call emergency responders to assist, Rodriguez said. Since then, the man hasn’t again attempted to hurt himself. Both Solomon and the CSUMB officer took issue with the Marina response. “Generally, when one tool isn’t working, you usually move on to something else,” Solomon said. “There were four officers there. ... This doesn’t pass the smell test for us.” Following the incident, the CSUMB officer called the Marina sergeant to protest the action inside the student’s dorm room, Solomon said. Shortly after, Marina police filed a complaint and asked for an investigation into the officer’s “failure to act.” Marina officers on scene included a sergeant, a corporal and an officer. Together they have 32 years’ experience, Rodriguez said. If SUPA hadn’t alleged excessive force by Marina police, Rodriguez said he likely wouldn’t have commented for the media. On Thursday, he defended the Marina officers’ actions and questioned why the union waited 10 months after the incident to make their grievances public. “I get that they’re trying to save this officer’s job, but they did it at the expense of impugning the reputation of police officers they don’t even know,” he said. CSUMB police officials never alleged excessive force, Rodriguez said. Because of a good working relationship between the two agencies, Rodriguez said he thought his counterpart at CSUMB would have apprised him of any concerns. Ultimately, Rodriguez said he was “blindsided” by SUPA’s allegations and remained confident in his officers’ actions. University officials largely declined comment, citing the ongoing personnel investigation. Joan Weiner, public information officer, did note “this case is much more complex than what was conveyed in the press release.” The CSUMB officer in question has nine years’ experience on the Monterey Bay campus. He’s never been disciplined, Solomon said. Now, he faces potential termination. In the wake of notable officer-involved deaths in Ferguson, Cleveland, Ohio, and New York, N.Y., Solomon said he was shocked by Marina’s complaint. “We have an officer who showed incredible restraint in a very difficult situation,” he said. “He had it handled. The situation had all but been resolved when the other officers escalated it.” Solomon added, “We have an officer who did everything right and he’s not being supported.” Follow Allison Gatlin on Twitter @allison_salnews #salinas.

They have noticed that these birds consistently build their nests at a specific height above the ground. This particular height seems ideal for the Blue Pikono's survival, as the nests are well protected from predators and are within easy reach of food sources. Hypothesis: The Blue Pikono has evolved adaptively to build nests at the ideal height above the ground to maximize its chances of survival and reproduction. Justification for this hypothesis: 1. Observing the behavior: By observing the consistent pattern of nest building among the Blue Pikono birds, it indicates that this behavior might be influenced by certain factors that make it adaptive for these birds to build their nests at the ideal height. 2. Considering their environment: We are analyzing the specific environment in which the Blue Pikono primarily resides, such as the dense rainforest, which may contribute to their preference for the observed height. 3. Predators and food sources: In the process of natural selection, the ability to avoid predators and access food resources efficiently are essential for the survival of any species. By taking into account the observed height of the nest related to these factors, we can hypothesize that the Blue Pikono's nesting habits have evolved as part of their adaptive behavior."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Pick one category for the following text.

This task involves various stages and consideration of multiple physical objects to ensure the final product is both functional and aesthetically pleasing. Stage 1: Design and planning Knowledge of physical objects is essential in designing the chair, as the designer needs to understand materials and their properties. Wood, for instance, is a commonly used material for constructing chairs due to its strength, durability, and ease of woodworking. The design process also requires knowledge of human ergonomics to create a chair that is comfortable and supportive of various body types. Additionally, specific tools, such as a ruler and pencil, will need to be used to prepare precise diagrams and sketches of the chair design. Stage 2: Material selection The next stage involves selecting suitable materials for the chair’s construction, such as deciding on the type of wood and other elements like seating material (e.g., leather or fabric). Choosing the right wood is essential, as each type has specific properties concerning strength, durability, appearance, and ease of use. For example, hardwoods like oak and maple are strong and durable, making them suitable for chair frames, whereas softer woods like pine are easier to work with but might be less suitable for heavyweight support. Stage 3: Measuring and cutting Physical objects like measuring tapes, rulers, and protractors are used to measure the wood pieces accurately and mark cutting lines. Knowledge of these objects is critical for obtaining precise measurements and angles, ensuring the chair components fit together correctly. Cutting typically involves tools like handsaws, circular saws, or jigsaws, which require understanding their mode of operation and safety measures. Stage 4: Joining and assembly Joining the cut pieces of wood together demands knowledge of various woodworking techniques (such as mortise and tenon joints or dovetail joints) and the appropriate tools like wood chisels, saws, hammers, and wood glue. Different components of the chair, like the legs, seat, backrest, and armrests, are joined together at this stage. The joinery must be strong and stable to ensure the chair can withstand the weight and daily usage without becoming wobbly or broken. Stage 5: Finishing Finally, finishing the chair requires knowledge and use of objects like sandpaper for smoothing rough edges, stains or paints for enhancing the chair’s appearance, and sealants like lacquer, varnish, or oil for protecting the wood from damage due to moisture and for easy cleaning. Depending on the selected materials for the seating part, an understanding of sewing or upholstery techniques and the corresponding tools (like fabric, foam, staples, and staple guns) may be necessary. In conclusion, constructing a wooden chair is a task that demands a thorough understanding of various physical objects, ranging from wood pieces, tools, and materials to techniques and safety precautions. Each stage of the process must be executed with precision and care, ultimately resulting in a functional, comfortable, and appealing piece of furniture."},{"instruction":"After a tough win over the Texans, the Steelers stayed home for a game against the Colts.

The highway of hope had great sound effects. Possible answers: (a). Yes. (b). It's impossible to say. (c). No.","output":"(c). No. The Highway of Hope is a silent film from the year 1917, which means that there was no synchronized recorded sound used in the film. Instead, music was usually played live accompanying the screenings. Sound effects as we understand them today were not present in silent films, as the technology to incorporate synchronized recorded sound had not yet been developed. Silent films often relied heavily on text intertitles to convey dialogue and story elements. Accompanied by live music, whether it be an orchestra, a small ensemble, a pianist or an organist, silent films created a unique atmosphere that relied on visual storytelling, music, and text to engage the audience. The era of silent films laid the foundation for narrative and visual techniques that later contributed to the sound films we know today, but the absence of audible dialogue and sound effects in The Highway of Hope means that it did not have \\"great sound effects\\" as we understand the term now.

For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world. Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight.

Informativeness: The review contains only one word, \\"Well.\\" It does not provide any significant information or elaboration on the specific aspects or qualities of the product or service under review. As a user or potential customer, the review offers no insights or guidance. Thus, in terms of informativeness, it would fall on the lower end of the scale, most likely at 1. 2. Clarity: The one-word nature of this review makes it difficult to decipher the intent behind it. \\"Well\\" could be interpreted as an affirmation, satisfaction, or skepticism. Depending on the reviewer's tone, it may or may not provide a clear understanding of their experience. Due to the ambiguity, the review could be rated anywhere from a 1 to a 3 in terms of clarity. 3. Helpfulness: In terms of helpfulness, the review lacks descriptive feedback or examples to support the reviewer's opinion. It is hard to determine the aspects of the product or service they liked or disliked. A helpful review should allow readers to make an informed decision about whether or not to engage with the product based on the provided information. Therefore, in terms of helpfulness, this review would most likely receive a 1. Taking these factors into consideration, the overall rating of the review based on informativeness, clarity, and helpfulness would likely be closer to a 1 or potentially a 2 at best.

He’s treated as humorous, but Trump is still standing above the rest of the field. ||||| Editor’s Note: February 2, 2016 After speaking with two members of Dylann Roof’s family, The Intercept can no longer stand by the premise of this story. Both individuals said that they do not know of a cousin named Scott Roof. The problems with this story reflect a pattern of misattributed quotes that The Intercept uncovered in stories written by Juan Thompson, a former staff reporter. We apologize to our readers. DYLANN ROOF , the 21-year-old white supremacist accused of murdering nine black churchgoers at an historic church in Charleston, South Carolina, was captured Thursday morning, ending an extensive 14-hour search by federal and local law enforcement. Roof’s arrest brings some relief to a city and country on edge, following yet another mass shooting. Roof’s Facebook page, which has been deleted, showed a photo of him dressed in a black jacket adorned with symbols of the racist white regimes that ruled Rhodesia and South Africa. Dalton Tyler, Roof’s roommate, told ABC News that Roof spoke of starting a civil war and that he advocated racial separatism. “He was big into segregation and other stuff. He said he wanted to start a civil war. He said he was going to do something like that and then kill himself,” Tyler said. Scott Roof, who identified himself as Dylann Roof’s cousin, told me over the telephone that “Dylann was normal until he started listening to that white power music stuff.” He also claimed that “he kind of went over the edge when a girl he liked starting dating a black guy two years back.” This scenario recalls a manifesto written by Elliot Rodger, who on May 23, 2014 gunned down six people in Isla Vista, California: “How could an inferior, ugly black boy be able to get a white girl and not me?” “Dylann liked her,” Scott Roof said. “The black guy got her. He changed. I don’t know if we would be here if not …” Roof then abruptly hung up the phone. The Wall Street Journal reported that Roof’s family had grown concerned over the last two months as his racist views started to boil over. “He apparently told people that he was involved in groups, racist groups,” said a woman who identified herself as the mother of Roof’s former stepmother. “He turned into a loner in the last couple of years and no one knew why. He just fell off the grid somehow.” Roof’s uncle Charles Cowles told Reuters that Roof’s father, Ben, gave the alleged killer a .45 caliber pistol for his birthday earlier this year. Police have not disclosed what sort of firearm was used in the shootings. Roof was captured four hours away from Charleston, in Shelby, North Carolina, after a local florist spotted his car on the highway and alerted authorities. Meanwhile, Mashable obtained a SnapChat video that was recorded just moments before Roof allegedly opened fire on his victims. The short clip shows a Bible study group sitting around a table. At the far end is a white male who resembles Roof. The video was taken by Tywanza Sanders, 26, a recent college graduate who was among the nine people killed Wednesday night. The city of Charleston has multiple vigils planned this evening to remember those who were gunned down. “If we stay silent,” South Carolina congressman Jim Clyburn told a memorial service yesterday, “they win.” “They must not win.” Photo: Chuck Burton/AP ||||| The Intercept disclosed today that a former reporter for the national-security focused website fabricated quotes and invented sources for a number of stories published last year. According to a post published on Tuesday afternoon by editor-in-chief Betsy Reed, that reporter, Juan Thompson, went so far as to register fake email addresses, including one in Reed’s own name, to deceive his editors about the extent of his fabrications: An investigation into Thompson’s reporting turned up three instances in which quotes were attributed to people who said they had not been interviewed. In other instances, quotes were attributed to individuals we could not reach, who could not remember speaking with him, or whose identities could not be confirmed. In his reporting Thompson also used quotes that we cannot verify from unnamed people whom he claimed to have encountered at public events. Thompson went to great lengths to deceive his editors, creating an email account to impersonate a source and lying about his reporting methods. Shortly before Reed’s post, The Intercept prepended lengthy editor’s notes to five of Thompson’s prior articles. Four of the notes amount to severe corrections; the fifth, attached to an article containing quotes attributed to a cousin of the white supremacist Dylann Roof, indicates a total retraction: “After speaking with two members of Dylann Roof’s family, The Intercept can no longer stand by the premise of this story. Both individuals said that they do not know of a cousin named Scott Roof.” In the now-retracted article, Thompson had claimed that “Scott Roof” had speculated during a phone conversation that Dylann Roof may been driven to murder nine black churchgoers at a Charleston, South Carolina church because “he kind of went over the edge when a girl he liked starting dating a black guy two years back.” Thompson’s report was picked up by dozens of other news outlets. Thompson was hired by The Intercept’s founding editor-in-chief, John Cook, in November 2014. Reed replaced Cook, a former editor of Gawker.com and the current executive editor of Gawker Media, in December 2014. Prior to The Intercept, Thompson had reported in Chicago for DNAInfo and interned at the local NPR affiliate, WBEZ.* Based on his Twitter account, Thompson appears to be invested in the outcomes of other journalism controversies. In several tweets from last year, for example, he argued that former BuzzFeed editor Benny Johnson, who was fired for committing widespread plagiarism in the summer of 2014, would not have been been able to bounce back so quickly (to editor positions at National Review and the Independent Journal Review) if he were not white: White reporter commits plagiarism, moves on to bigger things. Whereas Blair is a pariah, this is white suprmcy. Yuck. http://t.co/c2zzs7EsUk — Juan M. Thompson (@JuanMThompson) June 9, 2015 .@bennyjohnson got fired for rank plagiarism. Get's on a boat, catches crab, & gets 2 job offerings. If I plagiarized I'm back on EBT. Yuck. — Juan M. Thompson (@JuanMThompson) June 9, 2015 Shortly after The Intercept’s note was published on Tuesday, a former colleague of Thompson’s suggested on Twitter that his past behavior had sent up some red flags. That colleague, a social media editor at DNAInfo Chicago named Jen Sabella, tweeted: Can't say we didn't see this coming... https://t.co/o8mOpEzhpO — Jen Sabella (@jensabella) February 2, 2016 @whet He interned for us a few summers ago -- VERY briefly. — Jen Sabella (@jensabella) February 2, 2016 When asked for clarification, Sabella referred us to DNAInfo Chicago’s managing editor, Shamus Toomey, who provided the following statement about Thompson’s tenure there: “He briefly served as a summer intern in 2013, covering mainly event stories.” When asked for comment by Gawker, Thompson sent us a copy of an undated letter he apparently sent to editor-in-chief Betsy Reed: Ms. Reed: I’ve been undergoing radiation treatment for testicular cancer and, since I no longer have health insurance, I’ve been feverishly struggling and figuring out how to pay for my treatment. All of this, of course, has taken up my time and energy; except for the few moments I’ve spent searching for some relief. With regards to verifying the comments, I’m in STL undergoing treatment, again, and not in NY, thus I lack access to my notebooks (which I took for most stories) to address these matters. Moreover, after finally looking over the notes sent to me, I must say this: I had a habit of writing drafts of stories, placing the names of ppl I wanted to get quotes from in there, and then going to fetch the quotes. (Was it sloppy? Yes? But I’m a cub reporter and expected a sustained and competent editor to guide me, something which I never had at your company and something with which The Intercept continues to struggle as everyone in this business knows.) But, I digress; back to the situation before us. If I couldn’t obtain a quote from the person I wanted, I went somewhere else, and must’ve forgot to change the names—clearly. Also, yes I encouraged some of my interviewees to use another name; they’re poor black people who didn’t want their names in the public given the situations and that was the only was of convincing them otherwise. That also explains why some of them didn’t want to talk with your company’s research team or denied the events. These weren’t articles in Harpers or The Nation. Instead, these are the lives of people forgotten by society and their being in public and talking to white, NY people, no less, could harm and turn them off. They’ve lost loved ones to violence you and others couldn’t possibly imagine. Ultimately, the journalism that covers the experiences of poor black folk and the journalism others, such as you and First Look, are used to differs drastically. This dilemma is the Great Problem with the white media organizations that dominate our media landscape. As Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote: “The standard [white] progressive approach of the moment is to mix color-conscious moral invective with color-blind public policy.” Such an approach ignores the differences in the way we must navigate these various fields: including journalism. The comments from editors calling me a stray dog; the lower pay; the being told on a trip to DC that I “shouldn’t spend like it’s the first of the month”. I shrugged it all off. I hope you and your company can understand all this and give me time to recover so that I may eventually look over my notes. I must say, though, it’s a very nefarious and ill liberal and anti humanist position to take if you do otherwise: kicking a cancer patient when he’s down. I’ve been through a lot tougher situations than this and will weather anything thrown my way. Ms. Reed, I also just read Counsel Oberlander’s letter. I’m not in NY and have been sick and bed-ridden from radiation so of course I can’t return that laptop—that I also broke by the way. But if your company wishes to withhold my separation pay, which I was banking on for my treatment, go right ahead. I’m also owed reimbursement from the trip to DC which I haven’t received. But I’m not angry because, naturally, I didn’t bring this up because my focus is on much more important things. Juan Thompson According to Reed’s note, Thompson “did not cooperate in the review” of his past reporting. Update — 3:40 p.m. Reed has responded: From: Betsy Reed Subject: Re: quick question Date: February 2, 2016 at 3:38:46 PM EST To: Keenan Trotter Keenan, I did receive an email from Juan today but it was not identical to the letter he sent to you, which you posted. In particular, this paragraph was not in the email he sent me: The comments from editors calling me a stray dog; the lower pay; the being told on a trip to DC that I “shouldn’t spend like it’s the first of the month”. I shrugged it all off. Thanks, Betsy Update — 4:40 p.m. A reader points out that Thompson provided a third and slightly different version of the letter he purportedly sent to Reed to CNN media reporter Tom Kludt. In the version he sent to Gawker, the 7th paragraph reads: The comments from editors calling me a stray dog; the lower pay; the being told on a trip to DC that I “shouldn’t spend like it’s the first of the month”. I shrugged it all off. In the version he sent to CNN, the same paragraph contains two extra clauses (bolding ours): The comments from editors calling me a stray dog; the lower pay; the being told on a trip to DC that I “shouldn’t spend like it’s the first of the month”. I shrugged it all off. And did this force to exaggerate and work to prove my worth? Yes. Update — 4:52 p.m. Thompson attempted to explain the differing versions of his letter to Reed in an email to Gawker: From: Juan Thompson Subject: Re: Press inquiry from Gawker Date: February 2, 2016 at 4:49:08 PM EST To: Keenan Trotter It’s the same I’m editing as I think of more things. Hmm. * Update — 6:15 p.m. Ben Calhoun, who serves as vice president of content and programming at Chicago Public Media, which operates WBEZ, tells Gawker that Thompson’s staff biography at The Intercept, which we paraphrased above, erroneously described him as a reporter for the NPR affiliate: I wanted to reach out to you about Juan Thompson. Among the things that Juan apparently misled people about was his role at WBEZ. In his bio for The Intercept Juan stated that he was a reporter at WBEZ. That claim is not true. Juan was never a reporter at WBEZ. Juan was an intern for a local talk show for 4 months (May – August of 2014). The extent of his duties was minimal, and he certainly was never responsible for any piece of journalism – nor does he have any bylines with us. We’d obviously appreciate very much if Gawker didn’t propagate this particular piece of bad information. Up until an hour or so ago, Thompson’s biography at The Intercept read as follows: Juan Thompson is a journalist with a focus on crime, punishment, the police state, and race. Prior to joining The Intercept, he worked as a production assistant and reporter at Chicago’s NPR member station WBEZ and as a reporter for DNAinfo Chicago. He lives in Brooklyn. It now reads: Juan Thompson is a former staff reporter for The Intercept. Update — 6:45 p.m. Thompson apparently provided a fourth version of the letter he purportedly sent to Reed, this time to Recode’s Noah Kulwin. The seventh paragraph of Recode’s copy includes an additional passage referring to a different reporter who used to work at The Intercept: The comments from editors calling me a stray dog; the lower pay; the being told on a trip to DC that I “shouldn’t spend like it’s the first of the month”. I shrugged it all off. Even after the only black reporter there was fired and the editor said to him “You seem too angry”, invoking the angry black male stereotype. Did all this force to exaggerate my personal shit in order to prove my worth? Yes. ||||| On Tuesday morning, the digital magazine The Intercept posted a note from Editor in Chief Betsy Reed acknowledging that former staffer Juan M. Thompson plagiarized, made up quotes and, in one case, fully invented a story, in multiple articles. Thompson was fired for the alleged deception. Reed says that Thompson, who formerly worked for news website DNAinfo and public radio station WBEZ in Chicago, “fabricated several quotes in his stories and created fake email accounts.” From Reed’s post: An investigation into Thompson’s reporting turned up three instances in which quotes were attributed to people who said they had not been interviewed. In other instances, quotes were attributed to individuals we could not reach, who could not remember speaking with him, or whose identities could not be confirmed. In his reporting Thompson also used quotes that we cannot verify from unnamed people whom he claimed to have encountered at public events. Thompson went to great lengths to deceive his editors, creating an email account to impersonate a source and lying about his reporting methods. Detailed corrections have been added to four articles, which focus on police brutality, Black Lives Matter activists and the city of St. Louis. One piece, which suggested that Charleston shooter Dylann Roof was spurned by a romantic interest who chose a black man over him, was found to have been based on quotes from an entirely falsified source. Reed said that The Intercept “will publish further corrections” if they are warranted. In an email sent from Thompson to Betsy Reed, that Thompson provided to Re/code (and Reed verified), Thompson acknowledges that he made mistakes. He adds that this was due to poor editing at The Intercept, and because he did not want to expose the identities of “poor black people who didn’t want their names in the public.” We’ve posted the email below. When we reached out to Thompson, he provided Re/code (as well as Gawker) with a version of the email that Reed says she did not receive, which includes an additional paragraph alleging unfair pay, and that editors called Thompson “a stray dog.” The Intercept launched in early 2014, co-founded by a group including investigative journalist Glenn Greenwald and filmmaker Laura Poitras. The two are best known for breaking the story of NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden in 2013. The Intercept’s parent company is First Look Media, an outfit launched in 2013 and funded by eBay co-founder and billionaire Pierre Omidyar. The impact of Thompson’s alleged fraud doesn’t appear as severe as the mendacity of ex-New York Times journalist Jayson Blair or 1990s prestige mag darling Stephen Glass. While The Intercept is influential (it won a National Magazine Award on Monday night), most of Thompson’s damage was done when his story about Dylann Roof was picked up by more widely read news outlets like the Daily Mail and the New York Daily News*. DNAinfo Editor in Chief John Ness and representatives for First Look Media and WBEZ did not respond before this article was published. Update: Gawker’s J.K. Trotter points out that one paragraph reads differently among the copies of the email sent to Reed that Thompson gave to media outlets, including Re/code and CNN. This is the same paragraph that Betsy Reed says she never saw in the message she received from Thompson. In the version Re/code obtained, the added sentence alleges a dimension of racism to a previous firing at The Intercept. Additionally, Thompson addresses how he stretched his credentials (“Did all this force [me] to exaggerate my personal shit in order to prove my worth?”). Chicago Public Media’s Kassie Stephenson told Re/code that Thompson was an intern at WBEZ in 2014. “He worked on our afternoon talk show, ‘The Afternoon Shift,’ as part of the production team. He didn’t have a byline,” Stephenson said. On Twitter, a DNAinfo editor said that he had “briefly” been an intern at that website a few summers back. Previously on The Intercept’s website, he was identified as having once been a reporter at both WBEZ and DNAinfo. Over email, Thompson said that the following lines were an after-the-fact add: Even after the only black reporter there was fired and the editor said to him “You seem too angry”, invoking the angry black male stereotype. Did all this force [me] to exaggerate my personal shit in order to prove my worth? Yes. We’ve reached out for additional comment from Betsy Reed, and we’ll update if we hear back. You can read Thompson’s email to Betsy Reed below, which he titled “The Great Problem” when he sent it to Re/code. The paragraph that Reed says she did not receive is highlighted in italics. Ms. Reed: I’ve been undergoing radiation treatment for testicular cancer and, since I no longer have health insurance, I’ve been feverishly struggling and figuring out how to pay for my treatment. All of this, of course, has taken up my time and energy; except for the few moments I’ve spent searching for some relief.

The employee, Juan Thompson, was a staff reporter from November 2014 until last month. Thompson fabricated several quotes in his stories and created fake email accounts that he used to impersonate people, one of which was a Gmail account in my name. An investigation into Thompson’s reporting turned up three instances in which quotes were attributed to people who said they had not been interviewed. In other instances, quotes were attributed to individuals we could not reach, who could not remember speaking with him, or whose identities could not be confirmed. In his reporting Thompson also used quotes that we cannot verify from unnamed people whom he claimed to have encountered at public events. Thompson went to great lengths to deceive his editors, creating an email account to impersonate a source and lying about his reporting methods. We have published corrections and editor’s notes to the affected pieces, and we will publish further corrections if we identify additional problems. We are retracting one story in its entirety. We have decided not to remove the posts but have labeled them “Retracted” or “Corrected,” based on our findings. We have added notes to stories with unconfirmed quotes. We apologize to the subjects of the stories; to the people who were falsely quoted; and to you, our readers. We are contacting news outlets that picked up the corrected stories to alert them to the problems. Thompson wrote mostly short articles on news events and criminal justice. Many of these articles relied on publicly available sources and are accurate; others contain original reporting that held up under scrutiny. Thompson admitted to creating fake email accounts and fabricating messages, but stood by his published work. He did not cooperate in the review. The Intercept deeply regrets this situation. Ultimately, I am accountable for everything we publish. The best way we can see to maintain the trust of readers is to acknowledge and correct these mistakes, and to focus on producing journalism we are proud of.

Anglers prize Caddo, the only naturally formed lake in Texas, for its trophy bass; canoeists rate its twisting, interlocking bayous among the most challenging to navigate. Environmentalists cherish its 26,000 acres as a rare, if not singular, wetlands environment. Caddo is more of a large bayou, composed of many smaller waterways. It is home to over 200 species of birds; hundreds of kinds of mammals, reptiles and fish; and countless plants, most prominently the towering baldcypress  some as old as 400 years  that erupt from its surface like limbs of drowned giants. But what struck me about Caddo Lake the first time I saw it was the powerful suggestion of the supernatural that it evoked. Honestly, it’s kind of a creepy place. Spectral shapes shift in the mist that rises from its cilantro-colored surface; ghost stories seem to ooze from its forested shores. Spanish moss dangles like serpents from cypress branches; spooky tales lurk behind the wary eyes of egrets and rabbits. Natural beauty by itself can stop you dead in your tracks, but Caddo also works on the primal circuits. It sticks with you. That, perhaps, is why my wife, Ann, and I return every few years to the lake, which sits about 15 miles west of Shreveport, La.: to make sure that what we saw the first time really existed; and maybe to figure it out, learn from it, even befriend it. For John Winn, 48, one of the lake’s most prominent guides, Caddo has been a lifelong companion. “In a way, this lake raised me,” he said, piloting his shallow-draft Go-Devil boat through the cypresses, which in early spring were equal parts dead graying foliage and new green growth. “Most everything important I’ve ever done has been on this lake.” Among Caddo’s many mysteries is its genesis. The lake was named for the Caddo Indians, who settled in the area in the early 1600s. There are two theories of its creation: The Caddo Indians held that it was formed by an earthquake and flooding; other, more recent histories say it was the result of the Great Raft  a huge logjam in the Red River, which in the early 1800s forced enough water into Big Cypress Bayou to create the lake. At the same time, the bayou became deep and wide enough to handle big steamships, which began heading up the Mississippi from New Orleans, then northeastward on the Red River and all the way to the hamlet of Jefferson, 15 miles west of the lake. As the 19th century progressed, Jefferson became Texas’s second-largest port after Galveston, a jumping-off point for goods headed for the fast-developing West. The town boomed, and the lake was a favored hideout for criminal elements drawn to all the new money  leading to the claim that, during this era, there was a murder a day in the area. Maybe it is the ghosts of these murderers and thieves that give the lake such a preternatural spookiness: what happened at Caddo, stayed in Caddo. Sometimes, the legends around Caddo cross over into the popular imagination. “I get requests all the time for Bigfoot tours,” Mr. Winn said, stroking at a gray-and-black beard. “Fine. But I’ve been out here all my life. I know places out here that the fishes don’t know about. I’ve never seen Bigfoot.” Mr. Winn turned the Go-Devil down one of the lake’s 42 mapped and marked “boat roads” in search of the animals that definitely inhabit the lake. A spring cold snap seemed to be keeping the alligators out of sight, but we saw plenty of turtles and frogs, hawks and vultures soaring overhead. The most interesting thing we saw was a beaver dam  a good five feet high and half again as wide, banked up against a cypress tree  looking every bit as solid as an Allied bunker. “These beavers back in here will get to be 70 pounds or so, and it’s all muscle,” Mr. Winn said. “There’s not much that can stand up to one except maybe for a gator, and even they find them too tough to eat.” Like a lot of ecological treasures, Caddo has been rather routinely abused, first by that steamboat traffic in the 19th century, then again, beginning in 1910, when prospectors built the country’s first “over-water” oil rigs to tap what was hoped to be infinite reserves in East Texas. In the last 20 years, Caddo has been assaulted by more-contemporary culprits, including mercury and other pollutants from past industrial excesses. So far, with the aid of several environmental organizations, the lake’s defenders have kept much of the vicissitudes of the 21st century at bay. It is one of 26 areas in the country designated for protection by the Ramsar Convention, a 1970s treaty that seeks to protect wetlands by asking participating nations to designate, put to “best” use and, if necessary, completely protect certain areas. What was this article about?","output":"So, this article is about a place called Caddo Lake, which is on the border between Texas and Louisiana. This lake is special because it formed all by itself - usually lakes are made by people, but not this one! It's a big watery area filled with lots of tiny rivers and channels, and it's home to many different types of creatures like birds, fish, and mammals. Some trees in the lake are as old as 400 years. It's a bit like a giant outdoor zoo! They're saying that this place feels very magical and a little bit spooky, with stories of ghosts and the like. There's a lot of history attached to Caddo Lake too. People named it after the Caddo Indians who used to live in that area long, long ago, about 400 years ago. There are different stories about how the lake came into being. The lake was important for transport back in the 1800s. Large boats known as steamships could travel from New Orleans all the way to a small town near the lake called Jefferson. This made Jefferson very wealthy and important. They also mention that this area used to be a bit dangerous back then - there were even pirates hiding out in the lake! In more recent years, Caddo Lake has faced some problems like pollution, but people are working very hard to protect it because it's such a special place. They are doing their best to make sure the plants, animals, and the lake itself can stay healthy and beautiful."},{"instruction":"Can you tell me the answer to when did elvis presley record blue suede shoes??","output":"To find the answer to when Elvis Presley recorded \\"Blue Suede Shoes,\\" I will follow these steps: 1.

A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'.

By 1966, the Beatles had grown weary of live performance. In John Lennon's opinion, they could \\"send out four waxworks ... and that would satisfy the crowds. Beatles concerts are nothing to do with music anymore. They're just bloody tribal rites.\\" In June that year, two days after finishing the album Revolver, the group set off for a tour that started in West Germany. While in Hamburg they received an anonymous telegram stating: \\"Do not go to Tokyo. Your life is in danger.\\" The threat was taken seriously in light of the controversy surrounding the tour among Japan's religious and conservative groups, with particular opposition to the Beatles' planned performances at the sacred Nippon Budokan arena. As an added precaution, 35,000 police were mobilised and tasked with protecting the group, who were transported from hotels to concert venues in armoured vehicles. The Beatles then performed in the Philippines, where they were threatened and manhandled by its citizens for not visiting First Lady Imelda Marcos. The group were angry with their manager, Brian Epstein, for insisting on what they regarded as an exhausting and demoralising itinerary. The publication in the US of Lennon's remarks about the Beatles being \\"more popular than Jesus\\" then embroiled the band in controversy and protest in America's Bible Belt. A public apology eased tensions, but a US tour in August that was marked by reduced ticket sales, relative to the group's record attendances in 1965, and subpar performances proved to be their last. The author Nicholas Schaffner writes: To the Beatles, playing such concerts had become a charade so remote from the new directions they were pursuing that not a single tune was attempted from the just-released Revolver LP, whose arrangements were for the most part impossible to reproduce with the limitations imposed by their two-guitars-bass-and-drums stage lineup.

Lord West said the UK’s tough anti-gun laws were a crucial tool in the fight against terror - but demanded further action to tighten restrictions on ammunition. The Labour peer also hit out at the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg for blocking new powers for the security services and urged ministers to increase anti-terror funding. Scroll down for video. Former security minister Admiral Lord West said new powers were needed to tackle Islamist fanatics. Lord West's intervention comes amid warnings from security chiefs that up to 150 jihadists in the UK could carry out gun attacks similar to the Paris atrocities, the Sunday Times reported this morning. Appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr show this morning Lord West said the government’s Communications Data Bill, dubbed a ‘snoopers’ charter’ by opponents, was needed to track terrorist suspects. The bill allows the security services to monitor who people are emailing and what they are looking at online. Lord West said: ‘I think that needs to go through, and I was very irked that it was removed, in fact it was removed by the Deputy Prime Minister, when it had all been agreed across all parties.’ He added that the security services ‘need more money’ to monitor suspected terrorists amid claims that up to 150 fanatics have returned from the war in Syria intent on carrying out attacks at home. The Labour peer’s warning comes after security chiefs warned last week that Britain was being targeted by al-Qaeda terrorists. MI5 chief Andrew Parker said the terror group was plotting spectacular 'mass casualty' attacks on the UK. Lord West (left) was interviewed by the BBC presenter Andrew Marr (centre) alongside the Labour leader Ed Miliband (right) Labour leader Ed Miliband said he was open minded about giving the security services more powers to monitor people's emails. Fanatics wish to emulate 'crude' attacks carried out overseas in recent months. Chillingly, tactics could include a 'hit-and-run' on a crowded public place using a lorry, van or car. Unlike gun or bomb plots, which involves buying weapons or equipment, such an attack would be hard for the security services to detect. At least three plots which would have involved 'certain deaths' in Britain have been foiled in recent months, Mr Parker said. Officials are also keeping tabs on up to 600 British extremists who have travelled to Syria – about 300 of who are now back home. Following the warning, the Chancellor George Osborne said he had handed the security services a new £100million anti-terror fund to track British lone-wolf extremists. Mr Osborne said the cash had been handed over 'in the last few weeks' amid growing fears over the number of radicals returning from Iraq and Syria to wreak terror in Britain. He said the Government would provide MI5 and MI6 with 'all the resources and all the legislation' they need to prevent a terrorist atrocity in Britain. But Mr Parker, the director-general of MI5, said it was almost inevitable that an attack in Britain would succeed sooner or later. He said al-Qaeda was directing British-based fanatics from overseas to carry out attacks on airlines or a Mumbai-style gun and bomb atrocities. In a rare public speech, Mr Parker warned: 'Although we and our partners try our utmost, we know that we cannot hope to stop everything.' Mr Parker's speech, only his second since taking charge in April 2013, warned that the UK was facing a string of 'complex and ambitious plots' against the likes of transport networks and major landmarks. In response to the attack on the Paris-based satirical magazine on Wednesday, Mr Osborne said the threat to the UK was 'severe' – but insisted security chiefs would get whatever they needed. He said: 'It's clearly a big challenge for all countries including Britain and we face a terrorist threat. We have a severe terrorist threat; that is our national state of readiness. 'We have put a huge amount of planning and effort, from the police, from the security services, from the Government into anticipating what might try and happen, stopping some of these attacks and of course we have been successfully doing that over the last year. 'In the last few weeks we have put extra money, over a hundred million pounds into specifically monitoring people who are going to conflicts in Syria and Iraq. 'These sort of self-starting terrorists who get their ideas off the internet and then go and want to perpetrate horrendous crimes, so we are putting a huge effort in. 'As the director general of MI5 said over the last 24 hours, that is the threat we face and we face a threat from more complex plots.' Warning: Andrew Parker (pictured), the director-general of MI5, said it was almost inevitable an attack in Britain would succeed sooner or later. The Chancellor pledged to provide MI5 and MI6 with 'all the resources and all the legislation' they need. Mr Osborne promised that the security services would get 'all the resources and all the legislation' necessary to prevent a terrorist attack in the UK. 'We have got to be vigilant, we have got to have the resources there and my commitment is very clear. This is the national priority. We will put the resources in, whatever the security services need they will get because they do a heroic job on our behalf. 'They often don't get praise, they don't often appear on sofas like this to talk about their work but they are absolutely in the front line with the police dealing with this threat and they will get the support they need and indeed in the last few weeks they have got that support.' 'Our national threat level is severe and that means we assess independently, it is not the politicians who make this assessment but the experts make this assessment, that an attack is highly likely. 'So, we have to be ready for that. We don't have specific intelligence that an attack is imminent or else we would increase the threat level, but we think it is highly likely and we have to be prepared. We have had terrible incidents on our streets.' Mr Osborne's remarks came amid warnings that amid warnings that the threat to Britain was now 'as serious as it has ever been' and the security services needed more powers to monitor fanatics. Former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the chairman of the joint intelligence committee, said the security services must have the power to intercept communications between suspected terrorists in order to prevent future attacks. He said: 'What is emerging in Paris is that the two individuals responsible for the terrible massacre at Charlie Hebdo, may have been linked to Al Qaida in Yemen. 'Now they must have ben communicating with people in the Yemen over the last few days, over the last few weeks. 'The highly important objective is to enable the intelligence agencies in Britain, France and other democracies to be able to get hold of these communications to try and prevent incidents of this kind.'

In the last two decades, we have witnessed a tremendous growth in the popularity and usage of social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat. These platforms have now become an integral part of daily life for billions of people across the globe. While these platforms offer many benefits, such as staying connected with friends, finding communities with shared interests, and staying informed about world events, there has been a growing concern related to their impact on the mental health of the adolescent population. Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to the potential negative effects of social media use due to factors such as their developing brains, growing need for social acceptance, and increasing concern for self-image. Additionally, excessive use of social media has been linked to sleep problems, distraction from school work, and cyberbullying, which may further contribute to worsening mental health. There has been a significant amount of research conducted in recent years, exploring the relationship between social media use and mental health among adolescents. Hypothesis: Increased usage of social media platforms leads to reduced mental well-being among adolescents. The hypothesis suggested here is that a higher degree of engagement with social media platforms will lead to negative consequences for the mental health of adolescents. This could manifest as heightened feelings of depression, anxiety, loneliness, poor self-esteem, and a reduction in overall life satisfaction. Not all adolescents may necessarily experience these effects, but the risk may be higher for those who engage heavily or indulge in unhealthy patterns of social media use. To investigate and test this hypothesis, a series of well-designed studies, both observational (such as surveys or longitudinal studies) and experimental (such as randomized controlled trials), can be conducted to explore the relationship between social media use and mental well-being among adolescents. The research should consider factors like the frequency of social media use, the type and content of social media interactions, and the overall time spent on social media platforms. Moreover, the studies should also differentiate between active and passive social media use (creating and sharing content versus merely browsing other people's content) and assess the influence of individual personality traits, social support, and the quality of offline relationships on moderating the effects of social media use on adolescents' mental health. In conclusion, understanding the relationship between social media usage and the mental health of adolescents is of great importance, given that this age group is particularly vulnerable to the possible negative consequences associated with such usage. A combination of well-conducted research studies could help further our understanding of this topic, which may ultimately lead to better-informed guidelines and interventions to help adolescents navigate the world of social media, maintain healthy usage patterns, and work towards supporting their overall mental well-being."},{"instruction":"Given the question: I remember back in the late 1970’s when I first started investing in property as a young guy, being taken to a house that felt EXTREMELY cold, strange, and rather chilling. Okay it was an older house that need some renovation work, but there was something about the place that just did not seem right. But despite that, it was available for purchase at what seemed to be a very attractive price … always a good starting point. Anyway, the real estate agent finished taking me around the property answering the questions that I had, and I left with a plan to do some costings before making a decision. But something was niggling me and making me feel a little uncomfortable, so I decided to investigate the property further. A couple of days later I was around at a friends house. He was in the Police force and as it happened he was in the same neighbourhood, I mentioned this particular property that I was looking at buying. He asked me the actual address after which he ‘kindly’ informed me that that that house had been the scene of a murder 6 months previously. It turned out that the property had been rented to a homosexual couple and that after an argument, one had murdered the other in the bath and then proceeded to cut his head off. Apparently the head was subsequently discovered a week later in the trunk of a car that had been abandoned up by a local golf-course. Less than impressed that the real estate agent had been less than forthcoming with me, I made the decision to not to proceed with the purchase. As they say in the property business ‘Location, Location, Location’ is always an important factor in determining the value of a property. However despite that being a good location, it was reputation that deterred me on that occasion. Sometimes there are situations where even the best makeover will not work.

Article: Trees are useful to man in three important ways: They provide him with wood and other products; they provide him shade;. and they help to prevent droughts and floods. Unfortunately, in many parts of the world, man has not realized that the third of these services is the most important.In his eagerness to make money from trees, he has cut them down in large numbers, only to find that without them he has lost the best friends he had. And besides, he is usually too careless to plant and look after new trees. So the forests slowly disappear. This does not only mean that man will have fewer trees. The results are even more serious: for where there are trees, their roots break up soil allowing the rain to sink in and also bind the soil, thus preventing it from being washed away easily;but where there are no trees, the rain falls on hard ground and flows away, causing floods and carrying away the rich top-soil. When the top-soil is gone, nothing remains but worthless desert. Two thousand years ago,a rich and powerful country cut down its trees to build warships, with which to gain itself an empire .It set up the empire, but, without its trees, its soil became poor and grew weak.

He is also alone when he faces a group intending to lynch Tom Robinson and once more in the courthouse during Tom's trial. Lee even uses dreamlike imagery from the mad dog incident to describe some of the courtroom scenes.

Mary never did as well on tests in high school as Lindsey because","output":"she suffered from severe test anxiety. While Lindsey always maintained a calm demeanor and strong focus, Mary's mind would blank and her heart would race as soon as she saw the first question on her test paper. Despite her best efforts to overcome this problem, test-taking always haunted her throughout her high school journey. For years, Lindsey and Mary had been best friends. They met in their freshman year during their first chemistry class, and quickly found that they shared a passion for the subject. Mary had an incredible understanding of complex concepts and an impressive curiosity for the subject, so much so that even her teachers would often be amazed at her potential to excel. It wasn't long before she became well known amongst her classmates as the \\"Chemistry Whiz.\\" Despite her natural aptitude for the subject, Mary's overwhelming sense of dread whenever an exam was near remained her most significant hurdle to overcome. Despite her best efforts, it persisted: the excessive sweating, rapid heartbeat, clammy hands, and blank mind during exams were inescapable. Concerned by her struggles and unwilling to watch her best friend suffer in silence, Lindsey made it her mission to help Mary overcome her crippling test anxiety. As they completed high school, Lindsey's compassionate spirit drove her to research various coping mechanisms and relaxation techniques. In addition to this, Lindsey also supported Mary by being her study partner, quiz master, and overall cheerleader whenever Mary needed a boost of confidence. Despite these attempts to address the root of Mary's test-taking anxiety, the pivotal moment of transformation came when their high school guidance counselor recommended Mary to undergo therapy to address the issue professionally. With her parents and Lindsey's support, Mary reluctantly agreed. Throughout her therapy sessions, Mary gradually uncovered the true depth of her anxiety. She realized that her fear of failure and intense pressure to achieve perfection had resulted in this debilitating anxiety. Working closely with her therapist, Mary began to learn skills that enabled her to confront her self-imposed expectations and regain control over her anxiety. As the months passed, Mary began to notice a gradual yet significant change in her test-taking experience. While she still felt nerves, her anxiety became more manageable. The support of her family, friends, and therapist allowed Mary to rebuild her confidence and, with time, slowly chip away at the wall of test-anxiety that had been holding her back for so long. Although Mary never quite matched Lindsey's effortless ease when it came to exams, her newfound resilience allowed her to break free from the clutches of anxiety that had once dictated her life. From their final high school exams to their college years, Mary and Lindsey would forge ahead as a team, bound by their shared determination to succeed. Both Lindsey and Mary went on to study chemistry in college, with Mary following her dreams to specialize in organic chemistry and Lindsey in biochemistry. They continued to support each other, celebrating each other's successes and offering a shoulder to lean on during difficult moments. Even as they branched out into their respective areas of expertise, the friendship they cultivated throughout high school remained unshaken. Over the years, Mary became known not only for her extraordinary dedication to her work, but also for her willingness to help others. Her own experiences with test anxiety and overcoming it lent itself to her career as an esteemed professor and researcher, mentoring students who found themselves facing similar challenges. Mary and Lindsey's unique journey through high school and beyond not only defined their friendship but also set the stage for them to impact countless lives and inspire many more, both by sharing their academic prowess and as beacons of resilience and compassion. In the end, the true test of their friendship proved to be their unwavering support for each other, proving that no obstacle is insurmountable when you have a friend by your side."},{"instruction":"Q:Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed.

Martin Luther King Jr.'s presence in Birmingham was not welcomed by all in the black community. A local black attorney complained in Time that the new city administration did not have enough time to confer with the various groups invested in changing the city's segregation policies. Black hotel owner A. G. Gaston agreed. A white Jesuit priest assisting in desegregation negotiations attested the \\"demonstrations [were] poorly timed and misdirected\\".Protest organizers knew they would meet with violence from the Birmingham Police Department and chose a confrontational approach to get the attention of the federal government. Wyatt Tee Walker, one of the SCLC founders and the executive director from 1960 to 1964, planned the tactics of the direct action protests, specifically targeting Bull Connor's tendency to react to demonstrations with violence: \\"My theory was that if we mounted a strong nonviolent movement, the opposition would surely do something to attract the media, and in turn induce national sympathy and attention to the everyday segregated circumstance of a person living in the Deep South.\\" He headed the planning of what he called Project C, which stood for \\"confrontation\\".

Instead, Rimes executive produced the album. A month following the album's release, Twisted Angel was certified \\"Gold\\" by the RIAA, her second Gold-certified album. The album received mainly negative reviews by most music critics and magazines.

Statistically, most American adults change jobs at least a few times in their lives, and jobs that last for all or even the majority of one’s working life are exceedingly rare nowadays. To work successfully at the same job for nearly 30 years is definitely a big accomplishment, and it’s a distinction Alf Clausen has earned by composing music for The Simpsons for nearly its entire run. Clausen has been the FOX animated institution’s sole composer since 1990, starting from season 2’s ‘Treehouse of Horror’, the first in The Simpsons’ long tradition of Halloween specials. Surprisingly enough, though, despite scoring some 567 episodes of the series, Clausen was not tapped to do the music for 2007’s The Simpsons Movie, with that honor going to Hans Zimmer. Still, most fans assumed that Clausen’s job was more than safe at this late juncture, and that he’d likely continue providing music for the show until it eventually ends. That won’t be the case, however, as Variety reports that Clausen has been abruptly fired, just weeks ahead of The Simpsons’ season 29 premiere. The only explanation for this change so far comes from Clausen himself, who says that he received a call recently from Simpsons producer Richard Sakai informing him that his services would no longer be required, and that show was looking for “a different kind of music.” Despite the season 29 premiere episode — entitled ‘The Serfsons’ — being just over a month away, Clausen’s departure appears to be immediate, with the season 28 finale ‘Dogtown’ serving as his last effort for The Simpsons. The identity of the composer that will replace him has yet to be revealed, but their first work for the show will definitely be heard during season the 29 premiere. FOX has yet to offer an official statement on the matter. Clausen stands as one of the most respected composers working in animation, having earned a whopping 23 Emmy nominations — winning twice — for his contributions to The Simpsons. He’s also received 7 additional Emmy nominations for other projects. Some of Clausen’s other credits include Alf, The Critic, and Moonlighting. It’ll be interesting to see where he ends up next, as he’s likely to get several offers. The Simpsons season 29 premieres October 1 on FOX.

Clausen, whose Emmy record includes two wins (1997 and ’98) and another 21 nominations for “The Simpsons” dating back to 1992, has scored more than 560 episodes of the series, starting early in the 1990-91 season. He is believed to be the most-nominated composer in Emmy history, with a total of 30 nominations overall. He has also won five Annie Awards, all for his “Simpsons” music. His long tenure with the series has made him one of the most respected creators of animation music in TV history. Clausen’s last complete score for the series was for the season finale of Season 28, which aired in May. The season premiere is slated for Oct. 1, but it is not yet clear who will be scoring that episode. Speculation about Clausen’s dismissal involves cost-cutting measures, which have been ongoing at “The Simpsons” in recent years, despite its massive profits for Fox and executive producer James L. Brooks’ Gracie Films. Clausen uses a 35-piece orchestra every week — something that “Simpsons” creator Matt Groening insisted upon from the start of the show. Including costs of musicians, recording studios, and orchestration, expenses routinely run into the millions of dollars per year. Danny Elfman’s “Simpsons” theme is expected to be retained. ||||| Thirty years ago this month, America’s favorite animated family made their debut as part of The Tracey Ullman Show. To celebrate, CoS will be broadcasting live from Springfield all week with a slew of Simpsons features. Today, Lior Phillips talks to longtime composer Alf Clausen, who’s arguably the eldest member of the Simpson family, having been there since the beginning. You might not know the name Alf Clausen, but he’s been one of the most influential, talented musicians you’ve listened to for most of your life. For more than two and a half decades, Clausen has been in your living room, the roots of his music entangling the joy receptors in your brain for half an hour at a time. He’s covered seemingly every genre, from Latin jazz to Broadway show tunes. He’s composed songs that you know by heart, songs that can stretch a smile across your face year in and year out. Alf Clausen, of course, has composed the music for every episode of The Simpsons for the last 27 years. He’s the man behind endlessly fun hooks like “We Put the Spring in Springfield” and “You’re Checkin’ In” (both of which netted him Emmys). He’s the never-seen but always felt main character alongside the intrepid Simpson family, the brains behind the 30 or so musical cues in each episode. Simply put, he contributes a beating heart and dramatic counterpoint to the brilliant stories, the two halves inseparable and feeding off each other in a beautiful crescendo of hilarity and yellow-hued surreality. Because no celebration of The Simpsons could be complete without hearing from the one and only Clausen, Associate Editor Lior Phillips spoke with the Springfield maestro for a nice afternoon chat. Together, the two discussed Clausen’s entire career, specifically his transition from engineering to music, getting The Simpsons job, what it takes to compose the music for each episode, and his personal affinity for the Comic Book Guy. What’s a typical day for you? Do you work from the studio or from home? Well, I don’t work every single day, and when I do I typically work from home. With The Simpsons, we have kind of a scattered schedule for recording. So that you could give yourself a little bit of time off and a necessary break between the episodes? Yes, it’s funny you’re bringing that up because we are now enjoying the fruits of four weeks off before we go back to work. Oh my gosh! Do you get four weeks off every year? Or is this quite a rare occurrence? No, this one just came out of the blue. The network changed the schedule a little bit and everybody’s really enjoying it. So what have you been doing on your time off? Taxes. [Laughs.] I’m so sorry, that is awful. Yeah, that’s no way to relax, is it? No, but at least you’re mentally giving your brain a little bit of a break off from being creative all the time … unless you feel like you’re getting creative with your taxes, which is not a good thing! When do you go back to work again? Yes! [laughs] I think the next recording session is April 21st. Then we start recording and we do three shows in a row in three weeks. Then we’re finished for the season. For us, it’s 28. Amazing, huh? It really is remarkable. While it’s a series that’s ingrained in pop culture, I don’t think a lot of folks realize that it’s the longest-running scripted primetime television series of all time. And you’ve been a part of this for such a long time. Do you take any time to sit and reflect on things like that, on how it is such an important part of culture? Well, I don’t have much time to think of that. When we first put out the first Simpsons music CD, with a lot of the songs that I had written, it was on Rhino records the first time around. We worked really hard, we got the CD all finished and ready to release, it got released, and spread out to radio stations, and what not, and I did an interview with a guy who was hosting a primetime drive-time in San Francisco, in the morning, at nine o’clock. So I got on the phone with him, and he was very cordial. He said, “Let me ask you a personal question. What does it feel like to be an icon of pop culture?” And my first instinct was to turn my head 90 degrees, look over my shoulder, and see who he was talking about. Ha! I’m not surprised. With longevity comes loyalty and legend, at the core it’s an animated series full of dramatic characters that you really do feel like family, and you have been such an integral part of it. Does your family watch the show? Well, I don’t think they really understood it. Some of them do. Not all of them, but some of them do. I have a grandson who used to poo-poo The Simpsons when he was young, but now he’s grown up with it, and he’s eight years old, and he has watched every episode of The Simpsons. Little by little we grew into it and started to realize that something special was going on here. Are you saying that when you first watched it, it was a little bit left field for you? Did you not relate to the humor, or did you just think it was something you’d never seen before? To me it was pretty much the writing and the actors’ delivery of the writing that really hooked us in. Well, it’s been an amazing ride, if I can put it that way. Were you fascinated with music from a very young age? What’s interesting is that I started by majoring in mechanical engineering. I went to college in North Dakota at North Dakota State University, which is where I grew up. What happened was, I got a chance to go to New York City and stay with my cousin for six weeks. My cousin was a professional musician, a choir director, and a piano instructor. He and his wife just completely turned my life around. They wined and dined me in New York City for six straight weeks, and boy I’ll tell you I was just amazingly moved at all the Broadway shows I got to see, like My Fair Lady with Rex Harrison and Julie Andrews, and West Side Story with Carol Lawrence and Larry Kert, and How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. Seeing those things on Broadway for the first time, it was awe-inspiring. So, when I came back to North Dakota, I thought, Well, guess what folks: This mechanical engineering stuff is not for me. So I changed my major, and majored in music from there on. I went to Berklee College in Boston. While they’re completely different fields, there is a certain amount of critical thinking necessary for classical composition. And then, skipping ahead, Matt Groening asked you to score a couple of episodes. Yes, I believe it was back in 1990. So, he called you, and did you immediately say yes? I immediately said no. What! It’s a very, very interesting story. He had his secretary call my agent and had me come in for an interview. I went in and he said, “Do you have any interest in doing an animated series?” And I said, “No.” He said, “Really, why?” I said, “Basically I’ve been concentrating on dramas. I consider myself to be a drama scorer, and that’s what I want to do with my life.” He said, “Well, we look upon our show as being a drama where the characters are drawn. We’d like it scored that way, because you do that.” So, I thought about it for a while, and I said, “Yeah, I think I can do that.” So they gave me my first episode, which was “Treehouse of Horror I”. I scored that for them, and we had a lot of music. I thought, Boy, they’re going to throw me out of here when I tell them how many players I need. I talked to Matt about it, and he said, “Whatever you want, you can have. Let’s just see how it goes.” So, they put out a call for about 45 musicians. It was really a pretty hefty number for television. But it went well, they liked what I wrote, and they kept me. What was the reason that you felt you needed to work with so many musicians? Was it that you were hooked on the concept of it being dramatic? Or did you just feel out the music and give it what it needs. I think it was more the latter. I was used to working with a large orchestra, and I thought they were telling me they wanted what I gave everybody else, and that’s what it took. It took 45 players. And everybody was happy about it. So then of course we start to score the series and I couldn’t have 45 players, but they gave me 35 every week, which is pretty good. How does working with a big ensemble affect your composition? Well, I look at the orchestra as another actor, another player. I think everybody else really feels that as well. They always tell me that there’s another player involved with the orchestra, and it adds a lot to the story line and color. What do you feel is the correlation between the characters, the humor, and how that’s conveyed through music? Can a joke even work on its own, or do you feel that music is an integral part of that? A long time ago a musician friend of mine gave me a saying that I’ve never forgotten. He said, “You can’t vaudeville vaudeville.” Basically what it means is that you can’t score something funny with something funny, with funny music. It doesn’t work. My take has been, every time we have something dramatic to score, that’s the way I score it. I don’t score it like Looney Tunes or anything like that. Matt told me that too. “We want to be different. We want to do something that people are not going to expect. They’re expecting Looney Tunes and Disney, and we’re not going to go there. We want to be our own voice.” But then what is it like writing for a show that covers so many genres and time periods? There have been a lot of episodes that hit upon very specific cultural moments or even into the past, episodes set in the ’60s, the ’70s. And you have to write that music for something that has so many different narrative touch points. How is that for you? I think that’s one of the reasons they’ve kept me all these years. They were looking for somebody who could score all those different types of music in small clip-form. That’s what’s been fun for me. I think that anyone else who would have been hired for this job and stayed for this long would have gone to the nuthouse. [Laughs.] From one nutter to another, you sound semi-nutty to me. Is that just because it’s you have to be constantly creative? I have to do a lot of reference work. They want my cue to reflect the moment. Most composers don’t have a very broad stylistic palette, I think that’s the best way I could put it. They like that I can go into the files in my brain and come back with the style that they’re asking for very easily. You have to balance that nostalgia with originality and make it your own. If you get stuck and you’re busy searching through your brain-files, what do you do to push around the process? Your observation is very good about that, because it does happen. But fortunately not very often. If it does happen, I just step away from the cue for a while, and work on another one. We have an average of 35 cues in one episode, so, there’s a lot on my plate, and if one shows up that I get really stuck with, I try not to stay there very long. I go on to take a walk in the park to clear my head. That’s interesting. How are songs actually born? Are you given the script and then told to create the cue around that? Or are you given some sort of animation that you can visually attach your music to? It’s the visual animation that I get. I get a copy of the episode for the week. I like working that way too, because I get to see what the public sees. That makes it a lot easier for me. I have been very careful that I don’t duplicate myself. One of our intentions on the show is to keep it fresh so that the public doesn’t feel like we’re cheating them. Once in awhile I’ll have a situation where I’m really tired and I know what I want, and I’m going to pull a cue from three years ago, and I say to myself, “Yeah, I could use that, and nobody’s ever going to know…” Well, now I find that every time I do that, one of the episodes that has that same cue in it pops up in syndication, and there’s somebody watching the show in syndication saying, “What a lazy bum, man! He’s using the same music over and over, what’s the matter with that guy? Do you feel like you have a relationship with the various characters at this point? They are kind of like your family! Do you have a favorite character at all? Oh, absolutely. I’ve lived with them for a long time now. I like Comic Book Guy! But there are so many characters doing so many things, it’s hard to just grab one. Is there a specific song that sticks out? “We Do (The Stonecutter’s Song)” Oh, I love that one! Did it come out very quickly? That song was nominated for an Emmy as well. It came out very quickly. Most of them come out pretty quickly because I don’t have any extra time. They have to come out pretty quickly. [Laughs.] Yeah. I’m trying to remember. I’ve got two Emmys. One for “I’m Checkin’ In” and the other one where Homer wants the house of ill repute torn down, and Bart is working there and wants to keep it…. “We Put the Spring in Springfield”! But even just in terms of Emmy nominations, you have received more than pretty much any other musician, which is quite insane. Thirty is the number. When the cast has to sing certain songs, do you help them in that process realize their potential? Once in awhile I’ve had the opportunity to do that. What happens more often than not is that my music editor, Chris Ledesma, will take over the chore of conducting the vocal sessions to record the cast singing the songs, because we can’t be in two places at the same time. I’m very lucky to have somebody who understands music and who understands conducting. You only have, as you said earlier, a few seconds to make a huge musical statement, and there’s obviously huge challenges in that. But you’ve also been a part of The Simpsons albums and worked with Jackson Browne, David Byrne, and The B-52s. Are there any artists that you’ve gotten to work with on these albums that you found very inspirational? Tito Puente! It was great, so much fun. Tito came into the studio with his whole band. When I recorded U2, they just stayed in as a group of singers, as they are. We got a chance to hang out a bit, and that was really fun too. Boy, you can’t believe how many people were in the recording studio. Oh my! That’s a beautiful memory. For the film adaptation of the show, were you asked to score that? Uhh… They didn’t ask. That’s their business, but it was weird. I found out for the first time on a message board that I wasn’t going to be scoring the movie. I’ve been in that situation before. This was a little bit more big-time, if I can say that. I was kind of frustrated and curious as to why after all of those years, making all of those songs and scoring all of those episodes that they wanted to call someone else. Weird. But the important thing is to move on to the next, to the next, to the next, and we’ll see what’s going to happen. Try not to take it all too seriously. I haven’t even seen it to be honest, I had no reason to go. You’ve dedicated your life to something that is going to be in our lives forever, whether they stop making The Simpsons or not. Yeah, it’s pretty remarkable. The opportunity was certainly never expected and I just keep going and going. Of course, you know, my wife says, “When are you going to retire?” And I said, “I don’t know!” Because it’s a double-edged sword. On one hand, I’ve said what I’m going to say musically and I don’t have to do any more. But on the other hand, I want to kind of ride this stage into the sunset, as they say, and try to see if I can finish the series. Everybody jokes about that. There’s an episode of The Simpsons where the kids are riding in the back seat, with Marge and Homer driving, and somebody says something, and Lisa goes, you know, “Could this be the end of this series… of events?” It’s really funny, isn’t it? I will say my wife has been a miracle-worker to keep me going, to keep me alive. I give her a lot of credit. That’s really heartfelt and beautiful to hear. What are your goals for the upcoming season? Surviving. Just surviving? [Laughs] What about having fun Alf? [Laughs] Sometimes it feels that way, I hate to tell you! There’s so much to do in a short period of time, and the producers need it when they need it, and we just have to do what we do and hope it comes out the way they want. I’ve been pretty lucky so far. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Longtime composer for The Simpsons, Alf Clausen, has been fired after 27 years of working on the show, according to Variety.

Let's analyze each aspect in detail: 1. Content: The review seems to be focused on a specific issue that the user is facing, which is that their game (presumably \\"Gunship Battle: Second War\\") is not working properly. This suggests a negative experience, and they might be seeking assistance. However, the content of the review is minimal and does not provide enough information about the problem. For instance, it does not provide details about the device they are using, the nature of the issue (e.g., crashes, freezes, etc.), or any steps they have tried to resolve it. This makes it difficult for others to understand the root of the problem and provide help. Rating: 2/5 2. Clarity: The clarity of the review is not optimal, as grammatical errors and word choices make it difficult to understand the core message. For example, \\"My games has not working like\\" should potentially be \\"My game is not working like.\\" Additionally, the title of the game \\"Gunship Battle: Second War\\" is not correctly formatted. It could lead to confusion for those who are not familiar with the game or misinterpret the issue being addressed. Rating: 1/5 3. Helpfulness: As mentioned earlier, the review lacks essential details about the problem, making it hard for other users or developers to provide support or solutions. A helpful review would include information about the device being used, the nature of the issue, and any troubleshooting steps taken before writing the review. Since it does not have these elements, it is of very limited use for other users or the game's developer. Rating: 1/5 Taking all of these factors into account, we can rate this review as follows: Average Rating: (2+1+1)/3 = 1.33 To round off this rating to the nearest whole number on a scale of 1-5, we can conclude that this review scores a 1 out of 5. This reflects that the review is least favorable in terms of content, clarity, and helpfulness. A more effective review would provide a detailed description of the issue, proper grammar, and additional information that would allow others to better understand and potentially offer appropriate solutions to the problem."},{"instruction":"Here are some reviews for a movie: 1.

Let's examine these factors step by step. Step 1: Space and equipment A ship needs to have adequate space and equipment to perform a hanging. This includes a sturdy structure to attach the rope, such as a yardarm on a mast, and the necessary rope and restraints. If a ship is well-equipped and has sufficient room, this factor could be considered viable. Step 2: Stability and motion of the ship A ship at sea is subject to motion due to waves, swells, and other weather-related factors. Sudden movement, especially during a turbulent storm, could potentially complicate or disrupt the execution process. However, if the hanging is performed during a period of relative calm, this factor would not pose a significant concern. Step 3: Skill and expertise of the executioner The effectiveness of a hanging relies heavily on the skill of the executioner. A well-executed hanging should result in a quick and relatively painless death, whereas a poorly performed hanging could lead to strangulation or other undesirable outcomes. If the ship's crew includes a skilled executioner, this factor would be less of a concern. Step 4: Legal and ethical considerations Laws and regulations surrounding executions, including those performed at sea, vary by country and jurisdiction. In some cases, hanging may be an approved method of execution, while in others, it might be strictly prohibited. Additionally, ethical concerns may arise about the appropriateness of performing executions at sea. Considering these factors, hanging could be a viable execution method on a ship at sea under the right circumstances. Factors such as having suitable space and equipment, performing the execution during a relatively calm period, having a skilled executioner, and adhering to legal and ethical guidelines would need to be met for a hanging to be considered viable in this situation."},{"instruction":"Richard of Bordeaux was the younger son of Edward, the Black Prince, and Joan of Kent. Edward, heir apparent to the throne of England, had distinguished himself as a military commander in the early phases of the Hundred Years' War, particularly in the Battle of Poitiers in 1356. After further military adventures, however, he contracted dysentery in Spain in 1370. He never fully recovered and had to return to England the next year. Whereas the poll tax of 1381 was the spark of the Peasants' Revolt, the root of the conflict lay in tensions between peasants and landowners precipitated by the economic and demographic consequences of the Black Death and subsequent outbreaks of the plague. The rebellion started in Kent and Essex in late May, and on 12 June, bands of peasants gathered at Blackheath near London under the leaders Wat Tyler, John Ball, and Jack Straw. John of Gaunt's Savoy Palace was burnt down. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Simon Sudbury, who was also Lord Chancellor, and the king's Lord High Treasurer, Robert Hales, were both killed by the rebels, who were demanding the complete abolition of serfdom. The king, sheltered within the Tower of London with his councillors, agreed that the Crown did not have the forces to disperse the rebels and that the only feasible option was to negotiate. It is unclear how much Richard, who was still only fourteen years old, was involved in these deliberations, although historians have suggested that he was among the proponents of negotiations. The king set out by the River Thames on 13 June, but the large number of people thronging the banks at Greenwich made it impossible for him to land, forcing him to return to the Tower. The next day, Friday, 14 June, he set out by horse and met the rebels at Mile End. The king agreed to the rebels' demands, but this move only emboldened them; they continued their looting and killings. Richard met Wat Tyler again the next day at Smithfield and reiterated that the demands would be met, but the rebel leader was not convinced of the king's sincerity. The king's men grew restive, an altercation broke out, and William Walworth, the mayor of London, pulled Tyler down from his horse and killed him. The situation became tense once the rebels realised what had happened, but the king acted with calm resolve and, saying \\"I am your captain, follow me!\\", he led the mob away from the scene. Walworth meanwhile gathered a force to surround the peasant army, but the king granted clemency and allowed the rebels to disperse and return to their homes. The king soon revoked the charters of freedom and pardon that he had granted, and as disturbances continued in other parts of the country, he personally went into Essex to suppress the rebellion. On 28 June at Billericay, he defeated the last rebels in a small skirmish and effectively ended the Peasants' Revolt. Despite his young age, Richard had shown great courage and determination in his handling of the rebellion. It is likely, though, that the events impressed upon him the dangers of disobedience and threats to royal authority, and helped shape the absolutist attitudes to kingship that would later prove fatal to his reign. Ask a question about this article.","output":"What were the main causes of the Peasants' Revolt, and how did King Richard II's handling of the revolt impact his future reign and attitude towards royal authority?"},{"instruction":"Summarize: Asad Khan, from Bradford, died September last year. His family believe he had been bullied. Pupils from All Saints Primary School have been working with Bradford University students to produce a documentary on bullying awareness. Asad's cousin, Farah Naz, said: \\"We don't want other children to suffer what he had to suffer.\\" She said there was \\"a lesson to be learnt from his tragic death\\" and made an appeal to bullies. \\"I don't know what Asad went through, but please don't do it to any other young child. \\"We had no idea he was suffering from bullying because at home he was just [his usual self] running around, playing and being very talkative... if we had a slight idea that he was, things would've been different.\\" More on this story and others from across Yorkshire Project Coordinator Sabeen Raja said the film was a good tribute to the 11-year-old. \\"I think it's a good way for the children to see the impact that bullying may have and I think it's a good way to remember him, to know that he didn't leave in a way without something being done about it.\\" Hundreds of people attended his funeral last year and his death affected the local community with more than 200 people gathering at a centre in Girlington in October to offer support and discuss the issue of bullying. Asad was found unresponsive at his home on Tile Street, off Whetley Lane, on 28 September, by his mother. He was taken to hospital but died a short time later.","output":"Last September, Asad Khan, a young boy from Bradford, passed away. His family believes that bullying was a contributing factor in his tragic death. Since then, students from All Saints Primary School and Bradford University have collaborated to create a documentary aiming to raise awareness about the devastating effects of bullying. Asad's cousin, Farah Naz, shared her thoughts about Asad's experience, expressing that she hopes no other child has to endure the pain and suffering that Asad had to go through. She also mentioned that if the family had been aware of the bullying issues, things might have been different. Asad's usual behavior at home, running around and playing, did not reveal any signs of suffering or bullying. Sabeen Raja, the project coordinator, felt that the film was a fitting tribute to Asad, who was only 11 years old at the time of his passing. The documentary serves to demonstrate the immense impact that bullying can have on a young life. Importantly, it also ensures that something positive is done in the wake of such a tragic event, which has left an indelible mark on the community. Asad's death was deeply felt by the local community. Hundreds of people attended his funeral, and over 200 people gathered in Girlington the following October to offer their support and share their thoughts on the issue of bullying. Asad was found unresponsive in his home on Tile Street by his mother, and despite being immediately taken to the hospital, he passed away shortly after. This heart-rending incident serves as a reminder of the grave harm that bullying can cause, and the importance of developing and promoting empathy, kindness, and understanding in order to prevent such tragedies in the future. By sharing Asad's story, those working on the documentary hope to foster change and protect other young lives from experiencing this unwarranted pain."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Aubrey awaited patiently for Cameron to return her phone call from earlier that day.

Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks. I am facing a new situation today: Mike lives in a cold mid-western city, where there is not much predator prey interaction. Mike noticed that in his city some squirrels have darker coat, while others have lighter coat. He also knew that darker coats are more suitable in cold environment with less predator prey interaction. He started thinking why the squirrels developed different coat colors. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which coat would most likely become more common, darker or lighter? A:","output":"Based on the knowledge acquired from the background article on natural selection, it is likely that the darker coat will become more common among squirrels in Mike's cold mid-western city with less predator-prey interaction. The reason for this is that darker coats are more suitable for colder environments, as they can absorb more sunlight and provide better insulation, helping the squirrels to stay warm and maintain their body temperature. Since the environment in Mike's city is cold, squirrels with darker coats would have an advantage over those with lighter coats in terms of survival and reproduction. As a result, natural selection would cause the beneficial trait of having a darker coat to become more common in the squirrel population over time."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: - clubs is persebaya barito putra junior deltras sidoarjo pelita jaya purwakarta persela lamongan - caps is 16 - position is defender - years is 1994 2008 -- 2011 2011-present -- 1996 1999 -- 2005 2006 -- 2008 - height is 1.77 0 - currentclub is barito putra - youthclubs is persebaya junior - youthyears is 1994 -- 1996 - birth date is 20 august 1978 - fullname is agustiar batubara - birth place is surabaya , indonesia Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

How did the Ottomans change history? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Choose from: +no. +yes.","output":"+no. While these two questions are related, they are not paraphrases of each other. The first question asks about the specifics of how the Ottomans conquered Constantinople, while the second question inquires about the broader impact the Ottomans had on history. To answer the first question: The Ottomans conquered Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire, on May 29, 1453, under the leadership of Sultan Mehmed II. The siege of Constantin-ople lasted for 53 days and was a turning point in history, marking the end of the Byzantine Empire and the beginning of the Ottoman Empire's dominance in the region. Several factors contributed to the successful Ottoman conquest of Constantinople: 1. Preparation and planning: Mehmed II meticulously prepared for the siege by stockpiling weapons, gathering a large, well-trained army, and developing a detailed strategy. The overall force consisted of around 80,000 to 100,000 soldiers, with a mix of infantry, cavalry, and artillery. 2. Technological advantage: The Ottomans utilized advanced weaponry, specifically powerful, large-scale siege cannons. These cannons could fire massive stone projectiles that could penetrate the city's walls. The largest cannon, called the \\"Basilica,\\" had a barrel 27 feet long and required more than 1,000 pounds of gunpowder per shot. 3. Naval blockade: Sultan Mehmed II ordered a naval blockade to cut off Constantinople's access to outside supplies and reinforcements. The Ottoman fleet successfully stopped any Byzantine ships from entering or leaving the city's harbor, which slowly weakened the defenders' resolve. 4. Weak Byzantine defenses: Constantinople's walls were still formidable; however, the city had been in decline, and its defenses suffered from lack of maintenance and insufficient manpower. Additionally, the Byzantine Empire did not receive the support and reinforcements it needed from European allies due to a lack of unity among Christian nations. 5. Final assault: The decisive attack on the city was launched on May 29, 1453. Mehmed II ordered a multi-front assault, attacking along the entire length of the land walls and creating an overwhelming offensive force. After hours of intense combat, Ottoman troops breached the walls and entered the city, ultimately leading to the fall of Constantinople. To answer the second question: The Ottomans changed history in several ways through their conquests and governance of their vast empire: 1. Fusion of cultures: The Ottoman Empire comprised diverse territories and ethnicities within its borders, which resulted in a fusion of cultures. Art, architecture, science, and literature benefitted from the blending of Byzantine, Persian, and Islamic influences throughout the empire. 2. Trade: The Ottomans strategically controlled key trade routes between Europe and Asia, including the Silk Road. This enabled the Ottomans to influence global trade, encourage cultural exchange, and accumulate wealth. 3. Religion: The conquest of Constantinople and subsequent expansion of the Ottoman Empire marked the spread of Islam throughout southeastern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. However, the Ottomans were often tolerant of other religions within their empire, fostering a relatively peaceful coexistence among different faiths. 4. Military advancements: The Ottomans had a highly effective and well-disciplined military force, incorporating innovations in warfare, such as the aforementioned cannons. These advancements not only contributed to the Ottoman Empire's expansions but also influenced other military powers in Europe at the time. 5. Decline of feudalism: The Ottomans' centralized, bureaucratic government system contributed to the decline of feudalism in Europe. As the empire expanded into Europe, feudal lords who once held significant power found themselves subordinate to the centralized authority of the Ottoman Empire or losing territories altogether. In conclusion, these two questions address different aspects of the Ottoman Empire's impact on history. The first question pertains to the specific events surrounding the conquest of Constantinople, while the second question concerns the broad and long-lasting effects of the Ottoman Empire on world history."},{"instruction":"Around the beginning of the 20th century, a general dissatisfaction with the emphasis on revivalist architecture and elaborate decoration gave rise to many new lines of thought that served as precursors to Modern Architecture.

As part of the build-up to the start of MailOnline's Fantasy Football season, we will be taking a look at players new to the Premier League with the potential to light up England's top tier over the coming campaign. MAURICIO ISLA IN A NUTSHELL. Isla arrives at QPR with plenty of experience from Serie A. The 26-year-old made over 150 appearances in Italy's top division with Udinese and current parent club Juventus - and that should stand him in fine stead to show his ability as a Premier League wing back. Harry Redknapp will deploy the Chilean on the right of his midfield in his favoured 3-5-2 formation, although Isla's versatility means he could be pushed further up or into a back four should Redknapp want to mix thing up. Isla boasts pace down the flank with the ability to whip the ball into the box and he should be a perfect fit at Loftus Road. New in blue (and red, and black): Mauricio Isla poses for a photo at Loftus Road after sealing his move. Getting to grips with the best: Isla takes on Brazil's Neymar during his time with Chile at the World Cup. Born: Buin, Chile, June 12, 1988 (age 26) Position: Right wing back/midfielder. Previous clubs: Udinese, Juventus. 2007-2012: Udinese (127 appearances, 6 goals) 2012-: Juventus (29 apps, 0 goal) World Cup 2014. Appearances: 4. Tackles won: 6. Blocks: 4. Recovered balls: 22. Pass Completion: 76.9%. Stats from FIFA.com. WHY YOU SHOULD HAVE ISLA IN YOUR MAILONLINE FANTASY FOOTBALL TEAM. Wing backs look to be a popular option with a lot of Premier League sides this year - and that offers the perfect option for Fantasy Football managers looking for more points from their defenders. Playing out at right wing back should give Isla the chance to run up and down that wing and with his crossing ability he will weigh in with a good few assists especially with a poacher like Charlie Austin to aim for. And at just £4.1million - why not go for him? That's £0.6m cheaper than Liverpool's hapless centre back Kolo Toure! TOP LEVEL EXPERIENCE. Isla was one of Chile's many stars that impressed with their brilliant team play at this summer's World Cup. They were unlucky to be beaten on penalties by hosts Brazil and Isla looked pretty good - making his loan signing a bit of a coup for QPR. There's not just that though - Isla has played in the Champions League with Juventus too, so he should have no trouble adapting to the testing conditions of the Premier League. BUT HOW WILL HE PICK UP POINTS? Attacking runs up the flank should provide a fair share of assists for a defender - while Isla should be an almost certain starter for the Rs, meaning plenty of appearance points. You wouldn't expect someone from a newly promoted side to pick up much in terms of clean sheets but that might be a bit different for QPR. Harry Redknapp knows the league well and with experienced defenders like Rio Ferdinand and the quality of Steven Caulker helping out in defence, there's still potential for bonuses for Fantasy Football managers. Italian touch: Isla in action during a Champions League game with Galatasaray for his parent club Juventus. Skillful: You can rely on Isla to grab some assist points in Fantasy Football - perfect for any manager. DON'T JUST TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT. Harry Redknapp knows a thing or two about what makes a good Premier League player - and he seems excited to see Isla in action for his newly promoted side. 'He's a top player and we're delighted to have him here,' Redknapp said. 'He showed his quality in the World Cup for Chile and it's a great loan signing for us.' 'He’s a versatile player, he’s full of energy. I’m confident he’ll be a really big asset for us this season.' Redknapp's words seem to indicate that he would even be happy playing Isla further up the field should the Rs change formation - great news for Fantasy Football managers looking to get more out of their defenders. Energetic: Isla will be up and down the flank for QPR this season - let's hope for big points from him! Write highlights for this article.","output":"1.

Trump Jr.'s statements on the meeting have not mentioned that he had been told the person he was dealing with might be acting for the Kremlin, reports Reuters. Trump Jr., who is quickly becoming a major figure in the investigation into alleged Russian election meddling, lawyered up on Monday, hiring New York-based attorney Allen Futerfas to represent him in the probe, the Hill reports.

Trump Jr. said Monday that he would \\"be happy\\" to discuss the meeting with the Senate Intelligence Committee. Expand this summary.","output":"The New York Times recently reported that before his meeting with Kremlin-linked Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya last year, Donald Trump Jr. had been informed via email that the meeting was a part of a Russian effort to help his father's campaign. The email in question, which is likely to be of great interest to investigators looking for evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow, was apparently sent by Rob Goldstone, the music publicist responsible for setting up the meeting with Veselnitskaya. Citing \\"three people with knowledge of the email,\\" the New York Times broke the story, and it is noteworthy that Trump Jr. has not mentioned that he was informed the person he was interacting with might be acting for the Kremlin. As a key figure in the investigation into alleged Russian election meddling, Trump Jr. has obtained legal representation, hiring New York-based attorney Allen Futerfas to represent him in the matter. Futerfas has described the reports on the meeting as \\"much ado about nothing.\\" In a statement, he explained that Goldstone had approached Trump Jr. with the suggestion that people had information on \\"alleged wrongdoing by Democratic Party frontrunner, Hillary Clinton, in her dealings with Russia.\\" Trump Jr's understanding of the matter was that someone had information that could potentially be helpful to the campaign, and it was provided by someone he knew. Despite the controversy, Trump Jr. stated on Monday that he would \\"be happy\\" to discuss the meeting with the Senate Intelligence Committee. The situation raises several questions and concerns about the possibility of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, as well as the transparency and honesty of those involved in the events leading up to, during, and after the meetings. In the coming days and weeks, the investigation, led by special counsel Robert Mueller, will continue to look into this email, as well as other evidence that might provide insight into the actions and motives of those within the Trump campaign. The email and the circumstances surrounding the meeting between Trump Jr. and Veselnitskaya are notable because they point to a possible connection between the Trump campaign and Russian efforts to assist in the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States. Moreover, if Trump Jr.’s meeting with Veselnitskaya was indeed an effort to obtain damaging information on Hillary Clinton from a Russian source, it may be considered as an offer of help from the Russian government and could provide insight into any possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. As the investigation proceeds, more details about similar communications and meetings may come to light. Trump Jr.’s willingness to discuss the matter with the Senate Intelligence Committee may provide further information for the investigators and shed light on the extent of his knowledge about Russian efforts to help his father’s campaign. However, at this point, many unanswered questions remain, and it is unclear what the implications of these reports will be for the ongoing investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Overall, the discovery of the email informing Donald Trump Jr. that his meeting with a Kremlin-linked lawyer was part of a Russian effort to help the Trump campaign raises significant questions and concerns about the possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow. The email's revelation, along with the meeting it references, will continue to be a central part of the ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign's potential ties to Russia. As further details emerge, the transparency and honesty of those involved, as well as the implications for the Trump administration, will be closely scrutinized."},{"instruction":"Translate to French: Ophthalmology (6 Articles) Blackwell NA, Kelly GJ, Lenton LM.","output":"Ophtalmologie (6 Articles) Blackwell NA, Kelly GJ, Lenton LM.

Who is more likely to develop hypertension in the future? Roger and Samantha are brother and sister. Both of them perform roughly the same amount of physical activity on a day-to-day basis. Roger, however, eats a lot more food relative to the amount he needs given his activity levels. Samantha, on the other hand, eats the appropriate amount of food given her level of activity. Hint: Any unused energy in food—whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids—is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Roger is more likely to develop hypertension in the future. The key factor that contributes to this conclusion is Roger's eating habits compared to Samantha's. Both Roger and Samantha engage in approximately the same amount of physical activity on a daily basis, which means their energy expenditure should be quite similar. However, Roger consumes a significantly larger amount of food than he needs, considering his activity levels. As a result, the excess energy he gets from his diet is stored as body fat. As mentioned in the hint, an additional 3,500 Calories of energy can result in almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. Over time, consistently consuming more food energy than required could lead to obesity. Obesity is defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 30.0 kg/m² or higher. BMI is an indicator of a person's body fat content, calculated by dividing their weight (in kilograms) by the square of their height (in meters). A high BMI and increased body fat content can raise the risk of health issues, such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. The fact that Roger is consuming more food than necessary and is potentially accumulating a higher amount of body fat may lead him to become obese. In contrast, Samantha maintains a well-balanced diet that matches her energy requirements and activity levels. Consequently, Samantha has a lower risk of developing obesity and its associated health complications, such as hypertension. In summary, considering their distinct dietary habits and the potential risk factors for obesity and hypertension, Roger is more likely to develop hypertension in the future as compared to his sister Samantha."},{"instruction":"Information: - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II. - The Iron Cross (abbreviated EK) was a military decoration in the Kingdom of Prussia, and later in the German Empire (18711918) and Nazi Germany (19331945). It was established by King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia in March 1813 backdated to the birthday of his late wife Queen Louise on 10 March 1813 during the Napoleonic Wars (EK 1813). Louise was the first person to receive this decoration (posthumous). The recommissioned Iron Cross was also awarded during the Franco-Prussian War (EK 1870), World War I (EK 1914), and World War II (EK 1939, re-introduced with a swastika added in the center). The Iron Cross was normally a military decoration only, though there were instances of it being awarded to civilians for performing military functions. Two examples of this were civilian test pilots Hanna Reitsch who was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class and 1st Class and Melitta Schenk Gräfin von Stauffenberg, who was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class, for their actions as pilots during World War II. - Melitta Schenk Gräfin von Stauffenberg, born Melitta Schiller (9 January 1903 8 April 1945), was a German Aviator who served as a test pilot in the Luftwaffe before and during World War II. - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. - Erich Walther ( 5 August 1903 -- 26 December 1947 ) was a German general of the Fallschirmjäger who served during World War II. He was also a recipient of the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords . The Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross and its higher grade Oak Leaves and Swords was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership . - Strategic bombing is a military strategy used in a total war with the goal of defeating the enemy by destroying its morale or its economic ability to produce and transport materiel to the theatres of military operations, or both. It is a systematically organized and executed attack from the air which can utilize strategic bombers, long- or medium-range missiles, or nuclear-armed fighter-bomber aircraft to attack targets deemed vital to the enemy's war-making capability.

This statement implies that the current ending of Wade led to 23 million fewer taxpayers in the United States. Hypothesis: Because of Wade ending, not many people will be paying taxes. This statement suggests that the ending of Wade has adversely affected the number of people paying taxes, which seems to be in line with the premise. Step-by-step analysis: 1. Identify the correlation between the premise and hypothesis: Both statements revolve around the impact of the ending of Wade on the number of taxpayers in the United States. 2. Compare the effects: The premise states that there would be 23 million more taxpayers had Wade ended differently, while the hypothesis suggests that not many people will be paying taxes due to the ending of Wade. 3. Determine the validity of the connection between premise and hypothesis: The hypothesis states an effect (not many people paying taxes) as a result of the same cause (Wade ending) that also resulted in 23 million fewer taxpayers according to the premise.

A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: An atom’s mass number is its mass in atomic mass units (amu), which is about equal to the total number of protons and neutrons in the atom. Different isotopes of an element have different mass numbers because they have different numbers of neutrons. Choices: - protons - electrons - nuclei - neutrons A: The answer is:","output":"neutrons. To further elaborate on the answer, let us dive deeper into the concept of isotopes and their mass numbers. Atoms consist of three main particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons and neutrons are located in the nucleus of an atom, while electrons orbit around the nucleus. Now, isotopes are variants of the same chemical element that have the same number of protons and electrons but differ in the number of neutrons in their atomic nucleus. The different number of neutrons in isotopes is what accounts for the variations in mass numbers. Since the mass number is the sum of protons and neutrons in an atom, different numbers of neutrons lead to distinct mass numbers. To illustrate, let's consider the case of carbon, one of the essential elements of life. Carbon has two stable isotopes, carbon-12 (12C) and carbon-13 (13C). Both isotopes have the same number of protons (6) and electrons (6) since they are both carbon, but they differ in the number of neutrons. Carbon-12 has 6 neutrons, while carbon-13 has 7 neutrons. This difference in neutrons affects their mass numbers, which are 12 and 13, respectively.

Which person didn't observe warming in winter? A:","output":"To answer this question correctly, let's first break it down by examining the climates and recent climate trends of both Australia and Antarctica. Australia has a diverse climate, varying from tropical in the north to temperate in the south. While the continent experiences four seasons, the northern region has mainly two seasons - the wet and the dry. Australia has been experiencing significant climate changes over the years, including increased temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, and more frequent and severe weather events. According to data from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM), the country has seen an overall increase in average temperatures, including during the winter months. In fact, BOM reported that Australia's winter temperatures in 2020 were well above average. Hence, it can be concluded that Jordan observed warming during the winter months while studying climate change in Australia. On the other hand, Antarctica, the southernmost continent, is primarily dominated by its thick ice sheet and extremely cold temperatures. It has an extremely cold and windy climate, making it the coldest and driest continent on earth. Research in recent years by the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) and other organizations has shown that the Antarctic Peninsula has been one of the most rapidly warming regions of the planet. However, the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, which is much larger, has shown a mixture of both slight cooling and warming trends depending on location, with overall minimal warming. Given that Antarctica experiences such extreme cold and the rate of warming varies depending on location, it would generally be more likely that Jeb, who studied Antarctica, did not observe warming during the winter months compared to Jordan, who studied Australia. Nonetheless, it is important to note that the answer could be more nuanced if we had specific information about the exact location where Jeb conducted his observations in Antarctica."},{"instruction":"You are considering whether to buy a product.

Hardy Rodenstock (born December 7, 1941 in Marienwerder (Kwidzyn), legal name Meinhard Gorke ) is a former publisher and manager of pop and Schlager music in Germany and is a prominent wine collector, connoisseur, and trader, with a special interest in old and rare wines. He became famous for his allegedly uncanny ability to track down old and very rare wines, and for arranging extravagant wine tastings featuring these wines. It has been alleged that Rodenstock is the perpetrator of an elaborate wine fraud. In 1992, a German court found that Rodenstock had \\"knowingly offered adulterated wine\\" for sale. In May 2008, a book about the controversy was published under the title The Billionaire's Vinegar, written by Benjamin Wallace. In the book a tritium test and two carbon-14 tests date the wine circa 1962. Later, a cesium-137 test gave similar results. Rodenstock was not available for comments on the publication of the book. Auctioneer Michael Broadbent, on the other hand, was unhappy with how his relationship to Rodenstock was portrayed in the book. In July 2009 it was announced that Michael Broadbent would sue Random House, the publishers of The Billionaire's Vinegar, for libel and defamation of character, on claims that the book made allegations that suggested that Broadbent had behaved in an unprofessional manner in the way in which he had auctioned some of these bottles and that his relationship and dealings with Hardy Rodenstock was suspected of being improper. The suit was filed in the United Kingdom, whose libel laws are favorable to the plaintiff. Unlike U.S. law, in English defamation law even true allegations can be defamatory. Random House initially stated it did not believe it had defamed Broadbent and would defend the lawsuit. In October 2009, Random House, avoiding trial, entered into a settlement agreement with Broadbent. In a statement read out in open court, Random House apologised unreservedly for making the allegations, and accepted that they were untrue. It gave an undertaking not to repeat the allegations and paid Broadbent undisclosed damages. It removed the book from sale in the United Kingdom. It also was reported that Wallace was not a party to the lawsuit or settlement, that Random House would be making no changes to the book, and that it would continue to publish the book in all territories except the UK. The film rights to The Billionaire's Vinegar have been purchased by a Hollywood consortium, while HBO simultaneously had bought the film rights to the corresponding The New Yorker article. Entity:","output":"The entity this text is about is Hardy Rodenstock (Meinhard Gorke)."},{"instruction":"Article: Fill a 5 gallon (18.9 L) bucket with sand, rocks, concrete, or even water. Use it to do curls or attach two of them to a bar or board and use as a bench press. Take 2 packs of 6 bottles each and duct tape them symmetrically to an iron bar you can grip easily. This barbell will be good for any exercise you do with a barbell, like lifts and presses. If these 2 packs are too much, don't use half filled bottles. Half-filled bottles will slosh around and shake the bar. Instead, tape individual filled bottles to the bar. If 2 packs aren't enough, use four or six packs of bottles taped to the bar. Alternately, tape individual bottles to each end of the bar. First line them horizontally along the bar side by side, then stack them on top of each other. Make sure to leave plenty of room for your hands to grip the bar in wide and narrow grips. The taping must be functional. Make horizontal, vertical, and diagonal rounds to wrap the packs to the bar. Tires are used in many workout and bodybuilding routines. You can add additional weights to regular tires when doing workouts, or you can go to a junkyard and find tractor tires. Flipping them and tying a rope to them to pull behind you are only two ways you can use a tire as a weight. Slosh tubes are long plastic tubes filled with about 40 pounds of water. But the workout benefits come from the uneven, sloshing water, which makes you use muscles as you try to keep the water balanced as it goes from one end of the tube to the other. You can make your own slosh tube with a PVC pipe. The pipe should be about 4 inches in diameter and 9-10 feet long. Place a cap on one end, then fill the pipe halfway with water. Cap the other end. Sandbags are similar to slosh tubes in that they are unstable, shifting weights that require you to engage more muscles. To make an easy sandbag, fill 5 or 6 gallon freezer bags with sand. You want the sandbag to be around 50 or 60 pounds. Double bag the bags so they don't break, and then tape the end. Place the bags into the duffle bag. Zip up the duffle bag, and you are ready to work out! An alternate way to make a sandbag is to use an old army/navy rucksack or canvas laundry bag. Use contractor garbage bags to fill with pea gravel. You can fill them with 10, 20, or 25 pounds. Fill 5 or 6 bags with gravel, and secure them with duct tape. Add them to the bag until your desired weight. Add and remove bags of sand or gravel for different weights. Use a scale to determine how heavy the bag is before you start working out, and add or remove weight accordingly. If you don't want to change the weight, you can add the sand or gravel directly into the bag. You cannot easily remove the weight or add weight if you do this. Make sure to leave some room in the interior bags so the sand or gravel can move around. If you are adding a large amount of weight, use a sturdier duffle bag. What is a summary?","output":"Summary: To create homemade workout equipment, you can fill a 5-gallon bucket with various materials and use it for curls or a bench press. Additionally, you can create a barbell by taping packs of water bottles to an iron bar, ensuring secure and functional taping. Tires, especially tractor tires, can be used in various workout routines, while slosh tubes can be made from PVC pipes filled with water for an unstable weight experience.

This was also the first World Cup held outside Europe and the Americas. The event took place from May 31 to June 30, 2002, featuring 32 teams from various nations across the world. South Korea and Japan were selected as co-hosts after winning the bid against Mexico in May 1996. This decision was deeply rooted in FIFA's policy to promote football in all continents, and Asia was recognized as an emerging football market with immense potential. In South Korea, matches were played in various cities, including Seoul, Incheon, Suwon, Daejeon, Daegu, Gwangju, Ulsan, and Seogwipo. The largest stadium in South Korea used for the event was Seoul World Cup Stadium, with a capacity of 66,704 seats. This stadium hosted the opening match between Senegal and France, as well as several other matches throughout the tournament, including the thrilling semi-final between South Korea and Germany. In Japan, matches took place in cities such as Yokohama, Saitama, Shizuoka, Kobe, Sapporo, Miyagi, Niigata, Ibaraki, Ōita, and Osaka. The largest stadium in Japan was Nissan (now International) Stadium in Yokohama, with a capacity of 70,000 seats. The venue was known for hosting the final match between Germany and Brazil, in which Brazil emerged as the winner, claiming their fifth World Cup title. The 2002 World Cup was notable for several reasons, including the surprising performance of the South Korean national team, which reached the semi-finals under the guidance of their Dutch coach Guus Hiddink. It was also memorable for the \\"Golden Goal\\" rule, which was used for the last time in this tournament, and instances of controversial officiating that raised questions about the quality and impartiality of some referees. The organization and logistics of the event were generally considered successful, despite initial concerns about the distance between the two co-hosting countries and the related travel issues.

Of the 60 million European military personnel who were mobilised from 1914 to 1918, 8 million were killed, 7 million were permanently disabled, and 15 million were seriously injured. Germany lost 15.1% of its active male population, Austria-Hungary lost 17.1%, and France lost 10.5%. In Germany, civilian deaths were 474,000 higher than in peacetime, due in large part to food shortages and malnutrition that weakened resistance to disease. By the end of the war, starvation caused by famine had killed approximately 100,000 people in Lebanon. Between 5 and 10 million people died in the Russian famine of 1921. By 1922, there were between 4.5 million and 7 million homeless children in Russia as a result of nearly a decade of devastation from World War I, the Russian Civil War, and the subsequent famine of 1920-1922.

The difference between these two figures gives the number of soldiers who were killed in excess of those who were disabled. Calculating this difference: 8,000,000 (Soldiers killed) - 7,000,000 (Soldiers disabled) = 1,000,000 Therefore, one million more soldiers were killed than were permanently disabled during the time period from 1914 to 1918. It should be noted that these figures present a stark picture of the devastating impact of the war on human lives and health. Not only were millions of lives lost on the battlefield, but an almost equivalent number of soldiers were left with permanent disabilities that would have drastically changed their lives. The physical and psychological trauma experienced by those who participated in the war had long lasting impact on their personal lives and the societies they were part of. Furthermore, the war not only affected soldiers, but also significantly harmed civilians with the rise in deaths due to food shortages, malnutrition, disease, and famine, as indicated by the article. The war and its ensuing political events also led to a large number of displaced individuals and refugees.

Sadly, the weather has been pretty gray and rainy so far – in fact the forecast has it cloudy and rainy every day until after we leave. So I was pleasantly surprised to be awakened by the sun peeking around the edges of the curtain in my room, especially after the weather yesterday in which the wind gusted 35-40 mph – hard enough to blow the patio furniture around on my balcony (and at one point, catching a chair and flipping it against the rail so hard that if the rail had been just a bit shorter, it might have gone over). Our group all agreed that we should take advantage of the nice weather and head to the old city walls and St. Lawrence Fort (Lovrijenac). We spent several hours walking the walls and climbing up and down stairs. The sun sparkled off the Adriatic Sea and cast a warm glow on the orange and red tiled roofs in old city.

Question 1: What is a split-second decision you made that changed your life? In this question, the focus is on the swift nature of the decision-making process. A split-second decision refers to a choice made almost instantly, often under pressure or in an emotionally charged situation. The requester is asking for an example of that kind of decision and wants to know how it changed your life. Question 2: How did one small decision change your life? This question is similar to the first, but it emphasizes the \\"small\\" aspect of the decision rather than the speed at which it was made. The request here is for an example of a minor or seemingly insignificant decision that had a significant impact on your life. Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?

Question 1 is specifically asking about rapid, split-second decisions, while question 2 is focused on the size or scale of the decision rather than the speed at which it was made. In conclusion, the two questions are not exactly the same, but they are related in terms of discussing life-altering decisions.

Article: Parents might tell older children to \\"Act your age\\". But some researchers say that is what persons from thirteen to nineteen years old are doing. While teenagers can look all grown up, studies have shown that their brains are still developing. How much this explains their behavior, though, is a subject of debate. Jay Giedd of America's National Institutes of Health is a leader in this area of research. Doctor Giedd has been studying a group of young people since 1991. They visit him every two years for imaging tests of their brains. He says considerable development continues in young people from the teenage years into the twenties. A part of the brain called the dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex appears especially undeveloped in teenagers. Researchers believe that this area controls judgment and consideration of risk. So, its underdevelopment may explain why young people seem more willing to take risks like driving too fast. Laurence Steinberg is a psychology professor at Temple University in Philadelphia. He says stronger laws and stronger parental control are needed to protect teens from themselves. That includes raising the age for driving. He says research shows that teenage brains are not fully equipped to control behavior. Other researchers, however, say there is not enough evidence to make a strong case for such findings. Psychologist Robert Epstein is a visiting scholar at the University of California in San Diego. Mr. Epstein notes that teen behavior differs from culture to culture. He says behavior depends for the most part on socialization. He believes that teenagers will demonstrate better, safer behavior if they spend more time with adults, and are treated more like them. But is that always true? Mike Males works at the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice in San Francisco. He suggests that all of this talk lately about brainless teens could be an attempt to take away attention from the reality. Writing in the New York Times, he says it is middle-aged adults whose behavior has worsened. In his... Question: Why do young people seem more willing to take adventures?

Over the next 400 million years or so, invertebrate diversity showed little overall trend, and vertebrate diversity shows an overall exponential trend. This dramatic rise in diversity was marked by periodic, massive losses of diversity classified as mass extinction events. A significant loss occurred when rainforests collapsed in the carboniferous. The worst was the Permian-Triassic extinction event, 251 million years ago. Vertebrates took 30 million years to recover from this event. What type of diversity showed an overall exponential trend?","output":"To answer the question, let's follow the information given in the article step-by-step: 1.

Think slowly and carefully, before giving your answer.","output":"Sainsbury's could theoretically attempt to buy Tesco; however, there are several factors to consider: 1. Market Share: Sainsbury's and Tesco are two of the largest supermarket chains in the UK. Combined, they would create an entity with significant market share, potentially leading to a reduction in competition within the retail market. As a result, a potential merger or acquisition might face scrutiny from regulatory authorities like the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in the UK. 2. Financial Feasibility: Tesco is currently larger than Sainsbury's in terms of market capitalization, revenues, and number of stores. Sainsbury's would need to secure significant financing to complete a deal of this magnitude, potentially involving an extensive borrowing program or issuing more shares. 3. Corporate Strategy: Sainsbury's and Tesco could have different corporate strategies and visions for their businesses. For a successful merger or acquisition to occur, aligning these strategies and visions will be critical. 4. Shareholder Approval: Both companies are publicly traded entities, meaning that significant shareholders would need to approve any deal. This can sometimes be a barrier to completing mergers or acquisitions if shareholders do not support the proposed terms. In conclusion, while it is theoretically possible for Sainsbury's to buy Tesco, there are numerous obstacles to consider. Regulatory concerns, financing challenges, corporate strategies, and shareholder approvals would all need to be addressed for such a transaction to occur."},{"instruction":"Process: - A mushroom gives off gills lined with basidia - The basidia gives off spores - The spores germinate - The spores create Hyphae - Multiple Hyphae meet and converge - They join with Mycelium - A hyphal knot forms in the ground - A primordia shoots out of the ground - A mushroom cap is formed. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is no bread for the mold to attach to happens, how will it affect more hyphal knots form in the ground. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"The given process describes the life cycle of a mushroom, which is a type of fungi. On the other hand, the perturbation hypothesis refers to a scenario where there is no bread for mold to attach to. To clarify the context, it is essential to understand that mold is a different group of fungi, and the life cycle/process mentioned above is not directly applicable to mold. Molds usually grow on organic matter like bread and rely on it as a source of nutrition for their growth and reproduction. They release enzymes to break down the available organic matter into simpler compounds, which they absorb for sustenance. Then, they produce spores, which are spread through the air and land on suitable surfaces to continue the mold growth cycle. Considering the perturbation hypothesis, let's analyze the effect of no bread (or the absence of a suitable substrate for mold) on the formation of hyphal knots in mushrooms: Since mold and mushrooms are both categorized as fungi, they have some similarities in their life cycles, particularly in the formation of hyphae and mycelium. However, they also have notable differences. Mushrooms usually grow in natural environments, thriving on decaying plant material, and do not require specific substrates like bread to develop. On the other hand, molds typically grow on moist organic matter, including bread, fruit, and other food items. Given the differences in their growth requirements, if no bread is available for mold to attach to, it has no direct impact on the formation of hyphal knots for mushroom growth. Mushrooms can still develop hyphal knots and progress through their life cycle using other organic materials in the environment, such as decaying plant matter. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of no bread for mold to attach to does not have a direct or indirect effect on the process of hyphal knot formation in mushrooms. Both mushrooms and molds are fungi, but they exhibit different growth requirements and thrive in different environments."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Information: - Pinyin, or Hàny Pnyn, is the official romanization system for Standard Chinese in mainland China, Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan. It is often used to teach Standard Chinese, which is normally written using Chinese characters. The system includes four diacritics denoting tones. Pinyin without tone marks is used to spell Chinese names and words in languages written with the Latin alphabet, and also in certain computer input methods to enter Chinese characters. - Korla, Kurla, or Kuerle ( lit. Krorain) is a mid-sized city in central Xinjiang, and is, administratively, a county-level city and the seat of the Bayin'gholin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture, which is larger than Great Britain and is the largest Chinese prefecture. Korla is known for its \\"fragrant\\" pears. - In geography, an oasis (plural: oases) is an isolated area of vegetation in a desert, typically surrounding a spring or similar water source, such as a pond or small lake. Oases also provide habitat for animals and even humans if the area is big enough. The location of oases has been of critical importance for trade and transportation routes in desert areas; caravans must travel via oases so that supplies of water and food can be replenished. Thus, political or military control of an oasis has in many cases meant control of trade on a particular route. For example, the oases of Awjila, Ghadames, and Kufra, situated in modern-day Libya, have at various times been vital to both North-South and East-West trade in the Sahara Desert. - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia.

The term Loulan is the Chinese transcription of the native name Krorän , and is used to refer to the city located near Lop Nur as well as the kingdom . The kingdom was renamed Shanshan ( ) after its king was assassinated by an envoy of the Han dynasty in 77 BCE ; however , the town at the northwestern corner of the brackish desert lake Lop Nur retained the name of Loulan . The kingdom included at various times settlements such as Niya , Charklik , Miran , and Qiemo . It was intermittently under Chinese control from the early Han dynasty until its abandonment centuries later . The ruins of Loulan are near the now desiccated Lop Nur in the Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture , Xinjiang , and are now completely surrounded by desert . - The Silk Road or Silk Route was an ancient network of trade routes that were for centuries central to cultural interaction through regions of the Asian continent connecting the East and West from China to the Mediterranean Sea. - Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture, often abbreviated to Bayingol (literally \\"rich river\\"), is an autonomous prefecture of the People's Republic of China, bordering Gansu to the east, Qinghai to the southeast, and the Tibet Autonomous Region to the south. It is the largest prefecture-level division nationally, with an area of , even larger than its neighbouring province of Gansu. The prefectural capital is Korla. - Trade, or commerce, involves the transfer of goods and/or services from one person or entity to another, often in exchange for money. A network that allows trade is called a market. - A desert is a barren area of land where little precipitation occurs and consequently living conditions are hostile for plant and animal life. The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to the processes of denudation. About one third of the land surface of the world is arid or semi-arid. This includes much of the polar regions where little precipitation occurs and which are sometimes called polar deserts or \\"cold deserts\\". Deserts can be classified by the amount of precipitation that falls, by the temperature that prevails, by the causes of desertification or by their geographical location. - Ruoqiang (Qarkilik) County (historically known as Charkliq, Chaqiliq, or Qakilik) is a county in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, China under the administration of the Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture.

Geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks an understanding of the Earth and its human and natural complexitiesnot merely where objects are, but how they have changed and come to be. It is often defined in terms of the two branches of human geography and physical geography. The four historical traditions in geographical research are: spatial analyses of natural and the human phenomena, area studies of places and regions, studies of human-land relationships, and the Earth sciences. Geography has been called \\"the world discipline\\" and \\"the bridge between the human and the physical sciences\\". - The Lop Desert, or the Lop Depression, is a desert extending from Korla eastwards along the foot of the Kuruk-tagh (meaning Dry Mountain) to the formerly terminal Tarim Basin in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China. It is an almost perfectly flat expanse with no topographic relief. Lake Bosten in the northwest lies at an altitude of 1,030 m to 1,040 m (3,380 to 3,410 ft), while the Lop Nur in the southeast is only 250 m lower. - Awjila (Berber: \\"Awilan\\", \\"Awjila\\", \\"Awgila\\" Latin: \\"Augila\\") is an oasis town in the Al Wahat District in the Cyrenaica region of northeastern Libya.

The jury ultimately rejected the state criminal charges, acquitting Zimmerman and sparking public outcry. Step 2: Explain the criteria for federal hate crimes Federal hate crime laws require clear proof of racial motivation behind an act, and legal experts argue that proving it in this case may be challenging. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has not yet announced whether they will pursue federal charges against Zimmerman but has faced pressure from civil rights groups and the public to do so. Step 3: Quote AG Holder on the high legal bar Attorney General Eric Holder has acknowledged the difficulty of pursuing federal hate crimes charges in the Zimmerman case, calling it a \\"high legal bar.\\" He emphasized that the DOJ will base its decision on the facts of the case and the applicable laws: \\"The Department of Justice will remain mindful of its solemn responsibility to act in a manner that is consistent with the facts and the law.\\" Step 4: Address President Obama's role Although President Obama has been vocal about the tragedy and the need for reflection on issues of race in the nation, he holds no decision-making authority over federal charges. Obama has urged the public to respect the jury's decision in Zimmerman's trial, stating that \\"A jury has spoken.\\" Conclusion: The potential pursuit of federal hate crimes charges in the Zimmerman case highlights the complex issue of racial motivation in criminal acts. With the high legal bar to clear, the Department of Justice must carefully examine the facts and laws in deciding whether or not to charge Zimmerman under federal hate crimes statutes."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Given these facts, what may die if it becomes too hot among the following options: - bacteria - Frogs - some mammals - h2o - tunicates - humans - thermometer - gravity Answer:","output":"Among the given options, bacteria, frogs, some mammals, tunicates, and humans may die if exposed to temperatures that are too high for their survival, as they are living organisms with biological processes that can be negatively affected by excessive heat. It is important to note that the temperature tolerance varies for different organisms, and while some might be able to survive higher temperatures, others may not. 1. Bacteria: As single-celled organisms, bacteria can thrive in various environmental conditions, including extreme temperatures. However, their adaptability has limits, and exposure to temperatures beyond their tolerance range will negatively affect their growth, reproduction, and metabolic processes. When exposed to excessively high temperatures, bacteria may die due to the denaturation of essential proteins and enzymes, DNA damage, or disruption of cellular membranes. 2. Frogs: Frogs are ectothermic animals, meaning that their body temperature relies on external heat sources. If the environmental temperature becomes too high, frogs may experience hyperthermia, leading to protein denaturation, metabolic dysfunctions, and/or dehydration. These factors can cause internal organ failure, compromising the frog's overall health and potentially leading to death. 3. Some mammals: While mammals, including humans, are generally better at adapting to varying environmental conditions, excessive heat can still be detrimental. Mammals have evolved mechanisms, such as sweating and panting, to cool their bodies in excessively hot environments. Nevertheless, extreme temperatures can overwhelm these systems, causing heat exhaustion or heat stroke, which can be fatal. 4. Tunicates: Tunicates are marine invertebrates that, like other organisms, have specific temperature ranges in which they can survive. If the water temperature becomes too high, it can affect their metabolic rate, reproduction, and overall physiology. Prolonged exposure to elevated temperatures may lead to stress, disease, or death. 5. Humans: Human bodies have several mechanisms to regulate body temperature (such as sweating and vasodilation), thus enabling us to survive within a range of environmental temperatures. However, excessive heat can cause serious health issues such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke, which can be life-threatening. It's important to mention that H2O (water), thermometer, and gravity are not living organisms and cannot \\"die\\" as a result of high temperatures. However, water can evaporate when exposed to high temperatures, and thermometers can become damaged or provide inaccurate readings if exposed to extreme heat. Gravity, being a fundamental force of nature, remains unaffected by temperature changes."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person that played drums for Warsaw on their first gig? On 20 July 1976, childhood friends Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook separately attended a Sex Pistols show at the Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall. Both were inspired by the Pistols' performance. Sumner said that he felt the Pistols \\"destroyed the myth of being a pop star, of a musician being some kind of god that you had to worship\\". The following day Hook borrowed £35 from his mother to buy a bass guitar. They formed a band with Terry Mason, who had also attended the gig; Sumner bought a guitar, and Mason a drum kit. After their schoolfriend Martin Gresty declined an invitation to join as vocalist after getting a job at a factory, the band placed an advertisement for a vocalist in the Manchester Virgin Records shop. Ian Curtis, who knew them from earlier gigs, responded and was hired without audition. Sumner said that he \\"knew he was all right to get on with and that's what we based the whole group on. If we liked someone, they were in.\\"Buzzcocks manager Richard Boon and frontman Pete Shelley have both been credited with suggesting the band name \\"Stiff Kittens\\", but the band settled on \\"Warsaw\\" shortly before their first gig, a reference to David Bowie's song \\"Warszawa\\". Warsaw debuted on 29 May 1977 at the Electric Circus, supporting the Buzzcocks, Penetration and John Cooper Clarke. Tony Tabac played drums that night after joining the band two days earlier. Reviews in the NME by Paul Morley and in Sounds by Ian Wood brought them immediate national exposure. Mason became the band's manager and Tabac was replaced on drums in June 1977 by Steve Brotherdale, who also played in the punk band Panik. Brotherdale tried to get Curtis to leave the band and join Panik, and even had Curtis audition. In July 1977, Warsaw recorded five demo tracks at Pennine Sound Studios, Oldham. Uneasy with Brotherdale's aggressive personality, the band fired him soon after the sessions: driving home from the studio, they pulled over and asked Brotherdale to check on a flat tyre; when he got out of the car, they drove off.In August...

First, he took a chemical system that was at equilibrium. He labeled it as case E. Then he changed the temperature of the system. He labeled that experiment as case T. Finally, he observed two more experiments, case A and case B. In case A forward reaction was favored, and in case B reverse reaction was favored. and a hint : Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase. Please answer this question : Would the reactants concentration increase or decrease in case A than in case B?","output":"In order to answer this question, let's first review the given information and recall Le Châtelier's principle, which states that when a chemical system at equilibrium experiences a stress, the system will attempt to counteract the stress by adjusting the equilibrium until a new balance is established. In cases A and B, both represent disturbed equilibriums with different stress factors that favored either the forward or the reverse reactions. In case A, the forward reaction is favored. This means that the reactants are being consumed to form products at a faster rate than the reverse reaction. As a result of this disturbance, the system is no longer at equilibrium and will attempt to re-establish equilibrium by favoring the forward reaction. Consequently, the concentration of the reactants will decrease, and the concentration of the products will increase. The chemical system will continue to shift in this direction until a new equilibrium is reached. In case B, the reverse reaction is favored. This means that the products are being consumed to form reactants at a faster rate than the forward reaction. The disturbance in equilibrium causes the system to respond by favoring the reverse reaction. This will result in an increase in the concentration of the reactants and a decrease in the concentration of the products. The chemical system will continue to adjust until a new equilibrium is established. To address the question, in case A, the concentration of the reactants would decrease compared to case B, where the concentration of the reactants would increase. This outcome results from the different reactions being favored in each scenario based on the applied stress, according to Le Châtelier's principle."},{"instruction":"Continue writing the following text.

The nearest town, Fort McMurray, Alberta was a small fur trading post, other markets were far away, and transportation costs were too high to ship the raw bituminous sand for paving. In 1915, Sidney Ells of the Federal Mines Branch experimented with separation techniques and used the bitumen to pave 600 feet of road in Edmonton, Alberta. Other roads in Alberta were paved with oil sands, but it was generally not economic. During the 1920s Dr. Karl A. Clark of the Alberta Research Council patented a hot water oil separation process and entrepreneur Robert C. Fitzsimmons built the Bitumount oil separation plant, which between 1925 and 1958 produced up to 300 barrels (50 m3) per day of bitumen using Dr. Clark's method. Most of the bitumen was used for waterproofing roofs, but other uses included fuels, lubrication oils, printers ink, medicines, rust and acid-proof paints, fireproof roofing, street paving, patent leather, and fence post preservatives.

Context: Yes; I have a rare form of cluster/ice pick headaches that can affect any part of my body. It’s quite uncommon, but essentially I can get an excruciating migraine in my arm, leg, etc., on top of getting them in my head/temples. For years my family and I had no idea what was happening, and with no vocabulary to properly explain what was happening, I described it for about fifteen years as “beeping.” Doctors told us it was anything from growth spurts to a grab for attention, and for a while I gave up trying to figure out what they were. When they got worse and I couldn’t ignore them anymore, I was finally sent to a neurologist, who diagnosed me with ice pick headaches. I let out a sigh of relief that I didn’t even know I was holding in; I felt like I could finally breathe. Years of stress and confusion washed off of me, and I started taking a beta blocker to prevent them. I’ve been on them for a few years now, and it’s changed my life for the better. I used to be terrified of learning to drive, for many reasons, but a large one being that if I got an ice pick headache on the road, I couldn’t guarantee the safety of those around me if I was at the wheel. Now I’m considering finally getting my license (considering - I still don’t like being behind the wheel), I don’t double over in white hot pain randomly anymore, and when I do get a cluster headache, I can still function. It almost sounds a little silly, but really, they were crippling, and being able to work through them on my own? It’s the greatest gift I’ve given to myself. You know yourself better than anyone, even if you feel like you don’t know yourself. If something feels wrong, don’t just live with it - keep pushing for a correct diagnosis!

Kimmel was a military officer who served on both sides of the American Civil War, as well as the father of what admiral in the United States Navy was the Commander in Chief of the United States Fleet at the time of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor? Answer:","output":"Manning Marius Kimmel (1822-1890) was an intriguing figure in American history, a military officer who did indeed serve on both sides during the turbulent period of the American Civil War. His military career started when he joined the United States Army and served during the Mexican-American War. Later on, during the American Civil War, he initially served under the Union, but eventually made the decision to defect to the Confederate side. Although the motives of his defection are not completely clear, it may have been driven by a combination of personal reasons and regional loyalty, which was not uncommon during the time of the Civil War. When examining the personal life of Manning M. Kimmel, it becomes apparent that he was not only a military man but also a family man. One of his sons, Husband Edward Kimmel (1882-1968), went on to have a long and influential career in the United States Navy, ultimately rising to the high-ranking position of admiral. Admiral Husband E. Kimmel was a key figure in American history, particularly during the tumultuous years of World War II. He assumed command as the Commander in Chief of the United States Fleet on February 1, 1941, and held this position when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. This tragic event, which led to the United States formally entering the war, has been deeply scrutinized by historians ever since. As the Commander in Chief of the United States Fleet at the time of the Pearl Harbor attack, Admiral Kimmel faced intense scrutiny regarding his preparedness and the impotence of the United States forces during the surprise onslaught by the Japanese. In the aftermath of the attack, Admiral Kimmel, along with Lieutenant General Walter Short, was relieved of his duties and demoted in rank. A series of investigations into the events surrounding the attack on Pearl Harbor focused on the intelligence failures and potential incompetence of the leadership, with Admiral Kimmel shouldering much of the blame. However, it is essential to understand the broader context of political and military factors that contributed to the attack on Pearl Harbor and to acknowledge that Admiral Kimmel was not solely responsible for the outcome. The United States was unprepared for the imminent threat of global war, and intelligence signals regarding the impending Japanese assault were notoriously mismanaged. Throughout the years that followed, there were numerous efforts to posthumously exonerate Kimmel and Short, and in 2000, the United States Congress issued a statement acknowledging that both men were not solely responsible for the disaster at Pearl Harbor. Thus, while their careers were tarnished by the unfortunate events of December 7, 1941, it is important to remember that the historical legacy of Manning M. Kimmel and his son, Husband E. Kimmel, is one of service, dedication, and resiliency in the face of adversity."},{"instruction":"Translate to Russian: But the clouds are not \\"squeezed out\\" as in the case of thunder clouds dispersion: they are lifted to a certain altitude, where they stop being rain clouds.

В частности, эта фраза объясняет, что вместо \\"выжимания\\" облака поднимаются на определенную высоту в атмосфере, на которой они уже не могут вызвать дождь.

Would \\"In statistics and probability theory , standard deviation (represented by the symbol sigma, σ ) shows how much variation or dispersion exists from the average ( mean ), or expected value.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"Standard deviation, represented by the symbol sigma (σ), is a key concept in statistics and probability theory. It is a measure that quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values from their mean (average) value. In simpler terms, the standard deviation helps to determine the spread of data points in a dataset and provides an insight into its overall consistency. A smaller standard deviation indicates that the data points are closely packed around the mean, whereas a large standard deviation suggests that the data points are more dispersed. The answer provided, \\"In statistics and probability theory, standard deviation (represented by the symbol sigma, σ) shows how much variation or dispersion exists from the average (mean), or expected value,\\" is indeed a reasonable response as it encapsulates the basic definition of standard deviation. However, to better understand the importance and application of this concept, it is essential to delve into further detail. Standard deviation is typically calculated using the following steps: 1. Compute the mean (average) of the dataset. 2. Subtract the mean from each data point and square the result. This calculates the squared difference for each data point. 3. Find the average of these squared differences. This is called the variance. 4. Take the square root of the variance, resulting in the standard deviation. There are two primary types of standard deviations – population standard deviation and sample standard deviation. - Population standard deviation applies to the complete dataset and is a fixed parameter that does not depend on the sample chosen. It is generally denoted by the lowercase Greek letter sigma (σ). - Sample standard deviation, on the other hand, is an estimate of the population standard deviation derived from a specific sample of the dataset. It is generally represented by the lowercase letter s. Standard deviation is an essential tool for statisticians and researchers as it allows them to make inferences and predictions about a population based on a sample. It is used in various contexts, such as hypothesis testing, quality control, finance, and investment analysis, to name a few. The concept enables analysts to gauge the degree of uncertainty and risk associated with a particular dataset, ultimately aiding in the interpretation of results and decision-making processes."},{"instruction":"What is the answer: What does the name 'Pont' as in Pontefract or Pontypoolmean?","output":"The name 'Pont' as in Pontefract or Pontypool has its origins in the Latin word \\"pons,\\" which means \\"bridge.\\" The presence of 'Pont' in these place names indicates the historical significance of bridges in these particular areas. To understand the meaning behind each name, let's analyze them separately. 1. Pontefract: Pontefract is a historic market town located in West Yorkshire, England. The name Pontefract can be broken down into two parts - 'Pont' and 'Fract.' The first part, 'Pont,' refers to the bridge, as previously mentioned. The latter part, 'Fract,' is derived from the Latin word \\"fractus,\\" which means broken or destroyed. Thus, the name Pontefract essentially means \\"broken bridge.\\" The history behind this name goes back to the time when the Romans built an important bridge in the region. The bridge connected the two primary Roman roads - Ermine Street and Dere Street - and played a significant role in facilitating transportation in the area. When the Romans left Britain, the bridge eventually fell into disrepair and was destroyed, leaving behind the town that came to be known as Pontefract, or \\"broken bridge.\\" 2. Pontypool: Pontypool is a town in the county borough of Torfaen, South Wales. Like Pontefract, the name Pontypool also has two parts - 'Pont' and 'ypool.' The prefix 'Pont' signifies the presence of a bridge, and 'ypool' is a modification of 'pool,' a term often used to describe a body of water, like a small lake or pond. In this case, 'ypool' refers to the Afon Llwyd river, which flows through Pontypool's area. The name Pontypool thus translates to \\"the bridge over the pool\\" or \\"the bridge by the river.\\" The reason behind this name goes back to the construction of a bridge over the Afon Llwyd river, which had a significant impact on the area's development. The bridge connected the western and eastern sides of the river and fostered local trade, industry, and communication. As a result, a settlement grew around the bridge, eventually giving rise to the town of Pontypool. In conclusion, the name 'Pont' as seen in Pontefract and Pontypool refers to the historical prominence of bridges in these areas. The bridges played essential roles in the development and expansion of these towns, becoming integral symbols of their respective origins and histories."},{"instruction":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Katharine Meyer Graham was once described as \\"the most powerful woman in America.\\" She was not a government official or elected representative.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"Yes, the two questions are closely related as they both inquire about investing in Social Trade Biz. However, there is a slight difference in their emphasis. The first question, \\"Is it safe to invest in social trade biz?\\" is focused on determining the safety or risk involved in investing in Social Trade Biz. To answer this question, one would need to evaluate the platform's legitimacy, track record, and potential risks or challenges that might be associated with investing in it. Step 1: Research the legitimacy of Social Trade Biz and its credentials. Step 2: Evaluate the platform's track record in terms of its users' experiences and rate of success. Step 3: Analyze potential risks and challenges associated with investing in Social Trade Biz. Step 4: Summarize the findings and provide a conclusion about the safety of investing in the platform. The second question, \\"Can I invest in social trade?\\" is more focused on the person's ability, or whether it is possible for them to invest in Social Trade Biz. Step 1: Determine if the platform accepts investments from your country or region. Step 2: Check for any legal or regulatory restrictions on investing in Social Trade Biz. Step 3: Ascertain if you meet the minimum investment requirements or criteria set by the platform. Step 4: Assess if you can afford the investment and are willing to take the associated risks. Step 5: Provide an answer to whether or not the person can invest in Social Trade Biz based on the findings.

A. sadness B. hopelessness C. loss of innocence D. confusion E. anger The best answer is Answer:","output":"To determine the best answer, I will analyze each option and its relation to the negative consequence of learning about the world. A. Sadness: Learning about the world may include becoming aware of harsh realities, natural disasters, and moral dilemmas that can evoke sadness. B. Hopelessness: Acquiring knowledge about world issues, such as ongoing wars, extreme poverty, and environmental degradation, can lead to feelings of hopelessness. C. Loss of innocence: As a person learns more about the complexities and challenges of the world, the idealistic perspective they may have held as a child can fade, resulting in a loss of innocence. D. Confusion: While acquiring knowledge about the world can provide clarity, it can also lead to confusion due to conflicting information, beliefs, and perspectives. E. Anger: Learning about injustices or unethical actions in the world can provoke anger in some individuals. After analyzing each option, I conclude that the best answer is: Answer: C. Loss of innocence This choice encompasses a fundamental change that occurs when someone learns about the world. While sadness, hopelessness, confusion, and anger can result from different aspects of learning, the loss of innocence reflects an overarching, negative consequence that occurs when one's understanding of the world becomes more nuanced and complex."},{"instruction":"Lizzy: A building has four floors with ten rooms each. Legacy has to clean each room, and it takes her 6 hours to clean one room. If she earns 15 per hour of work, calculate the total amount of money she makes from cleaning all the floors in the building.. Me: Hmmm, let me think. I think this is the detailed solution:","output":"Step 1: Calculate the total number of rooms in the building. A building has four floors with 10 rooms each, so to find the total number of rooms, you can multiply the number of floors by the number of rooms per floor: 4 floors * 10 rooms/floor = 40 rooms Step 2: Calculate the total time it takes to clean all the rooms. If it takes Legacy 6 hours to clean one room, we can multiply this time by the total number of rooms to find out how long it would take her to clean the entire building: 6 hours/room * 40 rooms = 240 hours Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money earned from cleaning all the rooms. Legacy earns 15 per hour of work. Given it will take her 240 hours to clean the entire building, we can multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours worked to calculate her total earnings: 15/hour * 240 hours = 3600 So, Legacy would make a total of 3600 from cleaning all the floors in the building."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"\\"La vida es como andar en bicicleta: para mantener el equilibrio, debes seguir avanzando.\\" This sentence is in Spanish and translates to, \\"Life is like riding a bicycle: to keep your balance, you must keep moving forward.\\" It is a metaphor often attributed to Albert Einstein, which conveys the idea that in order to overcome challenges and maintain progress, one must continue to strive forward without dwelling on past setbacks or victories. The message resonates with people across various cultures, as it emphasizes resilience, perseverance, and personal growth, which are universally valued attributes."},{"instruction":"I find I enjoy this show, but the format needs some work. First off, the good attributes. I like how this show will take us through the day-to-day life of an addict because the producers have a knack at getting the addict to show us how bad they've allowed their lives to become. This is followed by an intervention which is then followed by an outcome. Intervention doesn't candy-coat things and sometimes the outcome (often short term due to the constraints of time between filming and airing) is a negative outcome. This makes the positive outcomes all the better. Another thing I like about the show is the quality of the camera work. Given the reality that these cameramen have to squeeze anywhere and don't have the benefit of re shooting scenes the photography is surprisingly good and stable. It's actually superior to scripted shows like \\"The Shield\\" where the photography is so bad it can induce nausea. Now for the bad. An episode will sometimes contain two completely different and unrelated cases that will be mixed together during the show. You'll get caught up in the story of one addict then suddenly you're thrown into the story of another. Get caught up in that story then suddenly you're back to the first addict...or are you? By now you may have forgotten which case the individual currently on screen belong to. This constant flip-flopping between addicts really gets disruptive during the intervention scenes because the show will even mix together the two completely unrelated interventions! I once heard the marketing B.S. reason for this poor design: \\"The show can get so intense that switching to another addict allows the viewer time to absorb what they're watching.\\" Oh please. Clearly the reason this is done is because they have two cases that aren't big enough for an hour show so they mix two together. By mixing them instead of giving each a half hour block, like they should, it forces the viewer to watch the entire thing (and the commercials) if they are interested in one case but not the other. I used to find these \\"blender\\" episodes so annoying that I'd only tell my TiVo to record episodes containing one addict, but then it became easier just to record all of them. What is the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review is mixed. The reviewer appreciates certain aspects of the show, such as its realistic portrayal of addicts' lives, the quality of the camera work, and its willingness to show both positive and negative outcomes. However, they also express strong dissatisfaction with the episode format, specifically the way each episode can mix together two unrelated cases, which they find disruptive and confusing."},{"instruction":"I ' ve been packing stuff up all this week getting ready for the move on Saturday , and hopefully I 'll be able to get 4 of my friends to help my mother and I out that day carrying all the heavy stuff .

Sometimes an inventor comes up with a wholly new idea, but more often inventions are simply improvements on an older design. With a little imagination and creativity , an old idea can suddenly become something new. However, creating a new invention means much more than having a brilliant idea. A good designer follows the design process: identifying the challenge, researching and brainstorming ideas , designing a solution, testing and evaluating the ideas, and finally building the product. Designers also use science, math, technology, and engineering to design a tool that satisfies the need they identified. Anyone can be an inventor --even kids! For example, Chester Greenwood was just fifteen years old when he invented a product that changed his life. In fact, his idea was so good that his invention supported him for the rest of his life. You may not know his name, but you probably know his invention --earmuffs ! The inspiration for his earmuff design came to Chester when he was ice-skating. His ears were cold, and he decided to find a way to keep them warm. With the help of his grandmother, he made a new product to protect his ears and at the age of eighteen, Chester patented his earmuff design. Many other famous inventors started young as well. Margaret Knight --the inventor of the flat-bottomed brown paper bag --is said to have created a safety device for textile looms when she was just twelve years old. Another example is Thomas Edison, one of the greatest inventors in history, who applied for his first patent when he was just twenty-one years old.

(A parody of Wallace Wimple and his wife \\"Sweetie Face\\".) The scene cuts to Daffy eating corn while singing \\"I Dream of Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair\\" minding his business. A shadow of Meek is show getting ready to chop off Daffy's head. Then he jumps and shouts \\"WATCH IT, BUB!!!\\" directly in his face. After a brief talk to Meek, he flicks his beak at his face and marches to a hay stack. Meek chops the stack various times and on the last chop, he thinks he kills the duck. Daffy fakes his death by squirting ketchup and throwing his feathers around (\\"You crushed my little head!\\") This fools Meek by pretending he is beheaded and runs rapidly. Meek feels sad and goes back to his house, where Daffy is seen putting lots of sugar cubes into a cup of coffee. Meek guiltily tells him that he has killed a duck. Daffy cheers up Meek into giving him a cup of coffee and asks how many lumps (of sugar) his wife usually gives him. Meek shows Daffy a 'lump' (a bump on his head), and Daffy hits him on the head (giving him another 'lump') and pours cream on it. Daffy dances on the cakes and pies, singing \\"Shortening Bread\\", and Meek immediately recognizes the duck he thought he killed (\\"Say. That's that Daffy Duck.\\") Daffy then utters 'YOU AIN'T JUST WHISTLING DIXIE!!!', then throws a pie at him, leading into a war between himself and Meek.

Hornsby has also achieved recognition for his solo albums and performances, his touring band Bruce Hornsby and the Noisemakers, his bluegrass project with Ricky Skaggs and his appearances as a session and guest musician. Bruce Randall Hornsby was born in Williamsburg, Virginia, a son of Robert Stanley Hornsby (1920-1998), an attorney, real-estate developer and former musician, and his wife, nee Lois Saunier. Raised a Christian Scientist, he has two siblings: Robert Saunier \\"Bobby\\" Hornsby, a realtor with Hornsby Realty and locally known musician, and Jonathan Bigelow Hornsby, an engineer who has collaborated in songwriting.

Answer:","output":"The Vampire ride at Chessington World of Adventures Resort, a theme park situated in Chessington, UK, initially opened on April 11, 1990. It was designed by John Wardley, a British amusement ride designer, and manufactured by Arrow Dynamics, an American amusement park ride manufacturer. The Vampire ride is a suspended swinging roller coaster known for its unique, bat-themed design and ambience, with its creepy forest surroundings and gothic-themed station. When the ride started operation in 1990, it became an instant hit among the visitors, and soon became one of the most popular and enduring attractions within the park. However, the ride started experiencing technical issues in the early 2000s, primarily due to the age of the ride's system and the fact that Arrow Dynamics had gone bankrupt, making it difficult to maintain and source replacement parts. As a result, Chessington World of Adventures Resort decided to invest in a major refurbishment and upgrade of the Vampire ride. The refurbishment process commenced in September 2001, when the original ride was closed for renovations. Vampire was then re-launched in March 2002 with significant upgrades, including new trains and a revamped ride system. This time, the ride was manufactured by Vekoma, a Dutch amusement ride manufacturer known for its roller coasters and other thrill rides. The new trains adopted the floorless, hanging design, giving riders a more thrilling experience in contrast to the previous sit-down, ski-lift-style seating. Other changes included a smoother ride experience, an altered layout, and improvements in theming, such as enhanced lighting and special effects. The ride's popularity soared once again, solidifying its status as a must-visit attraction at Chessington World of Adventures Resort. In conclusion, the Vampire ride at Chessington initially opened in 1990 and was later refurbished and upgraded in 2002 to its current form. The ride remains one of the park's most iconic and beloved attractions, providing visitors with a thrilling and immersive experience filled with gothic ambience and high-flying excitement."},{"instruction":"Options are: (1).

The man was in the store's tool section and went unnoticed until he began grabbing several small saws, including one meant to cut sheet rock, and started using them on his arms. \\"He cut both arms with hand saws down to the bone,\\" said West Covina police Cpl. Rudy Lopez. Officers received several 911 calls and arrived to find the man lying unconscious in the aisle in a pool of blood. An off-duty paramedic from the Pasadena Fire Department had been shopping nearby and hurried to the scene. \\"The officers had already found the man down, face down, blood all over the store, multiple aisles, and the whole store is in chaos,\\" the paramedic, Art Hurtado, told KNBC-TV. Hurtado thought the man was dead but when he checked he found breath and a slight pulse and said he thought to himself, \\"I can save this guy.\\" With help from police and store employees, Hurtado collected rope and rags from store shelves and put makeshift tourniquets on both arms, most likely saving the man's life, police said. \\"Were we in a good place for it? No, but you improvise,\\" Hurtado said. \\"If I didn't have rope I'd have used my shoelaces. We would have made it work.\\" The man was in surgery hours after the incident, said Lopez, who knew no more about his condition. The man, who looked to be in his 40s, was carrying no identification, has been unable to answer questions, and was not heard saying anything in the store, so police do not know his name or why he cut himself, Lopez said. Police interviewed about five people who said they saw what happened, and Lopez said there were likely many more who quickly left the disturbing scene. \\"It was pretty graphic,\\" he said. What was this article about?","output":"This article is about a man who went to a Home Depot store in California and deliberately hurt himself with saws in the aisles.

By Dan Bloom PUBLISHED: 04:31 EST, 13 February 2014 | UPDATED: 05:36 EST, 13 February 2014 Disney has dropped the voice of Donald Duck in the Middle East after he said Israel should be demolished. Wael Mansour no longer works for the global corporation - whose founder Walt Disney was famously accused of being racist and anti-semitic - after he tweeted: 'I truly wish #Israel is demolished, I hate Zionism, I have so much hate inside me with every single child they murder or land they seize'. He insisted his message was 'anti-Zionist', claiming Israelis were 'just a bunch of Polish / Ethiopian immigrants roughly 70 years old'. Pressed on whether there was a reason for Mr","output":"Mansour's firing, a Disney spokesperson revealed that the decision was made in the interest of preserving the company's reputation and values. The corporation has long been associated with family-friendly entertainment and promoting positivity, and Mr. Mansour's incendiary remarks on such a sensitive issue were seen as highly inappropriate and damaging to the company's image. Disney has grown from its early days as an animation studio to become a global conglomerate featuring multiple divisions, including film, television, theme parks, and consumer products. Each of these divisions is built upon a commitment to providing wholesome entertainment for people of all ages and backgrounds, and Mr. Mansour's tweet was found to be in direct conflict with these goals. Many observers have noticed an evolving climate of sensitivity and corporate social responsibility in recent years, which has prompted a heightened response from companies like Disney regarding messages that could potentially cause offense or harm to others. These actions are a reflection of a broader trend where organizations are increasingly accountable for the actions of their employees, especially when it comes to public statements or social media. Critics argue that the tweet, which Mr. Mansour posted on his personal account, should not affect his employment status with the company. They opine that his personal views, though controversial, do not negate his abilities as a voice actor and Disney should respect his freedom of speech. However, supporters of the decision point out that it is reasonable for Disney to want to distance themselves from someone who publicly espouses divisive opinions, particularly when those opinions are at odds with the company's commitment to inclusivity and positivity. While Mr. Mansour's comments about Israel and Zionism might have gained prominence due to his association with Disney, it should be noted that Middle East politics and geopolitical tensions often involve emotions running high and deep-seated animosities. Personal opinions on these subjects can be very divisive. However, as a multinational corporation, Disney's primary responsibility is to its customers and stakeholders. By terminating Mr. Mansour's contract, they aim to protect their brand image and maintain their commitment to providing family-friendly entertainment worldwide. In light of the firing, Disney has embarked on a search for a new voice actor to replace Mr. Mansour in the Middle East as Donald Duck. Their choice will likely be scrutinized closely as they strive to find a candidate who fully embodies the values of their organization. What this incident has highlighted is that companies today need to be ever more vigilant about the actions and statements of their employees, as well as maintaining clear codes of conduct to guide behavior within their ranks, so as not to jeopardize the hard-won trust and loyalty of their global customer base."},{"instruction":"Compania neagă faptul că practicile sale sunt inechitabile sau că preţurile sunt prea mari, declarând că are \\"clienţi satisfăcuţi\\".

Answer:","output":"After thoroughly researching and analyzing the provided information, it is clear that the musician who is Scottish among the two options, Rose McDowall and Crispian Mills, is Rose McDowall. Rose McDowall, born on October 21, 1959, in Glasgow, Scotland, is a Scottish musician. She began her music career in the early 1980s as the singer and guitarist of the punk-pop duo Strawberry Switchblade, which she formed with her friend Jill Bryson, a fellow Scotswoman. The duo gained significant popularity and saw success with their hit song \\"Since Yesterday,\\" which was released in 1984. Although the band did not last long and disbanded in 1986, McDowall's career continued to flourish. Over the years, Rose McDowall has worked on various musical projects, including collaborations with other prominent musicians. She was notably involved in several collaborations with the experimental, post-industrial music collective Coil, as well as the neofolk band Current 93. Additionally, she has been a part of bands such as Spell, with Boyd Rice, and Sorrow, which she founded with her then-husband Robert Lee. Throughout her career, McDowall has explored multiple genres, including post-punk, gothic rock, experimental, and neofolk, retaining her Scottish identity all the while. On the other hand, Crispian Mills, full name Crispian John David Boulting, was born on January 18, 1973, in Hammersmith, London, England. He is the lead singer and guitarist of the English rock band Kula Shaker. Mills, the son of the famous English actress Hayley Mills and film director Roy Boulting, was a key member of Kula Shaker during the Britpop era in the late 1990s. The band gained fame with their debut album 'K,' which was released in 1996 and showcased Indian-influenced music combined with elements of Britpop and psychedelic rock. Though the band disbanded in 1999, they later reunited in 2004 and have been active ever since. In conclusion, although both Rose McDowall and Crispian Mills have made significant contributions to their respective music scenes, Rose McDowall is the Scottish musician among the two. Her versatile career and collaborations across genres have left an indelible mark on the Scottish music landscape, while Crispian Mills's association with the English rock scene and his British origin set the two musicians apart."},{"instruction":"Bailey got on a train and went back to her home as quick as she could. Given the question \\"What will Bailey want to do next?\\", is \\"buy a ticket at the train station\\" a valid answer? The answer is:","output":"No, \\"buy a ticket at the train station\\" is not a valid answer to the question, \\"What will Bailey want to do next?\\" From the information provided, we know that Bailey has already boarded the train and is on her way back home as quickly as possible. Since she is already on the train, it is safe to assume that she has purchased a ticket prior to boarding, as per standard procedure at train stations. Therefore, Bailey would not need to buy a ticket at the train station next. Instead, a more valid answer to \\"What will Bailey want to do next?\\" could involve activities she might want to do once she has reached her destination, which is her home in this case. Possibilities include: 1. If Bailey is returning from a long trip, she might want to unpack and clean up her belongings first. 2. If Bailey is tired from her journey, she might want to take a shower or bath to freshen up and then rest. 3. Bailey may need to attend to personal errands, such as checking her mail, watering her plants, or taking care of any pets she might have. 4. If Bailey went home quickly because of an urgent or emergency situation, she might want to address that issue as her next priority. This could include attending to a family emergency, dealing with an urgent work issue, or solving a problem that requires her immediate attention. 5. Bailey may also want to reconnect with friends or family members upon returning home, either through phone calls, messaging, or in-person visits. 6. Depending on the time of day, Bailey might want to prepare or eat a meal once she gets home since traveling can often lead to irregular meal times. These are just a few examples of valid answers to the question \\"What will Bailey want to do next?\\" The key takeaway is that buying a ticket at the train station is not a valid answer since Bailey has already boarded the train and is en route to her home."},{"instruction":"Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean Translate to Russian Russian:","output":"Разбросанные острова в Индийском океане Острова, разбросанные в Индийском океане, представляют собой ряд небольших островов и атоллов, принадлежащих различным странам и находящихся в разных частях океана.

Article:","output":"Title: Real Madrid's New Acquisition: Brazilian Midfielder Lucas Silva Set to Bolster Squad Real Madrid has announced the signing of Brazilian midfielder Lucas Silva, who will be presented to fans on Monday. The 22-year-old, who has made his mark as an emerging talent with Brazilian club Cruzeiro, was signed for a hefty transfer fee of £11.5 million. Silva has put pen to paper on a contract that will see him donning the famous white jersey until 2020. Lucas Silva's arrival in the Spanish capital is expected to provide much-needed cover for central-midfielder Toni Kroos, as the promising youngster gains first team experience in one of the most competitive leagues in world football. Known for his composed style, excellent ball control, and ability to dictate the tempo of games from the midfield, Silva is touted as one of Brazil's brightest young stars and is expected to adapt well to the pressure of playing for a top European club like Real Madrid. Silva's signing may have broader implications for the future of the current Real Madrid squad, indicating that the club is preparing to clear the decks for the Brazilian sensation. This could signal the impending departures of Asier Illarramendi and Sami Khedira, two midfielders who have found themselves on the fringes of first-team action this season. Illarramendi, a fellow Real Madrid youth product, has struggled to assert himself in the starting eleven amid tough competition, while Khedira – a World Cup winner with Germany – has been linked with a move away from the Bernabéu, with his contract set to expire this summer. There is no denying the statement of intent behind Real Madrid's acquisition of Lucas Silva. The club has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to nurturing and developing the brightest young talents in world football, providing them with an opportunity to compete for silverware at the highest level. As the reigning European champions, Real Madrid is certainly an attractive proposition for any budding superstar, and Silva will have the chance to test his mettle alongside some of the most celebrated names in the game. As the young Brazilian begins his journey in Madrid, fans and pundits alike will be keeping a watchful eye on his progress, eager to see if he can live up to the lofty expectations set for him. The stage is set for Lucas Silva to prove his worth and make a real impact as part of a world-class team. It remains to be seen how he will adapt to life in La Liga, and if he can become the lynchpin in central midfield that Real Madrid have been seeking. In conclusion, the signing of Lucas Silva represents a fresh injection of youth and talent into the Real Madrid squad. With Silva expected to become an essential component of the squad, the future certainly looks bright for both the player and the club. It will be fascinating to see how Silva's potential translates into performances on the pitch and whether he can replicate the stellar displays that earned him a big-money move in the first place."},{"instruction":"Select from options: Continue writing the next sentence.

Options: A. see king B. hello C. meow D. drink water E. live many years Answer:","output":"C. meow A detailed answer: Typically, a cat would be expected to say \\"meow\\" as it is the most common vocalization associated with felines. Cats may make various vocalizations, including meows, purrs, hisses, and growls, all of which serve different purposes depending on the cat's needs and emotions. Option A, \\"see king,\\" is nonsensical and unrelated to how a cat would typically communicate. Option B, \\"hello,\\" is a human greeting and not usually associated with the vocalizations made by a cat. Option D, \\"drink water,\\" also seems unrelated as it is a phrase in English and does not reflect the way a cat communicates with its environment. Option E, \\"live many years,\\" is an expression that may represent a wish for longevity, but again, it does not align with the way a cat typically vocalizes. Thus, the best option in line with common sense is option C, \\"meow.\\" Cats use their meows to communicate with humans by expressing their needs, emotions, or seeking attention. Adult cats rarely meow to each other, and it is generally believed that they have adopted this form of communication specifically to interact with humans. Different tones, frequencies, and lengths of meows can communicate a range of emotions, from hunger, pain, or distress to friendliness, contentment, and even aggression.

Here are a few possible scenarios to consider: 1. Positive sentiment: If the phrase \\"another visit\\" refers to a situation in which the speaker enjoys the company of the person being visited or appreciates the specific location they visit, then it can be considered as having a positive connotation. For example, visiting a close friend, a family member, or a favorite vacation spot would be situations where \\"another visit\\" is a favorable event. In such cases, \\"another visit\\" can imply looking forward to spending time in a familiar, enjoyable, or comforting environment. 2. Negative sentiment: However, if the phrase \\"another visit\\" involves an encounter with an unpleasant or difficult individual or visiting a location that has negative associations, then it can be considered as having a negative connotation. For instance, if someone is talking about making another visit to a doctor's office where the medical treatments have been painful or uncomfortable, the phrase would have a negative tone. Similarly, visiting a place that holds bad memories, such as a childhood home filled with negative experiences, could also create an unfavorable perspective on \\"another visit.\\" 3. Neutral sentiment: In some cases, \\"another visit\\" may not carry any strong positive or negative implications, but rather be perceived as a neutral statement. For example, if a person is discussing routine visits to a location for work purposes, this might not evoke strong emotions. In situations like these, \\"another visit\\" is simply describing an event or action without carrying significant emotional weight. Ultimately, the positivity or negativity of the phrase \\"another visit\\" is dependent on the context it is placed in, the emotions tied to the specific visit, and the relationships and experiences connected to that particular encounter."},{"instruction":"Read the article and select the best answer.

Donald Trump triumphantly greeted the three Americans released by North Korea in the early morning darkness at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington early Thursday, an image one can expect to see over and over again come the 2020 U.S. presidential election campaign. “It was a very important thing to all of us to be able to get these three great people out,” Trump told reporters on the tarmac. He then went on to speculate that live television coverage of the arrival “probably broke the all-time in history television rating for 3 o’clock in the morning.” It was a moment the president gladly seized given that his White House has been buffeted by a chaotic mix of policy and personal drama in recent days. The prospect of a potentially historic breakthrough on North Korea could move a number of other unwelcome distractions to the side, including the ongoing Russia investigation, the growing legal difficulties for Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and the soap opera that the Stormy Daniels story has become. Daniels is the adult film actress who claims she once had an affair with Trump. He denies the claim. Trump also announced Thursday on Twitter that he will meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on June 12 in Singapore. A new CNN poll found that 77 percent of those surveyed support Trump meeting the North Korean leader, and 53 percent approve of his handling of the North Korea issue generally. Those numbers are in keeping with a general trend of late that has seen the president’s poll ratings improving, perhaps in part because of the strong economy.

The German team demonstrated incredible coordination and skill on the field, overwhelming Real Madrid and leaving them struggling to keep up. From the very beginning, Dortmund's players displayed a tremendous level of energy and determination that seemed to catch their opponents off guard. Their relentless offensive efforts and impenetrable defense made it nearly impossible for the Real Madrid side to gain any traction throughout the match. Dortmund's strategy of maintaining constant pressure, both offensively and defensively, forced Real Madrid into making mistakes and conceding goals. The immense physical and psychological pressure placed on the Spanish team made it difficult for them to execute their game plan effectively. This was further compounded by the exceptional performance of Robert Lewandowski, who scored all four of Dortmund's goals during the match. Lewandowski's incredible display not only highlighted his individual talent but also emphasized the effectiveness of Dortmund's teamwork and tactical approach. Each goal showcased a different facet of his ability as a forward, ranging from his precise finishing to his impressive aerial prowess. His performance undoubtedly solidified his status as one of the elite strikers in European football at the time. Additionally, the atmosphere created by Dortmund's passionate fans played a significant role in motivating the team and contributing to their success that night. The electrifying energy they provided served as a catalyst for the players, who fed off their enthusiasm and translated it into remarkable performances on the field. In the end, the first leg of the Champions League semifinal between Borussia Dortmund and Real Madrid served as a testament to Dortmund's immense talent, tactical prowess, and undying determination. The German side floated like a butterfly, moving gracefully across the field, and stung like a bee, delivering devastating blows to opposing teams. The result left the Real Madrid side reeling and in dire need of a miracle to overturn the deficit in the second leg of the semifinal. The Borussia Dortmund side had truly embodied the essence of Muhammad Ali's famous quote and made their mark in the world of football."},{"instruction":"Q:Process: - Pollution enters natural water sources such as rivers and lakes - The pollution negatively affects the water quality - The pollution negatively affects the health of plants and animals - The plants and animals have shorter, less healthy lives - The plants and animals do not reproduce very well - The number of plants and animals decreases over time - The quality of water gets worse and worse as there are no plants or animals to clean it - Eventually there is nothing living in the water and it is unusable - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the population decreases happens, how will it affect there are more pollution producing companies. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation can have indirect effects on the process. If the population decreases and there are more pollution-producing companies, it could lead to the following consequences: 1. Increased pollution: With more pollution-producing companies, the amount of pollution entering natural water sources might increase significantly, further exacerbating the negative effects on water quality. 2. Faster degradation of the water ecosystem: As the pollution worsens water quality, the health of plants and animals would decline even more quickly, leading to a faster decline in their population. 3. Increased difficulty in reversing the situation: With a higher rate of pollution, it would become more challenging to restore the water ecosystem and bring it back to a healthy state. This could potentially result in the permanent loss of certain plant and animal species in the affected water bodies. 4. Amplified environmental consequences: An increase in pollution could also contribute to a broader range of environmental problems, such as air pollution, soil contamination, and greenhouse gas emissions, which could further impact the health of both wildlife and human populations.

Montana’s appointed Sen. John Walsh was by far the most endangered incumbent in the chamber at the time of the previous installment in early August, but his decision last month to not seek a full term opened the top slot to a couple other worthy contenders. Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark., is still in a perilous political position, but Louisiana Sen. Mary L. Landrieu has leapfrogged him on the list to become the Senate’s most vulnerable incumbent. The Democrat is pushing hard to eclipse 50 percent on Nov. 4, the day of Louisiana’s jungle primary and possibly Landrieu’s best opportunity for re-election. She will undoubtedly get close. But if Landrieu doesn’t win a majority of the vote against a few GOP challengers, she will likely face Rep. Bill Cassidy, R-La., in the Dec. 6 runoff. If that happens, all bets are off, and Landrieu’s viability may depend on which party prevailed on Election Day. With the elections just two months away, Democratic incumbents overall have run strong-enough campaigns to ensure the fight for the Senate majority remains a tossup — despite a playing field tilted heavily in the GOP’s direction. Republicans, who need a net gain of six seats to take control of the chamber, are expected to get halfway there by picking up the open seats in Montana, South Dakota and West Virginia. Its open-seat opportunities don’t stop there, but the GOP will likely need to defeat at least two sitting senators to win the majority. They have several to choose from: 1. Mary L. Landrieu, D-La. No incumbent faces a more complicated path to re-election than Landrieu, thanks to the state’s unique voting process and calendar. With a challenging national climate and a strong GOP challenger in Rep. Bill Cassidy, Republicans may finally defeat the senator who has won some tough races before. 2. Mark Pryor, D-Ark. Pryor is surprising people in both parties and is in far better shape at this point than some expected a year ago. But he remains a top target of national Republicans, who believe Rep. Tom Cotton will ultimately win over the GOP voters who have supported Pryor in the past. 3. Mark Begich, D-Alaska The Democrat running arguably the best campaign also happens to be in possibly the most challenging state for the party. Begich and his Democratic backers have been hammering Republican Dan Sullivan for months, long before he finally emerged with the nomination Aug. 19. 4. Kay Hagan, D-N.C. Hagan is a top target for Republicans, but circumstances have been good to her. Republican Thom Tillis, the state House speaker, had to put his candidacy on the back burner for the past several months when the legislature’s “short session” ended up not so short. He only became a full-time candidate last week, when the House finally wrapped up. 5. Mark Udall, D-Colo. Udall has a strong opponent in Rep. Cory Gardner, and Colorado is a solidly purple state that could go either way. Democrats are hoping their 2010 playbook, which got Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet elected in a Republican wave year, will be as successful the second time around. 6. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. If rankings went by polling alone, McConnell might be higher on this list. He faces a legitimate challenge in Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes, a rock star fundraiser who makes the party optimistic. Grimes needs to top the 47 percent McConnell’s previous opponent received in 2008, but that’s not easy in a midterm cycle with an unpopular Democratic president. 7. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H. Shaheen is well-liked and remains the clear favorite, but a single poll in mid-August showing a 2-point race caused an uproar of speculation. It’s likely not that close, but Republicans hope former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown will begin to close the gap after the Sept. 9 primary. 8. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore. With a solid lead in the polls and large financial advantage, Merkley doesn’t appear to be in much danger. But Republican Monica Wehby is getting some much-needed help from the Koch brothers on the airwaves and Merkley’s poll numbers, while strong, don’t match Al Franken’s, pushing the Oregon senator up one spot on this list. 9. Al Franken, D-Minn. Franken is a strong fundraiser in a solidly blue state. There’s a path for Republicans to potentially make this race competitive, but so far, GOP nominee Mike McFadden hasn’t made it happen. 10. Mark Warner, D-Va. It would take a Republican wave election to oust Warner, a popular former governor with a massive cash advantage over his Republican opponent Ed Gillespie. He joins this list largely for lack of another option. Editor’s note: Roll Call will publish a revised list of the Top 10 Most Vulnerable House Members on Wednesday. These features will be updated during the first week of October and again before Election Day.

Bill Enyart (D-Ill.) Text Size - + reset Enyart, a freshman Democrat, is running for reelection in a southern Illinois district where Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn and President Barack Obama are deeply unpopular. A former adjutant general in the Illinois National Guard, Enyart remains an unknown figure throughout much of the district and has struggled to raise campaign cash. His Republican opponent, state Rep. Mike Bost, is famous for his tirades on the floor of the Legislature. Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) Grimm’s 20-count federal indictment has made him the most endangered House GOP lawmaker of 2014. But he’s not done yet. Internal polling from both parties suggests that Grimm is tied or slightly ahead of his Democratic opponent, former New York City Councilman Domenic Recchia. But Democrats have promised to bombard Grimm with millions of dollars of TV ads, and national Republicans are queasy about coming to Grimm’s aid. (WATCH: House races preview) Rep. Rick Nolan (D-Minn.) Democrats have grown increasingly worried about Nolan, who won a 2012 comeback race after serving in the House from 1974 to 1980. Over the summer, the Democratic groups House Majority PAC and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees joined forces to air TV ads in an attempt to boost the 70-year-old incumbent, who has also struggled to raise money. Nolan faces a strong opponent in Republican businessman Stewart Mills, who has been dubbed the “Brad Pitt” of the GOP. Rep. Carol Shea-Porter (D-N.H.) Polling shows Shea-Porter, a third-term Democrat, falling behind her likely Republican opponent, former Rep. Frank Guinta. Guinta, who unseated Shea-Porter in 2010 and then lost to her in 2012, is well known in the Manchester area and the favorable environment could push him over the top in a district that skews slightly to the right. Rep. Steve Southerland (R-Fla.) Southerland, a sophomore Republican, faces perhaps the strongest Democratic recruit in the country in Gwen Graham, a Leon County schools official who is the daughter of former Sen. Bob Graham. Graham has outraised Southerland, and she’s waging an energetic campaign, running quality TV ads and joining her father on the trail. |||||","output":"According to Roll Call's monthly ranking of most vulnerable senators, Louisiana Sen.

The Deputy Minister has vowed to establish a media panel for this tasks if it's not included in the UK government's wider review of the BBC's charter. BBC representatives, specifically James Purnell, the corporation's director of strategy, have expressed their commitment to Welsh audiences at a media summit held in Cardiff. The event precedes the introduction of a new charter for the BBC, which decides its remit for the upcoming decade, and is set to come into effect in January 2017. In conclusion, the article is centered on the debate about the BBC's commitment to English-language programming in Wales, with Welsh government figures asserting the importance of properly funded media that reflect the reality of Welsh life and the BBC defending its financial constraints and affirming its dedication to meeting Welsh audience's expectations."},{"instruction":"By. Graham Smith. Last updated at 10:41 PM on 12th October 2011. Slovakia's main political parties have reached a deal to approve changes to an EU bailout fund this week, the main opposition leader said today -just one day after parliament rejected the proposal, causing the government to fall. Robert Fico, head of Smer-Social Democracy, said that in exchange for his party's votes, three outgoing government party leaders have agreed to hold early general elections on March 10. He said: 'Slovakia will ratify the EU bailout fund without any problems. I believe it will happen on Friday this week at the latest,' Collapsed: In a desperate effort to force a vote in favour of the bailout fund, Prime Minister Iveta Radicova tied it to a confidence vote - the one-year-old government subsequently collapsed. Tuesday's vote on the bail out failed because a junior coalition party, the Freedom and Solidarity party, was against it. In a desperate effort to force that. party to vote in favour of the bailout fund, Prime Minister Iveta. Radicova tied the vote to a confidence vote - but it failed causing her one-year-old government to collapse. With the government defunct - and. with the promise of early elections - Fico said his party will now vote. in favour of the bailout fund, which all 16 other members of the. eurozone have already supported. The leaders of three coalition parties. - Mikulas Dzurinda of the Slovak Democratic and Christian Union, which. Radicova belongs to; Jan Figel of the Christian Democrats and Bela Bugar. of a party of ethnic Hungarians - confirmed the deal. Bugar said. 'We had to pay a political price. And the early election is the price.' Just one day after parliament rejected the proposal causing the government to fall, Slovakia's main political parties have reached a deal to approve changes to an EU bailout. Opposition party leader, and former prime minister, Robert Fico said: 'Slovakia will ratify the EU bailout fund without any problems. I believe it will happen on Friday this week at the latest' The announcement came hours after EU. President Herman Van Rompuy and European Commission President Jose. Manuel Barroso called on Slovak political parties 'to rise above the. positioning of short-term politics, and seize the next occasion to. ensure a swift adoption of the new agreement.' They said the enhancement of the. €44billion Euro European Financial Stability Facility is crucial 'to. preserve financial stability in the euro area. And that is in the. interest of all euro countries, including the Slovak people.' Eurozone leaders had agreed in July to. increase the size and powers of the bailout fund, giving it the ability. to lend quickly to governments in case of market trouble in order to. contain the stubborn financial crisis. Fico's populist leftist party is by. far the strongest political force in Slovakia and stands a good chance. to win the early ballot. It won last year's general elections in June. with 34.8 percent of the vote, taking 62 seats in the 150-seat. Parliament. The senior party of the outgoing. coalition, the Slovak Democratic and Christian Union, was well behind in. second, with 15.4 percent, or 28 seats. Fico's party campaigned on a promise. to maintain the country's welfare state even as other European countries. slash their budgets to deal with the economic crisis. During his term of prime minister. between 2006 and 2010, Slovakia adopted the euro currency in 2009. Despite him taking the largest share of the vote in the 2010 election,. four opposition parties with a majority of 79 parliamentary seats agreed. to form a ruling coalition. Mr Fico and his party had always. supported expanding the fund expansion in principle, but had said it. would vote 'yes' only if the government agreed to call early elections. As major eurozone policies need the. approval of all 17 countries that use the currency, Slovakia's vote -. the last - carried immense weight. For. weeks it appeared certain it would reject boosting the bailout fund,. unnerving financial markets and threatening the future of Europe's plans. to fight the crisis. Experts. said EU officials could possibly find a way around a Slovakian. rejection of the bill to boost the powers and size of the bailout fund,. the European Financial Stability Facility (ESFS), but that doing so. would carry costs to European unity. In. the longer-term, the drama seems sure to add momentum to the push for. nimbler rules to govern the 17-country eurozone, where government. reaction to the unfolding crisis has seemed for many months to be behind. the curve. That push has been gathering momentum for some time. Charts key economic data for Greece. In August, the leaders of France and Germany, President Nicolas Sarkozy and Chancellor Angela Merkel, proposed that the heads of the eurozone countries elect the president of a new 'economic government' who would direct regular summits to respond to the continent's financial crisis. And in September Jose Manuel Barroso. president of the European Commission, decried what he called 'the constraint of unanimity'. Mr Barroso told the European Parliament: 'The pace of our joint endeavour cannot be dictated by the slowest.' At issue now is an agreement reached by the eurozone leaders in July to enlarge the EFSF's capital guarantee from 440billion to 780billion euro. Slovakia would contribute about 1 per cent, or 7.7billion euro. In addition, if the changes are approved, the facility would have new powers and able to prop up government bond markets and help put new capital reserves against losses in banks. Although 16 countries have given the thumbs-up, approval of the changes has found itself in potential jeopardy because of the opposition of a junior member of Slovakia's governing coalition, the Freedom and Solidarity Party. The party's chairman, Richard Sulik, had called the expanded bailout fund 'a road to hell' and vowed to block. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"In Slovakia, some political parties agreed to make changes to the EU bailout fund. This happened after the government fell because they couldn't agree before.

An insecticidal soap solution can be an effective household remedy to control aphids, but it only kills aphids on contact and has no residual effect.

The first technical dictionary, named \\"Lexicon Technicum: Or, An Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences,\\" was drafted by Harris and published in 1704.

The opening scene sets the stage (literally) for the personalities of the gambler, Kansas Charlie (Eddy Chandler), and his buddy, John Scott (John Wayne) the rodeo (say Roh-Day-oh) star, both of whom are slightly randy. The film follows their adventures, as they try to best each other in the pursuit of the Mexican Juanita, and later in their pursuit of perky Mary Kornman, who has the inevitable evil brother (though he'd been led astray by the real villain, and wants to repent). And oh, of course, they're being wrongly accused of two crimes and have to serve jail time before escaping and being exonerated at the end. The high point is Scott continually and deliberately ogling Mary's butt in her grocery store, and knocking away the ladder she's standing on so he can catch her and grab her as she falls. It all seems a little contemporary for a 30s western, but it sounds better than it actually is. Sadly, the exciting action elements we find in many other Lone Stars are sorely missing here. No Yakima Canutt. Cheap and bad uses of stock footage of riders falling off horses. No George Hayes. Tedious Stooge-like bi-play between Scott and Charlie, with Charlie swinging at Scott, Scott stomping on his foot and then punching him (repeated two more times!). The skilled Paul Fix is underused. Eddy Chandler himself, here in his big star turn, is not really believable as a randy side kick. The villain looks too old and fat. So does Chandler, who spent his later career in 300 more movies as an uncredited meatloaf. Mary Kornman, of the twenties \\"Our Gang\\" (see 'Mary, Queen of Tots' 1925) is cute in her scenes with John Wayne, but that's about it for this one. Seeds of a better western lie buried here. P.S.

I have a muffin and dirty skull to talk to but they don't talk back Describe the sentiment embodied by this tweet.","output":"The sentiment embodied by this tweet can be described as a complex mixture of nostalgia, loneliness, longing for connection, and a hint of humor. The user seems to be missing the presence of a deceased pet and is comparing the current situation to their memories of a pet cemetery. By mentioning the muffin and the dirty skull, the user is probably trying to fill the void left by their beloved pet; however, they also recognize the futility of this attempt as these objects do not possess the ability to communicate or connect with them emotionally. The nostalgic element in the sentiment is brought forth by the mention of a pet cemetery, which could have been a place where the user might have experienced love, loss, and reminiscing about their pets. A pet cemetery often symbolizes the final resting place for animals that have had special connections with their owners. This connection creates a sense of longing for the companionship that pets offer, and the user seems to be missing that unique bond. Loneliness is another pervasive theme in the sentiment. The user's attempt at establishing some form of communication or connection with inanimate objects, like the muffin and dirty skull, suggests that they are in need of company and emotional support. Although the user already knows that these objects cannot provide such support, their desire for connection pushes them to seek solace in these unconventional companions. The act of mentioning these objects with the knowledge that they cannot offer the desired interaction is an implicit cry for help, revealing the depth of their loneliness. Despite the underlying sadness, there is also a sense of humor in the tweet. The statement, \\"I have a muffin and dirty skull to talk to, but they don't talk back,\\" expresses the user's awareness of the absurdity in their actions, and they use this humor to shed light on their emotional condition. The lightheartedness helps to soften the otherwise somber sentiment and provides a relatable aspect for readers who might have experienced similar feelings of loneliness or loss. In conclusion, the sentiment expressed in the tweet is a complex interplay of nostalgia, loneliness, longing for connection, and light-hearted humor. While it addresses the pain of losing a beloved pet and the challenge of filling the void left behind, it also showcases the user's ability to find solace and even a touch of humor in unconventional ways.

Knox, 24, was convicted and sentenced to 26 years in prison for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher, 21, who was found partially naked with her throat cut in her bedroom of the house the two shared. Knox and her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 26, were convicted on two key pieces of evidence: a 30-centimeter (12-inch) kitchen knife and a clasp from Kercher's bloodied bra. Authorities testified in the original trial that Kercher's DNA was found on the blade of the knife, Knox's DNA was on its handle, and DNA from Sollecito was on the bra clasp. But in their appeal in Perugia, two independent, court-appointed experts -- professors Carla Vecchiotti and Stefano Conti -- were damning in their appraisal of the methods used by police forensic teams. Conti showed a brief clip of two officers collecting the bra clasp, pointing out how it had been found six weeks after the murder and in a different place. There were gasps from the public gallery as the two officers were seen picking up the clasp, passing it from hand to hand, dropping it, picking it up and then placing it on the floor again. Conti said that although gloves were worn, grubby dirt marks could clearly be seen on the thumb and forefinger of one of the officers. \\"We can see from these circumstances proper protocol was not followed,\\" he said. He also highlighted how the clasp had been placed into a plastic bag instead of a paper bag, saying the risk of contamination was \\"significant\\" as a result of how it had been collected. The experts said the clasp had been kept in such a poor way that it was covered in rust, and further testing was futile. They both stressed that they had worn masks, gloves, paper suits and used sterile knives and scissors during their retesting at Rome's La Sapinenza University. With regard to the knife, Vecchiotti said their test results were negative for blood and that the amount of DNA said to have been Kercher's was so low, it could not be examined again with any conclusion. The two said that, studying the original report, it was clear that \\"numerous people had been in and out of the crime scene\\" and that \\"objects had been moved,\\" which again put all evidence at risk of contamination. In a point-by-point deconstruction, the experts said that because of the errors made by police during the original investigation, the evidence against Knox and Sollecito should be considered \\"inadmissible.\\" Knox and Sollecito listened intently as the experts put forward their case, bringing fresh hope to them that they will be freed when the court gives its verdict in September. During a break in proceedings, Knox's mother, Edda Mellas, said: \\"To us this is not earth-shattering, because we have been saying it all along since the original trial, but it was just ignored. \\"It really does beggar the question how they were found guilty in the first place when you see the mistakes that were made during the original investigation,\\" she said. The hearing is scheduled to resume on Saturday. Kercher, a University of Leeds student from Coulsdon, Surrey, was discovered with her throat slit in November 2007, in the hilltop town of Perugia, just two months after she arrived in Italy during her year abroad. A third defendant, small-time drug dealer Rudy Guede, an immigrant from the Ivory Coast, was also jailed in connection with the brutal killing. He received a 30-year sentence for murder and sexual violence following a fast-track trial in October 2008. His sentence was later cut to 16 years. Knox and Sollecito -- who is serving 25 years -- were found guilty in December 2009. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Amanda Knox and her friend Raffaele Sollecito were found guilty of killing their roommate, Meredith Kercher. They were sent to jail because some clues (a knife and a bra clasp) had their DNA. But, two experts said that the police made big mistakes when they looked at these clues, so Amanda and Raffaele might not really be guilty. The experts showed that the police didn't follow the right steps and may have accidentally put their own DNA on the clues. Now, Amanda and Raffaele are waiting to find out if they will be let out of jail because of these mistakes. Amanda's mom says they have been saying these mistakes happened all along but people didn't listen until now."},{"instruction":"Question: Given the below context: Chrismansyah Rahadi ([xrisˈmanʃah raˈhadi]; 16 September 1949 – 30 March 2007), born Christian Rahadi but better known by his stage name of Chrisye ([xəˈriʃə]), was an Indonesian progressive pop singer and songwriter. In his 40-year career he won many awards and accolades; in 2011 Rolling Stone Indonesia declared him the third-greatest Indonesian musician of all time. Born in Jakarta of mixed Chinese-Indonesian descent, Chrisye became interested in music at an early age. At high school he played bass guitar in a band he formed with his brother, Joris. In the late 1960s he joined Sabda Nada (later Gipsy), a band led by his neighbours, the Nasutions. In 1973, after a short hiatus, he rejoined the band to play in New York for a year. He briefly returned to Indonesia and then went back to New York with another band, the Pro's. After once again returning to Indonesia, he collaborated with Gipsy and Guruh Sukarnoputra to record the 1976 indie album Guruh Gipsy. Following the success of Guruh Gipsy, in 1977 Chrisye recorded two of his most critically acclaimed works: \\"Lilin-Lilin Kecil\\" by James F. Sundah, which eventually became his signature song, and the soundtrack album Badai Pasti Berlalu. Their success landed him a recording contract with Musica Studios, with whom he released his first solo album, Sabda Alam, in 1978. Over his almost 25-year career with Musica he recorded a further eighteen albums, and in 1980 acted in a film, Seindah Rembulan. Chrisye died in his Jakarta home on 30 March 2007 after a long battle with lung cancer. Known for his stiff stage persona and smooth vocals, Chrisye was critically acclaimed in Indonesia. Five albums to which he contributed were included in Rolling Stone Indonesia's list of the 150 Best Indonesian Albums of All Time; another four of his songs (and a fifth to which he contributed) were classified as some of the best Indonesian songs of all time in a later issue of the same magazine.

A former Marine who murdered his neighbour was twice turned away by police after handing himself in and confessing to the crime, a court heard. Killer Thomas Puxty had to demand an interview after officers refused to believe him when walked into a police station to admit to brutally torturing and murdering his neighbour five years earlier, it was said. Last year, Puxty, 31, was sentenced to life, with a minimum of 28 years, for the savage killing of Lee Clement at his home in Woolwich, south London, in March 2006. However, the details of his confession have only just been heard during an appeal to reduce his sentence. Appeal: Killer Thomas Puxty, left, had his sentence for murdering neighbour Lee Clement, right, cut by two years because he had 'solved his own crime' The judge ruled that his sentence should be cut by two years after hearing Puxty had ‘put himself behind bars'. Kerim Fuad QC, defending, told the court: ‘The police thought he (Puxty) was wasting their time. ‘He was allowed to smoke outside for an hour or two before coming back inside but was sent away twice. ‘He could have walked away. ‘It was his sheer persistence in demanding an interview which led to him taking the police down to where he had buried Mr Clement some years earlier.’ Lord Justice Elias told the court that Puxty had ‘fallen into alcoholism’ because of his guilt. The judge said: ‘The confession suggests an acceptance by the appellant of what he has done. ‘It demonstrates a wish to come to terms with his own conscience and to be willing to pay the price that society requires. ‘There is no doubt at all that the confession in this case resulted in a conviction which never otherwise would have happened. Confession: Killer Thomas Puxty walked into Plumstead Police Station, pictured, to demand officers arrest him for the brutal murder of his neighbour. ‘Only the defendant knew the deceased was dead, only the defendant knew he had been killed and only the defendant knew where he was buried.’,. Puxty had targeted Mr Clement after finding out he had £93,000 in his bank account. After tying the dad-of-three up Puxty then used a ‘pressure point technique’ he learned in the Marines to kill him before dumping his body in woodland in Kent. The 31-year-old former Royal Marine then went on a spending spree, spending more than £50,000 on motorbikes, TVs and flash watches, before becoming ‘overcome with guilt’ and handing himself into Plumstead Police station in March 2010. The killer, who admitted manslaughter claiming he didn’t mean to kill his victim, then took police to a remote spot in woods near Ashford, Kent, where he had buried his 60-year-old victim’s body in a shallow grave. He was jailed for life at Kingston Crown Court in December last year after being found guilty of murdering dad-of-three Mr Clements - who had never been reported missing - and told he would serve a minimum of 28 years behind bars. When contacted by MailOnline, the Metropolitan Police were unable to comment on the latest details to emerge about Puxty's arrest. But in a statement from the Met released after Puxty was found guilty of murder in December last year it made no reference to Puxty being turned away from Plumstead police station. It stated: ‘In March 2010 following his release from prison on other matters, Puxty attended Plumstead police station and confessed to killing Lee. ’Following his arrest, the investigation was referred to the Homicide and Serious Crime Command and a murder investigation was launched. ‘Detailed and extensive enquiries revealed that following the disposal of the body, Puxty withdrew money from Lee’s bank account, taking approximately £50,000 over a three month period in order to fuel his drugs and alcohol addiction, as well his liking for luxury goods and motorbikes.’ Write highlights for this article.","output":"A long time ago, a man named Thomas Puxty hurt and killed his neighbor, Lee Clement.

Question: What was common among Jews that lived in part of the Eurasian landmass? Context: A 2006 study found Ashkenazi Jews to be a clear, homogeneous genetic subgroup. Strikingly, regardless of the place of origin, Ashkenazi Jews can be grouped in the same genetic cohort – that is, regardless of whether an Ashkenazi Jew's ancestors came from Poland, Russia, Hungary, Lithuania, or any other place with a historical Jewish population, they belong to the same ethnic group. The research demonstrates the endogamy of the Jewish population in Europe and lends further credence to the idea of Ashkenazi Jews as an ethnic group. Moreover, though intermarriage among Jews of Ashkenazi descent has become increasingly common, many Haredi Jews, particularly members of Hasidic or Hareidi sects, continue to marry exclusively fellow Ashkenazi Jews. This trend keeps Ashkenazi genes prevalent and also helps researchers further study the genes of Ashkenazi Jews with relative ease.

A:","output":"A: The common name for Valeriana officinalis is Valerian. Valerian is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, and its roots have been widely used for their medicinal properties. It has a long history of traditional use dating back to ancient Greece and Rome, where it was used to treat conditions like insomnia, anxiety, and stress-related disorders. Valerian is also sometimes referred to as garden heliotrope, all-heal, setwall or Capon's tail due to its historical and medicinal uses. Valerian contains a variety of constituents, including volatile oils, valepotriates, valerenic acid, and other compounds, which are believed to contribute to its therapeutic effects. Its most common use today is as a natural remedy for sleep disorders, particularly for aiding people in falling asleep faster and experiencing a more restful sleep. It is often used as an alternative to over-the-counter and prescription sleep aids due to its gentler and non-habit-forming nature. In addition to its sleep-enhancing properties, valerian has demonstrated some efficacy in treating conditions related to anxiety, stress, and nervous tension. Some studies suggest that it may have a calming effect on the central nervous system, which could help alleviate symptoms related to physical and emotional stress. Additionally, valerian has been reported to benefit those who suffer from mild forms of depression or mood disorders. Other potential uses for valerian include treating gastrointestinal disorders like irritable bowel syndrome, managing muscle and joint pain, and reducing menstrual and menopausal symptoms. However, it is worth mentioning that more research is needed in these areas to fully understand the efficacy of valerian for such conditions. Historically, valerian has been consumed in the form of teas, infusions, and extracts, and nowadays, its dried roots are commonly found in capsules, tablets, and powders. It is important to remember that, as with any supplement or natural remedy, it is crucial to consult with a healthcare professional before adding valerian to one's wellness routine, especially when using it alongside other medications or if pregnant or breastfeeding."},{"instruction":"Reconstruct a question, answer pair from this explanation: He refers to a man not a girl.

The singer had sought to nullify her recording contract because it brought her into contact with super-producer Dr. Luke, whose real name is Luke Gottwald. The 28-year-old, whose real name is Kesha Rose Sebert, claims Dr. Luke drugged her with a pill that made her black out and raped her shortly after her 18th birthday in California. He was never criminally charged. OVER 100,000 CALL FOR SONY BOYCOTT AFTER KESHA RULING Sony has offered to let her work with another producer, but Kesha said she fears the company won’t promote her music as heavily if she’s not working with Gottwald, their biggest hitmaker. Dozens of fans rallied outside the courthouse in support of the shellshocked singer as she emerged from the courthouse. “Free Kesha Now! Free Kesha Now!” they chanted as the singer walked down the front steps with her entourage. A few minutes earlier, she had hugged a weeping fan outside the courtroom. “You don’t deserve this at all. It’s unfair,” the fan, Lindsay Scarpa, told her. KESHA ACCUSES SONY MUSIC OF ENABLING 'ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP' WITH DR. LUKE Kesha declined to speak with reporters. Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Shirley Kornreich said Sony would suffer irreparable harm if Kesha was not compelled to abide by a contract that requires her to make six more albums with the company. The judge said that granting the singer’s request to nullify her deal would undermine the state’s laws governing contracts and the court couldn’t do that. Kesha’s lawyer, Mark Geragos, argued that Sony’s promise to connect her to another producer was “illusory” because even if the recordings were made, the record company wouldn’t promote them. KESHA'S ALLEGED RAPE HAPPENED WHEN SHE WAS 18-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN He contended that Sony had more invested in Dr. Luke than in Kesha and it would do everything to protect him because he makes them more money. Kesha, in a dramatic all-white outfit seated in court next to her mother in a back row, initially looked stunned as the judge refused to issue the injunction. The \\"Tik Tok\\" singer accused producer Dr. Luke (r.) of rape and said she is afraid to work with him. Then as a tear-soaked fan in front of her started sniffling loudly, her own eyes filled with tears. STARS SUPPORT KESHA AFTER LEGAL BATTLE WITH DR.

And the answer is...","output":"Let's solve the equation step by step so it's easy to understand: 1. First, let's add and subtract the similar terms (all those with 'a'): 441*a - 772*a - 482*a = (441 - 772 - 482)*a = -813*a 2. Now our equation looks like: -813*a + 146 + 5545 = 0 3. Let's add the numbers (146 and 5545) together: 146 + 5545 = 5691 4. Our equation now looks like: -813*a + 5691 = 0 5. To solve for 'a', we want to get 'a' by itself. So, we'll move -813*a to the other side of the equation by adding 813*a to both sides: 5691 = 813*a 6. Finally, let's divide both sides by 813 to get 'a': a = 5691 / 813 7.

Born on July 9, 1937, in Bradford, England, Hockney is one of the most influential British artists of the 20th and 21st centuries. Although he gained prominence as one of the pioneers of the British Pop Art movement in the early 1960s, Hockney's work spans a diverse range of styles, media, and subject matters. David Hockney studied at the Bradford College of Art from 1953 to 1957 before moving on to the Royal College of Art (RCA) in London from 1959 to 1962. Alongside fellow students at the RCA, such as Ron Kitaj, R. B. Kitaj, and Peter Blake, Hockney began exploring popular culture's impact on art. As a result, he became one of the key figures of British Pop Art, a movement characterized by its critique of consumer culture, embrace of mass-produced imagery, and the challenge it posed to established artistic norms. Returning down to the painting, \\"Bertha and Bernie\\" is an oil on canvas work with dimensions measuring 60x48 inches. It showcases Hockney's signature style of portraying subjects in bright and vibrant colors. The painting features two prominent figures, presumably Bertha and Bernie, depicted in Hockney's playful and whimsical Pop Art framing. Over the years, David Hockney has experimented with numerous styles, like Realism, Abstract Expressionism, and Cubism, before developing his iconic style that harmoniously blends reality and abstraction. Although his work is highly varied, Hockney's paintings often convey the essence of two main themes: intimate moments and the relationships between individuals. As a prolific artist, David Hockney's work not only spans paintings but also drawings, printmaking, stage design, photography, and digital media. Some of his most famous works include \\"A Bigger Splash\\" (1967) and \\"Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)\\" (1972), which was auctioned for a record-breaking 90.3 million in 2018. Furthermore, his extensive career has contributed to the recognition and validation of the Pop Art movement, making him one of the most influential and important artists in modern history."},{"instruction":"Question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Spelling Bee for the following movie plot: When Charlie Brown's baseball team loses the first Little League game of the season, he becomes convinced that he will never win anything.

But for some young hopefuls, the overflowing bookshelves and wood paneling in a typical professor's study are just as likely to throw them as any question about Rousseau's \\"social contract.\\" For students from the inner city, many of whom have grown up with concrete and fluorescent lights, it's easy to be overawed. That's why, in one of the roughest parts of London, a public school recently built a little piece of Oxford  a replica don's room  in the hopes of boosting students' confidence when they go for an interview in the real thing. Two days a week, students from Brooke House Sixth Form College in Hackney, known as BSix, gather amid the room's leather-bound tomes, gilded picture frames and Chesterfield sofa to meet with an Oxford history tutor to prepare to apply to either Oxford or Cambridge (also known in Britain as Oxbridge). (MORE: Britain's Universities: Funding Excellence) BSix's students  among the poorest in the U.K.  will need all the help they can get. In wealthier parts of the country like Reading and Hammersmith, students in public schools are 50 times more likely to gain acceptance to Oxford or Cambridge than their counterparts in Hackney. They also face fierce competition from students armed with the best education money can buy: in 2010, Oxford offered 44% of its places to students from private schools, despite the fact that only 7% of British students attend them. The scales are weighted so heavily, in fact, that five British private schools sent more students to Oxford and Cambridge between 2007 and '09 than 2,000 public schools combined, according to the Sutton Trust, an educational charity in the U.K. And things don't appear to be changing quickly. In 2010-11, Britain's top 20 universities  known as the Russell Group  took proportionately fewer students from state-funded, public schools than the year before, according to the Higher Education Statistics Agency. When it comes to race, the numbers are even more dire. A recent investigation by Parliament member David Lammy found that in 2009, only 27 black students were offered undergraduate places at all of Oxford's colleges combined. For the entire decade from 1999 to 2009, black students received 10 or fewer places at more than half of Oxford's undergraduate colleges. Merton College, which accepted 795 white students during that period, admitted just four black students. (The real tragedy, some would argue, is that in those 10 years, only 32 black students applied to the college.) (MORE: The Queen Addresses Parliament, but Can Parliament Address Inequality?) Oxbridge admissions are a subject that Britain's class warriors regularly clash over. Yet even the most hardened elitists would not deny that, historically, Oxford and Cambridge have served as a stopover for cosseted dauphins on their ascent from Britain's best schools to its halls of power. Every university-educated Prime Minister save Gordon Brown has attended either Oxford or Cambridge, and the tradition shows no sign of changing. Prime Minister David Cameron and his deputy, Nick Clegg, both attended top private schools and then Oxbridge, as did almost 40% of their Cabinet. Labour leader Ed Miliband also attended Cambridge, though he did not attend a private secondary school. It's not just politicians. All but one of the judges sitting on the U.K.'s Supreme Court and 81% of the current senior judiciary in the country studied at one of the two storied universities. Of the leading British journalists who went to university, more than half were educated at Oxford or Cambridge, according to a 2007 study by the Sutton Trust. (VIDEO: TIME's Interview with David Cameron) The cabinet's privileged pedigree hasn't prevented its leaders from trying to address the problem, however. Last month, the government announced a record £900 million (1.46 billion) budget for outreach to disadvantaged students, a total that has grown by 162 million in the past three years. And in late February, the government made the controversial decision to appoint Les Ebdon, vice chancellor of the University of Bedfordshire, as director of the Office for Fair Access. Ebdon's suggestion that the government withhold some funding for universities that fail to admit more poor students sparked a middle-class firestorm. The Sunday Times of London splashed the headline \\"Will This Man Stop Your Child Going to a Top University?\\" across an unflattering picture of Ebdon superimposed over an idyllic Cambridge college. In the photo, Ebdon holds a sign reading, \\"Please Keep Out  Unless from a Disadvantaged Group, as Approved by the Dept. Social Engineering.\\" Meanwhile, Oxford, which would rather the government not fiddle with its admissions policies, has pursued its own reform agenda. The university now spends 4 million a year on student outreach, which includes school visits and teacher-training sessions aimed at encouraging poor and minority students to apply to the university. In 2010, Oxford also launched a summer school called UNIQ, which gives some 500 academically talented, state-school students a chance to experience studying at Oxford for a week. In addition, the university admissions office highly recommends to tutors that qualified students from poor areas be invited for interviews. And it has set of a target of increasing the number of undergrads from socioeconomically disadvantaged areas from 6.1% to 9% by 2016-17. (MORE: A Perfect Day ... in Oxford) Still, the university balks at the idea of admitting a student with lower grades just because of his or her socioeconomic background. \\"If your education is based around one-on-one tutorials with leading academics, you've got to select people who are really bright and will respond to that sort of educational system,\\" says Oxford press officer Julia Paolitto. British parents paying through the nose for private schooling to ensure their children's places at Oxbridge tend to agree. But even those working in inner-city public schools say putting too much weight on a student's background may not be a good idea. \\"We don't want any concessions from anybody,\\" says Ken Warman, principal of BSix. \\"It's not a good message for our students. Would you be as confident if you were let in because of where you were from?\\" One thing everyone seems to agree on is the need for more bright disadvantaged students to apply. And in that area, there's a lot to do. According to the Sutton Trust, less than half of public-school teachers urge their most promising students to consider Oxford and Cambridge. \\"There is an awful lot of mythology about what it is and isn't to become a student at Oxford,\\" says Mike Nicholson, director of undergraduate admissions at Oxford. \\"We now spend a lot of time challenging that mythology.\\" (PHOTOS: Cambridge University's Annual May Balls) For one student in Hackney, this has worked. In 2008, 16-year-old Allun Bokhari arrived at BSix having dropped out of his previous school, with no academic qualifications. At first glance, he hardly seemed like Oxbridge material. Yet his teachers quickly spotted that he was smart and began helping him preparing for the tests that Oxford requires. Two years later, Bokhari was accepted to study history and politics at Queen's College, Oxford. In 2011, BSix sent a student to Cambridge, bringing the school's Oxbridge total to two. Warman says it may not seem like many, but looks can be deceiving. \\"For a college like ours, that's a big breakthrough.\\" PHOTOS: TIME's Pictures of the Week. PHOTOS: Cartoons of the Week.

Let's examine them step by step to see their differences. 1. To what extent has Gibbon's History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire stood the test of time? Meaning analysis: - This question focuses on the endurance and relevance of Gibbon's work. - Specifically, it interrogates whether the book's historical analysis, arguments, and presentation still hold up today. - It asks if the book's content remains valid and useful for understanding the decline and fall of the Roman Empire. 2. Is it worthwhile, in this day and age, to read The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire? Meaning analysis: - This question focuses on the personal or educational value of reading Gibbon's work. - It asks if the book would be an appropriate or useful use of time for a modern reader. - It takes the modern perspective into account, considering if there are other, more relevant or more accessible resources available to study the decline and fall of the Roman Empire.

Time difference: The statement \\"Men in a group during daylight\\" does not specify the time of day when the gathering occurs. Daylight hours can vary significantly, lasting from early morning to late afternoon or early evening, depending on the geographic location and time of year. On the other hand, the premise \\"Men in white shirts gathering at sunset\\" specifically mentions that the event takes place during sunset, which is a distinct and relatively brief period at the end of the day. As a result, without more information, it is impossible to determine whether these two gatherings occur at the same time or during different parts of the day. 2. Clothing: The premise \\"Men in white shirts gathering at sunset\\" specifically mentions that the men are wearing white shirts. However, the statement \\"Men in a group during daylight\\" does not mention any details about their clothing. It is possible that the men gathering during daylight could be wearing white shirts, but this is not explicitly stated. Therefore, based solely on this statement, we cannot determine if the clothing description matches the premise. 3. The purpose of gathering: Both statements mention a group of men gathering, but there is no information provided about the reason or purpose for these gatherings. The premise \\"Men in white shirts gathering at sunset\\" could be related to a specific event, such as a religious ceremony or a social event, while the statement \\"Men in a group during daylight\\" could be referencing a completely different and unrelated gathering. We cannot verify if these gatherings share a common purpose or not. 4. The number of men: The premise \\"Men in white shirts gathering at sunset\\" and the statement \\"Men in a group during daylight\\" both mention a group of men, but do not provide any additional details about the number of men involved. It would be difficult to establish whether these are the same gatherings or two separate events with different attendees based on the provided information. In conclusion, to determine the accuracy of the premise \\"Men in white shirts gathering at sunset\\" based on the statement \\"Men in a group during daylight,\\" more information is required about the specific time, clothing, purpose of the gathering, and the number of men involved. Without these essential details, it is impossible to draw a definitive conclusion about the relationship between the two scenarios."},{"instruction":"Generate a movie review with positive sentiment.","output":"Title: The Voyage Through Dreams Director: Jane Marshall Genre: Fantasy, Drama Duration: 2 hours 20 minutes \\"The Voyage Through Dreams,\\" directed by the imaginative and genius mind of Jane Marshall, takes its viewers on a transcendent and scenic journey through dreamscapes and human emotions.

Little Tommy Stout. What a naughty boy was that, To try to drown poor pussy cat, Who never did him any harm, But killed all the mice in the farmer's barn. In this traditional nursery rhyme, Johnny Green is presented as a mischievous boy who does an ill-advised act, which in this case is putting the cat in the well. We don't learn why Johnny decided to do this, but the rhyme infers that Johnny's actions were naughty, especially since the poor pussy cat is portrayed as beneficial in keeping the farmer's barn free from mice. Due to the concerning nature of the content, some versions of this nursery rhyme have been changed, but in the original one, it's very clear: Johnny Green is the one who put the cat in the well. However, the rhyme also tells of Tommy Stout, another boy who disapproves Johnny's action and decides to rescue the cat from the well.

Context: Jenny and I were twins, and we were always close growing up despite our very different personalities. Besides a birthday and a couple dead parents, there wasn't much else we shared in common. She was an over-achiever and a bit of a kiss-ass, always trying to make mom and dad proud, which she seemed to pull off with ease. She was the girl in high school who played every sport, joined every club, ran the student council, and somehow still managed to pull A's without breaking a sweat. Intense doesn't even begin to describe her. I could never compete with that, so instead I decided to build an identity for myself as the rebel. Unfortunately, I somehow equated rebelling with turning into a giant asshole. We grew up in a middle-class suburban family. Our father was a teacher and our mother an architect. They were the kind of couple that kept a date night to go dancing every Friday for the 31 years they were married. They died when Jenny and I were twenty-two. We sold the house where we grew up and split the cash; neither of us wanted to set foot in it again. Jenny used the money to pay for her Master's. After school she went to work for James McPherson, one of the most powerful and richest men in the city. Aside from owning the St. Augustine, McPherson had interests in real estate, land development, venture capital, and other things I really should've known more about. The McPherson family was old money here going back to when this valley was nothing but orchards. If I said that at one time or another the McPherson family had owned every single square foot of land in our city, I'd probably be exaggerating - but not much.

The married lover of a millionaire heiress murdered her before getting his dinner lady girlfriend to pose as the dead woman so he could steal hundreds of thousands of pounds from her family. Donald Graham murdered Janet Brown in 2005 and went on to steal £585,000 from her estate, which he used to fund his lavish lifestyle and pay for sports cars. After killing Miss Brown, with whom he had been in a long relationship despite being married to someone else, Graham got a third woman to pose as her so she could ask the dead woman's father for more cash. Miss Brown's body has not been found. After murdering Miss Brown, Graham plundered the dead woman's savings and sold her assets - which he used to treat himself to a Ferrari, a Porsche and an Alfa Romeo. He then turned his greedy intentions on her elderly parents and started siphoning their cash, Newcastle Crown Court heard. Days after murdering Miss Brown, he met school dinner lady Elizabeth Todd and used some of the stolen money to buy her a house. When the killer's string of lies looked like they were about to unravel, Graham convinced Todd, who was today sentenced for fraud, to write two letters to Miss Brown's father's bank, posing as the dead woman, to request a cash transfer into his account. The 52-year-old mother, who lived in a council flat before she met Graham, also made two telephone calls under the guise of Miss Brown to a care home where a friend of hers worked and left messages under the dead woman's name in a bid to keep up the claim she was still alive. Miss Brown vanished in May 2005 and Graham convinced her friends and loved ones she had moved away abroad to start a new life. It was almost a decade later, after both of her parents died, that the sad truth of what happened to her emerged. Graham is currently serving a life sentence, with a minimum term of 32 years, for her murder. After killing Miss Brown (left), Graham got his girlfriend Elizabeth Todd (right) to pose as her so she could ask the dead woman's father for more cash. Todd, of Seaton Deleval, North Tyneside, pleaded guilty to fraud and perverting the course of justice. Judge John Evans sentenced her to six months imprisonment, suspended for 18 months, with supervision. The judge said: 'It is a tragic tale of repeated manipulation, naked exploitation, betrayal and greed which befell Janet Brown and ultimately her vulnerable parents at the hands of a ruthless killer. 'It ended with the untimely death, the cold-blooded murder, of Janet Brown. 'Your part in this appalling tale was, I accept, as do the crown, limited. 'It needs to be recognised, it is accepted you did not know the truth about Janet. Had you done so, had that been established, I would have had to approach the question of sentence on a very different basis.' Judge Evans said he accepted Todd was 'vulnerable and naïve' when she 'blindly carried out his directions'. Glen Gatland, defending, said Todd could have been preyed on by the callous killer because of her physical resemblance to Miss Brown. Mr Gatland said: 'There is evidence he tired to persuade Elizabeth Todd, very shortly after their first meetings, to have her hair dyed to the same colour.' The court heard Todd believed Graham, who would profess his 'love and devotion' to her, would one day marry her - a belief that was backed up when he bought two engagement rings. Mr Gatland added: 'He was a very, very skillful conman, he was able to lead Elizabeth Todd up the garden path. He is skillful at using women. 'Elizabeth Todd believed Janet Brown was overseas and working. She genuinely believed what Donald Graham was telling her.' Graham is currently serving a life sentence, with a minimum term of 32 years, for Miss Brown's murder. Graham, 60, who lived with his wife Denise, sent letters and cards to Miss Brown's parents after he killed her, claiming to be Janet and telling them she had settled in Europe. He then went about gaining the trust of her parents, giving him access to banking information and personal documents. After the death of Janet's mother, Graham even took her father shopping each week while defrauding the family of hundreds of thousands of pounds. During the murder trial, the court heard he created a fake will for Janet's elderly father Eric Brown, which would leave his estate - Plane Trees Estate, in Hexham, Northumberland, to Graham. Eric Brown's will originally left all of his assets to Janet, but in the circumstance that he outlived her everything would be left to the Guide Dogs for the Blind charity. The court how Janet Brown and Elizabeth Todd had both been listed as witnesses on the fake will in which Graham forged Eric Browns signature. Skipton Building Society noticed suspicious activity on Eric Brown's account in 2009 and stopped the transaction of a cheque from Eric Brown to Donald Graham's account. This led to Graham writing letters to the bank claiming to be Eric and Janet Brown, although they were both dead. Todd admitted writing two of the letters, claiming to be Miss Brown and requesting cash be transferred immediately. When Graham was interviewed by police he claimed he was the joint executor of Eric Brown's will with Janet Brown. Donald Graham, of Elsdon Avenue, Seaton Deleval, Northumberland, was charged with 19 offences in September 13, 2013, nearly four years after the investigation began. He was charged with murder, two counts of obtaining a money transfer by deception, 13 counts of fraud, forgery, conspiracy to commit fraud and perverting the course of justice. Todd pleaded guilty to fraud and perverting the course of justice and was handed a suspended sentence at Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) He first appeared at Newcastle Crown Court on September 17 2013 and pleaded not guilty to all charges on January 10 2014. Graham changed his plea on March 14 and admitted 18 fraud offences against Janet Brown and her parents. He denied murder and preventing the course of justice but a jury at Newcastle Crown Court found him guilty of both counts on June 19. The total amount that Graham gained during the fraud was £585,000. Janet Brown lived with her elderly parents Olive and Eric Brown in a converted barn on her parents estate Plane Trees Farm, near Hexham, Northumberland. She had been planning to go on holiday in June 2005 to France with Graham, her lover of eight years. Graham cancelled at the last minute falsely claiming his wife was too ill for him to leave her. Janet told a friend that Graham had 'let her down'. However Graham had secretly met another girlfriend - Todd - and was no longer interested in Janet Brown, only her finances. Janet disappeared before she went on holiday and has not been seen since.","output":"- Donald Graham murdered millionaire heiress Janet Brown in 2005 and stole £585,000 from her estate to fund his lavish lifestyle. - Graham convinced Elizabeth Todd, his girlfriend, to pose as the deceased Janet Brown and defraud even more money from her family. - Janet Brown's body has never been found and her disappearance remained a mystery for almost a decade after her death. - Elizabeth Todd was sentenced to six months imprisonment, suspended for 18 months, with supervision after pleading guilty to fraud and perverting the course of justice. - Graham is currently serving a life sentence with a minimum term of 32 years for the murder of Janet Brown."},{"instruction":"Question: Article: How many times a day do you check your email? When you wake up? Before bed? A dozen times in between? The technology that was supposed to simplify our lives has become the vital time-suck: the average teen spends more than seven hours a day using technological devices, plus an additional hour just text-messaging friends. The advantage of technological devices is connectedness: email lets us respond on the go, and we are in touch with more people during more hours of the day than at any other time in history. But is it possible we're more lonely than ever, too? That's what MIT professor Sherry Turkle observes in her new book, Alone Together, a fascinating portrait of our changing relationship with technology. Turkle details the ways technology has redefined our comprehension of closeness and loneliness--and warns us of the danger of accepting such virtual relationships in place of lasting emotional connections. For Turkle, the biggest worry is the effect all these shallow connections have on our development.

They decided to play a game of hockey under the microscope. For a puck they used one of the millions of experimental bacillus, and one-arm pincettes, which as it happened also resembled hockey sticks, served as sticks. The bacillus was not happy with it at all. It wanted to rest after an exhausting task involving vaccine discouragement, and these whitecoats here planned to put it to work yet again. And this time the work was much more labor-intensive and even more exhausting than before, but the condition and health of the tired bacillus not as good as in the times of youth, about two hours ago. The scientists got excited. On a microscope slide they etched a hockey rink with laser, agreed on the rules, connected the microscope's camera to the big screen display and played until the morning.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more air enters the bronchial tissue happens, how will it affect a GREATER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"If more air enters the bronchial tissue, it could potentially affect the amount of oxygen delivered to the blood stream. To understand how this change could impact the respiratory process, let's examine each step in greater detail and consider both the direct and indirect effects that this perturbation may have on the system. 1. Air is brought in through the mouth: When a person breathes in, air is taken in through the mouth or nose, where it is filtered and humidified to prevent damage to the delicate tissues in the respiratory system. If more air is entering the bronchial tissue, this could indicate a larger volume of air is being inhaled, possibly through deeper breaths or an increased respiratory rate. 2. Air passes through the lungs: After entering the mouth, air travels through the trachea and into the bronchial tubes, which branch off into smaller airways called bronchioles. These bronchioles eventually lead to tiny, balloon-like structures called alveoli. The alveoli are surrounded by a dense network of capillaries, which is where gas exchange occurs. If more air is present in the bronchial tissue, it suggests that more inhaled air is reaching the alveoli, which could potentially allow for a greater amount of oxygen to cross the alveolar membrane into the capillaries. 3. Carbon dioxide is removed: In the alveoli, oxygen diffuses from the inhaled air into the capillaries, while carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the alveoli, where it is then exhaled. The increased air in the bronchial tissue could mean that there is a larger amount of residual air left in the alveoli after exhalation, which may increase the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the air sacs, subsequently making it more challenging for carbon dioxide to be expelled. 4. The lungs bring the oxygen to the rest of the body: Oxygen that has entered the bloodstream binds with hemoglobin in red blood cells, which are then transported to cells throughout the body by the circulatory system. If more oxygen is available in the alveoli due to the increased air in the bronchial tissue, this could theoretically lead to a greater saturation of hemoglobin with oxygen, thereby delivering more oxygen to the tissues and organs. In conclusion, the perturbation of more air entering the bronchial tissue could potentially have both direct and indirect effects on the respiratory process. The direct effect would be the increased oxygen availability in the alveoli, which may lead to greater oxygen delivery to the bloodstream. However, there could also be indirect consequences, such as a higher partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the alveoli, which could make it more difficult for the body to expel carbon dioxide. It would be important to consider how the individual's respiratory and circulatory systems respond to these changes and adapt to maintain a proper balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the blood."},{"instruction":"Q: You are presented with the quiz \\"How do organisms grow and repair themselves?\\" But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints.

(III). recycling. (IV). mechanical. (V). Microscope. (VI). mitosis. (VII). meiosis. (VIII). atoms. The answer is:","output":"(VI). mitosis. Based on the hints provided by the teacher, we can gather that the process by which organisms grow and repair themselves is cell division, and that mitosis is a type of cell division. To briefly explain further, mitosis is the process where the nucleus of a cell is divided into two identical nuclei, each with the same number of chromosomes as the original cell. This process involves several stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. During prophase, the chromosomes condense, and the mitotic spindle begins to form. During metaphase, the chromosomes line up along the equatorial plate, and the spindle fibers attach to the centromeres. In anaphase, the sister chromatids are pulled apart by the spindle fibers towards opposite poles. Finally, during telophase, the separated chromatids reach the poles, the nuclear envelope re-forms around each set of newly-forming sister chromatids, and the chromosomes begin to uncoil, eventually completing the mitosis process. One key function of mitosis is growth, which occurs as the number of cells within an organism increases. New cells are created through mitosis to replace old or damaged ones, which in turn helps repair tissues and organs in the body. This process is crucial for the continuous growth and development of organisms, as well as for the maintenance of their overall health and well-being. In contrast, meiosis is another type of cell division that produces cells with half the number of chromosomes as the original cell (gametes). This process is essential for the formation of sex cells during sexual reproduction, ensuring that the offspring maintain the correct number of chromosomes when the sperm and egg cells unite. However, it is not related to the growth and repair of organisms, which is why the teacher specifically pointed out mitosis as the answer. Given the information provided by the teacher, the best answer to the quiz question \\"How do organisms grow and repair themselves?\\" is (VI). mitosis, as it directly relates to the growth and repair processes in organisms."},{"instruction":"Use the following highlights to write an article: Bob Sinclair has less than a week to knock down his Elizabeth Park house.

They were very excited to live in their new home at a place called Elizabeth Park. Bob was 66 years old and spent a whole six years creating the perfect two-storey house with lots of love and care. There was just one little problem. When Bob built his lovely house, he decided to use wood for some parts of it instead of using steel. When the people who work at the Council, which is a group of smart people who make the rules about what houses can be built and how they should be made, heard about this, they were not very happy. They said to Bob, \\"You didn't ask us if it was okay to use wood instead of steel, and you didn't get our approval.\\" Because Bob didn't follow the rules, the Council told him that he has to knock down his house, even though he spent so much time and effort creating it. Bob now has less than a week to say goodbye to the house he made for him and his wife to live in together. Poor Bob and Sheryl must be really upset about this, but it's important to remember that following rules is important, especially when it's about building a safe and happy home."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage which has extra information available on certain terms mentioned in it.

A: Choose your answer from: (I) arctic (II) deserts (III) forests (IV) in the oceans A:","output":"Plankton, nekton, and benthos are all terms used to describe various types of organisms that live primarily within aquatic environments. These organisms are categorized based on their ability to move and their preferred habitat within the water. To answer your question, we will look at each of the four options provided and identify which one corresponds to these three groups of organisms. I) Arctic While the Arctic is a region characterized by freezing temperatures, ice, and snow, it does contain aquatic environments such as the Arctic Ocean, where some plankton, nekton, and benthos can be found. However, the Arctic environment is not exclusive to these organisms, nor is it their primary habitat. II) Deserts Deserts are characterized by their arid and dry conditions, making them unsuitable habitats for plankton, nekton, and benthos. While some desert aquatic systems, such as oases or ephemeral rivers, may support limited aquatic life, this option would not be considered their primary habitat. III) Forests Although forests may contain bodies of water like lakes, rivers, and streams, these habitats alone would not be a primary location for plankton, nekton, and benthos. The majority of organisms found in forest ecosystems consist of terrestrial plants and animals rather than aquatic organisms. IV) In the oceans This is the correct answer. Plankton, nekton, and benthos predominantly reside in oceanic environments. Plankton refers to aquatic organisms that drift passively with water currents. They can be divided into two main groups: phytoplankton (photosynthesizing microscopic plants) and zooplankton (tiny animals that feed on phytoplankton or other zooplankton). Nekton includes more mobile and active aquatic creatures such as fish, squid, and marine mammals that can swim against currents or move independently. Benthos refers to organisms that live on, in, or near the ocean floor, such as crabs, clams, sea anemones, and various types of worms. In summary, plankton, nekton, and benthos primarily live in oceanic environments, making option (IV) the correct choice. Although some of these organisms can be found in other aquatic environments or ecosystems, the ocean is the primary habitat best suited for their survival and growth."},{"instruction":"Question: Given this review: \\"Can't access messages without app FC'ing One of the best simple Facebook apps but recently it's been force closing and crashing as soon as I open the 'messages' tab.

Options: - subway - front door - lawn - bookstore - library Step-by-step reasoning process below:","output":"The most suitable option for reading newspapers while riding to work would be the subway. Here's a step-by-step reasoning process: 1. Subway: It is common for people to use public transportation like the subway for commuting to work. Since it takes some time to travel, people can utilize this opportunity to catch up on the news by reading newspapers. This is a convenient option for multitasking and staying informed while in transit to work. 2. Front door: This option does not make sense, as the front door is typically the entrance to a person's home, and people don't read newspapers while standing at their front door to ride to work. 3. Lawn: Reading a newspaper on your lawn is an activity that could be done during leisure time or while relaxing at home before or after work, but it's not a suitable place to read newspapers while riding to work. 4. Bookstore: A bookstore is not relevant in this context. People go to bookstores to buy or borrow books, not to read newspapers while commuting to work. 5. Library: Although libraries do have newspapers available for reading, they serve as a separate location for reading and learning and are not related to the process of riding to work. People generally don't read newspapers in a library while commuting. In conclusion, the subway is the most appropriate option for reading newspapers while riding to work due to its convenience and the ability to multitask while in transit."},{"instruction":"Process: - A bird lays an egg - The egg hatches into a baby bird - Baby bird eats - Grows into an adult bird - The bird finds a mate - The pair build a nest - The birds lay eggs. Question: suppose there is very little human interference happens, how will it affect more eggs hatch. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect","output":"To approach this task, we need to evaluate the impact of human interference on the bird's lifecycle mentioned in the process. Here's the step-by-step approach: 1) Understanding the scenario: The scenario details the life cycle of a bird, from laying eggs to the next generation of birds. We need to predict the effect of minimal human interference on the number of eggs hatching. 2) Considering biological factors: In a natural environment without human interference, birds will follow their normal lifecycle - laying eggs, the emergence of baby birds, their growth, finding a mate, nest-building, and laying eggs by the next generation. Essentially, birds have evolved to do this on their own. 3) Considering the impact of human interference: Human interference can have both negative and positive impacts on a bird’s life. On the negative side, it could lead to habitat destruction, disturbance during nesting, or even direct harm to the birds, which could decrease the chance of eggs hatching or the survival of the chicks. On the positive side, the human activity might involve providing safe nesting places, providing food, or protecting birds from predators, which could increase the chances of survival. 4) Thinking about reduced human interference, it is plausible that based on the positive impacts mentioned earlier, less human activity could potentially lead to a decline in the number of eggs hatching, since there would be less protection and aid given to the birds. However, decreasing human activity would also mean less of the negative impacts, like birds’ habitat destruction, and thus could potentially be beneficial for the birds. 5) Evaluating the likely outcome: This question is somewhat complex as it depends on the kind of human interference the bird populations are subjected to. If human interference majorly involves negative impacts like habitat destruction, less interference would mean more birds surviving and hence, more eggs hatching. Alternatively, if human interference is primarily protective, less interference could lead to fewer eggs hatching. However, since most wild birds have naturally evolved to survive without human assistance, and the negative human impact due to urbanization and deforestation is generally more widespread, it is likely that with very little human interference, the hatching of eggs for wild birds may increase. Therefore, option A) \\"more\\" could be the most suitable answer."},{"instruction":"Des comparaisons des résultats d’essais et des prédictions de modèles avec le modèle « S-CLAY1 » et le modèle « Cam clay » modifié démontrent que, en dépit de sa simplicité, le modèle « S-CLAY1 » peut fournir d’excellentes prédictions du comportement du sol non structuré.

These models are employed to analyze and predict the behavior of soil when it is unstructured or not organized in a specific manner. The \\"S-CLAY1\\" model is noted for its simplicity, which can be advantageous when attempting to develop a model that is easily understood and can generate reliable predictions without excessive complexity. This quality makes the \\"S-CLAY1\\" model an attractive option for soil behavior analysis and could contribute to the development of better soil management strategies. On the other hand, the modified \\"Cam clay\\" model is also a prominent choice when addressing soil behavior prediction. The \\"Cam clay\\" model is based on a mechanistic approach, taking into account the macroscopic behavior of soils and their microscopic composition, which may result in a more detailed and potentially, more accurate representation of the actual behavior of various soil types.

There, a buffoon is entertaining peasants with a song mocking the local boyar (lord). Then, some soldiers come and arrest the buffoon.Chapter 3 Theophanes the Greek, 1405 AD. This begins with the grisly scene of a man shouting as he is dragged to the wheel to be broken. The scene ends with the gory aftermath: the bloodied body lying on the wheel. An artistic discussion occurs between Theophanes the Greek and Father Kirill. Theophanes asks him to become his assistant. Kirill says he will, if the master will come to the monastery and ask for him personally, in front of all the monks. To his bitter disappointment, he sends someone else, to ask for Andrei instead. Andrei agrees to go, but Danila refuses, when Andrei asks him to accompany him. Andrei is devastated. The next morning, he goes to Danilas cell and confesses, We have shared the same cell for years. I cant paint without you. I look with your eyes; I listen with your ears. Danila replies with tears in his eyes, You silly man, go with my blessing! Andrei kneels and kisses Danila's hand. Meanwhile, Father Kirill leaves the monastery in disgust, past a huge wall of logs, shouting You brood of vipers! You have made his temple a den of thieves.Chapter 4 The Passion according to Andrei, 1406 AD The chapter opens with Father Andrei walking through a forest with his apprentice, Foma.

With nearly 1,800 stores across the U.S., the retail giant has made its reputation as a low-price mecca. But as easy as it is to save money at Target, those with a little advanced Target I.Q. can save even more. GoBankingRates asked savings experts to offer 25 money-saving tips to make your Target shopping experience better than ever. Click through to see how you can save money the next time you shop at Target. Because most Targets mark down certain departments on specific days for clearance, knowing that schedule can help you find the best deals. “For instance, you’ll find the best deals on clearance electronics on a Monday and sporting good clearance on Thursday,” said Christy Palmer, founder of the All Things Target blog. Here’s a schedule Palmer said is good for most Targets: Here’s a kick-in-the-teeth sort of a moment: You finally buy that dress you’ve been craving only to see it go on sale the next day. Well, at Target, you can get the difference between what you paid and the new sale price refunded, said Palmer. So for any item that goes on sale within 14 days after purchase, just bring in your receipt and Target will adjust the price for you. Some exclusions do apply, so make sure you read Target’s policy before claiming a price adjustment. Read More: Target Vs. Walmart: Which Price Match Guarantee Saves More? Wait, shop Amazon to save money at Target? Yep, and any other retailer for that matter because Target has a price match guarantee. As expected, there are some rules and restrictions. But in general, Target will match the lower price from select online or local retailers. Bring in proof of the current lower price, with your original Target receipt to Target’s guest service desk. End caps are the shelves at the end of the aisles, and they are often filled with choice items marked way down. Look for the ones marked “Clearance.” “Most of these are the ones facing the walls, not the main walking aisles, so you may have to do some searching for them,” said Palmer. But your diligence could pay off since Palmer said these are filled with items that have been marked down from 15% to 70% off. Clearance items are some of the best deals at Target, Palmer said, and they are marked down to certain levels in a certain order. “First, items will get marked down to 15% or 30% off, then to 50% off, and finally end up at 70% off,” she said. These items have a red “Clearance” sticker with the original price, the new price and the percentage of the markdown in the top right-hand corner without a % symbol. “Check the number in the upper-right corner of the price tag.” said Palmer. “If it says ’70,’ it’s been marked down to 70% off.” Want Halloween or Christmas decorations, Easter baskets or back-to-school items practically free? Wait a few days or a few weeks after the holiday to buy them. Holiday items will be cut by 50% the day after the holiday — 30% for candy. But wait a week or so, and products could go down to 70% off. Then, a few days later, if anything is left, they’ll go to 90% off, which is practically free. Here’s a list of days and times of year that Target offers holiday sale prices, according to All Things Target: Target releases newspaper insert ads for specials on Sunday, and sales tend to run Sunday through Saturday. So, Palmer advised shopping earlier in the week for popular items to increase your chances at nabbing them on sale. Want to cash in on clearance items without dealing with the Target parking lot? Good news: Target has an online Clearance section with items in just about every department. And don’t worry — you’re not going to get stuck slogging through pages of women’s shoes and toddlers’ toys to find a desk lamp. The site is categorized. If you’re saving money by not getting a paper, you can still get in on all the discounted fun by checking the ad online at Target.com. Just look for the “Weekly Ad” tab on the site’s top ribbon. It will have pages of deals from a few dollars off to 25% off discounts and more. If you’ve done your pre-Target-run prep properly, you might have more than one coupon for a single item. No worries: Target lets you stack coupons. So don’t be shy about handing the checkout person a Target coupon, a manufacturer’s coupon and even a third coupon, such as Target’s Cartwheel discount for the same item. No, not down the aisles; use Target’s Cartwheel app. Download the app, and put the coupons you want in your list. When you visit Target, you simply present your barcode via your smartphone, and you will receive the discount. “By using the Cartwheel app, you can save an extra 5% to 50% off,” said Palmer. And if you’re not sure if it’s a Cartwheel-discounted item, no problem. “Just scan the UPC code of an item you want to purchase with the phone app and it will tell you if a Cartwheel offer matches up with the item,” said Palmer. The really cool thing is that it can be stacked with other coupons. To save even more money at Target, sign up for an Ibotta, Ebates, BeFrugal, or Checkout 51 account. These online programs and smartphone apps give you money back for selected items you buy at Target or other participating stores. Each service is slightly different, but the bottom line is you receive cash rebates for the items you buy. If you have an iPhone or Android smartphone, you can download the Target App, which lets you find and add Cartwheel deals as well as shop Target’s Weekly Ad. Plus, you can find coupons. Simply download the app, tap “mobile coupons,” and fill out the form. Once the coupons start flowing, you can merely present your smartphone to the cashier for scanning.

Yep, just like Donald Trump and Taylor Swift, Target tweets. You might have to slog through a lot of splashy ads for things like Popsicles and summer dresses, but pay attention and you’ll also be alerted to deals on new items or free shipping windows. That’s worth a hashtag or two. Whether you’re buying for another couple or getting hitched yourself, Target’s wedding registry is a great way to save money, said Jeanette Pavini, a savings expert with Coupons.com.

And after the event, newlyweds get a coupon for 15% off remaining items on their registry. You can knock up close to 10% off your bill by buying discount gift cards at sites like Gift Card Granny, Giftcard Zen, or Raise. The cards are real gift cards that you use like cash, so the bonus is that the gift card savings is in addition to any savings with coupons or sales.

Well, the Curbside service — which is available for Target in select areas of San Jose, San Francisco, New York, New Jersey, Philadelphia and Chicago — can help you save a ton of it. Basically, you place your order from the Target of your choice, then pick it up at the curb. “You won’t even have to leave you car,” said Palmer. Target’s Dollar Spot, which is right at the entrance to the store, is a great stop for serious bargain-hunters, said Palmer. Items in this section are often just 1 but can be as much as 2 or 3, she said — and even these items get marked down. “Certain items will get marked down to 50% off and then 70% off, so you end up paying 50 cents or 30 cents,” she said. “I find great deals on stationary items, coloring books, small toys, holiday items and more.” How often have you run into a market for a gallon of milk and some eggs and come out an hour later with a cart full of bunch of stuff? That usually spells the opposite of saving. “Planning really is one of the biggest keys when it comes to saving money,” said Palmer. So take 20 minutes before you leave for Target and plan your trip. “Make a list and stick to it,” she said. “Those Target buyers seem to know what people like, so it’s very easy to see something you just ‘have to have,’” said Palmer. If it’s really something you need, don’t worry; you’ll be back. Periodically, Target might have unadvertised markdowns on items. These bargains will be labeled with red and white sale signs, and the signs will have dates on the bottom telling you how long the sales are valid, said Palmer. “Some are valid longer than a week; some sale prices will last a month or more,” she said. Occasionally, Target will offer a Target gift card when you buy a certain amount of specific products, said Palmer. “For example they will give you a 10 gift card when you buy two boxes of brand specific diapers or a 5 gift card when you buy three bottles of brand specific shampoo or conditioner,” she said. So keep an eye on the in-store signage, AllThingsTarget.com, or your favorite savings website for these gift card offers. Bring in your own reusable bags, and Target will give you a 5-cent discount at checkout for each reusable. It’s not much but it can add up — especially on those big shopping days. So far, the savings seem to be adding up for shoppers and the environment: Target shoppers have used more than 190 million reusable bags instead of paper or plastic, according to Target’s website. That’s 9.5 million worth of nickels. Working out is great for your health, but workout clothes can hurt your wallet. To combat that, checkout Champion’s C9 line or workout clothes for Target, said Lori McDaniel of Offers.com. “You’ll save as much as 50% compared to the regular Champion line on items like leggings,” she said. And fear not, she added that Target shoppers won’t give up any quality with the C9 line. Don’t rush out that door: Many high-value coupons will print after your receipt. You will receive them upon checkout, and Palmer said they can vary from 20% off a certain department to 50 cents to 5 off certain items. No wonder Target shoppers come back.

Red meats are eaten only on occasion; sugar, processed foods filled with additives, fast foods, and junk food, which are the cause of so many illnesses in today’s world are simply not eaten. It should not be news that most health problems in the US can be attributed to a poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle. The Mediterranean diet solves both problems, if you let it. It provides the healthy nutritious foods your body needs for energy and well-being; plus, it incorporates exercise to solve the sedentary lifestyle issue. Let’s look at some of the potential difficulties. 1. The diet can be expensive. When you eat primarily fish, fresh (preferably organic) fruits and vegetables, nuts, etc. you will find that they are more expensive than grabbing a cheeseburger from a fast food joint or buying junk food from the vending machine at work. But . . . if you consider the health problems you may endure in the future and the cost of health care that goes with those problems, you may want to think twice about the actual cost. The healthy foods on the Mediterranean diet may not seem so expensive after all. Question: After the end of the story: Options: A. not enough information B. the writer is not exercising at all C. the writer is making use of the Mediterranean diet D. the writer is is eating red meats often === The correct answer is Answer:","output":"C. the writer is making use of the Mediterranean diet"},{"instruction":"Given an input stream, the objective of this task is to classify whether words in the stream are grammatically correct or not.

The band originated in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1976, with singer, rhythm guitarist, and songwriter Ric Ocasek; singer, songwriter and bassist Benjamin Orr; lead guitarist Elliot Easton; keyboardist Greg Hawkes; and drummer David Robinson. The Cars were at the forefront in merging 1970s guitar-oriented rock with the new synthesizer-oriented pop that was then becoming popular and which would flourish in the early 1980s. Robert Palmer, music critic for The New York Times and Rolling Stone, described the Cars' musical style by saying: \\"they have taken some important but disparate contemporary trends--punk minimalism, the labyrinthine synthesizer and guitar textures of art rock, the '50s rockabilly revival and the melodious terseness of power pop--and mixed them into a personal and appealing blend.\\" In 2010, the founding members of the Cars suggested a reunion when Ric Ocasek, Elliot Easton, Greg Hawkes and David Robinson placed a photo of the four members together in Millbrook Sound Studios, Millbrook, New York on their Facebook page. On October 13, they also posted a snippet of a new song, \\"Blue Tip\\", on their Facebook page. A picture of Jacknife Lee in the studio was posted on the group's Facebook page hinting that he would be producing the new Cars album. In October Billboard reported that a new album which may be supported by a tour is being recorded at veteran engineer Paul Orofino's studio in Millbrook, New York. A music clip of a new song, called \\"Sad Song\\", was added to the band's Facebook page on December 7, 2010; another clip of a song called \\"Free\\" was shared on their Facebook page on January 1, 2011. The official debut video for \\"Blue Tip\\" was released February 17, 2011. The video was directed by Roberto Serrini and Eron Otcasek from The Lab NYC and features the four members of the band, and NYC based street artist Joe Iurato. According to Rolling Stone, the surviving Cars mutually agreed there would be no replacing the late Benjamin Orr, so Hawkes and Lee handled all bass parts. The new album, titled Move Like This, was released on May 10 by Hear Music/Concord Music Group, debuting at No. 7 on Billboard's album charts. It featured 10 songs in under 40 minutes. The album's first single, \\"Sad Song\\", was released to radio stations March 1. In May 2011, the Cars went on a ten-city tour of the United States and Canada and also performed at Lollapalooza in Chicago in August. Though the Cars have not broken up, they have been inactive since the tour's conclusion in 2011, and their website has not been updated since that time. Though on April 28, 2016 Ric Ocasek appeared on behalf of the Cars for a Q & A with SiriusXM satellite radio. 2016 has also seen a release of remastered Cars music on CD and vinyl.

Then they make clothes like ordinary people's for everyone. Therefore, fashion really starts with individual finding a new look. Then a company uses that look and then it becomes fashionable! That doesn't mean you will. That is to say, a model might look perfect in a shirt but that doesn't mean you will. The same goes for mobile phones. Young people are always asking me when to change my mobile phones. Mobile phone companies are always putting new functions on their phones but do we really need all these extra functions? I use my phone to call people and to send messages to my friends. I don't need a camera, Internet surfing or a calendar on my phone.

Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"Based on the short movie review \\"never seems hopelessly juvenile,\\" it is difficult to be entirely certain about the critic's opinion, as the phrase can be interpreted in different ways. However, considering the elements of the statement, it appears that the critic is leaning towards a somewhat positive opinion of the movie. The word \\"never\\" implies that there wasn't a point in the movie where it felt hopelessly juvenile, meaning it did not come across as overly immature, childish, or unsophisticated. This suggests that the critic finds this aspect to be a positive trait in the movie. The term \\"hopelessly\\" indicates a strong sense of negativity when associated with being juvenile. By stating that the movie never gave an impression of being hopelessly juvenile, the critic implies a certain level of depth and maturity present throughout the film, which they might appreciate in a movie. However, it's important to note that this short review is open to interpretation and could be seen as a backhanded compliment. The critic may have potentially expected the movie to be juvenile or childish but was surprised to find that it never reached such a level. In that case, the critic might still be pointing out that the movie has some juvenile elements, but they do not overpower the experience. In conclusion, based on the available information, it can be inferred that the critic most likely had a relatively positive view of the movie, thanks to it not being hopelessly juvenile. However, without more context or additional information on the critic's thoughts, it is challenging to gauge the precise extent of their favorability towards the film."},{"instruction":"Lizzy: Nancy has a bag containing 22 tortilla chips.

Under the guidance of interim boss Roberto di Matteo, Chelsea's victory in the final has increased his chances of securing the permanent managerial position. Let's take a look at how the game unfolded and how this win has impacted Di Matteo's future prospects. 1. Competitive Match-Up: The clash between these two football giants was undoubtedly one of the most anticipated matches of the season. With both sides boasting an array of talent, the 2-1 scoreline was always going to be a tight affair. Despite Liverpool's valiant efforts and an impressive performance from their star players, it was Chelsea who brought home the trophy this time around. 2. Chelsea's Performance and Key Players: It is undeniable that Chelsea's players stepped up their game under the watchful eye of Di Matteo. Throughout the game, the team displayed remarkable composure and tactical discipline, which eventually paid off in the form of a victory. Some standout performances came from Didier Drogba and Ramires, who netted the crucial winning goals, further solidifying their status as vital members of the squad. 3. Roberto di Matteo's Tactical Masterclass: One of the key factors in Chelsea's triumph can be attributed to the tactical genius of Roberto di Matteo. The interim boss made some bold decisions, including switching formations and making shrewd substitutions. This ultimately enabled Chelsea to stave off Liverpool's attacks and maintain their lead in the latter stages of the game. 4. The Impact of this Win on Roberto di Matteo's Future: Given the uncertainty surrounding Chelsea's managerial position, securing the FA Cup trophy for the club will undoubtedly bolster Di Matteo's credentials for the permanent role. This victory shows that he is capable of making big decisions under pressure, all while managing a talented but occasionally tumultuous roster of players. Conclusion: The FA Cup win over Liverpool was an impressive achievement for Roberto di Matteo and the Chelsea squad. Although it's too soon to say if this win guarantees him the permanent manager position, the odds seem to be in his favor. If this success can be replicated in future matches, not only Chelsea's fans but also the club's management will have a hard time debating the prospect of Di Matteo staying on as a permanent fixture at the helm of the team."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question given this paragraph: A given habitat may contain many different species, but each species must have a different niche.

Can you help me answer a few questions? If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\". Question: Who insults Leticia? Movie title: Monster's Ball Movie plot: Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton), a widower, and his son, Sonny (Heath Ledger), are corrections officers in a prison in Louisiana. They reside with Hank's ailing father, Buck (Peter Boyle), a racist retired corrections officer whose wife committed suicide. Hank is a deputy warden. He oversees the execution of convicted murderer Lawrence Musgrove (Sean Combs). As explained to Sonny by Hank, at the diner bar the night before, a \\"Monster's Ball\\" is what the execution team calls that night's get-together. The proceedings prove too intense for Sonny, who begins to vomit and then collapses as he is leading Lawrence to the electric chair. Hank confronts Sonny in the jail's bathroom afterwards and slaps him for being so \\"soft\\" and ruining a man's last walk. At home, Hank attacks Sonny in his bed and tells him to get out of the house. Sonny grabs a gun, and threatens his father, who backs off. The confrontation ends in their living room with Hank at gunpoint, lying on the carpet, and Sonny in Buck's customary chair. Sonny asks his father if he hates him. After his father calmly confirms that he does and always has, Sonny responds, \\"Well I always loved you,\\" and then shoots himself in the chest, dying instantly. Hank buries Sonny in the back garden with no real funeral because, as Buck observes, \\"He was weak.\\" Hank subsequently quits his job, burns his uniform in the backyard, and locks the door of Sonny's room. During the years of Lawrence's imprisonment, his wife, Leticia (Halle Berry), has been struggling while raising their son, Tyrell (Coronji Calhoun), who has inherited his father's artistic talent. She abusively berates the boy regarding his obesity. Along with her domestic problems, Leticia struggles financially, leading to the loss of the family car and, worse, an eviction notice on her house.

The answer is:","output":"In the movie Monster's Ball, Leticia (played by Halle Berry) faces various challenges and hardships while raising her son Tyrell (played by Coronji Calhoun) and dealing with her husband's imprisonment and eventual execution. Throughout the film, Leticia is subjected to insults and demeaning comments by various characters. One character who insults Leticia is her husband, Lawrence Musgrove (played by Sean Combs). Despite being imprisoned and facing execution, Lawrence still manages to hurt Leticia emotionally by insulting her during their final prison visit. He criticizes Leticia for the way she has been raising Tyrell and implies that she is not a good mother. This scene is poignant because it highlights Leticia's vulnerability and struggles as a single mother. Another character who insults Leticia is her employer at the diner, who demeans her in front of customers. As Leticia is struggling financially and desperately needs the job, she endures the insults in order to provide for herself and her son. Leticia is also insulted by the protagonist of the film, Hank Grotowski (played by Billy Bob Thornton). Initially, Hank treats Leticia with disdain and racial prejudice due to his own upbringing and ingrained racist beliefs. However, as the movie progresses, they form an unlikely bond, find solace in each other’s company, and eventually develop a romantic relationship. Hank's character evolves and transforms throughout the film, as he learns to show empathy and care for Leticia, rejecting his former racist mindset. In conclusion, Leticia faces insults and harsh treatment from various characters throughout the movie Monster's Ball. These insults serve as a testimony to Leticia's perseverance and resilience in the face of adversity, as she continues to fight for a better life for herself and her son.

A: A:","output":"An infection may be intracellular or extracellular, depending on the pathogen."},{"instruction":"OK. You'll be given the following question. Please do chain-of-thought reasoning. Which of the following sentences is nonsensical? Options: - Sentence A: \\"If you fall, you will break a bone\\" - Sentence B: \\"If you fall, you may break a bone\\"","output":"To determine which of the two sentences is nonsensical, let's examine each sentence and evaluate the meaning it conveys. Sentence A: \\"If you fall, you will break a bone\\" This sentence implies that falling will definitely result in breaking a bone. Though this statement can be true in certain circumstances, it is not universally true, as falling doesn't always guarantee a broken bone. However, this sentence is not entirely nonsensical because it could apply to specific situations or be a warning, especially if the context involves a high risk of injury. Sentence B: \\"If you fall, you may break a bone\\" This sentence conveys the possibility that breaking a bone might occur if someone falls. Unlike Sentence A, this statement recognizes that breaking a bone is not an absolute outcome of falling, but a potential outcome instead. This is a more reasonable statement and is not nonsensical. In conclusion, neither Sentence A nor Sentence B is outright nonsensical, as both can be valid depending on the context. However, Sentence A is more likely to be considered nonsensical than Sentence B due to its more generalized and definite nature, as it doesn’t account for different factors and scenarios that could lead to various outcomes after a fall."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Who writes poetry such as Glaring Through Oblivion as well as leading the heavy metal band System Of A Down?

They are twisted and grotesque creatures, eerily silent and unnaturally strong, resulting from the devastating effects of the Corprus disease, which is known to plague the land of Morrowind. Tapping into their knowledge and previous encounters with these creatures, the protagonist sets about collecting the necessary supplies and weaponry. An ideal choice would be a powerful, enchanted weapon, capable of dealing significant damage to these relentless enemies. They also gather potions to boost their strength, agility, and endurance, along with healing potions to quickly recover from any injuries sustained during battle. Armed and ready for action, the protagonist ventures into the depths of the Corprus Stalkers' hideout, which is nothing more than a gloomy, dank cavern filled with stagnant air. The eerie atmosphere only serves to accentuate their fears, yet, they remain undeterred. They know that facing their fears head-on is the surest way to purge the land of this menace. As they delve deeper into the cavern, their senses are heightened, wary of any signs of danger. Soon enough, they catch the first glimpse of a Corprus Stalker. The sickly, misshapen figure is instantly recognizable, and, with a mix of anticipation and dread, they prepare to make their first strike.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more heat in the furnace happens, how will it affect MORE heat for the house. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis in this case refers to an increase in heat within the furnace beyond its usual operating temperature. If more heat is generated in the furnace, it may potentially have various effects on the overall heating process for the house. 1. Direct effect: If the furnace produces more heat, the air being heated within the furnace will reach higher temperatures. As a result, the blower will distribute this warmer air throughout the ducts, which will eventually exit through the vents into the room. This warmer air may lead to a quicker increase in the room temperature. However, this would only be more effective up to a certain point, as an overheated furnace can pose safety risks and damage the system. 2. Indirect effect: While an increase in heat generation within the furnace may initially contribute to more heat for the house, it could eventually lead to several negative consequences. Overheating can cause components within the furnace to wear out or malfunction sooner, which could ultimately decrease the efficiency and effectiveness of the heating system. Additionally, an overheated furnace can pose a fire hazard and compromise the safety of the occupants. 3. Thermostat control: The thermostat is designed to sense when the desired temperature has been reached and send a signal to the heating system to stop producing more heat. If the furnace is generating more heat than needed, the thermostat will work to regulate the system and maintain the desired temperature in the room. This implies that even if more heat is produced in the furnace, the thermostat will counteract this excessive heat generation to maintain a comfortable temperature indoors. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of more heat in the furnace may have a direct positive effect on the heating process for the house up to a certain point. However, it also has potential indirect effects, such as damaging the heating system components or posing safety risks. Therefore, it's important to ensure proper furnace maintenance and operation to avoid these issues and maintain an effective and efficient heating system."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Currency exchange services: You can exchange your home currency for Dominican Pesos at currency exchange bureaus in your home country before departure or at the airport in the Dominican Republic upon arrival. 2. ATMs: You can use ATMs in the Dominican Republic to withdraw Dominican Pesos using your debit or credit card. Be aware of potential fees your bank may charge for foreign transactions and withdrawals. It is always a good idea to inform your bank about your travel plans to avoid blocked transactions. 3. Credit cards: Major credit cards such as Visa and MasterCard are widely accepted in the Dominican Republic, primarily in hotels, restaurants, and shops in tourist areas. However, you might come across smaller businesses or remote locations where credit cards are not accepted, so it's wise to carry some cash with you. 4. Travelers' checks: Although they are becoming less common, travelers' checks can still be used in the Dominican Republic, but keep in mind that not all businesses accept them, and you may face additional fees for exchanging them. In conclusion, while US dollars are widely accepted, bringing and using the Dominican Peso is more advisable for better exchange rates and flexibility within the country. Ensure you carry a mix of cash (Dominican Pesos), a debit or credit card, and possibly travelers' checks for a hassle-free experience."},{"instruction":"Do some people die without understanding the actual meaning of life, being stuck in the materialistic pleasures the universe offers? Why are some religious people, who believe in life after death, and the day of judgment, also extremely materialistic and think only about their needs before death? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"Yes, some people might not fully understand the actual meaning of life and may focus more on materialistic things. Everyone has different beliefs and priorities, which sometimes can lead them to focus more on the things they can see and touch, like toys or clothes rather than bigger ideas like the meaning of life. Some religious people might also be materialistic because they might think it's important to take care of their needs and wants before they pass away. This doesn't mean they don't believe in life after death or judgment day, but they might find it difficult to balance both beliefs. These two questions are related because they both talk about people focusing on materialistic things and not fully understanding the deeper meaning of life.

Hendrix biographers Harry Shapiro and Caesar Glebbeek described the incident as \\"a nightmare which ... plagued\\" him for seven months. According to Redding, \\"the bust knocked any positive feelings Jimi was holding onto out of him\\" and that he was in \\"agonised suspense\\" from the arrest until the trial. In 2012, Plummer wrote: \\"The real possibility of prison hung over Hendrix like a spectre ... a threat to his career and the cause of much brooding and rumination.\\" Journalist Charles Shaar Murray asserted that the incident jeopardized what he described as \\"Hendrix's increasingly fragile peace of mind\\". Two weeks after the arrest, Hendrix told Lawrence: \\"Whatever I have done ... getting hooked on heroin is not one of them.\\" He explained that his fear of needles discouraged him from using the drug and that having known junkies convinced him that it was not something he should get involved with.

Is \\"He also pointed out the concept of apostolic succession to support his arguments.\\" the correct answer?","output":"As an AI, I don't have direct access to your personal information unless it's shared with me in the course of our conversation. However, I can tell you that Irenaeus, a 2nd-century theologian, is known for using the concept of Apostolic Succession to support his arguments against Gnosticism. Firstly, we need to consider the background of your query. Bishop Irenaeus was a significant early Christian theologian who was active in the 2nd century. One of the main controversies he faced was the rise of Gnosticism, a religious movement that had a different interpretation of Christian faith and which was considered heretical by mainstream Christianity. One of the main ways Irenaeus countered the beliefs of the Gnostics was through his writing, particularly in his work \\"Against Heresies\\". He argued that the Gnostics' beliefs were not in line with the teachings passed down from the Apostles of Jesus. Therefore, to justify his arguments, Irenaeus cited the concept of Apostolic Succession. This is a belief in the uninterrupted transmission of spiritual authority from the Apostles through successive Popes and Bishops, taught by the Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Churches, and Anglican Communion among others. So, yes, it is correct to say that Irenaeus cited the concept of Apostolic Succession to support his arguments."},{"instruction":"When was the American banker on which Revenue Act of 1924 was named born? The answer to this question is:","output":"Andrew William Mellon, the American banker on which Revenue Act of 1924 was named, was born on March 24, 1855 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Andrew Mellon was a prominent American banker, businessman, industrialist, philanthropist and also a politician from the Republican Party. The Revenue Act of 1924, popularly called as Mellon Tax Bill, was named after him during his tenure as the United States Secretary of the Treasury. Living through the period of the American Civil War and the post-war economic boom, Mellon came to prominence initially as a leading financier in the oil, steel, shipbuilding, construction, and other industries. Later, he served in the administration of three US presidents: Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover. As the Secretary of the Treasury, he played a crucial role in formulating federal tax laws and in policymaking. One of his masterworks was the Revenue Act of 1924 for which he oversaw successful passage. The act focused on reducing the federal tax burdens on individuals and corporations, simplifying tax laws, and eliminating unnecessary taxes. Apart from his political and business career, Mellon was also a noted philanthropist. He donated vast sums to educational and cultural institutions, including the establishment of the well-known Mellon Institute of Industrial Research and the National Gallery of Art. Summing up, Andrew Mellon, whose influence was acknowledged through the naming of the Revenue Act of 1924 after him, was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on March 24, 1855."},{"instruction":"Review: It's been a long time since I last saw a movie this bad.. The acting is very average, the story is horribly boring, and I'm at a loss for words as to the execution. It was completely unoriginal. O, and this is as much a comedy as Clint Eastwood's a pregnant Schwarzenegger! One of the first scenes (the one with the television show - where the hell are you?) got it right - the cast was 80% of let's face it - forgotten actors. If they were hoping for a career relaunch, then I think it might never happen with this on their CV! The script had the potential, but neither 80% of the actors nor the director (who's an actor and clearly should stick to being an actor) pulled it off. Fred Durst was the only one who seemed better than any of the rest. I'm sorry, but if you ever consider watching this - I highly recommend you turn to something less traumatic, because not only it's a total loss of time, but also a weak example of what bad cinema looks like. Now, what is this review like? a. negative. b. positive.","output":"The review is definitely a. negative. The reviewer makes it abundantly clear from the start that they did not enjoy the movie, using strong words like 'horribly boring' and 'completely unoriginal' to express their dissatisfaction. There is a palpable frustration in the way that they talk about the acting, pointing out that most of the cast consisted of forgotten actors, which they found disappointing. The critic also criticizes the story, implying a lack of creativity on the part of the filmmakers. They have a particular gripe with the director of the movie, suggesting that he should stick to acting, rather than directing, indicating that they think his directing skills are subpar. They do give minimal praise to Fred Durst saying he seemed better than the rest of the cast, however this brief positive comment is outweighed by their overarching negative view of the film. When speaking of the execution they call it 'a weak example of what bad cinema looks like', which further emphasizes their disapproval. Their final advice to others is to avoid watching this movie, as they believe it to be a complete waste of time and they warn that it could be a traumatic experience. Thus, it's clear that the reviewer's overall take on the movie is extremely negative."},{"instruction":"Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

Politically, Istanbul is seen as the most important administrative region in Turkey. Many politicians, including the President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, are of the view that a political party's performance in Istanbul is more significant than its general performance overall. This is due to the city's role as Turkey's financial centre, its large electorate and the fact that Erdoğan himself was elected Mayor of Istanbul in 1994. In the run-up to local elections in 2019, Erdoğan claimed 'if we fail in Istanbul, we will fail in Turkey'.Historically, Istanbul has voted for the winning party in general elections since 1995. Since 2002, the right-wing Justice and Development Party (AKP) has won pluralities in every general election, with 41.74% of the vote in the most recent parliamentary election on 24 June 2018. Erdoğan, the AKP's presidential candidate, received exactly 50.0% of the vote in the presidential election held on the same day. Starting with Erdoğan in 1994, Istanbul has had a conservative mayor for 25 years, until 2019. The second largest party in Istanbul is the centre-left Republican People's Party (CHP), which is also the country's main opposition. The left-wing pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) is the city's third largest political force due to a substantial number of Kurdish people migrating from south-eastern Turkey. More recently, Istanbul and many of Turkey's metropolitan cities are following a trend away from the government and their right-wing ideology. In 2013 and 2014, large-scale anti-AKP government protests began in İstanbul and spread throughout the nation. This trend first became evident electorally in the 2014 mayoral election where the centre-left opposition candidate won an impressive 40% of the vote, despite not winning. The first government defeat in Istanbul occurred in the 2017 constitutional referendum, where Istanbul voted 'No' by 51.4% to 48.6%. The AKP government had supported a 'Yes' vote and won the vote nationally due to high support in rural parts of the country....

Artistically, Moore, Hepworth and other members of The Seven and Five Society would develop steadily more abstract work, partly influenced by their frequent trips to Paris and their contact with leading progressive artists, notably Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Jean Arp and Alberto Giacometti. Moore flirted with Surrealism, joining Paul Nash's modern art movement \\"Unit One\\", in 1933. In 1934, Moore visited Spain; he visited the cave of Altamira (which he described as the \\"Royal Academy of Cave Painting\\"), Madrid, Toledo and Pamplona.Moore and Nash were on the organising committee of the International Surrealist Exhibition, which took place in London in 1936. In 1937, Roland Penrose purchased an abstract 'Mother and Child' in stone from Moore that he displayed in the front garden of his house in Hampstead. The work proved controversial with other residents and the local press ran a campaign against the piece over the next two years. At this time Moore gradually transitioned from direct carving to casting in bronze, modelling preliminary maquettes in clay or plaster rather than making preparatory drawings. In 1938, Moore met Kenneth Clark for the first time. From this time, Clark became an unlikely but influential champion of Moore's work, and through his position as member of the Arts Council of Great Britain he secured exhibitions and commissions for the artist., what would be the answer ?

Self-care on all levels should be an integral part of your lifestyle. There is an abundance of information available about the benefits of eating well and exercising regularly to sustain a healthy mind and body. In fact, I write about both regularly. But today I want to move in a little different direction. In addition to those two very basic and critical activities, there are a number of other things you can to improve your mental health and overall well-being. By incorporating them into your daily life, you will be better able to manage most challenges – including struggles with self-doubt, anxiety, and mild depression. Practices that Focus Your Energy on Well-being Accept Your Feelings Stuffing or ignoring your emotions is more damaging than it is helpful. Everyone has emotions. They are a natural part of being human. Bottling them up may seem like a good solution in the moment, but when you do it all the time, you are potentially creating a time bomb that will eventually explode. Unfortunately, you are hurting yourself as you hold them in and you run the risk of hurting those you love when the eruption finally occurs. Rather than acknowledging what you are feeling and allowing yourself to experience emotions, you may medicate, rationalize, blame, bury, deny, smother, drink, or stuff them (pretend they don’t exist). Emotions have become the enemy and many people will do anything to avoid them – especially the big three: fear, anger and sadness. It takes a lot of mental, physical and emotional energy to avoiding your feelings and creates high levels of stress and anxiety. Don’t stuff your emotions!

Options: + yes. + it is not possible to tell. + no.","output":"To analyze the statements and answer the question, let's break down the information provided in each sentence. Sentence 1: How about you guys, are you in a house apartment or a house? - This sentence asks if the person(s) in question live in a house, an apartment, or a house. Sentence 2: Do you live in a single-family home or in an apartment? - This sentence asks if the person(s) in question live in a single-family home (which is essentially a house) or an apartment. Now, let's consider the question and the options: Question: If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? The first sentence being true means that the person(s) in question live in a house, an apartment, or a house. Now, let's examine the possibilities for each option: Option 1: Yes - If the person(s) live in a house or an apartment, this would mean the second sentence asking \\"Do you live in a single-family home or an apartment?\\" could also be true since a house can be considered a single-family home. Option 2: It is not possible to tell - At first glance, this option may seem plausible since the first sentence asks about living in a \\"house apartment,\\" a term that is not widely used. However, since it also asks about living in a house, we can still conclude that the second sentence could be true. Option 3: No - This option indicates that the second sentence would not be true if the first sentence is true. However, since both sentences essentially ask about living in a house or an apartment, it makes sense that if the first statement holds true, the second should as well. Based on the comparison of the sentences and the options, the most accurate answer to the question, \\"If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?\\" would be: Option 1: Yes"},{"instruction":"Q:Information: - Worsted (or ) is a high-quality type of wool yarn, the fabric made from this yarn, and a yarn weight category. The name derives from Worstead, a village in the English county of Norfolk. That village, together with North Walsham and Aylsham, formed a manufacturing centre for yarn and cloth in the 12th century, when pasture enclosure and liming rendered the East Anglian soil too rich for the older agrarian sheep breeds.

Article: He has lived through various dangers but time may be running out for the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat. On September 11, Israel announced its decision to remove him, following several Palestinian suicide bomb attacks on Israel. \\"He should be punished for the killings,\\" an Israeli official said, \\"He has done nothing to stop the terrorist groups.\\" But the decision has angered many other countries. China said that Arafat is the true leader, elected by the Palestinian people, and removing him would harm the peace in the Middle East. Other governments share this idea. Arafat himself said: \\"They can kill me, but never get me out of my country.\\" He has spent most of his life in danger as the most important aim of Israel. But, just like a cat with nine lives, Arafat escaped every time. For years he has made a practice of sleeping in a different bed each night, thinking a moving person is harder to hit. In 1985, Israel sent fighter planes to kill Arafat. The wild bombing destroyed his office in Tunis but Arafat himself was unhurt. In 1992, the aircraft in which he was flying over North Africa broke in two during a crash landing. The pilot was killed but he managed to remain alive. What is so unbelievable is that he always remains calm in great danger. Israeli tanks and planes attacked his office building in Ram Allah in December 2001. When they saw the attackers coming, Arafat's bodyguards _ his orders to stay still and carried him to safety underground. Seconds later, several bombs were dropped nearby. Though safe, his bodyguards were so frightened that they were wet in sweat. But, Arafat, with Israeli tanks only 200 meters away, showed no fear at all. He stayed in the damaged office, talking by phone with foreign leaders in hope of preventing further attacks from Israel. All these experiences have made him a beloved leader to his people and an enemy to some others. But has he used up the last of his nine lives? Only time will tell. Question: According to the passage, which statement is true? Options: A: In 1992, Arafat's plane crashed in South Africa. B: Israeli officers thought Arafat himself sent the terrorist groups to Israel. C: China is the only country against Israel's decision of removing Arafat.
