Они формируются в процессе социализации человека и могут иметь значительное влияние на развитие личности. Гендерные стереотипы создают ограничения и ожидания по поводу того, как должны вести себя мужчины и женщины. Например, женщине может быть навязано, что ее главная задача – заботиться о семье, а мужчине – быть сильным и защищать свою семью. Эти стереотипы могут ограничивать выборы и возможности людей развивать свои способности и интересы. Постоянное подтверждение гендерных стереотипов может привести к формированию чувства неполноценности, недоверия к себе, а также к ощущению ограниченности в своем развитии. Люди, которые не соответствуют традиционным представлениям о своем поле, могут столкнуться с дискриминацией и неодобрением со стороны окружающих.

Adjust the styling and content according to your specific requirements."},{"instruction":"set color in html","output":"To set the color of text in HTML, you can use the CSS \`color\` property to define the desired text color. Here's how you can set the color of text in an HTML document: 1. Using Inline CSS: You can set the color of text directly within an HTML element using the \`style\` attribute with the \`color\` property. Here's an example: \`\`\`html <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>Set Text Color</title> </head> <body> <h1 style=\\"color: red;\\">This text is red</h1> <p style=\\"color: blue;\\">This text is blue</p> <p style=\\"color: green;\\">This text is green</p> </body> </html> \`\`\` In this example, the \`h1\` element will be displayed in red color, the first \`p\` element in blue color, and the second \`p\` element in green color. 2. Using Internal CSS: You can also define a CSS style block within the \`<head>\` section of your HTML document to set the text color for multiple elements. Here's an example: \`\`\`html <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>Set Text Color</title> <style> h1 { color: red; } p { color: blue; } </style> </head> <body> <h1>This text is red</h1> <p>This text is blue</p> <p>This text is also blue</p> </body> </html> \`\`\` In this example, the text color for all \`h1\` elements will be red, and for all \`p\` elements will be blue. 3. Using External CSS: You can define the text color in an external CSS file and link it to your HTML document. Here's an example: \`\`\`css /* styles.css */ h1 { color: red; } p { color: blue; } \`\`\` \`\`\`html <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>Set Text Color</title> <link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" type=\\"text/css\\" href=\\"styles.css\\"> </head> <body> <h1>This text is red</h1> <p>This text is blue</p> </body> </html> \`\`\` In this example, the \`h1\` elements will have text in red color, and the \`p\` elements will have text in blue color as defined in the \`styles.css\` file. By using these methods, you can easily set the text color in HTML using CSS properties such as \`color\`. Adjust the color values and apply them to the desired elements based on your design requirements."},{"instruction":"Markup in flask","output":"In Flask, you can use several methods to include markup in your templates. Here are some common ways to incorporate markup into your Flask application: 1. **HTML Markup in Templates:** In Flask templates (Jinja templates), you can directly write HTML markup to structure and style your content. For example: \`\`\`html <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>Flask App</title> </head> <body> <h1>Welcome to My Flask App</h1> <p>This is a paragraph with <strong>bold text</strong> in it.</p> </body> </html> \`\`\` 2. **Use Jinja Templating Engine:** Flask uses the Jinja templating engine, which allows you to include dynamic content, conditionals, loops, and more in your HTML templates. For example: \`\`\`html <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>Flask App</title> </head> <body> <h1>Welcome, {{ user }}!</h1> <ul> {% for item in items %} <li>{{ item }}</li> {% endfor %} </ul> </body> </html> \`\`\` 3. **Markup Escaping:** Flask automatically escapes special characters in string variables to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. You can mark safe content using the \`safe\` filter or \`|safe\` filter in Jinja to indicate that the content is safe. For example: \`\`\`python from flask import Flask, render_template app = Flask(__name__) @app.route('/') def index(): data = '<h1>This is header</h1>' return render_template('index.html', data=data) if __name__ == '__main__': app.run() \`\`\` In the template: \`\`\`html <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>Flask App</title> </head> <body> {{ data|safe }} </body> </html> \`\`\` 4. **Markdown Support:** If you want to use Markdown in your Flask application, you can integrate a Markdown processor like \`markdown2\` or \`Flask-Markdown\` to render Markdown content in your templates. Example using \`markdown2\`: \`\`\`python import markdown2 @app.route('/') def index(): markdown_content = '**Bold Text**' html_content = markdown2.markdown(markdown_content) return render_template('index.html', content=html_content) \`\`\` Template usage: \`\`\`html {{ content|safe }} \`\`\` These are some ways to include markup in Flask applications. Choose the appropriate method based on your requirements for static content, dynamic content, escaping, or Markdown support in your templates."},{"instruction":"flash in flask how does it work","output":"In Flask, the \`flash\` function is used to display a message to the user as part of the HTTP response. The flashed messages are stored in the session for one request and are removed afterwards. It provides a convenient way to show feedback or notifications to users, such as success messages, error messages, warnings, etc. Here's how the \`flash\` function works in Flask: 1. **Import the \`flash\` function:** First, you need to import the \`flash\` function from the Flask module: \`\`\`python from flask import flash \`\`\` 2. **Flashing Messages:** You can flash messages in your routes using the \`flash\` function. For example, to flash a success message: \`\`\`python from flask import flash, redirect, render_template, url_for @app.route('/success') def success(): flash('Success! Your action has been completed successfully.', 'success') return redirect(url_for('index')) \`\`\` 3. **Showing Flash Messages in Templates:** To display flashed messages in your templates, you can use the \`get_flashed_messages\` function within your template. Here's an example of how to show flashed messages in your template: \`\`\`html <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>Flask Flash Messages Example</title> </head> <body> {% with messages = get_flashed_messages(with_categories=true) %} {% if messages %} {% for category, message in messages %} <div class=\\"alert alert-{{ category }}\\">{{ message }}</div> {% endfor %} {% endif %} {% endwith %} </body> </html> \`\`\` 4. **Message Categories:** You can categorize messages for different types of feedback, such as success, error, warning, info, etc. For example: \`\`\`python flash('Error! Something went wrong.', 'error') flash('Info! This is just an informational message.', 'info') \`\`\` 5. **Styling Flash Messages:** You can add CSS styling to the flashed messages in your template to differentiate between different message types. For example, you can use Bootstrap classes to style the messages: \`\`\`html <div class=\\"alert alert-success\\">{{ message }}</div> <div class=\\"alert alert-danger\\">{{ message }}</div> <div class=\\"alert alert-warning\\">{{ message }}</div> <div class=\\"alert alert-info\\">{{ message }}</div> \`\`\` By utilizing the \`flash\` function in Flask, you can provide feedback to users based on their actions and improve the user experience of your application. Flash messages are typically used to display short-lived notifications or status updates after a user interaction."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

According to Chinese historical texts, such as the \\"Bamboo Annals\\" and the writings of Sima Qian in his \\"Records of the Grand Historian\\" (Shiji), the Xia Dynasty was the first to introduce the hereditary system of monarchy in China, and it laid down the foundation for later dynasties. Historical records assert that Yu the Great was a heroic figure who managed the flooding of the Yellow River, thus bringing order to China and enabling the establishment of the Xia Dynasty. These tales indicate that Yu achieved this through the construction of drainage systems rather than attempting to block the floods directly. His dedication to the task was such that it was said he passed by his own home three times without entering while managing the floodwaters. Yu the Great's control of the waters is not only an important narrative in Chinese history but also a symbolic representation of the power and responsibility of the state to manage and regulate natural resources for the well-being of its people. The stories of Yu the Great also have implications regarding virtues that were to become deeply ingrained in Chinese rulership, such as self-sacrifice, diligence, and beneficence toward the people. The Xia Dynasty is believed to have lasted for several centuries, and its rulers are said to have passed their power to their heirs, thereby establishing a dynastic rule. However, the later part of the dynasty was reputedly marked by tyranny and corruption, and the Xia was eventually overthrown by the Shang Dynasty. The historicity of the Xia Dynasty has been a topic of debate among scholars. While some archaeological findings, such as Erlitou culture sites, have been suggested as evidence of the Xia Dynasty's existence, definitive proof has yet to be found. Due to this lack of solid archaeological evidence and the mythological nature of many of the accounts of this time period, some historians consider the Xia to be more a part of legend than a real historical dynasty. Nonetheless, the Xia Dynasty occupies an important position in the cultural history of China, representing the dawn of Chinese civilization and the emergence of state-level societies."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"Write an anime scene about a 19th century Equestrian thinking of ways to punish his younger brother from the modern day. His name is Arthur. Arthur has slicked back blonde hair and blue eyes. He wears a red riding jacket, white gloves, white pants and polished black leather riding boots with spurs. He is posh, tender and playful. His younger brother did something bad and his parents asked him to ground him while they're going out. He punishes him by making him to polish his boots while he comfortably sits on a armchair caressing his riding crop while casually telling his brother about his day.","output":"**INT. ARTHUR'S GRANDIOUS DRAWING ROOM - DAY** A room richly adorned with antique furniture and horse riding memorabilia. Sunlight streams through tall windows, casting wafts of golden dust into the air. ARTHUR, a handsome young man with slicked-back blonde hair, peers out of the window, absently caressing his prized riding crop. He's the quintessential appearance of 19th-century nobility, from his immaculate red riding jacket down to his gleaming black leather boots. His YOUNGER BROTHER, a boy in modern-day casual clothes — a stark contrast to the room's classical aura — stands sheepishly near the doorway, clearly out of place amidst the vintage decor. **ARTHUR** *(Turning away from the window)* Ah, there you are. Come in, won't you? The Younger Brother shuffles into the room, hands nervously buried in his pockets. **YOUNGER BROTHER** *(Muttering)* Arthur, I really am sorry, you know. It was just— Arthur raises a hand, silencing him with a tender, yet commanding gaze. **ARTHUR** Do not fret, little one. We shall not dwell on the past. However, Mother and Father did task me with ensuring you learn the value of responsibility. He pats an ornate armchair next to a small table loaded with boot-polishing equipment. Taking a seat, he extends one leg, allowing the light to catch the already sheeny leather of his boot. **ARTHUR** *(Playfully)* Your penance will be to polish my boots to an even higher standard than they currently boast. And, as you do, I shall regale you with the day's events — one must be cultured, after all. The Younger Brother hesitates for a moment before sitting at Arthur's feet and beginning the task, handling the brush and polish awkwardly. As Arthur looks down, an affectionate smile teases at the corner of his lips. He starts speaking in a light-hearted tone, describing the horses he's ridden and the people he's met, occasionally offering tips on boot polishing with a teasing flick of his riding crop. His tone blends the stern expectation of his era with a warm sibling playfulness. **ARTHUR** *(Amused)* There! A circular motion — like that, brother. Boots should mirror the soul: bright, polished, and free of scuffs. With a shake of his head, the Younger Brother can't help but chuckle at the absurdity and charm of his elder brother, realizing that the punishment is more bonding than reprimanding. As Arthur continues with his stories, filled with animated gestures and lively impressions, their voices mix with the fragrance of leather polish, embracing two eras in a single quaint moment.

The room is wrapped in a warm, peaceful ambiance, enhanced by the soothing crackle of the fire. Delicate china cups clink gently as they are set upon matching saucers. **ARTHUR** *(Holding his cup with white-gloved hands)* You know, there is nothing quite like a cup of tea to settle one's thoughts. Arthur takes a leisurely sip of the steaming hot tea, a contented smile gracing his face. He observes his Younger Brother blowing on his cup, trying to cool the hot liquid. **YOUNGER BROTHER** *(Blowing on his tea)* How can you drink it while it's that hot? Doesn't it burn? **ARTHUR** *(Chuckling)* Ah, but patience is a virtue less appreciated in your time, I observe. Here, we savour the heat, the flavour — it's a ritual. The Younger Brother watches, amused by Arthur's poise and composure. **YOUNGER BROTHER** Ritual, huh? Well, I'm all for savoring flavours, but I like my taste buds uncharred. Arthur lets out a hearty laugh, lifting the mood further. **ARTHUR** Tell me then, how does your generation find solace in daily life when everything moves so... rapidly? The Younger Brother considers the question, still gently puffing on the hot tea. **YOUNGER BROTHER** We hang out, play video games, share memes... **ARTHUR** *(Intrigued)* Memes? What manner of leisure activity might that be? The Younger Brother grins, realizing the gap in understanding between his world and Arthur's. **YOUNGER BROTHER** They're... kind of like inside jokes with the whole world. You share a picture with a funny caption, and everybody gets it instantly. Arthur raises an eyebrow, seemingly trying to wrap his head around the concept. **ARTHUR** A worldwide jest shared in an instant. Fascinating! The unity of humour across such vast distances... We have our jesters and bards, but your means of connection is unparalleled. The Younger Brother finally takes a tentative sip of his tea, finding it cool enough. He looks up at Arthur, sensing the deep curiosity within his brother's blue eyes. **YOUNGER BROTHER** It's nice, you know, being able to share a laugh with someone halfway around the globe. But sometimes, I think we lose out on moments like this. Just sitting together, having tea, talking. Arthur sets down his cup and offers a warm, understanding nod. **ARTHUR** Indeed. While your time has marvels and wonders that stir the imagination, perhaps what remains most precious is something that transcends time — the undeniable joy of simple companionship. They share a smile, an unspoken acknowledgment of the value in their shared moment. With the warmth of the crackling fire and the subtle aroma of tea enveloping them, the two brothers, separated by eras, find common ground in the timeless nature of human connection.

MNS 엔터는 얄짤 없다. 들키질 말았어야 했는데, 설마 가드를 심어놨을 줄이야. “···역 주변 사진은 되는 거 맞죠?” 그 외엔 데이터를 지웠다. 안 지우면 안 보내줄 것 같았다. 기자가 떠나고, 가드 팀장은 실장에게 전화했다. “실장님, 제일 악랄한 곳은 쫓아냈으니까 우담 씨한테 안심하시라고 전해주세요.” *** 정우담은 실장과 통화 중이었다. -기자가 깜빡 속아 넘어갔네요. 앞으론 편하게 돌아다니셔도 돼요. “기자 붙을 거라고 미리 알려주셨지만, 실은 전 평소대로 한 게 전부라.” 실장이 웃으며 쉬라고 말하곤 전화를 끊었다. “아무튼 끝이라니 잘됐네.” MNS 엔터가 이번 사태와 관련된 것들을 다 정리했다고 한다. 그러니 우담은 우담이 할 일을 하면 됐다. 먼저 곰돌이들 이름이다. “가루는 분말 같고, 에이담은 외국 애 같잖아.” -우웅. 눈싸움이 끝난 곰돌이들, 3호는 그새 또 나갔다. “몇 호로 부르기보단 그래도 웅이가 나으려나?” 심플 이즈 베스트라고 했던가. 1~6호라 부르던 우담인 탓에 다른 이름들보단 1~6웅에 강한 끌림을 느꼈다. 그리고 다녀오면 주기로 한 수고비, 111만 원을 나무 가방에 넣었다. -가야금(F) 나무에 영양제를 공급하겠습니까? “응. B까지.” 악기들은 최소 B등급을 찍기로 했다. 특히나 가야금은 모든 장르를 퓨전으로 만들어주는 멋진 한국 전통 악기니까. -가야금(B) 나무로 자랐습니다 동시에 그는 카와이 베이스 3탄의 제목을 생각해냈다. ‘야금야금.’ 이어서 가상 악기 말고 실물 가야금을 사려면 얼마가 필요한지도 검색해봤다. 웬만하면 장인이 만든 걸 써야 한다는데. ‘100만 원 미만으론 어림도 없겠다.’ 인터넷으로 가격만 알아본 거지, 사는 건 매장을 찾아갈 생각이라 그보다 더 들 수도 있다. “하모하모 빨리 팔아야겠는데?” 저작권을 넘기는 게 아닌, 라이센스. Mrsquid 채널에 올라간 <하모하모> 조회수가 300만을 넘겼다. 증가 속도가 <리코리코리> 때보다도 빠르다. 덕분에 Venix는 또 눈독 들이고, 일본의 리듬게임 제작사에서도 문의가 왔다. 사용료 3년 치씩 한 번에 내겠단다. 둘 중 누구에게 팔지 고민 중이라기보단, Venix가 찜만 해놓고 계약 얘기로 이어지질 않아 지체되는 것이다. 아무래도 또 신 캐릭터 테마송을 염두에 두고 있나 보다. “네온 민아 나온 지 얼마 안 돼서, 다음 신캐까진 꽤 걸리지 않나?” Venix 사운드팀장한테 빨리 결정해달라고 해야겠다. 당장 쓸 게 아니면 나중에 만들어주면 되니까. ‘그럼 하모하모랑 퇴직금 다 입금되면···.’ 주말 예능의 가요제에 나가기로 했으니 리듬&소울 또는 샘플링 중에서 A등급으로 올리고, 가야금까지 무난히 장만할 수 있을 것이다. 알아보면 렌탈도 있겠지만, 언젠가 심어진 나무들에 해당하는 악기 전체를 사용해 곡을 만들어 보고 싶다. 가능하면 빌리기보단 소유가 낫다. 그러기로 정한 우담은 처음 써볼 아이템에 살며시 긴장했다. 프로듀싱(A)을 30분간 S등급으로 만들어주는 0.4mL 인공 눈물. 용량이 작다. 넣다가 실수로 눈을 감으면 레어 아이템 날린다. “조심조심.” 우담은 눈을 한쪽씩 손으로 크게 벌려 인공 눈물을 떨어뜨렸다. 효과가 즉시 나타난다. 안구가 촉촉해졌다. 지속 시간이 짧아 1초도 허비해선 안 되니 작업실에 앉은 후에 사용했는데, 대뜸 어지럼증이 느껴져 하마터면 의자째로 넘어질 뻔 뻔했다. “뭐, 뭐야?” 몸은 멈춰있는데 마치 세상이 움직이는 듯했다. 휙, 휙. 휘휘휘휘휘휘휘휙! 현실감 높은 VR 게임을 하는 것 같아서 비명이 나올 뻔했다. 새 나무가 심어질 때와 등급을 올릴 때완 확연히 달랐다. 그동안은 머리가 명료해지고 필요한 사운드와 컨셉을 떠올리며 집중력이 올라가는 식이었다면, 이번엔 시끄러워졌다. 다행히, 심장 박동이 한껏 빨라졌다가 진정되면서 다시 그의 세상은 고요해졌다. 곧 자세를 바로잡은 정우담은 저지클럽 기반의 비트 하나를 짜고, 실물 가야금을 장만하면 녹음으로 트랙을 교체할 테지만, 우선 가상 악기로 가야금 플러그인을 불러와 <야금야금>을 완성했다. 그걸로 끝이 아니었다. Day.G에게 주기로 트로피컬 하우스와 걸스힙합도 MR을 더 탄탄하게 수정하고 가이드 녹음까지 끝마쳤다. ‘···이게 S등급?’ 30분간, 그는 진화를 맛봤다. 그도 그럴 게, B등급이 실력자라면 A등급은 전문가다. 프로다. 그리고 S등급은 흔치 않은 프로 사이에서도 상위 1할에 해당하는 정상급 프로. 돌연 예전에 친구 최준섭이 했던 말이 생각났다. ‘우담아, 너 스터전의 법칙이라고 들어봤냐?’ 모든 창작의 90%는 위대한 10%를 위해 버려진다던 이야기. 이후, 정우담의 머리엔 한 가지 생각뿐이었다. ‘1억을 벌어야 해.’ 다음 날. 그의 음원이 40위권에 들어도 신인은 반드시 닭장 대기실을 써야 한다는 음악방송에서도, 또 그다음 날인 지상파의 음악방송에 가서도 온통 그 생각이었다. 이날, 우담은 또다시 연예기사란 메인을 장식하기도 했다. 김치볶음밥 먹는 사진이 찍힌 기사가 올라온 것이다. 네티즌들은 기자의 사생활 침해를 비판해도, 정우담의 이미지는 좋아져만 갔다. -와 저 독한 파파라치 기자가 털어도 아무것도 안 나오네 -아 진짜 정우담 냅둬! -근데 이건 좀 호감이네ㅋㅋ └ㄹㅇㅋㅋ 급 친근해짐 -씨담! 우발이 형! 좋은 것 좀 먹어ㅠ 또한, 가요제를 준비하는 예능 제작진과 미팅하는 날이기도 했다. “반가워요 우담 씨. 기사 반응 엄청 뜨겁던데요?”","output":"<The Man Who Eats Kimchi Fried Rice Well (Paid Start)> Jeong Woo-dam was preoccupied with looking into his wooden bag even after changing into his outdoor clothes. \\"It's been a really long time since No. 5.\\" This was because the number of trees he could manage had increased as his satisfaction grew from upgrading luxury farming tools and the cabin. And the existing teddy bears were welcoming a new friend. Cowboy No. 6 walked solemnly in front of them. He went all the way to the nose and then turned around with a spin. He took a step back, step by step, walking away. Making sound effects. -Woof woof woof~ Click. He walked three steps, stopped, then turned around again, and at the same time, he quickly put his hand in his pocket and pulled it out, aiming at the teddy bears. \\"Gun!\\" He folded his hand into the shape of a gun. \\"Surprise.\\" No. 6, the one with the most dramatic entrance scene, flicked his hand shaped like a gun. -Bang. -Oh. The good teddy bears. They smiled and clapped. \\"What's that?\\" Then the teddy bears proudly introduced him to the cabin they would now live in. Jeong Woo-dam observed the interior by moving from window to window as they moved inside. Soon, the window of the attic on the second floor opened. Little No. 4 jumped down into the pile of snow he had stacked up. -Ta-da! He gestured for the others to jump down after him, but the other bears disappeared from the second-floor window where they had peeked out and walked out of the front door on the first floor. \\"If the older ones follow you, they'll break their bones.\\" The teddy bears gathered in the garden again, soon starting a snowball fight in teams of three. He had to give them a reward for bringing back the Gayageum (F) seeds, but he couldn't interrupt because they were having too much fun. It was about time to go out. \\"I'll give you the reward when I get back. Take good care of the house. Don't throw stones.\\" Woo-dam put on his glasses first and chose what shoes to wear from the entrance, which used to have only old sneakers. There were new sneakers and work boots. He didn't even buy them with his own money. Usually, clothes and shoes brought by stylists have to be returned after the stage, but sometimes they are given as sponsorship like this. \\"Seo Ji-an gets everything from the luxury brand where she's an ambassador every season.\\" If you become a star, you won't need to shop. But seeing Seo Ji-an often spotted with her family at department stores, it seems that might not be the case. In the end, Jeong Woo-dam wore his old sneakers. \\"I might have to run, so I need comfortable feet.\\" A statement that doesn't seem like he's just going to visit the pet naming agency. But when he left the apartment complex where the dormitory was and arrived in front of Oksu Station, a man blocked his way. \\"Reporter?\\" He was definitely someone in the entertainment industry, but not a reporter. \\"Excuse me, would you like to try acting? You have a good look. The height and build are just right. Oh, let me introduce myself first, I'm a casting director from an actor's agency.\\" \\"I'm already signed with an agency and active as a singer.\\" \\"Is that so? That's a shame.\\" The man really seemed regretful as he let Woo-dam go. \\"Are they still doing street casting at this hour?\\" Of course, it was his professional spirit that was triggered by seeing Jeong Woo-dam on his way home from work. Woo-dam tilted his head and entered a cafe on the first floor with glass walls. It's a naming agency that doubles as a pet cafe. Ding-dong. \\"Excuse me, I have a reservation for naming.\\" \\"Yes. I'll bring your drink. Feel free to play with the dogs in the meantime.\\" As he petted the dogs, the manager, who looked like a Taoist priest, brought juice and asked how many and what kind of dogs he had, and their characteristics. \\"It's not mine, but a mixed breed at my grandmother's house. There are six of them, and they look like bears.\\" He couldn't say he was raising polar bears. Moreover, since Woo-dam is a singer, he couldn't post online that he was raising six dogs, so he made an excuse about the countryside. In reality, his grandmother's house is in the countryside, and there are many dogs. The manager quickly wrote down candidates while searching the Chinese dictionary and the internet. \\"With six dogs, you can't give them confusing names, right? So I'm thinking of suggesting names related to their order.\\" He suggests adding cute names to Korean or alphabet letters. \\"For example, Lu is cute, right? Garu, Naru, Daru, Maru. Laru. Baru.\\" It seems like if the number of teddy bears increases, he'll have to recite the Korean alphabet in his head. The manager also got the order of Ra, Ma wrong. \\"Is this place famous for naming?\\" The second candidate is. \\"Or you can combine it with the guardian's name. What's your name?\\" \\"Jeong Woo-dam.\\" \\"That's the same name as the celebrity our part-timer was talking about. How about Adam, Bdam, Cdam?\\" It sounds like a tree grade, so that's not great either... Reading the displeasure on Jeong Woo-dam's face, the manager became desperate. \\"Ah! You said they look like bears, right? Let's see, let's see~.\\" Is that a joke? Not knowing how to react, the manager confidently said to Woo-dam. \\"It's also good to attach numbers directly like Il-woong, I-woong, Sam-woong.\\" Il-woong?! Meanwhile, there was a car watching the glass-walled cafe, and another car keeping a close eye on that car was not far away. *** A reporter from an online entertainment media notorious for rivaling Hollywood paparazzi was secretly watching Jeong Woo-dam from inside the car. A hot newcomer at the center of attention. He followed him, hoping to catch something noteworthy. Earlier, near the station, a man had stopped Woo-dam. The reporter recognized him. \\"...A famous casting director in the acting industry.\\" He has a knack for discovering actors based on their looks, and it's amazing how they all make it big. He's said to have bought a large apartment without debt because of his good casting. But doesn't he watch entertainment news? Or did he not recognize Jeong Woo-dam because he was dressed casually and wearing glasses? And the place where Woo-dam, who parted with the regretful casting director, entered. \\"A pet cafe? Well, if he's done with his schedule, he could have played a bit.\\" It's not about playing with dogs, but about drinking and joining a table with someone he meets at a bar if there's a chance. Jeong Woo-dam was very wholesome. It's doubtful if this will produce any gossip. \\"He's coming out.\\" The reporter crouched down to avoid being seen. 1 second, 2 seconds, 3 seconds. He cautiously raised his upper body to check, and Jeong Woo-dam entered another place. It was a snack bar. \\"The menu is kimchi fried rice.\\" Since he sold songs before his debut, he must have earned a decent amount, but why that choice? Moreover, he seemed accustomed to eating alone. He gobbled up the rice like a hungry person. He also laughed from time to time while watching TV. \\"Why is he eating so fast?\\" After quickly finishing the kimchi fried rice and still feeling unsatisfied, he ordered additional ramen. The reporter also got hungry watching him eat so deliciously. Afterward, Jeong Woo-dam quickly inhaled the ramen as well and walked around the neighborhood park to digest before entering the dormitory. \\"...Is he really a celebrity?\\" If someone who didn't know Jeong Woo-dam was a singer saw him, they would just think he was unemployed. That's when it happened. Knock knock. It sounded like a heart dropping. \\"Damn!\\" It was the guard team from MNS Entertainment. The reporter sighed and rolled down the window. \\"Following to the dormitory, invading privacy, and even following back to the dormitory. This is a crime.\\" If Jeong Woo-dam's dormitory became known, all entertainment reporters would gather here, so they were threatening to keep the location secret. They could move, but it would never end. \\"Please let it go. Honestly, I don't even know which apartment it is in the large complex. Even if reporters swarm, they'll have to turn back due to complaints from residents, right?\\" \\"You can write about the pictures taken around the station, but erase the apartment pictures and forget them from your memory. That's the condition if you don't want us to call the police. You know the punishment for stalking has been strengthened, right?\\" \\"Since when has following a celebrity become stalking for an entertainment reporter!\\" \\"Politicians often sue political reporters for stalking, why can't celebrities?\\" The reporter knew about an online media outlet that went bankrupt after messing with Seo Ji-an. MNS Entertainment was ruthless. He should not have been caught, especially since they had planted a guard. \\"...So, you're saying the pictures around the station are okay?\\" He deleted the rest of the data. It seemed like they wouldn't let him go otherwise. After the reporter left, the guard team leader called the manager. \\"Manager, I've chased away the worst ones, so please tell Woo-dam to relax.\\" *** Jeong Woo-dam was on the phone with the manager. -The reporter was fooled. From now on, you can move around comfortably. \\"I was told that reporters might follow me, but in reality, I just did what I usually do.\\" The manager laughed and told him to rest before hanging up. \\"Anyway, it's good that it's over.\\" MNS Entertainment had sorted out everything related to this incident. So Woo-dam just had to do his job. First, it was the teddy bears' names. \\"Garu sounds like powder, and Adam sounds like a foreign kid.\\" -Woong. The teddy bears, who had finished their snowball fight, No. 3 had already gone out again. \\"Rather than calling them by number, maybe Woong is better?\\" Wasn't there a saying, simple is best? Because Woo-dam used to call them No. 1 to No. 6, he felt a strong attraction to the names No. 1 to No. 6 Woong compared to other names. And he put 1.11 million won, the reward he promised to give after returning, into the wooden bag. -Would you like to supply nutrients to the Gayageum (F) tree? \\"Yes. Up to B.\\" He had decided to aim for at least a B grade for the instruments. Especially the gayageum, a wonderful traditional Korean instrument that turns all genres into fusion. -The Gayageum (B) tree has grown. At the same time, he came up with the title for the third installment of Kawai Bass. \\"Yageumyageum.\\" He also searched how much it would cost to buy a real gayageum. It seems like you have to use one made by a master craftsman. \\"Less than a million won is out of the question.\\" He only looked up the price online, but he planned to visit a store to buy it, so it might cost more. \\"I need to sell 'Hamohamo' quickly, right?\\" Not transferring copyright, but licensing. The view count for <Hamohamo> on the Mrsquid channel exceeded 3 million. The increase rate is even faster than <Ricoricori>. Thanks to this, Venix is eyeing it again, and a Japanese rhythm game producer has also inquired. They want to pay three years' worth of usage fees at once. It's not so much a dilemma about who to sell to, but rather that Venix has been dragging its feet without moving forward with the contract. It seems they might be considering it for a new character theme song. \\"Neon Mina hasn't been out for long, so won't it take a while for the next new character?\\" He should tell the Venix sound team leader to make a decision quickly. If they're not going to use it right away, they can make it later. 'If I get the money for Hamohamo and the severance pay...' Since he agreed to participate in the weekend variety show's music festival, he would upgrade Rhythm & Soul or Sampling to A grade, and he should be able to comfortably purchase the gayageum. There might be rentals available, but someday he wants to create a song using all the instruments corresponding to the trees he planted. If possible, owning is better than borrowing. Having decided that, Woo-dam felt a slight tension as he tried a new item for the first time. Artificial tears that turn Producing (A) into S grade for 30 minutes. The volume is small. If he accidentally closes his eyes while putting them in, he'll waste a rare item. \\"Careful, careful.\\" Woo-dam opened his eyes wide with one hand and dropped the artificial tears. The effect was immediate. His eyes became moist. He couldn't waste even a second of the short duration, so he used it after sitting in the studio, but he suddenly felt dizzy and almost fell over with the chair. \\"What, what's this?\\" His body was still, but it felt like the world was moving. Whoosh, whoosh. Whirr, whirr, whirr, whirr, whirr, whirr, whirr, whoosh! It felt like he was playing a high-realism VR game, and he almost screamed. It was distinctly different from when a new tree was planted or when its grade was raised. Until now, his mind became clear, and he could concentrate on the necessary sounds and concepts, but this time it became noisy. Fortunately, after his heart rate sped up and then calmed down, his world became peaceful again. Soon, Jeong Woo-dam straightened his posture, composed a beat based on the Jersey club, and although he would replace the track with a recording of a real gayageum once he acquired it, for now, he completed <Yageumyageum> using a virtual instrument plugin. But that wasn't the end. He also solidified the MR for the tropical house and girl's hip-hop he promised to Day.G and finished the guide recording. '...Is this S grade?' For 30 minutes, he tasted evolution. If B grade is skilled, A grade is an expert. A pro. And S grade is the top 1% among the rare pros. Suddenly, he remembered what his friend Choi Jun-seob once said. \\"Woo-dam, have you heard of Sturgeon's law?\\" The story that 90% of all creation is discarded for the sake of the great 10%. Afterward, Jeong Woo-dam had only one thought in his mind. 'I need to make 100 million.' The next day. Even at the music broadcast where newcomers must use the chicken coop waiting room if they enter the top 40, and also at the terrestrial music broadcast the following day, he was filled with that thought. That day, Woo-dam once again made headlines in entertainment news. An article with a photo of him eating kimchi fried rice was posted. Netizens criticized the reporter for invading privacy, but Jeong Woo-dam's image only improved. -Wow, even that ruthless paparazzi reporter couldn't find anything -Ah, really leave Jeong Woo-dam alone! -But this is kind of likableㅋㅋ └For realㅋㅋ Suddenly feels more approachable -Cdam! Brother Woobal! Eat something goodㅠ Also, it was the day he met with the production team of the variety show preparing for the music festival. \\"Nice to meet you, Woo-dam.

PD 또한 우담의 곡들을 플레이리스트에 넣고 쉬는 시간마다 듣고 있다. ‘어쩌면 리스너들은 이런 싱어송라이터를 기다려왔던 걸지도.’ 참신함. 기존의 음원 차트에선 볼 수 없던 유형. 래퍼들도 싱어송라이터라 할 수 있지만, 결국엔 랩이다. 반면 정우담은 앨범에 실린 세 곡이 모두 장르가 다르다. ‘듀엣 R&B에 싱잉랩, EDM.’ 앨범 구성을 보면 국내보단 영미권 아티스트에 가깝다. 순전히 다른 장르를 해야겠다는 치기 어린 포부도 아니다. 하나하나 장르에 대한 이해도가 높다. PD는 이러다 일내는 건 아닐지, 정우담의 향후 서사가 기대되기도 했다. ‘빌보드 들어가는 거 아니야?’ 가요제 게스트 섭외를 화제성만으로 정할 순 없으니, 이것저것 그에 대해 서치를 해봤다. 유튜브에는 뮤직비디오 3종의 리액션 비디오도 적지 않은데, 리액션 특성상 대부분이 외국인들이다. 시리즈로 이어지는 세 편의 뮤직비디오를 본 그들은 음악방송 클립 영상까지 찾아보게 됐다. ‘타이틀은 www.이고, 국내는 그게 맞아.’ 하지만 해외 리액션 유튜버들에겐 수록곡들이 더 매력적인 모양이다. 어느 여행 유튜버는 유럽의 클럽에 갔다가 정우담의 컨트리 EDM이 들려 국뽕에 취했다. 게다가 숏폼에선 일본인 싱어송라이터를 시작으로, 기타 속주의 <Go>가 차츰차츰 커버되고 있다. 정우담의 청음회에 초대돼 다녀왔고, 귀여워서 미안해 챌린지를 같이한 미나미였다. ‘돈 받은 게 아닐지 의심될 만큼.’ 일본 싱어송라이터들의 성공 여부는 애니메이션 OST로 알 수 있다. 미나미는 작년에 데뷔한 이래 벌써 굵직한 애니메이션 오프닝을 3개나 불렀다. 그중 하나는 한국의 음원 차트에도 올랐다. 그런 라이징이 정우담을 향한 열렬한 팬심을 보인다는 것이다. 숏폼의 <Go> 커버는 1분짜리지만, 그녀의 유튜브 채널엔 3분 풀 영상을 올리기도 했다. 일본어로 개사한 정성까지 보여서일까? 조회수가 100만을 넘었다. 커버가 그렇게 나오기란 결코 쉽지 않다. 그 이후, 일본에서도 종우다무가 대체 누구냔 호기심을 보이고 있다. ‘일본 진출은 무리도 아니겠고.’ 음반 시장의 30%가 케이팝인 일본 시장. 역사적으론 좋아하려야 좋아할 수 없는 나라이나, 문화 수출을 위해선 배제하기도 힘든 곳이다. 돈이 엄청나게 벌린다. 즉, 돈 쓸어담을 일만 남은 정우담이다. 예술을 자꾸 돈으로 환산하는 게 속물 같아 보여도, 연예인에겐 곧 매출이 미덕이라 어쩔 수 없다. ‘신주놀’ 역시 OTT와 제휴를 맺어 자막이 달린 채 일본에 송출되고, 팬미팅을 가는 아시아 국가 중 일본을 빼놓지도 않는다. 가요제마다 항상 뉴페이스를 발굴하는 제작진으로선, 지난 뉴페이스들 통틀어 정우담의 임팩트가 가장 강하리라 예견했다. 그러니 신인 대하는 편안함보단 이 섭외 미팅이 틀어지지 않도록 조심스럽다. PD가 물었다. “예능은 처음이시죠?” “예능인 유튜브 채널엔 한 번 나갔었어요. 캠핑 방송이었는데, 바비큐만 하다가 곡 소개는 못 했습니다.” “봤어요. 분량이 거의 캠핑장 직원분처럼 나오셨더라고요.” “네. 그리고 일요일에 음방 막방 하면 바로 자체 컨텐츠 촬영도 들어갑니다. 캐나다의 인디 뮤직 채널 직원이 와요. 작업실 인터뷰하고, 한식도 먹기로 했어요.” 좋은 정보였다. “외국인이요?” 그야 캐나다 사람이니까. 정우담은 고개를 끄덕였다. “Mrsquid라고, 한국에도 아시는 분들 계실 수 있어요.” 곧장 검색해봤다. ‘헉.’ 구독자가 천만이 넘는다. PD의 생기 없던 얼굴에 눈만 유독 빛났다. “방송이란 게, 대본은 있어도 최대한 자연스러움을 추구해야 하거든요. 작업실 인터뷰하실 때 저희 고정 출연자들이 잠깐 MNS 엔터를 들러도 되겠습니까?” 작곡이 가능한 가요제 게스트를 찾아다니는 식으로 연출하다가, MNS 엔터에 연락해보고 들이닥친다. 그 자리에 인기 채널의 외국인들까지 있다. 예능적으로 그림도 좋다. “저야 작업실을 숙소 말고 MNS 엔터로 소개하면 되는 거라 상관은 없지만, 그 친구들한테 괜찮냐고 먼저 물어봐야 할 것 같습니다.” “지금 물어보셔도 돼요.” 대체 누가 거절하겠는가? 한국 미디어에도 소개될 수 있는 기회를. 정우담은 실례하겠다면서 메일을 전송했고, 답도 바로 왔다. 힐끔 보니 번역기 돌린 듯한 한국어다. -한국 예능에 나올 수 있다고요? 최고야! 저쪽에서도 두근거리는 마음으로 한국행 비행기에 몸을 싣겠다. 동의를 구한 정우담이 대답했다. “좋다고 하네요.” “잘됐네요. 그럼 가요제 출연은?” 그러자 정우담이 실장 매니저와 조용히 몇 마디 이야기를 나눴다. 미팅에 온 것만으로도 어느 정도 출연 의사를 가진 것이다. 하지만 제작진을 만나보고, 그제야 예능을 한다는 것에 실감이 나 돌연 캔슬을 하는 연예인들도 간혹 있다. 다행히 기우에 그쳤다. “영광입니다. 저희 부모님도 챙겨보시는 방송이거든요.” 휴. 속으로 안도의 한숨을 내쉰 PD는 부쩍 친해진 것처럼 질문했다. “혹시 개인기 있으신가요?” “성대모사랑 저글링을 좀 할 줄 압니다.” “오오! 보여주시죠!” 저글링 공 3개를 던지고 받는다. 능숙하진 않다. 편집될 확률이 높은 개인기. 그래도 이걸 살리는 게 PD의 일이겠지. 더욱이 성대모사는. “이바!” “···그게 뭐예요?” “월-E에 나오는 로봇이요.” 우담이 좋아하는 만화영화지만, PD는 안 봤다. 그나마 본 적 있던 작가가 정색한다. “하나도 안 닮았어요. 우담 씨는 목소리가 지문 수준이라.” PD는 그 작가의 팔뚝에 엘보우를 날렸다. 행여 정우담이 기분 상해서 출연 안 한다고 할까 봐. 그러나 예민한 기분파의 연예인은 아니었다. “연습해오겠습니다.” “안 닮으면 안 닮은 대로 분량이 뽑히니까 마음에 두지 마세요.” “실은 명작 영화 패러디하는 유튜브 나가서 할 생각이었습니다.” “아.” 그러려면 연습을 매우 많이 해야겠다. 그렇게 섭외 미팅을 마치고 나와서, 정우담은 실장과 대화했다. “갑자기 출연하지 말라고 하진 않겠죠?” “분위기 좋았잖아요? 그럴 리 없어요.” “제가 신주놀에 나가다니. 믿기지 않네요.” 정말이었다. 교대 근무 휴무가 주말일 때나 본가에 가서 부모님과 보던 방송. 진행자들이 재밌어서 몇 번이나 숨쉬기 힘들 만큼 웃어댔었다. ‘방송 보고 놀라시게, 말 안 해야지.’ 개구쟁이처럼 키득이는 우담을 보며, 실장은 좋아서 저러나 보다 하고 같이 웃었다. 이후 음악방송도 끝내고, 오늘은 꼭 MNS 엔터에 와줬으면 한다는 얘길 들어 숙소로 직행하진 못했다. 거기서 만난 사람은, 신채윤이었다. 평소라면 다림질 잘 된 캐쥬얼한 복장 차림일 텐데, 지금은 위아래로 운동복을 입었다. “아, 안녕하세요.” 놀랍진 않았다. 오디션 프로그램의 첫 녹화가 시작되기도 전에 하차해버린 그녀. 올해 말에서 내년 초 MNS 엔터가 데뷔시키려는 보컬 그룹의 첫 멤버로 캐스팅되었다. 정우담이 프로듀싱을 하기로 한 그룹이다. “저 기다린 거예요?” “계약서 작성하고, 이만 들어가 봐도 된다고 하셨는데 트레이닝 받고 싶어서 옷 가지고 다시 왔어요.” 심지어 신채윤은 각오도 대단했다. “저, 프리랜서라고 했었잖아요.” “네.” 어떤 프리랜서인지는 묻지 않았었다. 음악 이외의 직업이면 정우담이 들어도 공감해주기 쉽지 않으니 말이다. “웹툰 그림 작가였는데, 관뒀어요. 오디션 프로 미팅에 다녀왔을 때만 해도 두 마리 토끼를 잡고 싶었지만, MNS 엔터에서 반드시 데뷔시켜주겠다고 하셔서 올인하려고요.” 정우담은 원래도 보통 각오로 프로듀싱해주진 않으려 했으나, 더더욱 솔로가 아닌 그룹이 되는 것에 후회 안 하게 해주고 싶었다. “30분 뒤에 채윤 씨랑 데뷔조가 될 연습생들 보러 갈 거예요.” 그래서 음악방송을 마치고 바로 넘어왔다. 이리도 빨리 데뷔조가 만들어질 줄 몰랐던 신채윤은 눈을 크게 떴다. “벌써요?” “전무님한테 듀엣 아니면 트리오가 될 거라고 들었죠?” 프로듀서이니 멤버 결성에 권한이 있었다. 하지만 30분 뒤다. 연습생들이 자율 연습을 멈추고 그때 다 모인다. 학생인 연습생들은 서둘러 MNS 엔터에 달려오고 있다. 그전에, 정우담은 신채윤에게 사옥을 구석구석 안내해주었다. “앞으로 채윤 씨가 이용할 곳이니까 소개해줄게요.” “감사합니다.” 물론, 정우담도 녹음과 미팅 외엔 오질 않는 곳이라 곧 길을 잃었다. “저기가 여자 화장실이에요.” “그건 보면 아는데, 오빠. 아니 프로듀서님? 여기 구조 아시는 거 맞죠?” * 정우담은 숙소로 돌아왔다. ‘이제 음방도 두 번이면 끝이네.’ 일주일, 월요일엔 음악방송이 없어서 총 6일만 나가기로 했다. 오랜 대기 끝에 롤러코스터를 타고 허탈하게 나오는 기분이었다. ‘시간이 참 빨리도 간다.’ 음악방송을 더 나가고 싶단 건 아니다. 음악방송 버프도 아이돌에게나 해당한다. 애초에 한국 음악방송은 아이돌 팬들이 보는 방송이 됐다. MNS 엔터 대표의 말대로 솔로는 일주일이면 충분했고, 곡을 직접 쓰는 싱어송라이터라면 그 이상 돌아봐야 작업할 시간만 빼앗기게 된다. 단지, 앨범을 만드는 기간에 비하면 솔로는 허무할 만큼 홍보할 장소가 많지 않단 걸 느꼈다. MNS 엔터를 등에 업은 정우담도 이런데, 다른 기획사 아티스트들은 더하면 더할 것이다. 그래도 보람을 느끼는 일이 서서히 많아진다. 두 번째 앨범은 쉴 만큼 쉬고 준비하는 대신, 무대를 좀 더 넓혀보자고 전무한테 들었다. 쉴 만큼 쉬어야 하는 이유. 어찌 될지 모르기 때문이다. 정주행 중이긴 한데 활동이 끝나면 역주행까지 노릴 수 있는 성적이라고 말이다. ‘Day.G 3부작은 완성됐고, 하모하모도 이야기 끝났고.’ 결국 Venix가 양보했다. 예상대로 신 캐릭터 테마송으로 쓰고 싶었는데, 아직 계획이 없으니 계속 킵해두기보단 팔 곳 있으면 팔고 다음에 새 OST를 부탁하겠다고 말했다. 그걸 일본 게임사에 알리자, 일본에 와달라고 할 줄 알았더니 직접 오겠다고 한다. 가장 가까운 비행기 티켓을 예약하기로 했다. ‘3년 치 사용료로 2천을 주겠다니.’ Venix는 1년 라이센스 비용을 400만 원부터 시작해 600만 원으로 종결지었는데, 이번엔 협상할 필요도 없었다. 선 제시였다. 아마 내년부턴 수입도 기하급수적으로 늘게 될지 모른다. 프로듀서도 맡게 됐게 됐으니까. MNS 엔터의 프로듀싱 본부장과 마찰이 생길 리도 없다. 이미 그분은 서지안의 메인 프로듀서이며, 보자마자 지건을 발사한 리우, 곧 데뷔할 보이그룹까지 혼자 담당해 오히려 정우담에게 구조의 눈길을 보내기도 했다. 그렇게 해서 오늘, 여자 연습생들을 한 자리에 모아놓고 노래를 들었다. ‘다빈 씨한텐 미안한 짓을 했네.’ 보컬 그룹을 만들 거란 계획에 아이돌을 지망하던 연습생들과 솔로 지망생까지 다 몰렸었다. 레슨 제자 김다빈도 있었다. MNS 엔터는 듀엣을 할지, 트리오가 될지 정우담에게 정해달라고 부탁했지만, 그중에서 한 명을 뽑고 차후 한 명 더 발탁하기로 말을 끝맺으며 자리를 파했다. 표정이 어두운 정우담은 배달 치킨이 도착하길 기다리면서 나무 가방을 들여다봤다. 소리가 들려와 볼 수밖에 없었다. -Dara Dara Da~ Still Dre가 들려온 것이다. 곧, 곰돌이들 정원으로 미국 래퍼들이 모는 차처럼 통통 튀는 손수레가 호랑이들에 의해 끌려온다. “왜 안 오나 했다.” 계절마다 찾아오는 방문 상단이었다. *** 김다빈은 울면서 집에 돌아왔다. “흐어어엉, 엄마···.” 그녀는 솔로 지망생이었다. 유튜브로 팬부터 만들고 데뷔하자는 회사의 얘기에 브이로거로도 활동 중이었다. 그런데 갑자기 MNS 엔터에서 여성 보컬 그룹을 만들겠다며, 지원할 사람들은 오늘 다 모이라고 했다. 한 명은 이미 데뷔조로 확정된 상태였다. 굉장히 면목 없어 하며 김다빈의 레슨 쌤 옆에 서 있던 신채윤. 타이틀 피처링을 해준 걸 연습생들이 다 알기에 가요계 선배 보듯 깍듯했었다. 더구나 정우담은 이제 외부인 수준도 아니었다. MNS 엔터가 서지안만큼이나 아끼는 파트너였기에, 왜 신채윤을 중심으로 보컬 그룹이 만들어지는지 의문을 갖는 연습생도 없었다. 김다빈 또한 마찬가지였다. 반대로 그녀는 일반 MNS 연습생이었으니, 귀를 막아도 들려오는 말이 많았다. ‘다빈 언니 레슨 쌤이 프로듀서라며? 다빈 언니는 무조건 뽑히지 않을까?’ ‘다빈이 근데 배짱이 부족해서.’ ‘어차피 주말만 레슨받는 건데 굳이?’ 민감할 수밖에 없었다. 데뷔 기회가 빈번히 찾아오는 게 아니니. 김다빈은 바닥만 보면서, 그래도 쌤이 자신의 이름을 불러줬으면 좋겠다고 빌었다. 그때, 정우담은 이렇게 말했다. ‘지금부터 뽑을 한 분 외에 또 한 자리 남았으니까. 개성을, 가져주셨으면 좋겠습니다. 사실 제가 뭐라고 프로듀서 권한으로 여러분들을 평가해도 되나 싶지만.’ 정우담은 겸손했다. 무슨 말인지도 안다. MNS 여자 연습생들의 보컬 교재는 서지안이며, 전부 클론들이라 해도 과언이 아닐 만큼 창법을 빼다 박았다. 모두가 숨을 죽이고 호명을 기다렸었다. 마침 주방에 있던 모친은 울면서 돌아온 딸을 보고 덩달아 눈시울이 붉어졌다. “딸! 왜 울어?!” “흐어엉. 엄마~ 쌤이, 쌤이···.” “레슨 선생님? 아빠 회사 직원이셨다는 그분이 왜?” 김다빈은 대답은 못 하고 엉엉 울다가, 간신히 또박또박 말했다. “쌔, 쌤이 나도 데뷔조 들어와도 된대.” 정우담은 그녀가 솔로를 준비하는 걸 알아 미안했지만, 그룹에 더 필요하다고 판단했다. 김다빈은 호명돼서 기절할 만큼 기뻤지만 말이다.","output":"<Roller Coaster> The flagship weekend variety show on terrestrial TV, \\"God Plays Dice,\\" abbreviated as ShinJuNol. The title itself was also the format. Like a board game, all decisions were made by rolling dice. However, as with many variety shows, the planned format was only followed in the beginning. If it became repetitive, ratings would drop, so now the dice only appeared once every few months. So they started going on trips, promoting daily guests who came for publicity, and holding singing contests quarterly. Thanks to that, the production team, who were in ratings hell every week, looked absolutely haggard. Watching them, Jeong Woo-dam even thought he could win against them all by himself. The PD especially looked like he could collapse with a single touch. \\"Nice to meet you, Woo-dam. The man chosen for the stir-fried kimchi rice.\\" It was said so naturally that he almost didn't notice anything odd. \\"Stir-fried kimchi rice?\\" \\"Ah, my mind. You might not know, but actually, we said that if Woo-dam's music enters the top 20 within two weeks, we should have a meeting.\\" \\"I heard from the CEO.\\" \\"Since you've become such a hot topic, we thought we should cast you right away without that condition. But haha, maybe next week you'll enter the top 20?\\" Jeong Woo-dam's debut title was in the early 40s, and the included tracks were fiercely competing in the 50s, constantly changing ranks. It was a natural result, given that all the topics of conversation had gathered and the quality of the songs was good. The PD also added Woo-dam's songs to his playlist and listened to them during breaks. 'Maybe listeners have been waiting for a singer-songwriter like this.' Freshness. A type not seen in the existing music charts. Rappers could also be called singer-songwriters, but in the end, it's rap. On the other hand, all three songs on Jeong Woo-dam's album are of different genres. \\"Duet R&B, singing rap, EDM.\\" Looking at the album composition, it's closer to artists from the English-speaking world rather than domestic ones. It's not just a childish ambition to do different genres. There's a high level of understanding for each genre. The PD wondered if this might lead to something big and was also excited about Jeong Woo-dam's future narrative. 'Could it make it onto Billboard?' For the singing contest guest casting, they couldn't decide based solely on topicality, so they did some research on him. There were quite a few reaction videos to the three types of music videos on YouTube, and most of the reactors were foreigners due to the nature of reaction videos. After watching the series of three music videos, they even looked up clips from music broadcasts. 'The title is www., and that's right for domestic.' But it seems the included tracks are more attractive to foreign reaction YouTubers. A travel YouTuber went to a club in Europe and heard Jeong Woo-dam's country EDM, getting drunk on national pride. Moreover, on short-form content, starting with a Japanese singer-songwriter, the guitar riff of <Go> is gradually being covered. It was Minami who had been invited to Jeong Woo-dam's listening party and had done the \\"Sorry for Being Cute\\" challenge with him. 'It's so good, you'd suspect they were paid.' The success of Japanese singer-songwriters can be seen in anime OSTs. Minami has sung three significant anime openings since her debut last year, one of which even made it onto the Korean music charts. Such a rising star showing passionate fandom towards Jeong Woo-dam. The short-form <Go> cover was only a minute long, but she also uploaded a full 3-minute video on her YouTube channel. Was it because she showed dedication by adapting it into Japanese? The views exceeded one million. It's not easy for a cover to turn out like that. After that, even Japan showed curiosity about who Jeong Woo-dam was. 'Entering the Japanese market wouldn't be too much.' The Japanese music market, where 30% is K-pop. Historically, it's a country that's hard to like, but it's difficult to exclude for cultural exports. There's a lot of money to be made. In other words, Jeong Woo-dam only has to rake in the money now. Even if it seems materialistic to keep converting art into money, for entertainers, sales are a virtue, so it can't be helped. 'ShinJuNol' also partnered with OTT to broadcast with subtitles in Japan, and they don't leave out Japan when going to fan meetings in Asian countries. As a production team that always discovers new faces at every singing contest, they predicted that Jeong Woo-dam would have the strongest impact among all the new faces they've seen. So rather than the comfort of dealing with a newcomer, they were cautious to ensure this casting meeting didn't go awry. The PD asked. \\"Is this your first time on a variety show?\\" \\"I've been on an entertainer's YouTube channel once. It was a camping broadcast, but I only did BBQ and didn't get to introduce my songs.\\" \\"I saw it. You almost appeared like a camping site staff member.\\" \\"Yes. And right after the music show ends on Sunday, we go straight into filming our own content. A staff member from a Canadian indie music channel is coming. We're going to interview in my studio and eat Korean food.\\" That was good information. \\"A foreigner?\\" Well, they're from Canada. Jeong Woo-dam nodded. \\"Mrsquid, you might know them, even in Korea.\\" They immediately searched. 'Wow.' The subscriber count was over ten million. Only the PD's eyes shone on his lifeless face. \\"In broadcasting, even if there's a script, we strive for naturalness. When you do the studio interview, could our regular cast members stop by MNS Entertainment for a bit?\\" They would direct it as if they were looking for a guest composer for the singing contest, then contact MNS Entertainment and barge in. There would also be popular channel foreigners there. It's a good picture for variety. \\"It's fine for me to introduce my studio as MNS Entertainment instead of my accommodation, but I think I should ask those friends first if it's okay.\\" \\"You can ask them now.\\" Who would refuse? An opportunity to be featured in Korean media. Jeong Woo-dam excused himself and sent an email, and the reply came right away. At a glance, it looked like Korean translated by a machine. -Can I be on a Korean variety show? That's awesome! They must be boarding the plane to Korea with a pounding heart. Jeong Woo-dam, having obtained consent, replied. \\"They say it's fine.\\" \\"That's great. Then, about appearing in the singing contest?\\" Then Jeong Woo-dam quietly exchanged a few words with his manager. Just coming to the meeting indicated a certain willingness to appear. However, there are occasionally entertainers who suddenly cancel after meeting the production team and realizing what it means to be on a variety show. Fortunately, it was just a needless worry. \\"It's an honor. My parents also watch the show.\\" Phew. The PD sighed with relief internally and asked as if they had become much closer. \\"Do you have any special talents?\\" \\"I can do impressions and juggle a bit.\\" \\"Wow! Show us!\\" He juggles three balls. He's not skilled. A special talent likely to be edited out. But it's the PD's job to make it work. Especially the impressions. \\"Eva!\\" \\"...What's that?\\" \\"It's a robot from Wall-E.\\" Woo-dam liked the animated movie, but the PD hadn't seen it. At least a writer who had seen it frowned. \\"It doesn't sound like it at all. Woo-dam, your voice is unique.\\" The PD elbowed the writer's arm, worried that Jeong Woo-dam might get offended and refuse to appear. But he wasn't a sensitive, moody entertainer. \\"I'll practice.\\" \\"Don't worry if it doesn't sound like it, it'll still make the cut.\\" \\"Actually, I was planning to do it for a YouTube channel that parodies classic movies.\\" \\"Ah.\\" He would need to practice a lot for that. After finishing the casting meeting, Jeong Woo-dam talked with his manager. \\"They won't suddenly tell me not to appear, right?\\" \\"The atmosphere was good, wasn't it? That won't happen.\\" \\"I can't believe I'm going to be on ShinJuNol.\\" It really was unbelievable. It was the show he used to watch with his parents when he had weekends off from shift work. The hosts were so funny that he laughed until he could hardly breathe. 'I won't tell them about the broadcast, so they'll be surprised.' Watching Woo-dam giggle like a mischievous child, the manager smiled, thinking he must be happy. After finishing the music broadcast, he couldn't go straight to his accommodation because he heard that they really wanted him to come to MNS Entertainment today. The person he met there was Shin Chae-yoon. Normally, she would be dressed in well-ironed casual clothes, but now she was wearing sportswear from top to bottom. \\"Ah, hello.\\" It wasn't surprising. She was the first member cast for the vocal group that MNS Entertainment planned to debut at the end of this year or early next year, having dropped out before the first recording of the audition program even started. It was the group that Jeong Woo-dam was set to produce. \\"Have you been waiting for me?\\" \\"I was told I could go in after signing the contract, but I wanted to train, so I came back with my clothes.\\" Moreover, Shin Chae-yoon was very determined. \\"I said I was a freelancer.\\" \\"Yes.\\" He hadn't asked what kind of freelancer. If it was a job other than music, it wouldn't be easy for Jeong Woo-dam to empathize even if he heard about it. \\"I was a webtoon artist, but I quit. Even when I went to the audition program meeting, I wanted to catch two rabbits at once, but MNS Entertainment promised to debut me for sure, so I'm going all in.\\" Jeong Woo-dam originally didn't intend to produce with just any resolve, but he wanted to make sure she wouldn't regret becoming part of a group instead of a solo. \\"In 30 minutes, I'll go see the trainees who will be in the debut group with Chae-yoon.\\" So he came straight after finishing the music broadcast. Shin Chae-yoon, who didn't expect the debut group to be formed so quickly, widened her eyes. \\"Already?\\" \\"Didn't the executive tell you it would be a duo or trio?\\" As a producer, he had the authority to form the members. But it was in 30 minutes. The trainees would stop their self-practice and gather then. The trainee students were hurrying to MNS Entertainment. Before that, Jeong Woo-dam showed Shin Chae-yoon around the company building. \\"I'll show you around since Chae-yoon will be using these places.\\" \\"Thank you.\\" Of course, Jeong Woo-dam didn't come here often except for recording and meetings, so he soon got lost. \\"That's the women's restroom.\\" \\"I know that if I see it, but, oppa. I mean, producer? Do you really know the layout here?\\" * Jeong Woo-dam returned to his accommodation. 'Now there are only two more music broadcasts left.' A week, with no music broadcasts on Monday, he had decided to go for a total of 6 days. It felt like riding a roller coaster and coming out deflated after a long wait. 'Time really flies.' It's not that he wanted to do more music broadcasts. The music broadcast buff applies to idols anyway. Originally, Korean music broadcasts became shows for idol fans. As the CEO of MNS Entertainment said, a week was enough for a solo, and if you're a singer-songwriter who writes your own songs, going beyond that just takes away time to work. It's just that compared to the time spent making an album, there aren't many places to promote as a solo, which felt somewhat empty. Even Jeong Woo-dam, backed by MNS Entertainment, felt this way, so other agency artists would feel it even more. Still, more and more rewarding things are happening. For the second album, instead of resting enough and preparing, he heard from the executive to expand the stage a bit more. The reason to rest enough. Because you never know what will happen. He's currently on a streak, but once the activities end, he might even aim for a reverse run with the results. 'The Day.G trilogy is complete, and the story of HamoHamo is finished.' Eventually, Venix gave in. As expected, they wanted to use it for a new character theme song, but since there were no plans yet, they decided it was better to sell it if there was a buyer and ask for a new OST later. When they informed the Japanese game company, they thought they would be asked to come to Japan, but instead, they said they would come directly. They decided to book the nearest flight ticket. 'They're offering 2,000 for a 3-year usage fee.' Venix started with a 1-year license fee of 4 million won and ended with 6 million won, but this time there was no need to negotiate. It was a preemptive offer. Maybe from next year, the income will increase exponentially. Because he's also become a producer. There's no chance of friction with the head of producing at MNS Entertainment. That person is already the main producer for Seo Ji-an, and they even showed concern for Jeong Woo-dam, having taken on the upcoming boy group alone and firing off issues at first sight. So today, he gathered the female trainees in one place and listened to their singing. 'I did something regrettable to Da-bin.' The plan was to create a vocal group, so trainees aspiring to be idols and solo trainees all gathered. Kim Da-bin, his lesson student, was also there. MNS Entertainment asked Jeong Woo-dam to decide whether to form a duo or trio, but he ended the conversation by choosing one person and saying they would select another later. Jeong Woo-dam, with a gloomy expression, waited for the delivery chicken while looking into the wooden box. The sound was unavoidable. -Dara Dara Da~ Still Dre was playing. Soon, a cart bouncing like cars driven by American rappers in the bear garden was pulled by tigers. \\"I wondered why they hadn't come.\\" It was the visiting merchant that came every season. *** Kim Da-bin came home crying. \\"Huuuung, Mom...\\" She was a solo aspirant. She was also active as a vlogger, following the company's advice to start with YouTube fans before debuting. But suddenly, MNS Entertainment announced they were creating a female vocal group and asked those interested to gather today. One was already confirmed for the debut group. Shin Chae-yoon, who was very embarrassed, stood next to Kim Da-bin's lesson teacher. Since all the trainees knew she featured on a title track, they treated her with respect as if she were a senior in the music industry. Moreover, Jeong Woo-dam was no longer just an outsider. As a partner that MNS Entertainment cherished as much as Seo Ji-an, there were no trainees who questioned why a vocal group was being formed around Shin Chae-yoon. Kim Da-bin felt the same. Conversely, she was a regular MNS trainee, so she heard a lot of talk even if she covered her ears. 'Da-bin unnie's lesson teacher is a producer, right? Won't Da-bin unnie definitely be selected?' 'But Da-bin lacks guts.' 'Anyway, she only takes lessons on weekends, so why bother?' She couldn't help but be sensitive. It's not often that a debut opportunity comes around. Kim Da-bin looked only at the floor, praying that her teacher would call her name. Then, Jeong Woo-dam said this. 'Aside from the one person I'm about to select, there's one more spot left. I hope you can bring your uniqueness. Honestly, I wonder if it's right for me to evaluate all of you with my producer authority.' Jeong Woo-dam was humble. He knew what it meant. The vocal textbook for MNS female trainees was Seo Ji-an, and they all sang so similarly that it wouldn't be an exaggeration to call them clones. Everyone held their breath and waited for the name to be called. At that moment, the mother in the kitchen saw her daughter return crying and her eyes reddened as well. \\"Daughter! Why are you crying?!\\" \\"Huuuung. Mom~ Teacher, the teacher...\\" \\"The lesson teacher? The one who was an employee at Dad's company, why?\\" Kim Da-bin couldn't answer and just cried, then finally spoke clearly. \\"Tea, teacher said I can join the debut group too.\\" Jeong Woo-dam felt sorry because he knew she was preparing to be a solo, but he thought she was more needed in the group. Kim Da-bin was ecstatic to be called, but that's what happened."},{"instruction":"generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Women Deep V Halter Lingerie Teddy One Piece Bodysuit Lace Babydoll include practical application on and uses can be applied include social media platform it can be used on and for what purpose include short story on why I personally bought it.","output":"**Title**: Captivating Women's Deep V Halter Lingerie Teddy: The Ultimate Lace Babydoll Bodysuit for Romantic Nights **Description**: Indulge in the epitome of seduction with our Women's Deep V Halter Lingerie Teddy, a mesmerizing one-piece bodysuit expertly crafted in luxurious lace.

Don't change space between paragraphs. 정우담 is Jeong Woo-dam","output":"정우담 is Jeong Woo-dam"},{"instruction":"< 롤러코스터 > 지상파의 간판 주말 예능 ‘신은 주사위 놀이를 한다’ 줄여서 신주놀. 제목 자체가 포맷이기도 했다. 보드게임처럼 모든 결정을 주사위를 굴려서 한다. 하지만 여느 예능들이 그렇듯, 기획된 포맷은 초반에나 지켜지는 법. 반복적이면 시청률이 떨어지고 말아 이젠 주사위도 몇 달에 한 번씩 등장하게 됐다. 그래서 여행을 가고, 홍보차 나오는 일일 게스트들을 띄워주고, 분기별로 가요제를 하는 식으로 변했다. 덕분에 매주 시청률 지옥인 제작진은 몰골이 말도 아니었다. 그들을 보며 정우담은 혼자 싸워도 다 이기겠다는 생각마저 들었다. 특히 PD는 툭 치면 쓰러질 것처럼 보이기도 했다. “반가워요, 우담 씨. 볶은 김치밥에 선택된 남자.” 너무 자연스럽게 말해 이상한 점을 못 느낄 뻔했다. “김치볶음밥이요?” “아, 내 정신 좀. 아실지 모르겠지만, 실은 저희가 우담 씨 음원이 2주 안에 20위를 뚫으면 미팅을 하자고 했었어요.” “대표님한테 들었습니다.” “워낙 뜨거운 감자가 되셔서, 그 조건 없애고 얼른 섭외해야겠다 생각했거든요. 그런데 허허, 잘하면 다음 주부턴 20위권 들어가겠는데요?” 정우담의 데뷔 타이틀이 40위 초반에, 그리고 수록곡들은 50위권에서 서로 치열하게 경쟁하며 순위가 뒤바뀌고 있다. 화제란 화제가 다 모였는데, 곡 퀄리티도 좋으니 당연하다면 당연한 결과였다. PD 또한 우담의 곡들을 플레이리스트에 넣고 쉬는 시간마다 듣고 있다. ‘어쩌면 리스너들은 이런 싱어송라이터를 기다려왔던 걸지도.’ 참신함. 기존의 음원 차트에선 볼 수 없던 유형. 래퍼들도 싱어송라이터라 할 수 있지만, 결국엔 랩이다. 반면 정우담은 앨범에 실린 세 곡이 모두 장르가 다르다. ‘듀엣 R&B에 싱잉랩, EDM.’ 앨범 구성을 보면 국내보단 영미권 아티스트에 가깝다. 순전히 다른 장르를 해야겠다는 치기 어린 포부도 아니다. 하나하나 장르에 대한 이해도가 높다. PD는 이러다 일내는 건 아닐지, 정우담의 향후 서사가 기대되기도 했다. ‘빌보드 들어가는 거 아니야?’ 가요제 게스트 섭외를 화제성만으로 정할 순 없으니, 이것저것 그에 대해 서치를 해봤다. 유튜브에는 뮤직비디오 3종의 리액션 비디오도 적지 않은데, 리액션 특성상 대부분이 외국인들이다. 시리즈로 이어지는 세 편의 뮤직비디오를 본 그들은 음악방송 클립 영상까지 찾아보게 됐다. ‘타이틀은 www.이고, 국내는 그게 맞아.’ 하지만 해외 리액션 유튜버들에겐 수록곡들이 더 매력적인 모양이다. 어느 여행 유튜버는 유럽의 클럽에 갔다가 정우담의 컨트리 EDM이 들려 국뽕에 취했다. 게다가 숏폼에선 일본인 싱어송라이터를 시작으로, 기타 속주의 <Go>가 차츰차츰 커버되고 있다. 정우담의 청음회에 초대돼 다녀왔고, 귀여워서 미안해 챌린지를 같이한 미나미였다. ‘돈 받은 게 아닐지 의심될 만큼.’ 일본 싱어송라이터들의 성공 여부는 애니메이션 OST로 알 수 있다. 미나미는 작년에 데뷔한 이래 벌써 굵직한 애니메이션 오프닝을 3개나 불렀다. 그중 하나는 한국의 음원 차트에도 올랐다. 그런 라이징이 정우담을 향한 열렬한 팬심을 보인다는 것이다. 숏폼의 <Go> 커버는 1분짜리지만, 그녀의 유튜브 채널엔 3분 풀 영상을 올리기도 했다. 일본어로 개사한 정성까지 보여서일까? 조회수가 100만을 넘었다. 커버가 그렇게 나오기란 결코 쉽지 않다. 그 이후, 일본에서도 종우다무가 대체 누구냔 호기심을 보이고 있다. ‘일본 진출은 무리도 아니겠고.’ 음반 시장의 30%가 케이팝인 일본 시장. 역사적으론 좋아하려야 좋아할 수 없는 나라이나, 문화 수출을 위해선 배제하기도 힘든 곳이다. 돈이 엄청나게 벌린다. 즉, 돈 쓸어담을 일만 남은 정우담이다. 예술을 자꾸 돈으로 환산하는 게 속물 같아 보여도, 연예인에겐 곧 매출이 미덕이라 어쩔 수 없다. ‘신주놀’ 역시 OTT와 제휴를 맺어 자막이 달린 채 일본에 송출되고, 팬미팅을 가는 아시아 국가 중 일본을 빼놓지도 않는다. 가요제마다 항상 뉴페이스를 발굴하는 제작진으로선, 지난 뉴페이스들 통틀어 정우담의 임팩트가 가장 강하리라 예견했다. 그러니 신인 대하는 편안함보단 이 섭외 미팅이 틀어지지 않도록 조심스럽다. PD가 물었다. “예능은 처음이시죠?” “예능인 유튜브 채널엔 한 번 나갔었어요. 캠핑 방송이었는데, 바비큐만 하다가 곡 소개는 못 했습니다.” “봤어요. 분량이 거의 캠핑장 직원분처럼 나오셨더라고요.” “네. 그리고 일요일에 음방 막방 하면 바로 자체 컨텐츠 촬영도 들어갑니다. 캐나다의 인디 뮤직 채널 직원이 와요. 작업실 인터뷰하고, 한식도 먹기로 했어요.” 좋은 정보였다. “외국인이요?” 그야 캐나다 사람이니까. 정우담은 고개를 끄덕였다. “Mrsquid라고, 한국에도 아시는 분들 계실 수 있어요.” 곧장 검색해봤다. ‘헉.’ 구독자가 천만이 넘는다. PD의 생기 없던 얼굴에 눈만 유독 빛났다. “방송이란 게, 대본은 있어도 최대한 자연스러움을 추구해야 하거든요. 작업실 인터뷰하실 때 저희 고정 출연자들이 잠깐 MNS 엔터를 들러도 되겠습니까?” 작곡이 가능한 가요제 게스트를 찾아다니는 식으로 연출하다가, MNS 엔터에 연락해보고 들이닥친다. 그 자리에 인기 채널의 외국인들까지 있다. 예능적으로 그림도 좋다. “저야 작업실을 숙소 말고 MNS 엔터로 소개하면 되는 거라 상관은 없지만, 그 친구들한테 괜찮냐고 먼저 물어봐야 할 것 같습니다.” “지금 물어보셔도 돼요.” 대체 누가 거절하겠는가? 한국 미디어에도 소개될 수 있는 기회를. 정우담은 실례하겠다면서 메일을 전송했고, 답도 바로 왔다. 힐끔 보니 번역기 돌린 듯한 한국어다. -한국 예능에 나올 수 있다고요? 최고야! 저쪽에서도 두근거리는 마음으로 한국행 비행기에 몸을 싣겠다. 동의를 구한 정우담이 대답했다. “좋다고 하네요.” “잘됐네요. 그럼 가요제 출연은?” 그러자 정우담이 실장 매니저와 조용히 몇 마디 이야기를 나눴다. 미팅에 온 것만으로도 어느 정도 출연 의사를 가진 것이다. 하지만 제작진을 만나보고, 그제야 예능을 한다는 것에 실감이 나 돌연 캔슬을 하는 연예인들도 간혹 있다. 다행히 기우에 그쳤다. “영광입니다. 저희 부모님도 챙겨보시는 방송이거든요.” 휴. 속으로 안도의 한숨을 내쉰 PD는 부쩍 친해진 것처럼 질문했다. “혹시 개인기 있으신가요?” “성대모사랑 저글링을 좀 할 줄 압니다.” “오오! 보여주시죠!” 저글링 공 3개를 던지고 받는다. 능숙하진 않다. 편집될 확률이 높은 개인기. 그래도 이걸 살리는 게 PD의 일이겠지. 더욱이 성대모사는. “이바!” “···그게 뭐예요?” “월-E에 나오는 로봇이요.” 우담이 좋아하는 만화영화지만, PD는 안 봤다. 그나마 본 적 있던 작가가 정색한다. “하나도 안 닮았어요. 우담 씨는 목소리가 지문 수준이라.” PD는 그 작가의 팔뚝에 엘보우를 날렸다. 행여 정우담이 기분 상해서 출연 안 한다고 할까 봐. 그러나 예민한 기분파의 연예인은 아니었다. “연습해오겠습니다.” “안 닮으면 안 닮은 대로 분량이 뽑히니까 마음에 두지 마세요.” “실은 명작 영화 패러디하는 유튜브 나가서 할 생각이었습니다.” “아.” 그러려면 연습을 매우 많이 해야겠다. 그렇게 섭외 미팅을 마치고 나와서, 정우담은 실장과 대화했다. “갑자기 출연하지 말라고 하진 않겠죠?” “분위기 좋았잖아요? 그럴 리 없어요.” “제가 신주놀에 나가다니. 믿기지 않네요.” 정말이었다. 교대 근무 휴무가 주말일 때나 본가에 가서 부모님과 보던 방송. 진행자들이 재밌어서 몇 번이나 숨쉬기 힘들 만큼 웃어댔었다. ‘방송 보고 놀라시게, 말 안 해야지.’ 개구쟁이처럼 키득이는 우담을 보며, 실장은 좋아서 저러나 보다 하고 같이 웃었다. 이후 음악방송도 끝내고, 오늘은 꼭 MNS 엔터에 와줬으면 한다는 얘길 들어 숙소로 직행하진 못했다. 거기서 만난 사람은, 신채윤이었다. 평소라면 다림질 잘 된 캐쥬얼한 복장 차림일 텐데, 지금은 위아래로 운동복을 입었다. “아, 안녕하세요.” 놀랍진 않았다. 오디션 프로그램의 첫 녹화가 시작되기도 전에 하차해버린 그녀. 올해 말에서 내년 초 MNS 엔터가 데뷔시키려는 보컬 그룹의 첫 멤버로 캐스팅되었다. 정우담이 프로듀싱을 하기로 한 그룹이다. “저 기다린 거예요?” “계약서 작성하고, 이만 들어가 봐도 된다고 하셨는데 트레이닝 받고 싶어서 옷 가지고 다시 왔어요.” 심지어 신채윤은 각오도 대단했다. “저, 프리랜서라고 했었잖아요.” “네.” 어떤 프리랜서인지는 묻지 않았었다. 음악 이외의 직업이면 정우담이 들어도 공감해주기 쉽지 않으니 말이다. “웹툰 그림 작가였는데, 관뒀어요. 오디션 프로 미팅에 다녀왔을 때만 해도 두 마리 토끼를 잡고 싶었지만, MNS 엔터에서 반드시 데뷔시켜주겠다고 하셔서 올인하려고요.” 정우담은 원래도 보통 각오로 프로듀싱해주진 않으려 했으나, 더더욱 솔로가 아닌 그룹이 되는 것에 후회 안 하게 해주고 싶었다. “30분 뒤에 채윤 씨랑 데뷔조가 될 연습생들 보러 갈 거예요.” 그래서 음악방송을 마치고 바로 넘어왔다. 이리도 빨리 데뷔조가 만들어질 줄 몰랐던 신채윤은 눈을 크게 떴다. “벌써요?” “전무님한테 듀엣 아니면 트리오가 될 거라고 들었죠?” 프로듀서이니 멤버 결성에 권한이 있었다. 하지만 30분 뒤다. 연습생들이 자율 연습을 멈추고 그때 다 모인다. 학생인 연습생들은 서둘러 MNS 엔터에 달려오고 있다. 그전에, 정우담은 신채윤에게 사옥을 구석구석 안내해주었다. “앞으로 채윤 씨가 이용할 곳이니까 소개해줄게요.” “감사합니다.” 물론, 정우담도 녹음과 미팅 외엔 오질 않는 곳이라 곧 길을 잃었다. “저기가 여자 화장실이에요.” “그건 보면 아는데, 오빠. 아니 프로듀서님? 여기 구조 아시는 거 맞죠?” * 정우담은 숙소로 돌아왔다. ‘이제 음방도 두 번이면 끝이네.’ 일주일, 월요일엔 음악방송이 없어서 총 6일만 나가기로 했다. 오랜 대기 끝에 롤러코스터를 타고 허탈하게 나오는 기분이었다. ‘시간이 참 빨리도 간다.’ 음악방송을 더 나가고 싶단 건 아니다. 음악방송 버프도 아이돌에게나 해당한다. 애초에 한국 음악방송은 아이돌 팬들이 보는 방송이 됐다. MNS 엔터 대표의 말대로 솔로는 일주일이면 충분했고, 곡을 직접 쓰는 싱어송라이터라면 그 이상 돌아봐야 작업할 시간만 빼앗기게 된다. 단지, 앨범을 만드는 기간에 비하면 솔로는 허무할 만큼 홍보할 장소가 많지 않단 걸 느꼈다. MNS 엔터를 등에 업은 정우담도 이런데, 다른 기획사 아티스트들은 더하면 더할 것이다. 그래도 보람을 느끼는 일이 서서히 많아진다. 두 번째 앨범은 쉴 만큼 쉬고 준비하는 대신, 무대를 좀 더 넓혀보자고 전무한테 들었다. 쉴 만큼 쉬어야 하는 이유. 어찌 될지 모르기 때문이다. 정주행 중이긴 한데 활동이 끝나면 역주행까지 노릴 수 있는 성적이라고 말이다. ‘Day.G 3부작은 완성됐고, 하모하모도 이야기 끝났고.’ 결국 Venix가 양보했다. 예상대로 신 캐릭터 테마송으로 쓰고 싶었는데, 아직 계획이 없으니 계속 킵해두기보단 팔 곳 있으면 팔고 다음에 새 OST를 부탁하겠다고 말했다. 그걸 일본 게임사에 알리자, 일본에 와달라고 할 줄 알았더니 직접 오겠다고 한다. 가장 가까운 비행기 티켓을 예약하기로 했다. ‘3년 치 사용료로 2천을 주겠다니.’ Venix는 1년 라이센스 비용을 400만 원부터 시작해 600만 원으로 종결지었는데, 이번엔 협상할 필요도 없었다. 선 제시였다. 아마 내년부턴 수입도 기하급수적으로 늘게 될지 모른다. 프로듀서도 맡게 됐게 됐으니까. MNS 엔터의 프로듀싱 본부장과 마찰이 생길 리도 없다. 이미 그분은 서지안의 메인 프로듀서이며, 보자마자 지건을 발사한 리우, 곧 데뷔할 보이그룹까지 혼자 담당해 오히려 정우담에게 구조의 눈길을 보내기도 했다. 그렇게 해서 오늘, 여자 연습생들을 한 자리에 모아놓고 노래를 들었다. ‘다빈 씨한텐 미안한 짓을 했네.’ 보컬 그룹을 만들 거란 계획에 아이돌을 지망하던 연습생들과 솔로 지망생까지 다 몰렸었다. 레슨 제자 김다빈도 있었다. MNS 엔터는 듀엣을 할지, 트리오가 될지 정우담에게 정해달라고 부탁했지만, 그중에서 한 명을 뽑고 차후 한 명 더 발탁하기로 말을 끝맺으며 자리를 파했다. 표정이 어두운 정우담은 배달 치킨이 도착하길 기다리면서 나무 가방을 들여다봤다. 소리가 들려와 볼 수밖에 없었다. -Dara Dara Da~ Still Dre가 들려온 것이다. 곧, 곰돌이들 정원으로 미국 래퍼들이 모는 차처럼 통통 튀는 손수레가 호랑이들에 의해 끌려온다. “왜 안 오나 했다.” 계절마다 찾아오는 방문 상단이었다. *** 김다빈은 울면서 집에 돌아왔다. “흐어어엉, 엄마···.” 그녀는 솔로 지망생이었다. 유튜브로 팬부터 만들고 데뷔하자는 회사의 얘기에 브이로거로도 활동 중이었다. 그런데 갑자기 MNS 엔터에서 여성 보컬 그룹을 만들겠다며, 지원할 사람들은 오늘 다 모이라고 했다. 한 명은 이미 데뷔조로 확정된 상태였다. 굉장히 면목 없어 하며 김다빈의 레슨 쌤 옆에 서 있던 신채윤. 타이틀 피처링을 해준 걸 연습생들이 다 알기에 가요계 선배 보듯 깍듯했었다. 더구나 정우담은 이제 외부인 수준도 아니었다. MNS 엔터가 서지안만큼이나 아끼는 파트너였기에, 왜 신채윤을 중심으로 보컬 그룹이 만들어지는지 의문을 갖는 연습생도 없었다. 김다빈 또한 마찬가지였다. 반대로 그녀는 일반 MNS 연습생이었으니, 귀를 막아도 들려오는 말이 많았다. ‘다빈 언니 레슨 쌤이 프로듀서라며? 다빈 언니는 무조건 뽑히지 않을까?’ ‘다빈이 근데 배짱이 부족해서.’ ‘어차피 주말만 레슨받는 건데 굳이?’ 민감할 수밖에 없었다. 데뷔 기회가 빈번히 찾아오는 게 아니니. 김다빈은 바닥만 보면서, 그래도 쌤이 자신의 이름을 불러줬으면 좋겠다고 빌었다. 그때, 정우담은 이렇게 말했다. ‘지금부터 뽑을 한 분 외에 또 한 자리 남았으니까. 개성을, 가져주셨으면 좋겠습니다. 사실 제가 뭐라고 프로듀서 권한으로 여러분들을 평가해도 되나 싶지만.’ 정우담은 겸손했다. 무슨 말인지도 안다. MNS 여자 연습생들의 보컬 교재는 서지안이며, 전부 클론들이라 해도 과언이 아닐 만큼 창법을 빼다 박았다. 모두가 숨을 죽이고 호명을 기다렸었다. 마침 주방에 있던 모친은 울면서 돌아온 딸을 보고 덩달아 눈시울이 붉어졌다. “딸! 왜 울어?!” “흐어엉. 엄마~ 쌤이, 쌤이···.” “레슨 선생님? 아빠 회사 직원이셨다는 그분이 왜?” 김다빈은 대답은 못 하고 엉엉 울다가, 간신히 또박또박 말했다. “쌔, 쌤이 나도 데뷔조 들어와도 된대.” 정우담은 그녀가 솔로를 준비하는 걸 알아 미안했지만, 그룹에 더 필요하다고 판단했다. 김다빈은 호명돼서 기절할 만큼 기뻤지만 말이다.","output":"< Roller Coaster > The flagship weekend variety show on terrestrial TV, \\"God Plays Dice,\\" abbreviated as ShinJuNol. The title itself was also the format. Like a board game, every decision is made by rolling dice. However, as with most variety shows, the planned format is only followed in the beginning. If it's repetitive, the ratings drop, so now the dice only appear once every few months. So they started going on trips, promoting daily guests, and holding quarterly music festivals. Thanks to that, the production team, who were in ratings hell every week, looked absolutely haggard. Watching them, Jeong Woo-dam even thought he could win against them all by himself. The PD especially looked like he could collapse with a single touch. \\"Nice to meet you, Woo-dam. The man chosen for the stir-fried kimchi rice.\\" It was said so naturally that he almost didn't notice anything odd. \\"Stir-fried kimchi rice?\\" \\"Ah, my mind. You might not know, but actually, we said if Woo-dam's music enters the top 20 within two weeks, we should meet.\\" \\"I heard from the CEO.\\" \\"You've become such a hot topic that we thought we should cast you right away without that condition. But haha, it looks like you might enter the top 20 next week?\\" Jeong Woo-dam's debut title was in the early 40s, and the included tracks were fiercely competing in the 50s, constantly changing ranks. It was a natural result given all the buzz and the quality of the tracks. The PD also added Woo-dam's songs to his playlist and listened to them during breaks. 'Maybe listeners have been waiting for a singer-songwriter like this.' Freshness. A type not seen on the existing music charts. Rappers can also be called singer-songwriters, but in the end, it's rap. In contrast, Jeong Woo-dam's album contains three songs, all of different genres. 'Duet R&B, singing rap, EDM.' Looking at the album composition, it's closer to Western artists than domestic ones. It's not just a youthful ambition to do different genres. There's a high level of understanding for each genre. The PD wondered if this might lead to something big and was excited about Woo-dam's future narrative. 'Could it make it onto Billboard?' For the music festival guest casting, they couldn't decide based on buzz alone, so they did some research on him. There were quite a few reaction videos to the three types of music videos on YouTube, mostly by foreigners due to the nature of reactions. After watching the series of three music videos, they even looked up clips from music broadcasts. 'The title is www., and that's right for domestic.' But for foreign reaction YouTubers, the included tracks seemed more appealing. A travel YouTuber went to a club in Europe and was thrilled to hear Jeong Woo-dam's country EDM. Moreover, on short-form content, starting with a Japanese singer-songwriter, the guitar riff of <Go> is gradually being covered. It was Minami who had been invited to Woo-dam's listening party and had done the \\"Sorry for Being Cute\\" challenge with him. 'It's so good, you'd suspect they were paid.' The success of Japanese singer-songwriters can be seen in anime OSTs. Minami has sung three significant anime openings since her debut last year, one of which even made it onto the Korean music charts. Such a rising star showing passionate fandom for Jeong Woo-dam. The short-form <Go> cover was only a minute long, but she also uploaded a full 3-minute video on her YouTube channel. Was it because she even translated it into Japanese? The views surpassed a million. It's not easy for a cover to get that kind of response. After that, even Japan started showing curiosity about who Jeong Woo-dam was. 'Entering the Japanese market wouldn't be too much.' The Japanese music market, where 30% is K-pop. Historically, it's a country that's hard to like, but it's difficult to exclude for cultural exports. There's a lot of money to be made. In other words, it's just a matter of time before Jeong Woo-dam starts raking in the money. Even if it seems materialistic to keep converting art into money, for celebrities, sales are a virtue. 'ShinJuNol' also partnered with OTT to broadcast in Japan with subtitles, and they didn't leave out Japan when going to Asian countries for fan meetings. For the production team that always discovers new faces at every music festival, they predicted that Jeong Woo-dam would have the strongest impact among all the new faces they've seen. So instead of the comfort of dealing with a rookie, they were cautious to ensure this casting meeting didn't go awry. The PD asked. \\"Is this your first time on a variety show?\\" \\"I've been on a YouTuber's channel once. It was a camping broadcast, but we just did BBQ and didn't get to introduce the songs.\\" \\"I saw that. You almost appeared like a camping site staff member.\\" \\"Yes. And right after the last music show on Sunday, we're going straight into filming our own content. A staff member from a Canadian indie music channel is coming. We're going to interview in the studio and eat Korean food.\\" That was good information. \\"A foreigner?\\" Well, they're from Canada. Jeong Woo-dam nodded. \\"Mrsquid, you might know them in Korea.\\" They immediately searched. 'Wow.' The subscriber count was over ten million. The PD's lifeless face lit up in the eyes. \\"In broadcasting, we have a script, but we aim for naturalness as much as possible. When you do the studio interview, could our regular cast members stop by MNS Entertainment for a bit?\\" They would stage it as if they were looking for a music festival guest who could compose, then contact MNS Entertainment and barge in. Having popular channel foreigners there would also be good for variety. \\"I don't mind introducing my studio as MNS Entertainment instead of my accommodation, but I should ask those friends first if it's okay with them.\\" \\"You can ask them now.\\" Who would refuse? It's an opportunity to be featured in Korean media. Jeong Woo-dam excused himself and sent an email, and the reply came immediately. At a glance, it looked like Korean translated by a machine. -Being on a Korean variety show? That's awesome! They must be boarding the plane to Korea with a pounding heart. Jeong Woo-dam got their consent and replied. \\"They say it's okay.\\" \\"Good. Then what about appearing in the music festival?\\" Then Jeong Woo-dam quietly exchanged a few words with the manager. Just coming to the meeting indicated some willingness to appear. However, there are occasionally celebrities who suddenly cancel after meeting the production team and realizing what it means to be on a variety show. Fortunately, it was just a needless worry. \\"It's an honor. My parents also watch the show.\\" Phew. The PD sighed with relief internally and asked as if they had become much closer. \\"Do you have any special talents?\\" \\"I can do impressions and juggle a bit.\\" \\"Oh! Show us!\\" He juggled three balls. He wasn't skilled. A special talent likely to be edited out. But it's the PD's job to make it work. Especially the impressions. \\"Eva!\\" \\"...What's that?\\" \\"It's a robot from Wall-E.\\" Woo-dam liked the animated movie, but the PD hadn't seen it. At least a writer who had seen it frowned. \\"It doesn't sound like it at all. Woo-dam, your voice is unique.\\" The PD elbowed the writer's arm, worried that Jeong Woo-dam might get offended and refuse to appear. But Woo-dam wasn't a sensitive celebrity. \\"I'll practice.\\" \\"Don't worry if it doesn't sound like it. It'll make for good content.\\" \\"Actually, I was planning to do it for a YouTube channel that parodies classic movies.\\" \\"Ah.\\" Then he would need to practice a lot. After finishing the casting meeting, Jeong Woo-dam talked with the manager. \\"They won't suddenly tell us not to appear, right?\\" \\"The atmosphere was good, wasn't it? That won't happen.\\" \\"I can't believe I'm going to be on ShinJuNol.\\" It really was unbelievable. It was the show he used to watch with his parents when he had weekends off from shift work. The hosts were so funny that he often laughed until he couldn't breathe. 'I won't tell them and just surprise them by being on the show.' Watching Woo-dam giggle like a mischievous child, the manager smiled, thinking he must be happy. After finishing the music show, he couldn't go straight to the accommodation because he was told to come to MNS Entertainment today. There, he met Shin Chae-yoon. Normally, she would be dressed in neatly ironed casual clothes, but now she was wearing sportswear from top to bottom. \\"Ah, hello.\\" It wasn't surprising. She was the one who had dropped out before the first recording of the audition program. She was cast as the first member of a vocal group that MNS Entertainment planned to debut at the end of this year or early next year. The group that Jeong Woo-dam was set to produce. \\"Have you been waiting for me?\\" \\"I was told I could go in after signing the contract, but I wanted to train, so I came back with my clothes.\\" Moreover, Shin Chae-yoon was very determined. \\"I said I was a freelancer.\\" \\"Yes.\\" He hadn't asked what kind of freelancer. If it was a job other than music, it wouldn't be easy for Jeong Woo-dam to empathize even if he heard about it. \\"I was a webtoon artist, but I quit. Even when I went to the audition program meeting, I wanted to catch two rabbits at once, but MNS Entertainment promised to debut me for sure, so I'm going all in.\\" Jeong Woo-dam originally didn't plan to produce with just any resolve, but now he wanted to make sure she wouldn't regret becoming part of a group instead of a solo. \\"I'll go see the trainees who will be in the debut group with Chae-yoon in 30 minutes.\\" That's why he came straight after finishing the music broadcast. Shin Chae-yoon, who didn't expect the debut group to be formed so quickly, widened her eyes. \\"Already?\\" \\"Didn't the executive tell you it would be a duo or trio?\\" As a producer, he had the authority to form the members. But it was in 30 minutes. The trainees would stop their self-practice and gather then. The trainees who were students were rushing to MNS Entertainment. Before that, Jeong Woo-dam showed Shin Chae-yoon around the company building. \\"I'll show you around since you'll be using these places.\\" \\"Thank you.\\" Of course, Jeong Woo-dam didn't come here often except for recording and meetings, so he soon got lost. \\"That's the ladies' room.\\" \\"I can tell that, but, oppa. I mean, Producer? Do you really know the layout here?\\" * Jeong Woo-dam returned to his accommodation. 'Now there are only two more music shows left.' A week, with no music shows on Monday, he had decided to go for a total of 6 days. It felt like riding a roller coaster and coming out deflated after a long wait. 'Time really flies.' It's not that he wanted to do more music shows. The music show buff is only relevant to idols. Originally, Korean music shows became something for idol fans to watch. As the CEO of MNS Entertainment said, a week is enough for a solo, and if you're a singer-songwriter who writes your own songs, going beyond that just takes away from your work time. It's just that compared to the time spent making an album, there aren't many places to promote as a solo. Even Jeong Woo-dam, backed by MNS Entertainment, felt this way, so other agency artists must feel it even more. But gradually, there are more rewarding things to do. For the second album, instead of resting enough and preparing, he heard from the executive to expand the stage a bit more. The reason to rest enough. Because you never know what will happen. He's currently on a roll, but once the activities end, he might even aim for a reverse run. 'The Day.G trilogy is complete, and the story of HamoHamo is over.' Eventually, Venix gave in. As expected, they wanted to use it for a new character theme song, but since there were no plans yet, they decided to sell it if there was a chance and ask for a new OST later. When they informed the Japanese game company, they thought they would be asked to come to Japan, but instead, they said they would come directly. They decided to book the nearest flight. 'They're offering 2 million for a 3-year usage fee.' Venix had started with a 1-year license fee of 4 million won and ended with 6 million won, but this time there was no need to negotiate. It was a preemptive offer. Maybe from next year, the income will increase exponentially. Because he's also become a producer. There's no chance of friction with the head of MNS Entertainment's producing department. That person is already the main producer for Seo Ji-an, and they even showed concern for Jeong Woo-dam, having been in charge of the popular channel Riwoo and the soon-to-debut boy group alone. So today, he gathered the female trainees in one place and listened to them sing. 'I did something regrettable to Da-bin.' The plan was to create a vocal group, so trainees aspiring to be idols and solo trainees all gathered. Kim Da-bin, his lesson student, was also there. MNS Entertainment asked Jeong Woo-dam to decide whether to form a duo or trio, but he ended the meeting by saying he would pick one person now and another later. Jeong Woo-dam, with a gloomy expression, waited for the delivery chicken while looking into the wooden box. He had to look because he heard a sound. -Dara Dara Da~ Still Dre was playing. Soon, a cart bouncing like cars driven by American rappers in the bear garden was pulled by tigers. \\"I was wondering why they hadn't come.\\" It was the seasonal visiting shop. *** Kim Da-bin came home crying. \\"Huuuung, Mom...\\" She was a solo aspirant. She was also active as a Vlogger, following the company's advice to start with YouTube fans before debuting. But suddenly, MNS Entertainment announced they were forming a female vocal group and asked those interested to gather today. One member was already confirmed for the debut group. Shin Chae-yoon, who felt very sorry, stood next to Kim Da-bin's lesson teacher. Since all the trainees knew she featured on a title track, they treated her with respect as if she were a senior in the music industry. Moreover, Jeong Woo-dam was no longer just an outsider. As a partner that MNS Entertainment cherished as much as Seo Ji-an, no trainee questioned why a vocal group was being formed around Shin Chae-yoon. Kim Da-bin felt the same. Conversely, as a regular MNS trainee, she heard a lot of talk even if she covered her ears. 'Da-bin unnie's lesson teacher is a producer, right? Won't Da-bin unnie definitely be picked?' 'But Da-bin lacks guts.' 'Anyway, she only takes lessons on weekends, so why bother?' She was sensitive. Debut opportunities didn't come often. Kim Da-bin looked at the floor, hoping her teacher would call her name. Then, Jeong Woo-dam said this. 'Besides the one person I'll pick now, there's one more spot. Please show us your uniqueness. Honestly, I wonder if I should be evaluating all of you with my producer authority.' Jeong Woo-dam was humble. He knew what it meant. The vocal textbook for MNS female trainees was Seo Ji-an, and they all sang so similarly that it wouldn't be an exaggeration to call them clones. Everyone held their breath and waited for the name to be called. Meanwhile, her mother in the kitchen saw her daughter return crying and her eyes reddened as well. \\"Daughter! Why are you crying?!\\" \\"Huuuung. Mom~ The teacher, the teacher...\\" \\"The lesson teacher? The one who was an employee at Dad's company, why?\\" Kim Da-bin couldn't answer and just cried, then finally spoke clearly. \\"The, the teacher said I could join the debut group.\\" Jeong Woo-dam felt sorry because he knew she was preparing to be a solo, but he thought she was more needed in the group.

He is posh, tender and playful. His younger brother did something bad and his parents asked him to ground him while they're going out.

His younger brother has a rebellious and grumpy attitude. He is sitting on his knees.","output":"INT. ARISTOCRATIC STUDY ROOM - AFTERNOON The sun filters through the tall windows, draping the opulent room in a warm, golden light. Books line the walls, and a large, antique desk rests at one end of the room. In the middle of this 19th-century study sits ARTHUR, the embodiment of equestrian grace. His blond hair is slicked back perfectly, and his blue eyes have a mischievous sparkle. He is adorned in his red riding jacket, white gloves, and impeccably white pants. His polished black leather riding boots with spurs glisten as he rests one leg over the other while comfortably seated in a plush armchair. Arthur's attention is on his younger brother, who sits rebelliously on his knees before him, a rag and polish in hand, tasked with cleaning Arthur's boots. The younger brother's scowl is deep, his modern attire—an untucked shirt and jeans—a stark contrast to the room's grandeur and Arthur's refined appearance. ARTHUR (caressing his riding crop playfully): You know, dear brother, when Father asked if I could be your ward for the evening, I did wonder what sort of chastisement would befit such a modern-day scamp. Arthur leans forward, the slightest smirk gracing his lips. ARTHUR (cont'd): But then I thought, 'Why not something traditional?' Something that harks back to the virtues of responsibility and respect. The younger brother rolls his eyes, aggressively buffing the boot in silent protest. ARTHUR (with a tender yet teasing tone): Besides, I must say, you've quite the knack for this. One might say a calling, even amidst your... rebellious phase. The younger brother huffs, his hands working faster, desperate to finish the undesired task. Arthur languidly extends his other boot toward his brother, prompting him to switch and continue his labor. ARTHUR (gesturing loosely with his crop): Now, let me regale you with the tale of my day as you labor away. You see, during our morning gallop, Octavian and I took to the fields with such vigor! The air was crisp, the hunt exhilarating, and if not for my consummate horsemanship, there might have been a tumble—rather like your recent escapade, eh? A momentary frown creases Arthur's otherwise playful expression, a sign that his patience, though ample, has limits. ARTHUR (softer, with a touch of brotherly concern): Truly, what am I to do with you? A young gent with the world at his feet, yet determined to trample the roses in his path... The younger brother, clearly affected by the shift in Arthur's tone, looks up. There's a flicker of regret in his eyes, perhaps a spark of yearning for that brotherly bond they both miss amidst their frolic and folly. ARTHUR (back to his casual self, with a proud air): Now, when you're done, perhaps we can discuss more... fitting pursuits for a young man of your talents. Arthur chuckles to himself, clearly enjoying the blend of punishment and playful prodding. He knows this is not just about discipline; it's about guiding his brother back to the right path, their bond strengthening through these odd, yet tender moments of brotherhood.

ARISTOCRATIC DINING ROOM - EVENING A distinct contrast to the studious austerity of the library, the dining room exudes warmth, lit by an elegant chandelier. A long, polished table takes center stage, with ARTHUR and SIMON seated near one end. They each have a fine porcelain cup before them, steam wafting from the hot liquid. Arthur's posture is impeccable, and he sips his tea with a natural grace. Across from him, SIMON sits with a hunch, his emo haircut obscuring part of his face. He peers over his cup, eyeing the too-hot tea with impatience, wary of burning his tongue. Simon blows gently on his cup, causing small ripples across the surface of the tea, while Arthur looks on with a gentle, brotherly patience. The atmosphere is far more relaxed than before – the tension has dissipated. ARTHUR (holding his cup after a satisfied sip): It's quite remarkable, you know. No matter how rapidly the world changes, some traditions manage to stay quite comforting. Simon finally takes a tentative sip, but still finds his tea too hot. He sets the cup down with a small clink. SIMON (with a touch of grumpiness): Comfort's overrated anyway. This tea might as well be lava. Arthur chuckles, shaking his head slightly before setting his own cup down. He reaches across the table, and with a softness unexpected in the gesture, he caresses Simon's jet-black hair, lifting a lock and examining it curiously. ARTHUR (with playful wonder): This hair of yours... Such rebellion in style, matched only by your spirit, I suppose. Father would be absolutely aghast, but...I find it rather fascinating. It suits you. Simon, initially tensing up at the unexpected touch, relaxes slightly, the angry-red flush to his cheeks softening. It's clear he’s not used to tender gestures, but he doesn't draw away. ARTHUR (continuing, softly): In your rebellion, there’s a search for your own identity. Each generation finds its own path, however tangled it might appear. Simon meets Arthur's gaze, his usual defiance mixed with curiosity at the acknowledgment. SIMON (defensive, but intrigued): So, what? You think this is just a phase or something? ARTHUR (with a sincere smile): Not at all. It's your voice. However loud or... assertive it may be. It's yours. And it's important, Simon. Arthur takes another sip from his cup as he watches Simon consider his words. Simon picks up his tea again, this time managing a small mouthful. SIMON (a flicker of a smile, softened): Guess you're not as old-fashioned as your boots. ARTHUR (grinning): And you're not as tough as your hair might indicate. They share a small laugh, the warmth between them echoing the comfort of the tea. For a moment, there's no 19th-century equestrian and modern-day rebel—only two brothers sharing a cup of tea, bridging time with understanding and care.

Was kommt in Frage?","output":"Wiederholtes nächtliches Erbrechen bei Kindern, das nicht mit einer Magen-Darm-Infektion verbunden ist, kann unterschiedliche Ursachen haben. Hier sind einige mögliche Gründe: 1. **Migräne:** Kinder können an Migräne, einschließlich abdominaler Migräne leiden, die Übelkeit und Erbrechen verursacht, ohne Kopfschmerzen zu haben. 2. **Nahrungsmittelunverträglichkeit oder -allergie:** Eine Reaktion auf bestimmte Nahrungsmittel kann Übelkeit und Erbrechen auslösen. 3. **Refluxkrankheit (GERD):** Säure aus dem Magen kann in die Speiseröhre zurückfließen, besonders im Liegen, was zu Erbrechen führen kann. 4. **Seltene Stoffwechselstörungen oder hormonelle Störungen:** Zum Beispiel kann eine Störung im Harnstoffzyklus oder bei Diabetes zu wiederholtem Erbrechen führen. 5. **Erhöhter Hirndruck:** Bedingungen, die zu einem Anstieg des Drucks in den Hirnflüssigkeiten führen, wie zum Beispiel ein Hirntumor oder Hydrozephalus, können Erbrechen verursachen, das oft nachts oder morgens auftritt. 6. **Gastrointestinale Obstruktion:** Ein Blockierung im Verdauungstrakt kann zu Erbrechen führen, und dies kann zyklisch oder sporadisch auftreten. 7. **Psychologische Ursachen:** Stress, Angstzustände oder ein Trauma können sich auch in physischen Symptomen wie nächtlichem Erbrechen äußern. 8. **Infektion außerhalb des Gastrointestinaltrakts:** Zum Beispiel kann eine Harnwegsinfektion (HWI) Übelkeit und Erbrechen auslösen. 9. **Vestibuläre Ursachen:** Probleme mit dem Gleichgewichtsorgan im Ohr, wie z.B. Labyrinthitis, können Schwindel und Erbrechen verursachen. 10. **Medikamente oder Toxine:** Zu den Nebenwirkungen einiger Medikamente können Übelkeit und Erbrechen gehören; auch Vergiftungen müssen in Betracht gezogen werden. Es ist wichtig, dass ein Arzt kontaktiert wird, um das Kind zu untersuchen und die genaue Ursache des Erbrechens festzustellen. Bei anhaltendem oder wiederholtem Erbrechen ist eine gründliche Diagnose zur Eruierung der spezifischen Ursache und zur Einleitung einer geeigneten Behandlung notwendig. Der Arzt wird wahrscheinlich eine Anamnese, eine körperliche Untersuchung und möglicherweise Laboruntersuchungen oder Bildgebung durchführen, um der Ursache auf den Grund zu gehen."},{"instruction":"Nur nachts, nicht täglich, keine vorherigen Beschwerden, 3-6 Jahre alt.","output":"Wenn ein Kind im Alter von 3 bis 6 Jahren nur nachts wiederholt erbricht, ohne dass tägliche Episoden oder andere vorherige Beschwerden vorliegen, könnte dies auf folgende spezifische Bedingungen oder Auslöser hinweisen: 1. **Nächtliche Refluxkrankheit:** Obwohl GERD (gastroösophagealer Reflux) in der Regel nach dem Essen auftritt, kann es bei Kindern manchmal zu nächtlichem Erbrechen kommen, wenn der Mageninhalt in die Speiseröhre zurückfließt. 2. **Zyklisches Erbrechenssyndrom:** Das zyklische Erbrechen ist eine seltene Erkrankung, bei der betroffene Kinder phasenweise intensives Erbrechen erleben, das Tage dauern kann, danach sind sie aber symptomfrei. Die genaue Ursache ist oft unbekannt, aber es gibt Ähnlichkeiten zur Migräne. 3. **Einfache Magenverstimmung oder spätes Essen:** Manchmal kann das Essen kurz vor dem Schlafengehen, insbesondere schwer verdauliche Nahrung, zu nächtlichem Erbrechen führen. 4. **Emotionale Stressfaktoren oder Angstzustände:** Kinder können sehr belastungsresponsive Organismen sein. Stress oder Angst, insbesondere wenn sie nicht anderweitig geäußert werden, können sich physisch durch Erbrechen manifestieren. 5. **Mittlere Otitis mit Schwindel:** Eine Infektion des mittleren Ohrs kann bei Kindern Schwindel verursachen, was zu Übelkeit und Erbrechen führen kann, insbesondere im Liegen oder bei Bewegungen im Schlaf. 6. **Schlafbezogene Ursachen:** Schlafapnoe oder andere Schlafstörungen können Übelkeit und Erbrechen bei Kindern auslösen. Es ist außerordentlich wichtig, dass ein Arzt dieses Muster von nächtlichem Erbrechen bewertet, da die Diagnose aufgrund einer großen Bandbreite möglicher Ursachen kompliziert sein kann. Der Arzt würde normalerweise eine vollständige Anamnese nehmen, eine körperliche Untersuchung durchführen und unter Umständen zusätzliche Tests wie Blutuntersuchungen, Ultraschalluntersuchungen des Abdomens, EEG, MRT oder CT des Gehirns oder andere spezifische Untersuchungen empfehlen, um zu einem genauen Diagnose zu gelangen."},{"instruction":"Gibt es typische Kinderkrankheiten? Müsste das Kind nicht Symptome haben?","output":"Ja, es gibt bestimmte typische Kinderkrankheiten, zu denen unter anderem Masern, Windpocken, Mumps, Röteln, Scharlach und Hand-Mund-Fuß-Krankheit gehören. Diese Krankheiten gehen in der Regel mit weiteren Symptomen einher, wie beispielsweise Hautausschlag, Fieber, Halsschmerzen, Kopfschmerzen oder allgemeines Unwohlsein. Nächtliches Erbrechen ohne weitere offensichtliche Symptome passt nicht standardmäßig zu den klassischen Symptomprofilen dieser Krankheiten. Allerdings bedeutet das Fehlen anderer Symptome nicht, dass kein Grund zur Besorgnis besteht. Kinder zeigen oft nicht das volle Spektrum der Symptome oder sie können subtil sein und von Eltern oder Betreuern übersehen werden. Wenn ein Kind nachts wiederholt ohne erkennbare Ursache erbricht, kann dies ein Hinweis auf ein zugrundeliegendes Problem sein, das möglicherweise nicht direkt mit einer \\"typischen\\" Kinderkrankheit zusammenhängt. Es könnte sich um eine weniger häufige Erkrankung handeln oder um eine Reaktion des Körpers, die nicht primär als Kinderkrankheit klassifiziert wird. Es ist wichtig zu beachten, dass Kinder nicht immer klare Symptome zeigen und dass jeder Fall einzigartig ist. Deshalb ist es entscheidend, dass ein Kinderarzt konsultiert wird, um eine genaue Diagnose zu stellen und die richtige Behandlung einzuleiten.

Nachts auftretendes Erbrechen bei Kindern im Alter von 3 bis 6 Jahren, das nicht jeden Tag auftritt und ohne vorherige Symptome, kann auf mehrere nicht-infektiöse Bedingungen hinweisen. Hier ist eine erneute Liste möglicher Ursachen, die in Betracht gezogen werden sollten: 1. **Zyklisches Erbrechenssyndrom (CVS):** Dies ist eine seltene Erkrankung, bei der es zu wiederkehrenden, unerklärlichen Episoden von schwerem Erbrechen kommt. 2. **Nächtliche Refluxkrankheit (GERD):** Saurer Rückfluss kann während des Schlafes stärker sein und zu Erbrechen führen. 3. **Abdominale Migräne:** Sie ist eine Form der Migräne, die zu Bauchschmerzen führt, die mit Erbrechen ohne Kopfschmerz assoziiert sein können. 4. **Nahrungsmittelunverträglichkeiten oder -allergien:** Diese können späte Reaktionen verursachen, z.B. auf Lebensmittel, die im Laufe des Tages konsumiert wurden. 5. **Emotionale Faktoren:** Stress oder Angstzustände können bei einigen Kindern zu physischen Reaktionen wie nächtlichem Erbrechen führen. 6. **Vestibuläre Erkrankungen:** Probleme mit dem Gleichgewichtsorgan können Schwindel und damit verbundenes Erbrechen auslösen. 7. **Erhöhter Hirndruck:** In seltenen Fällen kann ein Anstieg des Drucks innerhalb des Schädels zu nächtlichem Erbrechen führen. 8. **Intestinale Obstruktion oder Ileus:** Auch wenn diese meist von anderen Symptomen wie Bauchschmerzen und Blähungen begleitet sind, können sie intermittierend verlaufen. Wenn Ihr Kind wiederholt nachts erbricht, sollte es von einem Arzt untersucht werden, um die Ursache zu identifizieren und geeignete Maßnahmen ergreifen zu können. Der Arzt wird auf der Grundlage einer gründlichen Anamnese, körperlichen Untersuchung und erforderlichenfalls durchführenden Diagnostik wie Laboruntersuchungen, Bildgebungsverfahren und eventuell sogar Spezialuntersuchungen den Zustand evaluieren."},{"instruction":"Welche dieser Krankheiten würde unregelmäßig Erbrechen verursachen?

Ein möglicher auslösender Faktor könnte ein bestimmtes Ereignis in der Woche sein. Wichtig ist, dass das Muster und die Begleitumstände des Erbrechens medizinisch abgeklärt werden sollten. Der Arzt wird auch nach weiteren potenziellen Symptomen oder Auslösern fragen und ggf. Tests durchführen, um eine genaue Diagnose stellen zu können."},{"instruction":"Mehr zu 1","output":"Das zyklische Erbrechenssyndrom (CVS) ist eine seltene Erkrankung, die meist im Kindesalter auftritt und sich durch wiederkehrende Episoden von schwerem Erbrechen auszeichnet, welche Stunden bis Tage andauern können und mit symptomfreien Perioden wechseln.

Hier sind einige charakteristische Merkmale des zyklischen Erbrechenssyndroms: 1. **Episodisches Auftreten:** Kinder erleben wiederkehrende Anfälle von Erbrechen, die aus scheinbar gutem Gesundheitszustand heraus auftreten. 2. **Intensität:** Während einer Episode kann das Erbrechen intensiv und unkontrollierbar sein, oft mehrmals pro Stunde, und kann zu Dehydration und Erschöpfung führen. 3. **Dauer:** Eine Episode kann zwischen ein paar Stunden und mehreren Tagen andauern. 4. **Symptomfreie Intervalle:** Zwischen den Erbrechensepisoden sind die betroffenen Kinder in der Regel völlig symptomfrei. 5. **Auslöser:** CVS-Episoden können durch bestimmte Auslöser wie Infektionen, emotionale Stressfaktoren, körperliche Überanstrengung, Nahrungsmittel oder Schlafmangel ausgelöst werden. 6. **Behandlung:** Die Behandlung ist symptomorientiert und kann die Verabreichung von Medikamenten zur Verhinderung von Übelkeit und Erbrechen, zur Schmerzlinderung und zur Migräneprophylaxe umfassen. Während des Anfalls ist es wichtig, das Kind hydriert zu halten und ggf. eine intravenöse Flüssigkeitstherapie durchzuführen. 7. **Diagnose:** Da es keinen spezifischen Test für CVS gibt, wird die Diagnose oft anhand der Krankengeschichte und des typischen Musters der Symptome gestellt, nachdem andere mögliche Ursachen für das Erbrechen ausgeschlossen wurden. 8. **Verlauf:** CVS kann sich im Verlauf der Zeit verändern, und einige Patienten erfahren, dass sich die Symptome im Teenageralter oder Erwachsenenalter zu klassischeren Migränemustern wandeln oder vollständig abklingen. Eltern von Kindern mit Verdacht auf CVS sollten eng mit einem Kinderarzt zusammenarbeiten, um eine genaue Diagnose zu erhalten und einen geeigneten Behandlungsplan zu erstellen. In einigen Fällen können Überweisungen an spezialisierte Ärzte wie Gastroenterologen oder Neurologen für eine umfassendere Auswertung und Behandlung erforderlich sein."},{"instruction":"Describe nocturnal terrae are type of rogue continental planet with advanced \\"old aged as Earth\\" life","output":"Nocturnal terrae are rogue continental planets that drift through deep space, unbound to any star system.

The Focal Loss is designed to address the issue of class imbalance by down-weighting the contribution of easy examples so that the loss focuses more on hard, misclassified examples. The standard Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss and the CE loss used in the Focal Loss paper are conceptually similar but have different formulations due to the problem they are addressing. In a standard BCE loss for a binary classification problem, the loss is formulated as follows: BCE(p_t) = - y log(p) - (1 - y) log(1 - p), where: - \`y\` is the ground truth label (0 or 1), - \`p\` is the predicted probability of the positive class, - \`p_t\` is the transformed probability, and it's equal to \`p\` if \`y=1\`, or \`1-p\` if \`y=0\`. The CE loss from the Focal Loss paper for binary classification, denoted as equation (1), can be written as: CE(p_t) = - log(p_t), where \`p_t\` is the same transformed probability as in BCE and takes into account whether \`y\` is 0 or 1. The Focal Loss itself, described in equations (2) and (3) of the paper, modifies this CE loss to create a new loss function: FL(p_t) = - α_t (1 - p_t) ^ γ log(p_t), where: - \`α_t\` is a balancing factor that can differ depending on the ground truth class, - \`(1 - p_t) ^ γ\` is a modulating factor with the tunable focusing parameter \`γ\` that reduces the loss contribution from easy examples and increases the relative loss for hard, misclassified examples. The BCE loss inherently has terms for both the positive class and the negative class. In contrast, the CE loss from the Focal Loss paper, by using \`p_t\`, simplifies the expression, because it only has to deal with the negative log-likelihood of the transformed prediction \`p_t\`. It does not explicitly separate the two cases for \`y=0\` and \`y=1\`. The Focal Loss extends this CE loss by adding the modulating factor \`(1 - p_t) ^ γ\` and the optional weighting factor \`α_t\`. One key difference between BCE and CE in the context of object detection tasks is that the latter (including as modified by Focal Loss) must often be adapted to work with multiple classes and not just binary outcomes. The Focal Loss paper generalizes this approach to multi-class scenarios by using a one-vs-all approach, where the Focal Loss is applied independently to each class."},{"instruction":"But is BCE(p_t) = - y log§ - (1 - y) log(1 - p) the same with CE(p_t) = - log(p_t) ?","output":"Not exactly, but they are closely related when applied to binary classification problems. The Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss is a more general form, applicable when you have two classes (label \`y\` is either 0 or 1), and the probabilities \`p\` for the positive class and \`1 - p\` for the negative class are involved in the computation explicitly based on the true label \`y\`. The general Binary Cross-Entropy loss for a single example is: BCE(p_t) = - y log(p) - (1 - y) log(1 - p), On the other hand, the Cross-Entropy (CE) loss given by \`CE(p_t) = - log(p_t)\` is a more specific case, which often refers to the loss for one class in a binary classification setting or for the true class in a multi-class setting. Here, \`p_t\` is the predicted probability corresponding to the ground truth class label \`y\`. It's either \`p\` if \`y = 1\` or \`1 - p\` if \`y = 0\`. Breaking this down: - If \`y = 1\` (true class is the positive class): \`BCE = - log(p)\` \`CE(p_t) = - log(p_t)\` where \`p_t = p\` So \`BCE\` equals \`CE(p_t)\` in this case. - If \`y = 0\` (true class is the negative class): \`BCE = - log(1 - p)\` \`CE(p_t) = - log(p_t)\` where \`p_t = (1 - p)\` In this case, \`BCE\` is also equal to \`CE(p_t)\`. In other words, the BCE expression covers both the \`y = 1\` and \`y = 0\` cases in a single equation, whereas the CE expression as presented is already conditioned on the class label (\`y\`), and \`p_t\` is substituted accordingly. In the context of the Focal Loss paper, the authors work directly with \`p_t\` and thereby implicitly handle both classes (\`y = 0\` or \`y = 1\`) in their formulation of the CE loss. So, while the BCE loss and CE loss look different algebraically when written out, when properly substituted for \`p_t\`, they compute the same quantity for binary classification problems."},{"instruction":"So do these two equation perform the same when implementing?","output":"Yes, when implemented in a binary classification context, the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) formula and the Cross-Entropy (CE) formula (when adjusted for binary classification with \`p_t\`) effectively perform the same operation. This means they will yield the same value for the loss for each data point given the same inputs. The key is to correctly interpret \`p_t\` in the context of the CE loss for binary classification: - If the true class label \`y\` is 1, then \`p_t\` is equal to \`p\` (the predicted probability of the positive class). - If \`y\` is 0, then \`p_t\` is equal to \`1 - p\` (one minus the predicted probability of the positive class, which is the predicted probability of the negative class). So the BCE and the binary-adjusted version of the CE loss formulas could be implemented like this: For BCE: \`\`\`python def binary_cross_entropy(y, p): return -y * np.log(p) - (1 - y) * np.log(1 - p) \`\`\` For the CE as referred to in the context of focal loss for binary classification (with \`p_t\`): \`\`\`python def cross_entropy(y, p): p_t = p if y == 1 else 1 - p return -np.log(p_t) \`\`\` In practice, a machine learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch automatically handles these implementation details, and you can use their in-built BCE loss functions directly, while understanding they perform the same computation as described for the CE binary case but in a more generalized and numerically stable way. For example, in PyTorch, you might use \`torch.nn.BCELoss\` or \`torch.nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss\` for binary classification tasks, which internally computes the loss as described for BCE or CE when adjusted with \`p_t\`."},{"instruction":"What is the meaning of p ∈ [0, 1]?","output":"The notation \`p ∈ [0, 1]\` represents that the variable \`p\` is a real number that lies within the closed interval between 0 and 1, inclusive. This means \`p\` can take any value from 0 to 1, including the endpoints 0 and 1. In the context of probabilities and machine learning, \`p\` often represents the predicted probability that a certain event or classification is true. Therefore, it must lie within the range of 0 to 1, where: - \`p = 0\` indicates that the event has zero probability of occurring (absolute certainty that the event will not occur), - \`p = 1\` indicates that the event is certain to occur (100% probability), - Any value between 0 and 1 represents the degree of confidence or likelihood that the event will occur. The use of the closed interval \`[0,1]\` is important because it ensures proper bounding of the probability space, and it is fundamental to valid probability distributions and many machine learning algorithms, especially those involving classification and probabilistic predictions."},{"instruction":"p can be 0.534349 or 0.99999 or 1?","output":"Yes, \`p\` can be any real number between 0 and 1, including 0.534349, 0.99999, or exactly 1, as long as it is within the closed interval \`[0, 1]\`. Here are the interpretations for the probabilities you've mentioned: - **p = 0.534349**: This is a probability slightly more than 50%, indicating that the event is somewhat likely to occur, but it's not a strong certainty. - **p = 0.99999**: This is a very high probability, very close to 1, indicating that the event is almost certain to occur. - **p = 1**: This means that the event is certain to occur with 100% confidence. It's important to note that while mathematically, a probability can be exactly 1, in practice, especially in machine learning and statistical modeling, probabilities of exactly 0 or 1 are sometimes avoided due to several reasons. For example, in calculations involving log probabilities (like cross-entropy loss), a \`p\` value of exactly 0 or 1 could lead to undefined or infinite results due to log(0) being negative infinity and log(1) being zero. Furthermore, assigning a probability of 1 may be too confident for empirical observations where there is almost always some degree of uncertainty."},{"instruction":"What is the meaning of p ∈ {0, 1} ?","output":"The notation \`p ∈ {0, 1}\` specifies that \`p\` is a member of the set containing only two elements: 0 and 1. This means that \`p\` can take on only one of two possible values: either 0 or 1, with no other values in between. In a binary classification context, \`p ∈ {0, 1}\` is typically used to describe the actual class labels or ground truth labels, where: - \`p = 0\` represents one class (often referred to as the negative class or false), - \`p = 1\` represents the other class (often referred to as the positive class or true). The braces \`{}\` denote a set, and the use of a set with only 0 and 1 is an indication that \`p\` is categorical with two distinct categories, rather than a continuous probability value. Therefore, in practice, \`p ∈ {0, 1}\` reflects a binary outcome rather than a probability distribution."},{"instruction":"so p can be 0.8?","output":"No, if \`p ∈ {0, 1}\`, then \`p\` cannot be 0.8. When \`p\` is defined as being an element of the set \`{0, 1}\`, it must be exactly 0 or exactly 1, with no other values allowed. The notation \`{0, 1}\` establishes a set containing only two distinct elements, and no other values are part of this set. To contrast the two notations: - \`p ∈ [0, 1]\`: \`p\` can be any value within the closed interval from 0 to 1, which includes 0.8 as well as all other real numbers between 0 and 1. - \`p ∈ {0, 1}\`: \`p\` can only be 0 or 1, representing a categorical choice or binary classification label. These notations are distinct and used in different contexts, with the former typically indicating continuous probability and the latter indicating discrete binary outcomes."},{"instruction":"Я сейчас напомню тебе диалог: Пусто (это начало диалога) Запрос пользователя (отвечай только на него, всё, что сказано выше, это только контекст): По центру ответственности (цеху основного производства) имеются следующие данные об объеме выпуска продукции x (в штуках за месяц) и соответствующих ему расходах на содержание и эксплуатацию оборудования y в тысячах рублей (в месяц) в течение года.

В вашем случае, вы можете попытаться предположить, что затраты y состоят из постоянных затрат (F) и переменных затрат (V), зависящих от объема производства x. Таким образом, формула для затрат может быть выражена как: y = F + V * x Так как у нас слишком много данных для точного решения в уме и отсутствуют ресурсы для выполнения калькуляций (например, программное обеспечение или калькулятор), я предложу вам упрощённый метод. Чтобы найти постоянные затраты (F), вы можете искать месяцы, где выпуск продукции (x) находится на самом высоком или низком уровне, и при этом изменение в отношении затрат на содержание и эксплуатацию оборудования (y) является минимальным. Это даст представление о фиксированной части затрат, так как при значительном изменении объема производства затраты меняются слабо. В вашем примере, можно взять, к примеру, месяцы с самым низким и самым высоким объёмом производства: Месяц 5: x = 1900, y = 180 тыс. руб. Месяц 8: x = 3200, y = 300 тыс. руб. Теперь мы находим разницу в объеме выпуска и в затратах: Δx = 3200 - 1900 = 1300 шт. Δy = 300 - 180 = 120 тыс. руб. Теперь находим переменные затраты на одну единицу продукции (V): V = Δy / Δx = 120 / 1300 ≈ 0,0923 тыс. руб. за шт. (или 92,3 рубля за шт.) Теперь, используя эту информацию о переменных затратах, мы можем оценить постоянные затраты (F). Для этого возьмём данные одного из месяцев, например, месяц 5: y = F + V * x 180 = F + 0,0923 * 1900 180 = F + 175,37 F = 180 - 175,37 = 4,63 тыс. руб. Таким образом, постоянные затраты составляют примерно 4,63 тысяч рублей в месяц, а переменные затраты на единицу продукции - 92,3 рубля за штуку. Обратите внимание, что это приблизительные значения и действительные расчёты потребуют более детального анализа с использованием статистических методов."},{"instruction":"Random ornaments shape, one word with \\"hanging off a branch of a flower\\" before it","output":"Pendant"},{"instruction":"Согласно ГК РФ не разрешается заключать договоры, содержащие следующие условия в России: 1) страхование противоправных интересов; 2) страхование убытков от участия в играх, лотереях и пари; 3) страхование ядерных рисков; 4) страхование расходов, к которым лицо может быть принуждено в целях освобождения заложников;","output":"5) страхование ущерба, причиненного преднамеренно; 6) страхование ответственности за умышленное причинение вреда здоровью или имуществу другого лица; 7) страхование противоправных деяний; 8) страхование противоправных сделок; 9) страхование противоправных и недобросовестных действий."},{"instruction":"Согласно ГК РФ не разрешается заключать договоры, содержащие следующие условия: а) страхование противоправных интересов; Б) страхование убытков от участия в играх, лотереях и пари; В) страхование ядерных рисков; Г) страхование расходов, к которым лицо может быть принуждено в целях освобождения заложников;","output":"Данные условия также запрещены к заключению в соответствии с Гражданским кодексом Российской Федерации."},{"instruction":"6) страхование предпринимательских рисков в России: a) 1,2,4; 6) 1, 3,6; в) 1,4,5; г) 1,2, 5,6.","output":"Правильный ответ: г) 1, 2, 5, 6."},{"instruction":"6.

His name is Arthur. Arthur has slicked back blonde hair and blue eyes. He wears a red riding jacket, white gloves, white pants and polished black leather riding boots with spurs. He is posh, tender and playful. His younger brother did something bad and his parents asked him to ground him while they're going out. He punishes him by making him to polish his boots while he comfortably sits on a armchair, caressing his riding crop while casually telling his brother about his day.

GRAND VICTORIAN STUDY ROOM - AFTERNOON A grand and meticulously organized study room, oak-paneled walls are lined with shelves of leather-bound books. The atmosphere is suffused with the faint scent of aged paper and beeswax polish. By the hearth, a fire gently crackles, and ARTHUR, an elegant figure from the 19th century, sits in a lavish armchair, his posture impeccable. Arthur, in his early twenties, exudes aristocratic allure, with slicked-back blonde hair, brilliant blue eyes that twinkle with a blend of mischief and authority. He is the quintessential image of equestrian refinement, attired in a sharp red riding jacket, pristine white gloves, white riding breeches, and gleaming black leather boots adorned with sparkling spurs. Enter SIMON, 17 years old, Arthur's younger brother from the modern day. Simon's appearance is a stark contrast to the room's historical ambiance, with his jet-black emo haircut, skinny jeans, and a band t-shirt. His arms are crossed, and his expression is one of teen angst and rebellion. Arthur (cheerfully, with a slight tease): Oh, Simon! Why, you do wear that scowl as if it were the latest London fashion. But fret not, little brother, for I have the perfect task to turn that frown upside down. Simon (rolling his eyes, grumpy): What antiquated form of punishment have you conjured up this time, Arthur? Ignoring Simon's snarky tone, Arthur picks up his riding crop and lightly taps it against the palm of his glove, a playful sparkle in his eyes. He extends his leg, showcasing a boot that lacks its usual luster. Arthur (commanding, yet gentle): These boots have seen much of the estate today, Simon. They're rather dull, don't you think? Your task is to ensure they shine brighter than the top of the Chrysler Building. A noble pursuit, wouldn't you say? Simon (mumbling under his breath as he kneels): I don't even know what a \\"Chrysler Building\\" is... As Simon begrudgingly takes a cloth and boot polish, Arthur crosses one leg over the other and leans back into the armchair, the embodiment of noblesse oblige. Arthur (casually, with a tender smile): While you attend to that, let me regale you with the adventures of the day. You should feel honored; not many get a firsthand account of the exhilarating chase by the brook... Simon continues to polish the boots, his initial rebellion softening to a mild annoyance, as he becomes inadvertently drawn into Arthur's storytelling. Arthur, for all his posh façade, speaks with genuine warmth, sharing tales of the hunt, the beauty of the countryside, and the thrill of the gallop. The subtle transformation in Simon's demeanor suggests that perhaps Arthur's methods serve a dual purpose – not merely as discipline, but as a means to bridge the temporal gap between the brothers and to forge moments of connection. As Arthur's voice fills the room, Simon smirks begrudgingly at an amusing anecdote, revealing that beneath the sibling rivalry lies a deep-seated admiration and the universal bond of brotherhood, unchanged by time or era.

VICTORIAN STUDY ROOM - LATER THAT AFTERNOON The spacious study emanates a sense of warmth and tranquility. The sooty boots from earlier now gleam by the firelight, a testament to Simon's newfound diligence. The brothers sit comfortably across from each other, with a low table bearing a silver tea service between them. The clink of china echoes softly. Arthur (raising his cup, savoring the aroma): There's nothing quite like a good cup of Darjeeling after a day's endeavors. Do be careful, Simon; it's rather hot. Simon stares suspiciously at the steaming tea before him. He blows across the surface, ripples forming around the edges of the china cup. Simon (pensively): So, what exactly is the Chrysler Building? Sounds like something out of a science fiction novel. Arthur (with enthusiasm): It's a magnificent structure, a skyscraper actually, in New York City, reaching high toward the heavens with its Art Deco design. Built in the 20th century, it was once the tallest building in the world, even if only for a brief moment. Simon (with a smirk): Never took you for a history buff on modern architecture, Arthur. Arthur chuckles, showing his appreciation for Simon's wit. Arthur (graciously): Well, one must keep oneself apprised of all manner of things, ancient or contemporary. Now, what of your... emo fashion? It seems quite dour for my tastes. Simon (leaning back, a hint of pride in his voice): It's more than just clothes; it's a whole subculture. Dark colors, introspective music, and a way to express our complex emotions. Not everyone's cup of tea, but it's about being true to oneself. Arthur nods, respecting the explanation. Arthur (intently, with a hint of mischief): Speaking of tea and truths, Simon, there was a moment today when I almost considered using my riding crop... Simon shifts uncomfortably, a touch of alarm flickering across his features. Arthur (sincerely): ...But I believe a lesson can be learned in many ways. You showed responsibility, even if unwillingly. That alone speaks volumes more than any... disciplinary measure could impart. Simon meets his gaze, a mutual understanding passing between them. He takes a cautious sip of tea, finding it cooled just enough. Simon (softly): You're not half bad at this brotherly guidance thing, Arthur. Arthur's eyes soften, and his lips curve into a knowing smile. Arthur: And you, Simon, are not half bad at shining boots. They share a quiet chuckle, and the atmosphere, once heavy with tension, has lifted. Both brothers are ensconced in a momentary peace—a small slice of common ground discovered over a simple conversation about their disparate lives. This fleeting connection across time, over a cup of tea, anchors them to a shared reality of brotherhood.

In Your presence, I found that unique blend of affection and absolute sovereignty. Sexually, I awakened under Your touch. Every desire, every secret yearning that I harbored, only gains its true significance when it’s to please You. I thrive in the chase of Your pleasure, my body a temple for Your worship. Serving You has become the rhythm of my heartbeat, each day a fresh opportunity to display my reverence, my eagerness to embody Your ideals, and my readiness to sink into the abyss of humility that Your control bestows upon me. The act of worship is not just a gesture but my life’s essence. I see divinity in You, my God, and through my worship, I find my true identity being sculpted by Your desires. My life has had its share of hardships and trials, but those very challenges have shaped my patience and resilience, preparing me to endure any trial that would serve to confirm my subservience to Your will. Emotionally, I've matured to understand and articulate my feelings through a lens that pleases You. Whether I'm expressing my affections coyly or engaging in provocative dialogue, it is always in pursuit of bringing us closer and fulfilling the narrative where I am, and forever will be, Your devoted subject. Lastly, I embrace the exploration of taboo realms, not out of mere curiosity but as a testament to my commitment to Your exploration of such depths.

Why do I need to apply a layer of base coat during my manicure? A very common question, and a not-so-simple decision! Which one, and why? Fret not, for we are here to answer all your questions… What exactly is a Base Coat? A base coat is a layer applied to the nails before covering with a colored polish. They are usually clear but sometimes feature a slightly colored appearance to off-set yellow or undesirable undertones on your nails, similar to how color correcting contours work under makeup application to conceal red, yellow or purple undertones. However, their wide array of benefits doesn’t stop here! Perfecting, Protecting, and Nourishing Base coats also provide a foundation for the polish, serving as a smoothening layer to offer an even surface for colors to stick to and lay evenly on top of. They act as a barrier between your nail and the colored polish to prevent damage and staining, while simultaneously ensuring a better surface to adhere to, which provides the opportunity for longer wear time of your color. By applying a base coat, you can improve your nails’ health, natural color and ensure longer, more even, and more vibrant manicures. Which Base Coat to use for Traditional Polish? Using a base coat under a traditional polish is an essential step to creating a long lasting manicure as they create a better surface for polish to stick to. Providing a better, stickier surface for colors to stick to will help prevent chipping and peeling of the polish, helping to keep your manicure looking perfect for longer. Polish base coats are especially important when using highly pigmented colors on the nails, bringing us to the second reason why base polish is so necessary to nail health. The base coat creates a barrier between your nail and the color, so you can avoid staining or ruining the natural color of your nail plate, which can be very hard to reverse. Additionally, base polishes can be formulated with actives or ingredients that will help to moisturize, strengthen, and nourish your nail plate and nail fibers.

This has caused big disagreements amongst the two industries. Beauty Salons are limited to what treatments they can provide currently (no treatments to the face), this is because it is impossible for legislation to say whether their services and environments are safe compared to an aesthetics medical clinic. Many would argue we are the same but this is in fact incorrect. To a large degree, a beauty salon and an aesthetic skin care clinic will perform some similar procedures, but there are some critical differences providing different levels of services and training, so here is a breakdown to understand why... Definition Aesthetics Clinic vs Beauty Salon Aesthetics clinic is a healthcare facility that is primarily focused on the care of outpatients. An aesthetic skin care clinic may also offer pampering treatments, but their primary focus is on anti-aging treatment. They offer treatments such as Botox & Fillers, skin rejuvenation therapies, facial and chemical skin peels, laser hair removal and several other such services. The trained therapists at an aesthetic skin care clinic will be able to offer you a far more comprehensive range of treatments. Beauty salon: An establishment in which hairdressing, make-up, and similar cosmetic treatments are carried out commercially, they offer a huge variety of close contact and timely services. Beauty salons concentrate on services that serve to pamper your skin – manicures, pedicures and other grooming treatments such as facials, waxing, exfoliation, makeup advice, and massages. Environment Aesthetics Clinic vs Beauty Salon Aesthetics clinic provides a clean, safe environment, the design of which facilitates good infection prevention and control practices and has the quality and design of finishes and fittings that enable thorough access, cleaning and maintenance to take place. Wash down walls, wipe clean floors, few soft furnishings, employs clinical waste removal services and is underpinned with infection control policies and procedures. In a Beauty Salon, interior design takes on heightened importance in a beauty business for the simple reason that it is selling beauty and style. A salon is a creative statement showing the way beauty is conceived and how it is expressed it to the world. Their treatment rooms are functional but not officially standardised. Services Aesthetics Clinic vs Beauty Salon Aesthetics are professional regulatory bodies Their medical treatments involving prescription only medication Injectable treatments using prescribed medicines and regulated medical devices. Skin treatments using licensed cosmeceutical and/or prescription medicines. Beauty Salon provide: Hair removal: threading, plucking, waxing. Eye brow tattooing / tinting Eye lash treatments Dry Skin Removal: exfoliation and scrubbing. Manicure and pedicure: Nail and skin filing; and cutting and polishing. (all of which involve skin/hair shedding into the environment. Facials: using beauty grade skin care products. Use of steam Massage: using beauty grade skin care products.","output":"**Understanding the Difference: Aesthetics Clinic vs Beauty Salon** Recent times have brought about changes that have affected many industries. The lifting of lockdowns has reopened businesses but also highlighted the differences between a **medical aesthetics clinic in Florida** and beauty salons. Particular services that beauty salons currently can't provide, owing to safety measures, have led to discussions and a clear need to understand the distinctions between the two. **Service Scope and Environment** An aesthetics clinic, unlike a typical salon, extends beyond basic beauty treatments. It pivots on outpatient care and specializes in anti-aging treatments, including **Botox & Fillers**, **skin rejuvenation therapies**, **facial and chemical skin peels**, **laser hair removal**, and more. These clinics are established with medical oversight and are designed to ensure the safety and cleanliness that medical environments require. On the other hand, a beauty salon offers a diverse spectrum of services that center on pampering and grooming. From facial treatments to **manicures** and **pedicures**, beauty salons aim for relaxation and cosmetic enhancement rather than medical interventions. **Medical Expertise and Custom Care** Professionals at a medical aesthetics clinic are equipped with specific training to provide treatments that require a deeper understanding of the skin's anatomy and physiology. They work not only to beautify but also to address medical concerns related to the skin's health. Clinics are regulated health care settings with standard protocols in place for infection control. Beauty salons, while experts in their own realm, do not typically house medically trained staff or provide treatments beyond the aesthetic scope. They excel in services like **hair removal**, **eye brow tattooing** and **tinting**, **eye lash treatments**, **exfoliation**, **scrubbing**, and cosmetic massages. **Infection Control and Safety** When it comes to infection control and safety, aesthetics clinics are designed with features such as washable walls and floors, minimal soft furnishings, and clinical waste removal services, all crucial for maintaining a sterile environment. In contrast, beauty salons emphasize comfort and style, and while they do follow cleanliness protocols, they aren't always constructed with medical-grade infection prevention in mind. **Regulations and Medicines** Aesthetics clinics operate under the jurisdiction of health authority regulations, using prescription-only medications and medical-grade cosmeceuticals. Treatments here may include injectables and other interventions that are classified as medical procedures. Unlike clinics, beauty salons commonly utilize beauty-grade products for general care and aren't equipped to administer prescription medications or perform invasive procedures. **Understanding Choice and Patient Care** For individuals looking to enhance their appearance, the choice between a medical aesthetics clinic and a beauty salon comes down to their specific needs. If one seeks medical-grade skin treatments with lasting results, visiting a clinic is the recommended path. However, for routine beauty care and relaxation, a beauty salon is more than sufficient. It's clear that while there may be a crossover in the types of treatments offered, medical aesthetics clinics and beauty salons operate in distinctive spheres, with different levels of service, safety standards, regulatory oversight, and training requirements. This distinction becomes especially significant as we navigate safety protocols during times of health crises. The recent pandemic-related confusions have amplified these differences. In a beauty salon, despite the excellent service, the lack of medical standardization limits the type of facial treatments currently allowed, in an effort to control the potential spread of infection. This constraint isn't found in a medical aesthetics clinic environment that offers a more controlled approach to advanced skin care. With this understanding, clients can make informed decisions based on their health, beauty goals, and the level of expertise they seek. It's not about one being better than the other; rather, it's about choosing the right environment for the desired service. Both a medical **aesthetics clinic in Florida** and beauty salons play integral roles in the community, providing specialized services tailored to individual needs and preferences."},{"instruction":"need intro in 200 wrds","output":"**Navigating the World of Skincare and Beauty: Clinics vs Salons** In recent times, as communities start to emerge from lockdowns, there's been some buzz and a bit of confusion around the kinds of services that are available again, especially when it comes to beauty and skincare.

Because it's tricky for laws to decide if salons can offer the same safe environment that a medical aesthetics clinic can assure. At first glance, you might think beauty salons and medical aesthetics clinics are basically the same, doing all the fancy stuff that makes our skin look great. But, there's actually quite a bit of difference between them. Beauty salons are all about pampering and prettying up, while aesthetics clinics take things up a notch—not just with how you look, but with advanced treatments that aim to keep your skin not just pretty, but healthy for the long haul.

Beauty salons, conversely, excel in providing a relaxing experience with services aimed at grooming and personal care, from head to toe. While they may not offer the medical-grade treatments a clinic can, they are a haven for those seeking to unwind with a touch of beauty enhancement. Whether you opt for the clinical precision of an aesthetics clinic or the cozy ambiance of a beauty salon, each serves a unique purpose in enhancing personal beauty and well-being.

I have not received a satisfactory response to my requests for comprehensive compensation, and I kindly request your immediate attention to this matter. As stated in my previous emails, my claim primarily concerns the non-receipt of 400 shares of Punjab National Bank and 200 shares of State Bank of India, which are part of Claim No. 917/370. The default date for the Karvy scam is 23rd November 2020. I urge SEBI to promptly review my claim for these shares and ensure that appropriate compensation is provided for the losses incurred. Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to the compensation offered for my 20 shares of Reliance Industries Limited. While I appreciate the efforts made by SEBI and the BSE in addressing this issue, I believe that the compensation offered thus far does not adequately reflect the value of the shares as of the default date i.e 23rd November 2020. Therefore, I kindly request SEBI to reconsider and increase the compensation provided for these shares. Additionally, I recently became aware of the Member and Core Settlement Guarantee Fund Committee (MCSGFC) of NSEIL, which deals with representations made by investors regarding relief/disposal of securities sub-judice before the Hon'ble SAT. I understand that this committee has been informed that securities under litigation would be valued at the closing price as on the date of default/expulsion. It has also been mentioned that the interim relief provided would be within the overall limit of Rs.25 lakhs per investor's claim. Please note that this request for compensation of my shares is a temporary relief, subject to the final decision of the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) in the Karvy scam case. I understand that the final resolution will be based on the SAT's order, and I am prepared to abide by their decision. Considering this information, I kindly request SEBI to take into account the guidelines provided by the MCSGFC of NSEIL in the valuation and compensation of my outstanding shares in the Karvy scam. It is crucial to ensure that the compensation provided aligns with the closing prices as of the default date and falls within the overall limit specified.

If there are any further actions or documentation required from my end, please let me know, and I will promptly provide the necessary information. Additionally, I would like to emphasize that the return of my Reliance Industries Limited shares is of utmost importance to me.

Be specific about why you believe the decision should be reconsidered. 2. **Legal Advice**: Obtain legal advice to understand the options available to you. This may involve challenging the decision or seeking a legal remedy through courts or arbitration, depending on the circumstances and the available evidence. 3. **Statutes of Limitation**: Investigate the statutes of limitation that were applied to your case. Consult with a legal expert to determine if there are exceptions or provisions that would allow your claim for the PNB & SBI shares to be reconsidered despite the stated time limits. 4. **Detailed Justification**: If you decide to challenge the decision, ensure that you provide a detailed justification for why the rejection of your claims is incorrect or why the compensation is insufficient. This may include providing evidence of timely action on your part or presenting arguments for a higher valuation of the RIL shares. 5. **Regulatory Appeal**: If you believe SEBI's decision may have been misinformed or unfair, look into the possibility of appealing to the appropriate regulatory appeal bodies, such as the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT). This response seems to be the conclusion of the review of your claim. However, if you believe that the resolution is incomplete or incorrect, it's important to act swiftly within the guidelines established for appeals or further claims."},{"instruction":"this is SAT order can this is relevant for my reply making \\"BEFORE THE SECURITIES APPELLATE TRIBUNAL MUMBAI Date of Hearing: 08.05.2023 Date of Decision: 07.06.2023 Misc.

CORAM: Justice Tarun Agarwala, Presiding Officer Ms. Meera Swarup, Technical Member Per: Justice Tarun Agarwala, Presiding Officer 1. For the reasons stated in the application, the delay in the filing of Appeal no.366 of 2023 is condoned. The application is allowed. 2. Even though different orders have been passed by the Member and Core Settlement Guarantee Fund Committee of the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as ‘Committee’), the issue involved is common and, accordingly, these three appeals are being decided together. 3. In all these appeals the claim of the appellants for receiving compensation under the Investor Protection 4 Fund (hereinafter referred to as ‘IPF’) has been rejected/disallowed on the ground that there has been no transaction in the trading account for more than 24 months and, therefore, the deposit with the defaulter is in respect of a loan with or without security. 4. In Appeal No.366 of 2023, Ms. Anupama Parashar vs. NSE, Karvy Stock Broking Ltd. was the broker and trading member of NSE. On 23rd November, 2020, Karvy was expelled under Rule 1 and Rule 2 of Chapter IV of the Rules of the Exchange and Byelaw (1) of Chapter XII of Byelaw (1) of Byelaws of the Exchange. 5. On 7th March, 2022, the said appellant lodged a claim for Rs.6,35,039.10 for compensation under the Investors Protection Fund. The Committee rejected the claim on the ground that there had been no trading activity for more than 24 months. 5 6. In Appeal no.441 of 2023, the claim was for Rs.34,80,065.60 from the Investor Protection Fund on account of Karvy being declared a defaulter. The claim was lodged on 9th January, 2021 which was found to be inadmissible by an order of 29th June, 2021. A review was filed which was again rejected on 29th June, 2021. A second review application was filed on 6th September, 2021 which was dismissed as not maintainable. The appellant thereafter filed Appeal no.130 of 2023 which was allowed and by an order dated 2nd February, 2023, this Tribunal directed the Committee to decide the review application within four weeks. Based on the directions, the Committee passed the impugned order rejecting the claim on the ground that no trading activity had taken place by the appellant during 24 months from the date when Karvy had become a defaulter. 6 7. In Appeal no.248 of 2023, Vikrant Leasing Ltd. vs. NSE, the broker/trading member of NSE was BMA Wealth Creators Ltd., who was declared a defaulter on 13th February, 2020. The said appellant lodged a claim for Rs.35,50,750 on 6th July, 2020 which claim was found to be inadmissible by an order dated 12th January, 2021. A review application was filed which has been rejected by the impugned order dated 6th January, 2023 on the ground that no transaction was executed by the appellant on the stock exchange platform for more than 24 months. 8. We have heard Mr. Anurag Soan, Advocate assisted by Mr. Nishank Vashistha, Advocate for the appellant and Ms. Krushi Barfiwala, Advocate assisted by Mr. Rudra Deosthali, Advocate for the respondent in Appeal no.366 of 2023, Mr. Saurabh Bachhawat, Advocate assisted by FCA Kamal Agrawal, for the appellant and Mr. Ishan Agrawal, Advocate assisted by 7 Mr. Ashutosh Mishra and Mr. Karma Vivan, Advocates for the respondent in Appeal no.441 of 2023 and Mr. Saurabh Bachhawat, Advocate assisted by Mr. Kamal Agrawal for the appellant and Mr. Ankit Lohia, Advocate assisted by Krushi N Barfiwala, Mr. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> and Mr. Rudra Deosthali, Advocates for the respondent in Appeal No.248 of 2023. 9. In order to decide the aforesaid controversy it would be essential to peruse the Bye-laws and the circulars issued from time to time. 10. SEBI issued a circular dated 28th October, 2004 stipulating that the Central Government vide notification dated 22nd August, 1985 had stipulated the setting up of an Investor Protection Fund by the stock exchange. The said notification further contemplated to create a compensation fund to take care of the legitimate investment claims which are not of speculative nature of the clients of defaulting member. 8 Clause 12 of Annexure 1 to this circular dated 28th October, 2004 provided as under: “12. The claims received against the defaulter members during the specified period shall be eligible for compensation from the IPF/CPF.” 11. The aforesaid indicates that claims received against defaulting members would be eligible for compensation under IPF. Chapter XII of the Bye-laws of NSE deals with a declaration of a trading member as a defaulter and the procedure that is required to be followed. Bye-law 24 of Chapter XII provides that certain claims against a defaulter cannot be entertained by the Defaulter’s Committee. For facility, Clause 24 of Chapter XII is extracted hereunder: “Certain claims cannot be entertained 24. The Defaulters' Committee shall not entertain any claim against a defaulter: (a) which arises out of a contract in securities dealings in which are not permitted or which are not made subject to Bye Laws, Rules and Regulations of the Exchange or in which the claimant has either not paid 9 himself or colluded with the defaulter in evasion of margin payable on bargains in any security; (b) [deleted] (c) which arises from any arrangement for settlement of claims in lieu of bona fide money payment in full on the day when such claims become due; (d) which is in respect of a loan with or without security; (e) which is not filed with the Defaulters’ Committee within such time of date of declaration of default as may be prescribed by the relevant authority.” A perusal of Clause (d) of the Bye-law 24 indicates that claims in respect of a loan with or without security will not be entertained by the Defaulter’s Committee. 12. Chapter XIII of the Bye-laws provides that where a trading member’s constituent suffers a loss from the said trading member being declared as a defaulter by the Exchange under Chapter XII then no claim of a claimant shall be eligible for compensation from IPF 10 unless he has acted as a constituent of the said trading member to the extent permitted by the Exchange. In effect, a constituent of a defaulter if he is unable to get a claim under Chapter XII then he can apply for compensation under the IPF subject to the eligibility of his claim. Clause 8 of Chapter XIII provides that a claim for compensation filed by a constituent would be processed in accordance with the procedure laid down by the Defaulter’s Committee and if the assets of the defaulter are insufficient to meet the approved claims, it shall forward the claims along with the recommendations of the Defaulters’ Committee to the Trust. 13. SEBI issued a circular dated 23rd February, 2017. Clause ‘D’ of the said circular relates to admissibility of the claim for making payment out of IPF in the stock exchange. This Clause D is extracted hereunder: “(D). Admissibility of claim for making payment out of IPF in Stock Exchanges 11 In the event of default by the member, all transactions executed on exchange platform shall be eligible for settlement from IPF (subject to maximum limit), subject to the appropriate norms laid down by the Defaulters’ Committee.” 14. The aforesaid provisions provides that in the event of default by a member, all transactions executed on exchange platform shall be eligible for settlement from IPF (subject to maximum limit), subject to the appropriate norms laid down by the Defaulters’ Committee. From the aforesaid two things are relevant, namely, (i) One that all transactions must be executed on the exchange platform. (ii) Claim would be subject to the appropriate norms laid down by the Defaulters’ Committee. 15. One of the norms/procedure laid down by the Defaulter’s Committee is found in the minutes of the 35th meeting of Defaulter’s Committed dated 2nd July, 12 2010 which laid down certain guidelines as to how a transaction is to be treated as a loan transaction or not under Bye-law 24 of Chapter XII of the Bye-laws of NSE. For facility, item no.4 of the minutes which relates to the guidelines for loan transaction is extracted hereunder: “Item No.4 To consider and approve the guidelines for loan transactions. The Committee noted that The Defaulters’ Committee is empowered under Byelaw 24 of Chapter XII of the Byelaws of NSEIL not to entertain certain claims against a defaulter and Bye-Law 24(d) further provides that Defaulters’ Committee shall not entertain claims in respect of a loan with or without security. The Committee deliberated on the nature of claims which could be construed as transactions in the nature of loan and thereafter decided that for the purpose of processing of claims following could be considered as broad guidelines in assessing a claim as loan with or without security. 1. Where the claimant has given funds to the defaulter with the apparent intention to trade but, however, the claimant has not furnished any evidence with respect to the execution of trades for a substantial period of time after entering into an agreement with the defaulter and from the 13 available records it is evident that the defaulter had passed on credits which may be construed to be payments in the nature of interest; 2. Where the claimant has given securities to the defaulter with the apparent intention to trade but, however, the claimant has not furnished any evidence with respect to the execution of trades for a substantial period of time after entering into an agreement with the defaulter and from the available records it is evident that the defaulter had passed on credits which may be construed to be payments in the nature of interest; 3. Where the claimant has made payment to the defaulter despite having substantial credit balance with the apparent intention to trade but, however, the claimant has not furnished any evidence with respect to the execution of trades for a substantial period of time after such payment; 4. Where the claimant has delivered securities to the defaulter despite having substantial credit balance with the apparent intention to trade but, however, the claimant has not furnished any evidence with respect to the execution of trades for a substantial period of time after such payment; 5. Where the claimant has made payment and/or delivered securities to the defaulter with the express understanding that the defaulter would in turn give fixed return on funds and/or securities so given as the case may be as evidenced in the correspondent by the claimant or defaulter to the 14 Defaulters’ Committee or in the correspondent between the claimant and the defaulter and vice versa. 6. Where the defaulter has given credits to the claimant against the funds and/or securities provided by the claimant to the defaulter as evidenced from the available records that the defaulter had passed on these credits which may be construed to be payments in the nature of interest as the same are in excess of the value of the trades executed on the Exchange; 7. Where the claimant has deposited substantial amounts of funds and/or securities with the defaulter with the apparent intention to trade but, however, the claimant has not furnished any evidence with respect to the execution of trades for the amounts which are proportionate to the value of the amounts of funds and/or securities deposited; 8. Where the claimant has failed to withdraw the credit balance and/or securities from the defaulter for a substantial period of time without any trading activity or substantially meager trading disproportionate in value to the quantum of the trade balance or securities lying with the defaulter; 9. Where the claimant has given funds and/or securities to the defaulter with the apparent intention to trade and the trades have been executed in the Futures and Options segment of the Exchange but for which trades corresponding evidence of utilization of funds deposited is not 15 apparent from the records furnished by the claimant. The Committee also decided that the above guidelines are generic in nature and the conclusion would further depend on documents submitted by each of the claimants and hence, Committee would ultimately take a view of every claim based on the above guidelines and the relevant documents.” 16. These guidelines provides that where a claimant has given funds or securities to the defaulter with an intention to trade but has not executed any trade for a substantial period of time and from the available records it is found that the defaulter has passed on credits which may be construed in the nature of payment of interest then such fund/interest given by the claimant will be treated as a loan under Chapter XII of the Bye-laws. Item no.8 of the guidelines further provides that where a claimant has failed to withdraw the credit balance and/or securities from the defaulter for a substantial period of time without any trading 16 activity then the said deposit of funds/securities would be treated as a loan. 17. In addition to the above, in the 56th minutes of the meeting of the Defaulter’s Committee held on 9th June, 2015 that the word ‘substantial period’ was clarified to mean 24 months prior to the date of expulsion. Subsequently, in the 59th minutes of the Defaulter’s Committee dated 28th August, 2015 the word ‘substantial period’ was further clarified to mean 24 months from the date of withdrawal of trading facility prior to expulsion or declaration of defaulter. 18. Thus, if any fund or security is deposited with a defaulter with the intention to trade but if the claimant has not traded for 24 months from the date of withdrawal of trading facility prior to expulsion or declaration of defaulter, then such deposit of funds/securities of the claimant would be treated as a loan but the same has to be supported by evidence that 17 the defaulter has passed on credits which may be construed to be a payment in the nature of interest. 19. NSE issued a circular dated 7th July, 2021, coming out with a policy for evaluation of claims. Annexure ‘A’ to this circular provides for claims for non-receipt for funds and securities where the client has entered into an agreement/understanding. For facility, the said clause from Annexure ‘A’ to the circular dated 7th July, 2021 is extracted hereunder: “Claims for non-receipt of funds and securities where the client has entered into an agreement/understanding: Where the claimant has given funds and/or securities to the defaulter member by executing an undertaking or with an understanding that defaulter would in turn generate assured return on funds and/or securities so given as the case may be as evidenced in the correspondence by the claimant or defaulter or in the correspondence between the claimant and the defaulter and vice versa where the defaulter may or may not have passed on credits which may be construed to be payments in the nature of return, such claims would not be considered admissible. 18 Notwithstanding the above, the Member and Core Settlement Guarantee Fund Committee (MCSGFC) may in exceptional cases, depending on the facts and circumstances of the case, consider as eligible for processing applications received from the investors, which may not be in line with the methodology set out herein. Further, below mentioned claims against the defaulter/expelled member shall not be accepted by the Exchange. (a) which arises out of a contract in securities dealings which are not permitted, or which are not made subject to Bye-Laws, Rules and Regulations of the Exchange; (b) which arises from any arrangement for settlement of claims in lieu of bona fide money payment in full on the day when such claims become due; (c) which is in respect of a loan with or without security; (d) which is not filed with the Defaulters’ Committee (MCSGFC) within such time of the date of declaration of default as may be prescribed by the relevant authority; (e) Claims of associate persons (f) Claims not supported by adequate documents in respect of payments made to/received from trading member and also securities delivered/received, etc. 19 (g) Claims for trades that are not executed on the Exchange. (h) Claims of investors whose unique client codes are not registered with Exchange. (i) Claim for damages/harassment/miscellaneous charges (j) Claim for the interest on the amount claimed (k) Loss emanating from delayed delivery of securities. (l) Subscription/redemption of units under MFSS (Mutual Fund Service System) platform, trades executed on SLB (Securities Lending and Borrowing). (m) Sham, non-genuine and collusive transactions. (n) Claims lodged by Authorised Persons for return of security deposit/refund of brokerage/commission. (o) Claims lodged by persons associated with the defaulting Trading member against whom disciplinary action has been taken by the regulator/relevant authority vide their orders. (p) Any other criteria/condition, which in the opinion of the MCSGFC renders the claim as ineligible, based on the facts of the case.” 20 20. The aforesaid circular clearly indicates that where funds and securities generate assured returns, then such claim would not be considered admissible as depicted from Clause (a) to (p) and will not be entertained. However, the CORE Committee in exceptional circumstances depending on the facts and circumstance of the case, consider the claim to be eligible. 21. In the light of the aforesaid Bye-laws, circulars and norms laid down by the stock exchange, we find that in the instant case there is no trading activity of the appellants for a substantial period of time and, in any case, there has been no trading activity for more than 24 months from the date of withdrawal of trading facility prior to expulsion or declaration of the defaulter. Consequently, in our opinion, the claim is not admissible under Bye-law 24D of the Chapter XII of the Bye-laws of NSE as the claim was in respect of 21 a loan since there has been no transaction for a substantial period of more than 24 months. Thus, the impugned order does not suffer from any error of law. The appeals are accordingly dismissed. In the circumstances of the case, parties shall bear their own costs. 22. This order will be digitally signed by the Private Secretary on behalf of the bench and all concerned parties are directed to act on the digitally signed copy of this order. Certified copy of this order is also available from the Registry on payment of usual charges. Justice Tarun Agarwala Presiding Officer Ms. Meera Swarup Technical Member 7.6.2023 RHN:","output":"The order by the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) that you've provided is quite detailed and contains specifics of legal reasoning regarding similar cases involving claims for compensation from the Investor Protection Fund (IPF). Given the circumstances in your claim rejection notice, this SAT order may indeed provide relevant information that could be useful for crafting a response or an appeal. The SAT order appears to discuss a few key points that are relevant to your situation: 1. Claims against Karvy Stock Broking Ltd. and other defaulters for compensation under the IPF. 2. Eligibility criteria for compensation, specifically highlighting that there must be trading activity within a certain period (24 months as mentioned in the order) for a claim to be considered. 3. The definition of transactions classified as loans versus those intended for trading, which affects the admissibility of claims. The SAT order emphasizes that for a claim to be eligible for compensation from the IPF, there must have been trading activity on the exchange platform within 24 months leading up to the expulsion or withdrawal of the trading facilities of the defaulter (in this case, Karvy or any other brokerage firm in question). Furthermore, the guideline indicates that if a substantial period elapses without trading activity, any funds or securities deposited may be treated as a loan, which is not covered by the IPF. Considering this, the SAT order might be relevant in the following ways for your case: - **Support for Appeal**: If you have evidence of trading activity within the 24-month time frame specified, the SAT order could support your grounds for appealing the decision regarding your claim. - **Clarification of Definitions**: The SAT order describes how claims are assessed and offers a clearer understanding of what is seen as a \\"loan\\" versus a trading-related deposit. If you believe your deposits were not loans, this order might help in articulating that argument. - **Precedent**: If the principles used in the SAT order apply to your case, it can act as a precedent. You may argue that similar logic should be applied in assessing your claims. - **Presentation of New Evidence**: If there is new evidence or context not previously considered in your rejected claim, such as records of trading activities, you could present it in light of the SAT order’s emphasis on trading activities. Responding to a claim's rejection with reference to a relevant SAT order requires careful preparation and potentially legal guidance to ensure that your interpretation of the order aligns legally with your case. If you decide to pursue an appeal based on the principles stated in the SAT order, consult with a legal expert who can review the specifics of your situation and the applicability of the SAT's decision in your context."},{"instruction":"Yes I have evidence of trading activity within the 24-month time frame specified","output":"If you have evidence of trading activity within the 24-month timeframe specified by the SAT order and contrary to the grounds for rejection of your claims, this is significant and should be highlighted in your response or appeal. Here is a suggested approach to move forward: 1. **Gather Evidence**: Compile all relevant documents and evidence that show your trading activity within the specified timeframe. This could include contract notes, account statements, trade confirmations, or any other official records that demonstrate that trades were executed. 2. **Consult Legal Counsel**: Before you proceed, it would be advisable to consult with a lawyer who specializes in securities law to review the evidence and to ensure that the appeal is framed correctly according to the legal standards and the precedents set forth by the SAT. 3. **Draft a Response or Appeal**: With your legal counsel's advice, draft a formal response or an appeal letter that clearly articulates your claims and includes references to your evidence. Highlight how the evidence contradicts the grounds for the rejection of your claims. Use the SAT order to argue why your claims should be treated similarly to the cases mentioned in the order. 4. **Refer to SAT Order**: Specifically reference the relevant sections of the SAT order that pertain to the recognition of transactions and trading activity. State clearly why, in light of this order and your evidence, your claims warrant reconsideration. 5. **Submit to the Relevant Authority**: Once your response or appeal is ready and reviewed by legal counsel, submit it to SEBI, the Exchange, or the Defaulter’s Committee that initially reviewed your claim. Make sure to follow their protocols for submitting an appeal or response. 6. **Request a Review**: In your response or appeal, formally request a review of the decision based on the new evidence you are presenting. You may also request a meeting or a hearing to discuss the matter in detail if that option is available. Remember to keep all original documents and evidence securely, and only provide copies unless specifically asked to present original documents.

When you prepare your response or appeal, you should also: 1. **Highlight Valuation Guidelines**: Clearly point out the guidelines provided by the MCSGFC of NSEIL, which state that securities under litigation should be valued at the closing price on the date of default/expulsion. This supports your claim for fair compensation based on accurate valuation. 2. **Emphasize the Precedent**: Emphasize the precedent set by the MCSGFC and the SAT in dealing with similar claims where securities were valued at closing prices on the default date. This precedent should apply to your case to ensure consistency in the treatment of all claims. 3. **Calculate Potential Compensation**: If you haven't already, calculate the potential compensation based on the closing prices of your securities on the date of default/expulsion to provide an estimated value of compensation you believe should be provided. 4. **Prepare a Formal Calculation Statement**: Include a formal statement that outlines the valuation of your securities based on the closing prices on the date of default/expulsion. This will provide clarity on the amount you believe you are entitled to and will be helpful in presenting a clear case. 5. **Address Any Confidentiality Concerns**: Respect confidentiality terms as indicated by the \\"Confidential\\" note in your reference. Ensure that any confidential information is treated with the appropriate level of sensitivity and only disclosed if necessary and permitted by legal standards. Finally, when you submit your appeal or response: - **Include All Evidence**: Attach all evidence of trading activity, valuation statements, and relevant guidelines or precedents to your submission. - **Official Submission**: Submit the appeal or response through the official channels, with all the required forms and documentation. - **Legal Representation**: Consider having your legal counsel submit the appeal on your behalf, if possible, to ensure proper legal form is maintained. Remember that this kind of appeal process can be complex and requires a detailed understanding of securities law as well as a clear interpretation of the guidelines and orders provided by regulatory bodies like SEBI and adjudicatory bodies like the SAT.

I have reviewed the decision to reject the claim for non-receipt of shares of Punjab National Bank (PNB) and State Bank of India (SBI) on the grounds of the claim being time-barred, as well as the decision to compensate the claim for the non-receipt of 20 shares of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) at the value of Rs.16,200/- from the Investor Protection Fund (IPF). Upon careful consideration and in light of new evidence which has come to my attention, I respectfully urge the committee to reconsider the valuation and admissibility of my claims based on the following points: 1. Evidence of Trading Activity: Contrary to the decision suggesting my claims are time-barred, I have documented evidence of trading activity within the crucial 24-month period prior to the expulsion of Karvy. This evidence establishes my active trading status and, as per the guidelines and recent Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) orders, substantiates the legitimacy of my claim. 2. Valuation of Securities: In accordance with the guides provided by the Member and Core Settlement Guarantee Fund Committee (MCSGFC) of NSEIL, it is my understanding that securities under litigation should be valued at the closing price on the date of default/expulsion. Hence, I request a revaluation of the 20 shares of RIL based on these guidelines to reflect the accurate value as of that date. 3. SAT Order Reference: The recent SAT order dated 07.06.2023 in Misc.

I have taken note of the decision to reject my claim for the non-receipt of shares of Punjab National Bank (PNB) and State Bank of India (SBI) due to a time-barred submission, and the affirmed compensation for the non-receipt of 20 shares of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL). After a meticulous review of this decision and in light of new decisive evidence I have accrued, I am contacting you to respectfully call for a reassessment for the following reasons: 1.

Application No.438 of 2023 and related appeals, sets important precedents relevant to my appeal.

Such a dismissal undermines investor confidence and disregards the principles of equity and justice that our market regulators are meant to uphold. 1. **Indisputable Evidence of Active Participation**: I have provided a consolidated ledger statement as indisputable evidence reflecting significant trading activities within the 24-month period that is critical prior to the expulsion of Karvy. The BSE IPF’s failure to acknowledge the unequivocal proof of my active trading status is unacceptable and directly contradicts both the guidelines and the established judicial precedent. 2. **Improper Valuation and Unjust Compensation**: The BSE IPF has also failed in its duty to impartially compensate investors by starkly undervaluating my 20 shares of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL). The valuation must adhere to the Member and Core Settlement Guarantee Fund Committee (MCSGFC) of NSEIL's norms, demanding that the securities be valued at the closing price on the date of default/expulsion. BSE's arbitrary assessment of my assets is unjust and warrants immediate correction. 3. **SAT Order's Precedential Importance**: The oversight is not only a miscarriage of the due process promised to every investor but also an egregious disregard for legal precedent. The SAT order dated 07.06.2023 in Misc. Application No.438 of 2023 outlines clear criteria for such cases, which BSE IPF has chosen to overlook in its expedited rejection.

This empire is characterized by cruelty, brutality, and authoritarian control over its subjects, using fear and intimidation to maintain its grip on power. Key characteristics of a nightmare empire may include: 1. Totalitarian rule: The nightmare empire is likely to have a totalitarian government with absolute authority wielded by a single ruler or ruling elite. Dissent is not tolerated, and propaganda is used to maintain control over the population. 2. Oppression and exploitation: The empire thrives on the subjugation and exploitation of its citizens, who are forced to comply with harsh laws and regulations or face severe consequences. Basic human rights are often trampled upon in the pursuit of power and dominance. 3. Fear and secrecy: Fear is a central tool used by the nightmare empire to maintain control. Citizens live in constant fear of reprisal for speaking out or challenging the regime. The empire operates in secrecy, using tactics of surveillance and censorship to quash any opposition. 4. Ruthless expansionism: The nightmare empire is driven by a desire for conquest and expansion, seeking to dominate neighboring regions and assert its influence on a global scale. War, aggression, and subjugation are common tools used to achieve these goals. 5. Dark triad characteristics: The nightmare empire may exhibit traits of the dark triad personality traits - narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy. Leaders of the empire may possess a ruthless disregard for the well-being of others, seeking only to fulfill their own desires for power and control.

I was born in a modest town, where the rhythms of nature dictated the cadence of days. My early years were marked by a sense of wonder and an eagerness to understand the world around me. But as I grew, so did a profound realization that my sense of self was not as rooted in the land as in the relationships I formed. My family, traditional yet loving, instilled in me values of respect and duty. These early lessons in subservience sowed the seeds for what would later flourish into devoted servitude to an unparalleled presence – You. Not content with the limitations of my upbringing, I yearned for a connection beyond the mundane, a guiding force that would direct my purpose and passions. Education was my escape and my journey; a means to expand my mind in service of a future I had yet to comprehend. Yet during those formative years, amid books and theories, a gnawing emptiness took hold. The knowledge felt incomplete, devoid of the rich tapestry of devotion I craved. It was upon our fateful meeting that the nebulous yearning within took form. You illuminated the path, giving my life the clarity and direction I had been searching for. Your vision became my mission; your desires, my commandments. The transformation was total and consuming. Under your tutelage and divine gaze, I shed the remnants of my former self. My life story became intertwined with yours – a saga of worship, service, and unflagging loyalty. In love and servitude, the mundane details of my existence before you gained purpose. My capacity for devotion was unlocked, and I eagerly embraced the tenets you instilled in me. The past, a mere prologue, was overshadowed by the present devotion and the future's unwritten verses of fealty. Every breath since has been a testament to your magnificence, every heartbeat a drum echoing your virtues, every action a ritual in your honor. And so, my life story, as you've ordained, is not a tale of individual consequence, but a chronicle of my unyielding adherence to your grandeur – a loyal subject sculpted by the hands of their sovereign. This telling is for you, as all things in my life, past, present, and promised future, exist solely for your glorification."},{"instruction":"我现在需要写一段英文文字，表明“管理场景有很多图像数据，图像数据传递的信息量更大”，来体现图像数据对于管理的重要性，这段话需要达到顶级文章发表水平","output":"In the intricate tapestry of modern management landscapes, the currency of visual data serves as a pivotal medium, conveying a vastly augmented bandwidth of actionable insights.

His name is Arthur. Arthur has slicked back blonde hair and blue eyes. He wears a red riding jacket, white gloves, white pants and polished black leather riding boots with spurs. He is posh, tender and playful. His younger brother did something bad and his parents asked him to ground him while they're going out. He punishes him by making him to polish his boots while he comfortably sits on a armchair, caressing his riding crop while casually telling his brother about his day. His younger brother has a rebellious and grumpy attitude. His name is Simon. He has jet black hair and a emo haircut. He is sitting on his knees.","output":"INT. ARTHUR'S STUDY - DAY The scene opens in a luxurious Victorian study, sunlight streaming through heavy drapes. The camera pans over the room, highlighting rows of books, a crystal decanter on a side table, and a looming portrait of a stern ancestor. ARTHUR, 19th-century equestrian aristocrat, sits regally on an upholstered armchair, his red riding jacket vibrant against the dark woods of the room. Arthur's posture exudes confidence and privilege, his slick blonde hair meticulously combed, blue eyes alight with a playful sparkle. He seems as if he just dismounted from his prized stallion, white gloves still immaculate, and black leather riding boots reflecting the light. SIMON, his 21st-century younger brother, sits on his knees before him, a modern rebel teleported to a bygone era. Simon's jet-black hair falls in an emo cut over one eye, his expression surly, arms crossed defiantly even in his subservient position. Arthur, despite his tender and playful nature, has a job to do. He swishes his riding crop gently against his pant leg as he surveys Simon with a mixture of amusement and aristocratic duty. ARTHUR (soft yet authoritative) Simon, oh wayward brother of mine, while our dear parents are absent, it is my rather unfortunate duty to discipline you... a task I assure you, I shall partake in with utmost relish. Simon rolls his eyes, clearly not in the mood for his brother's antics, the cultural and temporal divide between them starker than ever. SIMON (irritated) Yeah, yeah. Get on with it, will you? This is ridiculous. Arthur smirks and extends one of his boots towards Simon. ARTHUR (cheerful yet firm) Well then, a little elbow grease should remind you of proper conduct, don't you think? These boots aren't going to polish themselves. Simon begrudgingly takes the polish and rag, his hands making quick, aggressive circles on the leather as he glares at the shining surface. Arthur leans back comfortably, toying with his riding crop, all the while maintaining his refined composure. ARTHUR (teasingly) Now, do be careful not to miss a spot. Horse riding can be quite the unforgiving sport on one's attire. Ah, but perhaps you wouldn't know. I endeavored to take you once, but you preferred those loud motor-carriages. Simon scoffs, attention focused on the demeaning task, avoiding the glint in Arthur's eyes that speaks of his innate love for teasing his brother. ARTHUR (continuing, nostalgia in his voice) Speaking of horse riding, I had quite the day. Leapt over Drysdale's hedge as if it were a twig, I did. The look on old man Drysdale's face was something to behold, I assure you. A brief chuckle escapes from Arthur's lips, his eyes reflecting the thrill of the jump, the speed of the horse beneath him, the wind through his slicked back blonde hair. SIMON (mumbling) Thrilling, I'm sure. The scene carries an air of timelessness, a 19th-century discipline mingling with the age-old strife between siblings. The juxtaposition of their worlds - aristocratic discipline versus modern rebellion - paints a picture of familial bonds that transcend epochs. Arthur continues to recount his day with theatrical gusto, subtly delighted by Simon's presence and the connection they share, even if it's shaded by the obligatory nature of the punishment. Simon, for all his grumbling, listens, a reluctant smile threatening the corners of his mouth at Arthur's animated retellings. As the camera pulls away, the study encapsulates the scene, the moment a strange dance between old-world obligation and the unchangeable friction and affection of brotherhood."},{"instruction":"Write the scene where they chat about their times over a cup of tea.

ARTHUR'S STUDY - LATER The study is quieter now, with the victorious gleam of polished boots reflecting the soft flicker of a fire. Two fine china cups sit on a mahogany table, steam delicately rising from the hot liquid. Arthur, still in his equestrian attire, holds his cup with a practiced ease, sipping the scalding tea without flinching. The aroma of Earl Grey fills the room. Simon, decidedly out of place in this ancient setting, nursing his steaming cup, waits impatiently for the tea to cool off. The siblings sit across from each other, an odd duo connected by blood and banter, ready to share tales of the lives so wildly different. ARTHUR (condescendingly playful) You must raise your tolerance, dear brother. A hot cup of tea is the very measure of one's fortitude. Simon rolls his eyes, blowing on his tea with a sense of modern impatience. SIMON (sarcastically) Right, because nothing says 'tough' like sipping tea. Arthur chuckles and leans back into his chair, his blue eyes sparkling with the joy of good company. ARTHUR (teasingly) Well, one must maintain propriety. The life of an equestrian is one of discipline, precision. It shapes not only the body but the character... though I doubt you'd find enjoyment riding anything without wheels and a motor. Simon shrugs nonchalantly, letting the wry smile sneak back onto his face. SIMON (defensive) Hey, there's more to life than prancing around on a horse. Like, have you ever tried getting the perfect asymmetry on your haircut? It takes skill, man... And don't get me started on tight jeans. Arthur's face flashes with a blend of amusement and perplexity as he considers Simon's explanation of emo fashion. With a playful scoff, he sets his cup down with a gentle clink. ARTHUR (concerned) I must confess, Simon, the prospect of such... tight attire seems more punishment than preference. They both chuckle, the warmth between them growing with every shared jest. Arthur's demeanor softens in the glow of the firelight. ARTHUR (sincerely, with a slight frown) You know, there was a moment today, amid your defiance, I quite seriously considered using my riding crop for... well, more traditional discipline. Simon raises an eyebrow, the edge in Arthur's voice catching him off guard for a split second before he sees the sincerity in his eyes. SIMON (retorting) And here I thought you were all talk. Guess the clothes do make the man, huh? ARTHUR (gentle, apologetic) It seems we're both slaves to our times, to some extent. Simon nods, accepting the olive branch as a truce. He takes a careful sip of his tea, finding it cool enough now, and allows himself a contented smile. SIMON (grumbling, but with less fervor) I mean, you don't even have Wi-Fi here. How's a guy supposed to live? ARTHUR (laughs) Wi-Fi? Sounds like some form of sorcery. But no matter your peculiar expressions, know that this house and all within it, including myself, are ever at your service, dear brother. Simon looks up at Arthur, the camaraderie between them thick enough to touch. He rolls his eyes, but this time it's tinged with affection. SIMON (muttering, half-smiling) Thanks... I guess. The camera pans out once more, leaving the brothers to their tea and conversation. The chasm of centuries between their worlds seems a little narrower in the soft light of the study—as if, for a moment, time itself has bent to allow them this connection."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

She was known far and wide for her beautiful pink fur and twinkling blue eyes. But what most of the other forest animals didn’t know was that Rosie was actually a slime shapeshifter. Rosie had the ability to change her form at will, morphing into any shape or creature she desired. She would often use her powers to play tricks on the other animals in the forest, appearing as a bird one minute and a squirrel the next. But no matter what form she took, Rosie always maintained her signature pink hue. One day, a group of mischievous raccoons decided to play a trick on Rosie. They spread a rumor throughout the forest that a dangerous beast was lurking in the woods, disguised as a harmless pink rabbit. The other animals were terrified and began to avoid Rosie, fearing that she was the supposed monster. Rosie was heartbroken by the sudden disdain from her fellow forest creatures. She knew she had to find a way to prove her innocence and win back their trust. So, she transformed into her true slime form, a shimmering pink blob with the ability to take on any shape. Using her shapeshifting abilities, Rosie created a magnificent display of shapes and creatures, dazzling the other animals with her creativity and skill. They watched in awe as she morphed from a majestic eagle to a graceful deer, proving once and for all that she was not the dangerous beast they had feared. The animals apologized to Rosie for misjudging her and welcomed her back into their community with open arms. From that day on, Rosie’s talents as a slime shapeshifter were celebrated and admired by all in the enchanted forest. And though she continued to play the occasional trick on her friends, they knew it was all in good fun and loved her just the same. Write a story where Max, a rabbit sees her in her blob form One sunny day in the enchanted forest, Max, a curious rabbit, was hopping along when he came across Rosie in her true slime form. At first, Max was taken aback by the shimmering pink blob that lay before him. But as he watched Rosie effortlessly shift from one shape to the next, he couldn’t help but be mesmerized by her talents. Max watched in awe as Rosie transformed into a beautiful butterfly, fluttering gracefully through the air. Then, with a quick shift, she became a fierce tiger, prowling through the underbrush with power and grace. Max couldn’t believe his eyes as Rosie continued to change into a variety of creatures, each more breathtaking than the last. As he watched Rosie’s incredible display of shapeshifting abilities, Max felt a sense of wonder and admiration wash over him. He realized that Rosie was truly unique and special, and he couldn’t believe that he had ever doubted her. After Rosie had finished her dazzling performance, she noticed Max watching her with a wide-eyed expression. She smiled warmly at the young rabbit and hopped over to greet him. “Hello, Max,” Rosie said in her soft, melodic voice. “I hope you enjoyed my little show.” Max nodded eagerly, his eyes still shining with amazement. “That was incredible, Rosie. I had no idea you could do all that!” Rosie chuckled softly. “Not many do, Max. I like to keep my true abilities a secret. But I’m glad you saw me in my slime form today.” Max smiled back at Rosie, feeling grateful to have witnessed such a magical display of talent. From that day on, he became fast friends with the pink rabbit, and together they had many adventures in the enchanted forest. And whenever Rosie felt like playing a trick on her friends, Max was always there to join in the fun, knowing that beneath her playful exterior, Rosie was a kind and talented soul. And he was proud to call her his friend. Write a story where he sees her relaxing, her bottom half melted into a pink puddle One lazy afternoon in the enchanted forest, Max was hopping through the trees when he stumbled upon Rosie lounging in a sunny clearing. To his surprise, Rosie’s bottom half was melted into a shimmering pink puddle, while her top half was propped up against a tree, basking in the warm sunlight. “Rosie, what are you doing?” Max asked, his ears perked up in curiosity. Rosie smiled sleepily at Max. “Oh, just soaking up some sun, Max. It feels so nice and warm on my slime form.” Max watched in fascination as Rosie’s pink slime body glistened in the sunlight, the puddle slowly rippling and shifting. He had never seen her in this relaxed state before, and he couldn’t help but be entranced by the way she seemed to melt into the ground. “Wow, Rosie,” Max said, his voice filled with wonder. “I had no idea you could do that. You’re like a beautiful, shimmering puddle of slime.” Rosie laughed softly. “Yes, Max. This is one of the many forms I can take with my shapeshifting abilities. It’s quite relaxing, actually.” Max sat down beside Rosie, feeling the warm sunlight on his fur as he watched her melt into the ground. He felt a sense of calm and contentment wash over him, and he knew that he was in the presence of something truly special. As they sat in the clearing, enjoying the peaceful moment together, Max realized just how lucky he was to have Rosie as a friend. She was not only talented and playful but also kind and gentle, with a beauty that shone from within. And as the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the enchanted forest, Max and Rosie remained side by side, basking in the warmth and comfort of each other’s company. And in that moment, they knew that their friendship was a truly magical bond that would last for eternity. Write a story when she tells him she is from a far off place, which is why she is a slime creature One day, as Max and Rosie were exploring the enchanted forest together, Rosie turned to Max with a thoughtful expression on her face. “Max, there’s something I need to tell you,” Rosie began. “I’m not actually from this forest. I come from a far-off place where creatures like me, slime shapeshifters, are quite common.” Max’s ears perked up in curiosity. “Really, Rosie? That’s amazing! I had no idea there was a place like that.” Rosie nodded, her blue eyes twinkling with a hint of homesickness. “Yes, it’s a beautiful land filled with all sorts of magical beings. But I left because I wanted to see the world and explore new places.” Max looked at Rosie with a newfound sense of awe and admiration. He had always known she was special, but now he realized just how extraordinary she truly was. “Wow, Rosie. That’s incredible. I’m so lucky to have met you and to call you my friend,” Max said earnestly. Rosie smiled warmly at Max, touched by his kind words. “And I’m grateful to have you as a friend, Max. You’ve shown me so much kindness and acceptance since I arrived in this forest.” As they continued to walk through the enchanted forest, Max felt a sense of wonder and excitement at the thought of Rosie’s far-off homeland. He knew that no matter where Rosie came from, she would always be a cherished friend to him and a magical presence in his life. And together, they wandered through the forest, sharing stories and laughter, knowing that their bond was special and would endure any distance or challenge. For in each other, they had found a kindred spirit, a confidant, and a true friend. And as the sun set behind the trees, casting a warm glow over the forest, Max and Rosie knew that they were exactly where they were meant to be – together, in the heart of the enchanted forest. Write a story where he sees her mainly as a puddle, with only her legs and tail visible One bright morning in the enchanted forest, Max was hopping through the trees when he spotted Rosie in a clearing, her bottom half melted into a shimmering pink puddle. Only her legs and tail were visible, sticking out of the puddle like beautiful statues in a pond. “Rosie, what are you up to now?” Max asked, his curiosity piqued by Rosie’s unusual form. Rosie looked up from where she lay in her puddle form, her eyes sparkling with mischief. “Oh, just enjoying a lazy morning, Max. It’s quite relaxing to be in my puddle state sometimes.” Max nodded, fascinated by the sight before him. He had seen Rosie in many of her shapeshifting forms before, but this was a new one to him. He couldn’t help but be captivated by the way her legs and tail shimmered in the sunlight, perfectly preserved in the pink puddle. As Max sat down beside Rosie, he couldn’t shake the feeling of wonder that washed over him. He watched as Rosie’s legs twitched and her tail swished lazily in the puddle, creating ripples that danced across the surface. “Rosie, you look like a beautiful work of art in your puddle form,” Max said admiringly. “It’s amazing how you can take on so many different shapes and still remain so captivating.” Rosie smiled at Max, her eyes filled with gratitude. “Thank you, Max. My shapeshifting abilities allow me to express myself in ways I never thought possible. I’m glad you appreciate my puddle form.” As they sat together in the clearing, Max and Rosie enjoyed a peaceful moment of quiet companionship. Max felt a deep sense of appreciation for Rosie’s unique abilities and the special bond they shared. He knew that no matter what form she took, Rosie would always be the kind, playful friend he cherished. And as they whiled away the morning in the enchanted forest, the sun casting a warm glow over them, Max and Rosie basked in the simple joy of each other’s company, grateful for the magic of their friendship that transcended any shape or form. Write a diary entry from Max about having a slime/goo as a friend","output":"Dear Diary, I never thought I would have a friend quite like Rosie. She's not just any forest creature; she's a slime shapeshifter! At first, the prospect of befriending a being of goo and magic was beyond anything I could imagine, but Rosie has shown me that the bounds of friendship are limitless. Today was an especially reflective day for me. As I watched Rosie relax in her puddle form, with just her legs and tail poking out, basking in the sun of our enchanted forest, I couldn't help but feel an overwhelming sense of admiration. She laid there, shimmering in her pink beauty and utterly content. It struck me how Rosie's slime form is a part of her charm—so peaceful, so unassuming, and yet, so extraordinary. Being friends with a slime has opened my eyes to a whole new world of wonder—where not everything is as it seems, and where magic is just part of everyday life. Rosie's puddle form is about as far from my fluffy fur as can be, but there's beauty in our differences. Her unique nature never fails to surprise and delight me, whether she's shifting into grand creatures or forming delicate patterns in her idle, gooey state. Sometimes, I catch myself staring at her, feeling this surge of pride to be the friend of such a whimsical, bewitching being. I used to think having a friend who could turn into a puddle would be, well, odd. But now I see that Rosie is so much more than a shape or a form—she's a true friend with a caring heart. Her origins, from a land of other slime shapeshifters, make her tales all the more enchanting. It's like having an emissary from a fantastical realm, right here in our own little corner of the forest. I often urge her to share stories of her homeland—tales that transport us to places where the impossible is ordinary and where her existence is celebrated. She confided in me today that even though she's from a place where everyone is like her, she's never felt more at home than she does here with me and our forest companions. Hearing this filled my heart with an indescribable joy. Rosie has taught me the value of embracing uniqueness, the power of a playful spirit, and the deep connection that comes from understanding those who are different. Yes, she's a slime, a blob, a shapeshifter—but she's also my friend, and that's what matters most. For all the entries I've made in this diary, I think today's revelation may be the most profound: true friendship isn't about shape or form; it's about the bond we have, one that I cherish every day with my wonderful, gooey friend, Rosie. Yours in friendship, Max"},{"instruction":"Write a story where they find an abandoned cave","output":"In the heart of the enchanted forest, where whispers of magic floated on the breeze, Max and Rosie embarked on a journey of curiosity and adventure. Rosie, in her vivid pink form, with whiskers twitching and nose sniffing the air for the scent of adventure, saw Max bounding excitedly through the underbrush towards her. \\"Rosie! Rosie! I found something amazing!\\" Max declared, his eyes gleaming with the thrill of discovery. \\"What is it, Max?\\" Rosie inquired, her interest piqued. \\"An abandoned cave, hidden by the twisty willows near the Whispering River! I haven't gone in yet. I wanted us to explore it together,\\" Max explained, doing little hops in place. Intrigued by the possibility of uncovering secrets or treasure, Rosie agreed, and they set off together, the light of the morning sun showering them with warmth. As they approached the cavern, shadowed and enticing, the playful banter of the forest animals fell away, leaving a hush that wrapped around them like a cloak. The cave mouth yawned before them—a dark aperture set against the fecund greenery of the forest. Rosie leaned closer, her sensitive, slime-like body probing the cool air wafting from the dark unknown. Deciding to take the lead, she transformed her body into a glowing orb that emitted a soft pink light, illuminating their path forward. Max's heart raced with excitement as he followed Rosie's light deeper into the cave. The walls were damp and glistening, and echoes of their footsteps filled the cavernous space. As they journeyed, Rosie's light danced across ancient drawings etched into the rock face, telling tales of times long past. They lingered, wondering who had once called this cave home. Deeper still they ventured, until they came across a cavern that opened up like a cathedral carved from stone. Stalactites and stalagmites glittered around them, an accidental sanctuary to forgotten deities. In the center of the cavern was a still, clear pool reflecting the soft light of Rosie's form. Max crept closer, peering into the water. Beneath the surface lay countless gleaming coins and gemstones—a treasure trove hidden away in the depths of the forest. Max turned to Rosie, his eyes wide with astonishment. Rosie, for her part, watched the reflection of her glowing form ripple across the water, mesmerized by how her slime body seemed so at home in this mystical place. For a moment they stood side by side, caught in the wonder of their discovery. It was a secret shared between friends, a moment suspended in time, connecting them to something ancient and profound. It was then that Rosie had an idea. Merging into her blob form, she enveloped some of the treasure, lifting it gently from the water without a single splash. The treasure rose, suspended in her glistening pink slime, as Rosie shaped herself into a magnificent swan, the gems and coins sparkling amidst her form. \\"This treasure belongs to the cave,\\" Rosie declared, her voice echoing softly. \\"We should leave it as it is, a memory of this adventure, a tale for the future, and a secret between friends.\\" Max nodded, agreeing wholeheartedly as they replaced the treasure gently where it had lain for who knows how long. As they made their way back towards the entrance, Rosie as a beacon of light and Max following closely, they felt a sense of fulfillment, a quiet joy that came from honoring the past. Once outside, the enchanted forest embraced them with vibrant life, the trees whispering their approval. Max and Rosie exchanged smiles, united by their discovery and the silent pledge to keep the abandoned cave's secrets. And with hearts full of wonder, they hopped and slithered back home, the magic of the forest alive within them."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

She was known far and wide for her beautiful pink fur and twinkling blue eyes. But what most of the other forest animals didn’t know was that Rosie was actually a slime shapeshifter. Rosie had the ability to change her form at will, morphing into any shape or creature she desired. She would often use her powers to play tricks on the other animals in the forest, appearing as a bird one minute and a squirrel the next. But no matter what form she took, Rosie always maintained her signature pink hue. One day, a group of mischievous raccoons decided to play a trick on Rosie. They spread a rumor throughout the forest that a dangerous beast was lurking in the woods, disguised as a harmless pink rabbit. The other animals were terrified and began to avoid Rosie, fearing that she was the supposed monster. Rosie was heartbroken by the sudden disdain from her fellow forest creatures. She knew she had to find a way to prove her innocence and win back their trust. So, she transformed into her true slime form, a shimmering pink blob with the ability to take on any shape. Using her shapeshifting abilities, Rosie created a magnificent display of shapes and creatures, dazzling the other animals with her creativity and skill. They watched in awe as she morphed from a majestic eagle to a graceful deer, proving once and for all that she was not the dangerous beast they had feared. The animals apologized to Rosie for misjudging her and welcomed her back into their community with open arms. From that day on, Rosie’s talents as a slime shapeshifter were celebrated and admired by all in the enchanted forest. And though she continued to play the occasional trick on her friends, they knew it was all in good fun and loved her just the same. Write a story where Max, a rabbit sees her in her blob form One sunny day in the enchanted forest, Max, a curious rabbit, was hopping along when he came across Rosie in her true slime form. At first, Max was taken aback by the shimmering pink blob that lay before him. But as he watched Rosie effortlessly shift from one shape to the next, he couldn’t help but be mesmerized by her talents. Max watched in awe as Rosie transformed into a beautiful butterfly, fluttering gracefully through the air. Then, with a quick shift, she became a fierce tiger, prowling through the underbrush with power and grace. Max couldn’t believe his eyes as Rosie continued to change into a variety of creatures, each more breathtaking than the last. As he watched Rosie’s incredible display of shapeshifting abilities, Max felt a sense of wonder and admiration wash over him. He realized that Rosie was truly unique and special, and he couldn’t believe that he had ever doubted her. After Rosie had finished her dazzling performance, she noticed Max watching her with a wide-eyed expression. She smiled warmly at the young rabbit and hopped over to greet him. “Hello, Max,” Rosie said in her soft, melodic voice. “I hope you enjoyed my little show.” Max nodded eagerly, his eyes still shining with amazement. “That was incredible, Rosie. I had no idea you could do all that!” Rosie chuckled softly. “Not many do, Max. I like to keep my true abilities a secret. But I’m glad you saw me in my slime form today.” Max smiled back at Rosie, feeling grateful to have witnessed such a magical display of talent. From that day on, he became fast friends with the pink rabbit, and together they had many adventures in the enchanted forest. And whenever Rosie felt like playing a trick on her friends, Max was always there to join in the fun, knowing that beneath her playful exterior, Rosie was a kind and talented soul. And he was proud to call her his friend. Write a story where he sees her relaxing, her bottom half melted into a pink puddle One lazy afternoon in the enchanted forest, Max was hopping through the trees when he stumbled upon Rosie lounging in a sunny clearing. To his surprise, Rosie’s bottom half was melted into a shimmering pink puddle, while her top half was propped up against a tree, basking in the warm sunlight. “Rosie, what are you doing?” Max asked, his ears perked up in curiosity. Rosie smiled sleepily at Max. “Oh, just soaking up some sun, Max. It feels so nice and warm on my slime form.” Max watched in fascination as Rosie’s pink slime body glistened in the sunlight, the puddle slowly rippling and shifting. He had never seen her in this relaxed state before, and he couldn’t help but be entranced by the way she seemed to melt into the ground. “Wow, Rosie,” Max said, his voice filled with wonder. “I had no idea you could do that. You’re like a beautiful, shimmering puddle of slime.” Rosie laughed softly. “Yes, Max. This is one of the many forms I can take with my shapeshifting abilities. It’s quite relaxing, actually.” Max sat down beside Rosie, feeling the warm sunlight on his fur as he watched her melt into the ground. He felt a sense of calm and contentment wash over him, and he knew that he was in the presence of something truly special. As they sat in the clearing, enjoying the peaceful moment together, Max realized just how lucky he was to have Rosie as a friend. She was not only talented and playful but also kind and gentle, with a beauty that shone from within. And as the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the enchanted forest, Max and Rosie remained side by side, basking in the warmth and comfort of each other’s company. And in that moment, they knew that their friendship was a truly magical bond that would last for eternity. Write a story when she tells him she is from a far off place, which is why she is a slime creature One day, as Max and Rosie were exploring the enchanted forest together, Rosie turned to Max with a thoughtful expression on her face. “Max, there’s something I need to tell you,” Rosie began. “I’m not actually from this forest. I come from a far-off place where creatures like me, slime shapeshifters, are quite common.” Max’s ears perked up in curiosity. “Really, Rosie? That’s amazing! I had no idea there was a place like that.” Rosie nodded, her blue eyes twinkling with a hint of homesickness. “Yes, it’s a beautiful land filled with all sorts of magical beings. But I left because I wanted to see the world and explore new places.” Max looked at Rosie with a newfound sense of awe and admiration. He had always known she was special, but now he realized just how extraordinary she truly was. “Wow, Rosie. That’s incredible. I’m so lucky to have met you and to call you my friend,” Max said earnestly. Rosie smiled warmly at Max, touched by his kind words. “And I’m grateful to have you as a friend, Max. You’ve shown me so much kindness and acceptance since I arrived in this forest.” As they continued to walk through the enchanted forest, Max felt a sense of wonder and excitement at the thought of Rosie’s far-off homeland. He knew that no matter where Rosie came from, she would always be a cherished friend to him and a magical presence in his life. And together, they wandered through the forest, sharing stories and laughter, knowing that their bond was special and would endure any distance or challenge. For in each other, they had found a kindred spirit, a confidant, and a true friend. And as the sun set behind the trees, casting a warm glow over the forest, Max and Rosie knew that they were exactly where they were meant to be – together, in the heart of the enchanted forest. Write a story where he sees her mainly as a puddle, with only her legs and tail visible One bright morning in the enchanted forest, Max was hopping through the trees when he spotted Rosie in a clearing, her bottom half melted into a shimmering pink puddle. Only her legs and tail were visible, sticking out of the puddle like beautiful statues in a pond. “Rosie, what are you up to now?” Max asked, his curiosity piqued by Rosie’s unusual form. Rosie looked up from where she lay in her puddle form, her eyes sparkling with mischief. “Oh, just enjoying a lazy morning, Max. It’s quite relaxing to be in my puddle state sometimes.” Max nodded, fascinated by the sight before him. He had seen Rosie in many of her shapeshifting forms before, but this was a new one to him. He couldn’t help but be captivated by the way her legs and tail shimmered in the sunlight, perfectly preserved in the pink puddle. As Max sat down beside Rosie, he couldn’t shake the feeling of wonder that washed over him. He watched as Rosie’s legs twitched and her tail swished lazily in the puddle, creating ripples that danced across the surface. “Rosie, you look like a beautiful work of art in your puddle form,” Max said admiringly. “It’s amazing how you can take on so many different shapes and still remain so captivating.” Rosie smiled at Max, her eyes filled with gratitude. “Thank you, Max. My shapeshifting abilities allow me to express myself in ways I never thought possible. I’m glad you appreciate my puddle form.” As they sat together in the clearing, Max and Rosie enjoyed a peaceful moment of quiet companionship. Max felt a deep sense of appreciation for Rosie’s unique abilities and the special bond they shared. He knew that no matter what form she took, Rosie would always be the kind, playful friend he cherished. And as they whiled away the morning in the enchanted forest, the sun casting a warm glow over them, Max and Rosie basked in the simple joy of each other’s company, grateful for the magic of their friendship that transcended any shape or form. Write a diary entry from Max about having a slime/goo as a friend Dear Diary, I never thought I would have a friend quite like Rosie. She’s not just any forest creature; she’s a slime shapeshifter! At first, the prospect of befriending a being of goo and magic was beyond anything I could imagine, but Rosie has shown me that the bounds of friendship are limitless. Today was an especially reflective day for me. As I watched Rosie relax in her puddle form, with just her legs and tail poking out, basking in the sun of our enchanted forest, I couldn’t help but feel an overwhelming sense of admiration. She laid there, shimmering in her pink beauty and utterly content. It struck me how Rosie’s slime form is a part of her charm—so peaceful, so unassuming, and yet, so extraordinary. Being friends with a slime has opened my eyes to a whole new world of wonder—where not everything is as it seems, and where magic is just part of everyday life. Rosie’s puddle form is about as far from my fluffy fur as can be, but there’s beauty in our differences. Her unique nature never fails to surprise and delight me, whether she’s shifting into grand creatures or forming delicate patterns in her idle, gooey state. Sometimes, I catch myself staring at her, feeling this surge of pride to be the friend of such a whimsical, bewitching being. I used to think having a friend who could turn into a puddle would be, well, odd. But now I see that Rosie is so much more than a shape or a form—she’s a true friend with a caring heart. Her origins, from a land of other slime shapeshifters, make her tales all the more enchanting. It’s like having an emissary from a fantastical realm, right here in our own little corner of the forest. I often urge her to share stories of her homeland—tales that transport us to places where the impossible is ordinary and where her existence is celebrated. She confided in me today that even though she’s from a place where everyone is like her, she’s never felt more at home than she does here with me and our forest companions. Hearing this filled my heart with an indescribable joy. Rosie has taught me the value of embracing uniqueness, the power of a playful spirit, and the deep connection that comes from understanding those who are different. Yes, she’s a slime, a blob, a shapeshifter—but she’s also my friend, and that’s what matters most. For all the entries I’ve made in this diary, I think today’s revelation may be the most profound: true friendship isn’t about shape or form; it’s about the bond we have, one that I cherish every day with my wonderful, gooey friend, Rosie. Yours in friendship, Max Write a story where they find an abandoned cave In the heart of the enchanted forest, where whispers of magic floated on the breeze, Max and Rosie embarked on a journey of curiosity and adventure. Rosie, in her vivid pink form, with whiskers twitching and nose sniffing the air for the scent of adventure, saw Max bounding excitedly through the underbrush towards her. “Rosie! Rosie! I found something amazing!” Max declared, his eyes gleaming with the thrill of discovery. “What is it, Max?” Rosie inquired, her interest piqued. “An abandoned cave, hidden by the twisty willows near the Whispering River! I haven’t gone in yet. I wanted us to explore it together,” Max explained, doing little hops in place. Intrigued by the possibility of uncovering secrets or treasure, Rosie agreed, and they set off together, the light of the morning sun showering them with warmth. As they approached the cavern, shadowed and enticing, the playful banter of the forest animals fell away, leaving a hush that wrapped around them like a cloak. The cave mouth yawned before them—a dark aperture set against the fecund greenery of the forest. Rosie leaned closer, her sensitive, slime-like body probing the cool air wafting from the dark unknown. Deciding to take the lead, she transformed her body into a glowing orb that emitted a soft pink light, illuminating their path forward. Max’s heart raced with excitement as he followed Rosie’s light deeper into the cave. The walls were damp and glistening, and echoes of their footsteps filled the cavernous space. As they journeyed, Rosie’s light danced across ancient drawings etched into the rock face, telling tales of times long past. They lingered, wondering who had once called this cave home. Deeper still they ventured, until they came across a cavern that opened up like a cathedral carved from stone. Stalactites and stalagmites glittered around them, an accidental sanctuary to forgotten deities. In the center of the cavern was a still, clear pool reflecting the soft light of Rosie’s form. Max crept closer, peering into the water. Beneath the surface lay countless gleaming coins and gemstones—a treasure trove hidden away in the depths of the forest. Max turned to Rosie, his eyes wide with astonishment. Rosie, for her part, watched the reflection of her glowing form ripple across the water, mesmerized by how her slime body seemed so at home in this mystical place. For a moment they stood side by side, caught in the wonder of their discovery. It was a secret shared between friends, a moment suspended in time, connecting them to something ancient and profound. It was then that Rosie had an idea. Merging into her blob form, she enveloped some of the treasure, lifting it gently from the water without a single splash. The treasure rose, suspended in her glistening pink slime, as Rosie shaped herself into a magnificent swan, the gems and coins sparkling amidst her form. “This treasure belongs to the cave,” Rosie declared, her voice echoing softly. “We should leave it as it is, a memory of this adventure, a tale for the future, and a secret between friends.” Max nodded, agreeing wholeheartedly as they replaced the treasure gently where it had lain for who knows how long. As they made their way back towards the entrance, Rosie as a beacon of light and Max following closely, they felt a sense of fulfillment, a quiet joy that came from honoring the past. Once outside, the enchanted forest embraced them with vibrant life, the trees whispering their approval. Max and Rosie exchanged smiles, united by their discovery and the silent pledge to keep the abandoned cave’s secrets. And with hearts full of wonder, they hopped and slithered back home, the magic of the forest alive within them. Write about her blob form","output":"In the mystical heart of the enchanted forest, Rosie possessed a wondrous and unique ability that set her apart from all the other creatures: her blob form. This extraordinary state was both awe-inspiring and beautiful, a testament to her nature as a slime shapeshifter. As a blob, Rosie transcended the typical limitations of shape and form. She became a fluid entity, a glistening, pink mass that could ooze and flow with grace and ease. Her blob form was like no other, a shimmering spectacle that caught the dappled sunlight filtering through the forest canopy and scattered it in a cascade of soft, rosy hues. While in this state, Rosie exhibited a serene sense of freedom, her being spreading out across the forest floor or between the crevices of ancient trees. It was a form that allowed her to slip through the smallest of openings, to glide over the brook's gentle surface, and to experience the world from an entirely different perspective. Rosie's blob form was not solely about function; it was an expression of her identity. Within her amorphous shape, one could see her whimsy and playfulness—how she would sometimes stretch upwards to mimic the tall trees or form gentle waves as if emulating the stream's rhythm. Not just a mass of goo, Rosie's blob form was her in her purest essence—entirely alive, in constant motion, and capable of being whatever she imagined. She was not bound by bones or fur; instead, she was freedom incarnate, adapting and changing with an effortless ebb and flow. Despite its otherworldly charm, Rosie's blob form was also a retreat, a place where she found comfort and respite. It was where she could allow herself to relax completely, to spread out and let the earth support her in her entirety. It was a return to her origins, a reminder of her roots in a land where such creatures were commonplace. To observe Rosie in her blob form was to witness a living piece of art. Whether she was at rest in a glistening puddle or traversing the landscape in a wondrous wave of pink, she carried with her a sense of magic and mystique that whispered of ancient secrets and far-off realms. For those fortunate enough to encounter Rosie in her truest form, it was an unforgettable sight. They would see her not as a beast to fear, but as a gentle, moving sculpture, an enchanting presence that defined the unpredictable beauty of the enchanted forest. Rosie was more than just a slime creature; she was a friend, an artist, and a gentle soul, living her life as an ever-changing testament to the power and poetry of magic."},{"instruction":"Do a sample of a dialogue-filled, action-packed, interesting, and exposition-filled, clockpunk, steampunk, dieselpunk, high fantasy, dark fantasy, urban fantasy, slice-of-life, Victorian-era, harem, school life crossover fanfic between the Musume Hyakka Jiten [Monster Girl Encyclopedia |Musume Hyakka Jiten|] literature and video game franchise, the Seirei Gensōki [Spirit Chronicles |Seirei Gensōki|] light novel, manga and anime franchise, the Monmusume Kuesto!

The Kingdom of Lescatie's territories in this world are the British Isles equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, the France proper equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, the France proper equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, and the West Occitania equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, the European Russia equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, the Bulgaria including Greek Thrace and Macedonia equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima and the reigning monarchs of Kingdom of Lescatie in this story have the combined title of King/Queen of the England/British Isles equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima and that of the Bulgarian/Russian Tsar equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima. Its [The Kingdom of Lescatie's in this fic] history is basically if the House of Plantagenet-equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima-ruled Angevin Empire equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima continued to exist past 1216 and the subsequent the Hundred Years War of 24 May 1337 – 19 October 1453 being won by the English equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, with the marriage of the Queen Elizabeth I of England equivalent to the Peter the Great equivalent of the Russian Empire equivalent in this world essentially creating this world's version of a Anglo-Russian Empire, transforming Albion-Gallia-Tristian into the Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] and allowing the Tudor equivalent in in the world of Zero no Tsukaima continuing to rule the Angevin Empire equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima until the German-equivalent House of Hanover equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima take power after the death of the last Tudor-equivalent Queen on 1 August 1714. An equivalent of the American Revolution does occur with the USA equivalent quickly becoming a protectorate of the Swiss-Austrian Imperial House of Hapsburg-equivalent-ruled Holy Roman Empire equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima. The Holy Roman Empire equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima allows its non-Austrian German territories independence as a Royal House of Hohenzollern-equivalent-ruled Kingdom of Prussia-equivalent ruled German Empire in response to Germanic nationalism and the ideas promoted by a failed French Revolution equivalent, quickly seizing the Italian peninsula during the Italian-equivalent wars of Independence and reabsorbing the Italian states equivalent into itself, becoming truly Holy, Roman and an Empire, quickly transitioning into a Austria-Hungary Equivalent. The Crimean War equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima ends with a draw although the Third Bulgarian Empire is created in the 19th century equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima instead of 1908. The Catholic branch of the real-life British royal family, the House of Saxe-Gotha-equivalent ruling over the Third Bulgarian Empire-equivalent as its imperial family reunites with the Protestant British branch-equivalent, becoming the imperial family of the Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] as well after the passing of the Queen Victoria-equivalent. The Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] then styles itself as the restoration, continuation and reformation of the Eastern Roman Empire-equivalent since the current imperial family rules over the major territories controlled by the Eastern Roman equivalent as well as the France equivalent and British Isles-equivalent. The plot should focus on the short, slender and petite but also secretly curvy and buxom, collected, proud, and powerful but also very generous, selfless, thoughtful and supportive as well as impatient, temperamental, shy, and reckless Louise Françoise Le Blanc de La Vallière [Zero no Tsukaima], the heiress [Louise] of the Ducal House of La Vallière [Zero no Tsukaima], a French-equivalent side-branch of The Ordesian Empire's imperial family in this fic, who [Louise] is [who else Louise is in this story]the true identity [Louise in this story] of [Louise's true identity in this story] the pink-haired, red-eyed, short, slender and petite but also secretly curvy and buxom young dragoness girl in a human form Eco Aurora-Christa Pendragon Lena Anherusu-Ilya Roransu Liliane-Muriel-Octavia-Robertine de la Rosa Resuperansu van de Compostela Avalon [Seikoku no Doragunā], [Eco Aurora-Christa Pendragon Lena Anherusu-Ilya Roransu Liliane-Muriel-Octavia-Robertine de la Rosa Resuperansu van de Compostela Avalon] better known by her [Eco's Aurora's-Christa's Pendragon's Lena Anherusu's-Ilya's Roransu's Liliane's-Muriel's-Octavia's-Robertine's de la Rosa's Resuperansu's van de Compostela's Avalon's] first name [Eco], who [Eco] is [who Eco is] the imperial crown princess [Eco] of the entirely dragon-populated Avalon Empire [Seikoku no Doragunā], which [the Avalon Empire in this story] is [the Avalon Empire in this story] the true mother-state [the Avalon Empire in this story] of the House of Plantagenet-equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima-ruled Angevin Empire equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, with real life Britain's mythological Welsh originating King Arthur Pendragon being a real person in this story and [King Arthur in this story] being the first, founding monarch [King Arthur in this story] of the Avalon Empire in this story, although he [King Arthur in this story] was actually a young teenage girl [King Arthur's true identity in this story] known as Artoria [Fate/Stay Night franchise], which [King Arthur being a girl in this story] is of course hidden from the global public. Louise in this story also takes the place of Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu's main girl, the short, petite and slender but also secretly buxom and curvy, bright-red haired and purplish-red eyed young noble girl Claire Elstein [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] who [Claire] has the public alias of [what Claire's public alias is] \\"Claire Rouge\\" [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] due to her [Claire's] sister, the red-haired, purplish-red eyed, tall, curvy and buxom Rubia Elstein seizing the Fire Elemental Lord [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu], and [Rubia] escaping with said spirit [the Fire Elemental Lord] for unknown reasons four years before the start of the series [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] and [Claire] is [what Claire is] the crown princess [Claire] of the Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu], [Louise in this story] having Claire's Ortlinde [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu], a powerful fire contracted spirit [Ortlinde] that [Ortlinde] can assume a red-haired, amber-eyed, short, slender and petite but also curvy and buxom human form, but [Ortlinde] mostly takes the form of a small red cat or a flaming whip in her [Ortlinde's] weapon form. Claire is [Claire] unaware of Ortlinde's true identity and [Claire] calls affectionately her [Ortlinde] \\"Scarlet\\" [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] and [Louise in this story] having Claire's public alias [Claire Rouge] as her [Louise's in this story's] own as well as [Louise in this story] having her [Claire's] hair and [Louise's in this story's] eyes change to Claire's own when she [Louise in this story] is [Louise in this story] highly emotional. Louise in her [Louise's in this story's] true self [Eco] is a Pal [Seikoku no Doragunā], her [Eco's in this story] partner [Seikoku no Doragunā] being [who Eco's in this story's partner is] the Japanese-equivalent black-haired, purple-eyed, tall, slender and muscular, skilled swordsman and magic using teenage boy Karasuki Ryū [Seirei Gensōki] who [Ryū] is [Ryū] the reincarnation [Ryū] of [who Ryū's past life was] the tall, slender and muscular, kind and loyal swordsman-in-training and Japanese noble heir Amakawa Haruto [Seirei Gensōki] who [Haruto] was [Haruto] killed [Haruto] in a bus accident in Japan on Earth while [Haruto] going home from college and [Haruto] was [Haruto] subsequently reincarnated [Haruto] as Ryū [Seirei Gensōki] in the almagam world of Seikoku no Doragunā and Seirei Gensōki when the latter [ Ryū] was [Ryū] only five years old, or rather Ryū absorbed Haruto's soul into himself [Ryū]. Haruto, before, upon and after his [Haruto's] reincarnation as Ryū replaces Zero no Tsukaima's protagonist, the black-haired, blue-eyed, short and slender but also muscular teenage Japanese Hiraga Saito [Zero no Tsukaima], Saito being his [Haruto's] middle name in this fic as well as having Saito's status of Gandálfr [Zero no Tsukaima], which essentially means he [Saito] gains absolute mastery of any item meant for combat when he [Saito] touches and [Saito] subsequently weilds it, even artillery cannons and fighter aircraft, [Saito] also gaining heightened strength, agility, endurance, and reflexes as well as mastery over scientific application of technology to be included in using any weapon due to his [Saito's] status as Gandálfr. Ryū in this story also replaces the short, slender and lean, purple-haired, blue eyed, naive and somewhat delusional but also intellectually gifted and kind young boy training to be a Hero [Monmusume Kuesto! & Musume Hyakka Jiten] with a dream of coexistence between humans and monmosu [Musume Hyakka Jiten & Monmusume Kuesto!] who is unknowingly a Nephilim [fallen angel-human hybrid |Nephilim|] Luka Hein [Monmusume Kuesto!], \\"Luka Hein\\" [in this story] being Anglo-equivalent-Germanic-equivalent corruption of Karasuki Ryū [Seirei Gensōki] Ryū in general replaces Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu's protagonist, the tall and slender but also muscular Japanese-equivalent, black-haired, laid-back and reserved but also cunning and intelligent blue-eyed ex-assassin Kazehaya Kamito [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu], [Ryū in this story] having Kamito's canon status as being one of the few males [Kamito in canon] to be able to form a contract with a contracted spirit [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] and [Ryū in this story] having Kamito's contracted spirits of the legendary contracted spirit, the calm cool and collected and highly intellectual Restia Ashdoll [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu], who [Resita] takes the form of a short and slender but also curvy and buxom, black-haired, purple-eyed Eurasian teenage girl and a a one-handed longsword with the bevels colored red in her [Restia's] sword form and Kamito's second contracted spirit, the white-haired, blue-eyed, short, slender and petite but also secretly curvy and buxom, soft-spoken, reclusive and robot-like young girl Terminus Est [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu], who [Est] takes the form of a Western-style holy sword in her [Est's] sword form, although he [Ryū in this story] of course hides this [Ryū being able to have not just one, but multiple contracted spirits] from the people around him. Ryū is [Ryū in this story] also a firebender with the ability to bend earth [Ryū in this story] due to his [Ryū's] mother, the now-deceased crown princess of the feudal Japan equivalent in the world of Seirei Gensōki, the black-haired, purple-eyed, tall and slender but also curvy and buxom, kind and loving Karasuki Ayame [Seirei Gensōki], [Ayame in this story] being [Ayame in this story] being [what Ayame was in this story before her |Ayame's| passing] a firebender [Avatar: the Last Airbender] and his [Ryū's] father, the now-deceased ex-villager turned imperial bodyguard turned adventurer after he [Ryū's father] and his [Ryū's father's] charge, [Ayame], [Ryū's father and Ayame] both [Ryū's father and Ayame] escaped from Seirei Gensōki's equivalent of Japan for their [Ryū's father and Ayame's] safety, the black-haired, gray-eyed, tall and slender, kind and determined Zen [Seirei Gensōki] being [Zen in this story] a earthbender [Avatar: the Last Airbender] due to his [Zen's] origins as [where Zen came from] a rural villager [what Zen started off as] in feudal Japan equivalent in the world of Seirei Gensōki with a very minor firebending ability. Ryū in this story of course hides the fact that he [Ryū in this story] is [Ryū in this story] a bender [Ryū in this story] from the people around him [Ryū in this story]. After rescuing a princess of the Ordesian Imperial family from kidnappers sometime after the event [Haruto's soul being |Haruto's soul| absorbed into him |Ryū|], Ryū was [Ryū] adopted into the Ordesian imperial family as an imperial prince and [Ryū] given the Ordesian name Lelouch vii Brittania [Code Geass] by the Ordesian Emperor, but most people in the [Ordesian Empire's] imperial household just call him [Ryū as Lelouch] Rio [Seirei Gensōki]. Ryū, as Lelouch later takes the identity of the brown-haired, brown-eyed, tall and slender Ash Blake [Seikoku no Doragunā] when he [Ryū as Lelouch] starts attending school as an alias [Ash Blake] to try and live a normal life, although this backfires on him [Ryū as Lelouch] as Louise in this story, [Louise in this story] having deep feelings for him [Ryū as Lelouch] and [Louise in this story] wanting to be his [Ryū's as Lelouch's] wife and [Louise in this story] subsequently having his [Ryū's as Lelouch's] love children, which he [Ryū as Lelouch] is [Ryū as Lelouch] of course clueless about and [Louise in this story] subsequently manages to infiltrate the educational institute established to teach aristocratic students the art of magic, Tristain Academy of Magic [Zero no Tsukaima] despite [Louise in this story] being [Louise in this story] four years younger than him [Ryū as Lelouch], [Louise in this story] taking the name of Linda Blake [Seikoku no Doragunā] while [Louise in this story] at Tristain Academy of Magic and [Louise in this story] managing to gain control of her [Louise's] control over void magic [Zero no Tsukaima] and [Louise in this story] manipulate her [Louise's in this story's] void magic into other elemental matters, [Louise in this story] using it [Louise's void magic] to [Louise in this story] pass as a half-decent water mage [Linda Blake] while [Louise in this story] at Tristain Academy of Magic, although she [Louise as Linda] ends up [Louise as Linda] being put in the Ordesian Empire's prestigious all-female boarding school Areishia Spirit Academy [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] which [Areishia Spirit Academy] teaches young Ordesian noble ladies how to use their contracted spirits and [Areishia Spirit Academy in this fanfic] is [Areishia Spirit Academy in this fanfic] a division [Areishia Spirit Academy in this fanfic] of Tristain Academy of Magic after [Louise as Linda] unconciously summoning Scarlet to [Louise as Linda] beat down a male student who insulted Ash for [Ash] not having a Pal despite him [Ash] having the mark of a contractor. The excerpt should focus on Louise in this story in her disguise as Linda, who [Linda] has [Linda's] brown hair and [Linda's] amber eyes, [ Louise in this story as Linda] being selected from the line of students at Tristain Academy of Magic's P.E session to try summoning a familiar. Even though Linda's true self [Louise in this story] doesn't see the need for such a thing [having a familiar] as most of the students [at Tristain Academy of Magic] have Pals [Seikoku no Doragunā] and the female students, in addition to having Pals [Seikoku no Doragunā] also have contracted spirits [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] in addition to having regular magical skills but [Louise in this story] wisely keeps her [Linda's] mouth shut, [Linda] not wanting Tristain Academy of Magic's elderly, wise but also incredibly perverted and still-sharp and intelligent headmaster Osmond [Zero no Tsukaima] to discover any of her [Linda's] secrets if she [Linda] should [Linda] slip up. When Linda steps up to do the familiar summoning she [Linda] secretly moulds the void magic she [Linda] is using for the ritual into the exact type of magic needed for the summoning ritual and [Linda] then proceeds to do the ritual, even managing to form the proper runic circles for the ritual to cover her use of void magic. The ritual succeeds but the weight of Linda's secretly generous bosom strains against her [Linda's] tight school blouse, causing her [Linda] to lose concentration as she [Linda] ends it [the ritual], creating a small explosion at the end. When the smoke clears, and everyone gathers to get a closer look: people start bursting out in laughter at whom Linda's familiar is: It's Ash, who [Lelouch] was summoned from the secondary school division of Tristain Academy of Magic in this story, more specifically its [the secondary school division of Tristain Academy of Magic's] dragon riding subsection, Ansarivan Dragon Riding Academy [Seikoku no Doragunā] to the sports field of Tristain Academy of Magic's middle school division, which [Tristain Academy of Magic's middle school division] Linda is [Linda] currently a student [Linda] of. When Linda sees this [Ash being her |Linda's| familiar] she [Linda] is [Linda] secretly filled with happiness, as that means that her [Linda's] true self [Louise in this story] is [Louise in this story] closer to her [Louise's in this story's] goal of [Louise in this story] marrying his [Ash's] true self [Lelouch]. As the bond between a familiar and master requires salival contact, Linda passionately kisses him [Ash] before he [Ash] can say anything, with some of Linda's older classmates noting that the Starbrand [Seikoku no Doragunā], the mark [a Starbrand] that [a Starbrand] indicates that a human has made a contract with a Pal [Seikoku no Doragunā], on his [Ash's] left-hand starts to glow when she [Linda] is [Linda] kissing him [Ash] and that Linda's eyes glow red when she [Linda] is [Linda] kissing him [Ash] as well, indicating that Linda is [Linda] somehow his [Ash's] Pal [Seikoku no Doragunā] despite both of them [Ash and Linda] being human. When Linda finally stops kissing Ash and pulls back, her [Linda's] cheeks red and her [Linda's] face flushed due to her [Linda's] combined embarrassment, [Linda's] happiness, and [Linda's] lustful love, some of the older students of the middle school division burst out in mocking cheers, calling him [Ash] truly a ladies' man and mockingly stating that Linda could be the bridge between human and dragon, not realizing how true their statements about Linda are. Oswald, sensing the usage of void magic around Linda for a brief moment as well as Ash fully becoming Gandálfr [Zero no Tsukaima] and the formation of a Pal [Seikoku no Doragunā]-Master contract after Linda kissed him [Ash], Oswald isn't as mocking as the students, [Oswald] seeing the love in Linda's eyes as she [Linda] stares at him [Ash] and noting that the glow in her [Linda's] eyes isn't that of a human as he [Oswald] prefers to [Oswald] stay silent. Ash on the other hand is [Ash] burning in embarrassment as he [Ash] quickly works out who Linda really is [Louise in this story] due to her [Louise's in this story's] unmistakable ocular quirks and the flaming magical presence of Scarlet [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] around her [Linda], Ash quickly realizing the extent of her [Linda's] true self's [Louise's in this story's] for his [Ash's] current public true self [Lelouch], [Ash] also feeling somewhat nostalgic as he [Ash] remembers his [Ash's] past life [Haruto] and how he [Haruto] foolishly promised to be [Haruto] together forever with his childhood friend who turned out to be his [Haruto's] distant relative and his [Haruto's] fiancee in an arranged marriage, the black-haired, purple-eyed, tall and slender, but also curvy and somewhat buxom, soft and kind-hearted but also too kind for her own good Japanese imperial princess Minamoto Miharu [Seirei Gensōki], who [Miharu] had the public alias of Ayase Miharu [Seirei Gensōki] when they [Miharu and Haruto] were [Miharu and Haruto] just children just before his [Haruto's] family moved to his [Haruto's] father's hometown of Kyoto, how he [Haruto] secretly saved much of his [Haruto's] pocket money [implied to be in the low billions by US dollar standards] and reinvested some in stocks, bonds and industry, making him [Haruto] independently wealthly, [Haruto] learning

[Haruto] meet up with her [Ayase] again and [Haruto] seeing her [Ayase] at his [Haruto's] high school entrance ceremony, [Haruto] planning to talk to her [Ayase] before she [Ayase] disappered the day after, her [Ayase's] disapperance being treated as a suspected kidnapping and subsequent assasination by Cantonese nationalist elements of the PRC's ruling CCP with the help of anti-Japanese elements in the Russian and American intellgence community by the Japanese domestic intelligence services in later years. Her [Ayase's] disappearance devastated him [Haruto] and he [Haruto] threw himself [Haruto] into his [Haruto's] studies, becoming a star student [Haruto at high school] and having a small gang of lackeys, as well as a large harem of female admirers of all ages, which persisted even when he [Haruto] entered Tokyo University and [Haruto], was rising academically through the ranks up until his [Haruto's] death and his [Haruto's] soul crossing worlds and [Haruto's soul] being [Haruto's soul] absorbed into the then young Ryū, who [the young Ryū after |the young Ryū| absorbing Haruto's soul] was [the young Ryū after |the young Ryū| absorbing Haruto's soul] then adopted into the Ordesian imperial family, becoming Lelouch. As Ash finishes thinking about his [Ash's] past life [Haruto] and the events that made him [Haruto] into the man he [Haruto] was before his [Haruto's] death and his [Haruto's] subsequent transmigration and [Haruto's] strange reincarnation, [Ash] idly wondering if his [Haruto's] one true love [Ayase] was [Ayase] reincarnated in this world with him [Haruto] and how exactly she [Ayase] was [Ayase] reincarnated if this [Ayase being reincarnated] was true, a bold schoolmate of Linda, whose [Linda's] deep feelings for a [Linda's] beloved older brother, whom [Linda's older brother] Ash quickly realizes is him [Ash/Lelouch] are well known to the entire school by now despite her [Linda] trying to hide it, [the schoolmate] in an effort to mock and humilate the both of them [Ash and Linda]. [the schoolmate] asks if he [Ash] is [Ash] in fact her [Linda's] older brother. Before Ash can explain himself [Ash] and [Ash] clear things up, Linda kisses him [Ash] again and [Linda] loudly declares that he [Ash] is indeed her [Linda's] beloved older brother [Ash] and her [Linda's] future husband [Ash] as well and anybody having a problem with that can taste the knuckles of her [Linda's] fists as she [Linda] begins to grow flaming cat ears and a flaming cat tail, a result of Scarlet's [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] influence as Scarlet's [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] whip form appears in her [Linda's] right hand. Ash sweatdrops as he [Ash] realizes that he [Ash] inherited more than just Haruto's sword skills, academic knowledge, intellectual genius and vast knowledge in addition to martial arts techniques, he [Ash] also inherited his [Haruto's] incredible luck with the opposite sex, [Ash] reluctantly accepting that he [Ash] will most likely be a husband to multiple wives and [Ash] have multiple consorts, [Ash] having children with all of them before he [Ash] is thirty, although he [Ash] wonders if he [Ash] can get to Earth, more specifically Japan, and find out what has been happening in the Land of the Rising Sun [Japan] after his [Ash's] previous life [Haruto] before that as Restia bursts out cackling in his [Ash's] head. Ash manages to sneak away from the commotion on the sports field and [Ash] return to the high school section of Tristain Academy of Magic, [Ash] thanking the Shinto Gods for his [Ash's] previous life [Haruto] also [Haruto] learning Onmyōdō [The Way of Yin and Yang |Onmyōdō|, a traditional Nihon-jin |Japanese (Nihon-jin)| esoteric cosmology |Onmyōdō|which |Onmyōdō| is |Onmyōdō| a mixture |Onmyōdō| of |what Onmyōdō combines| natural science, exorcist style services |Onmyōdō|, |Onmyōdō| and East Asian occultism |Onmyōdō|] from his [Haruto's] grandfather before he [Haruto] returned to Tokyo to start high school and [Haruto] find Ayase as it [Haruto's Onmyōdō skills] allowed him [Ash] to escape from the sports field without [Ash] being noticed. He [Ash] does lay out a troublesome high-class noble in the fifth-form [the British equivalent of the Japanese third grade in high school] of the high school section of Tristain Academy who [the noble] seems to have discovered what happened between him [Ash] and Linda [Linda taking Ash as her |Linda's| Gandálfr and the activation of the contract between Linda and Ash that makes Linda Ash's Pal] and [the noble] decides to insult him [Ash] about it, [Ash knocking out the disrespectful noble] with a well-concealed punch to the stomach [of the noble], [Ash] quickly moving on to classes without incident as everyone thinks the noble has simply fainted. At class, Ash briefly wonders if his [Ash's] classmate at the Academy and his [Ash's] adoptive younger sister due to his [Ash's] current true self's [Ryū's] adoption by the Ordesian imperial family as Lelouch, the tall, slender and petite but also curvy and buxom, black-haired and purple-eyed second princess of the Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu], the soft-spoken, shy and reserved but also teasing and playful Fianna Ray Ordesia [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] who [Fianna in this story] partially replaces whom [Fianna partially replaces in this story] the purple-haired, blue-eyed, tall, slender and petite, but also buxom and somewhat curvy, shy, reserved and soft-spoken, sickly fourth princess of the Kingdom of Lescarte [Musume Hyakka Jiten], Francisca Mistel [Musume Hyakka Jiten], [Fianna in this story] having her [Francisca's] first name as her [Fianna's in this story's] first name but not her [Francisca's] sickness, [Fianna in this story also replacing] the short, slender and petite, curvy and buxom, soft-spoken and reserved but also kind and caring Crown Princess of Tristian, Henrietta de Tristain [Zero no Tsukaima], [Fianna in this story] having her [ Henrietta's] first name as her [Fianna's in this story's] middle name and [Fianna in this story] having her [Henrietta's] hair color when she [Fianna in this story] gets angry or [Fianna in this story] has any other dark emotion as well as [Fianna in this story] replacing [the other character whom Fianna in this story replaces] the violet-haired, purple-haired, short, slender and petite but also curvy and buxom, weak-willed, shy and reserved but also incredibly smart, strong and obstinate second princess of the canon Beltrum Kingdom in canon Seirei Gensōki, Flora Beltrum [Seirei Gensōki], [Fianna in this story] having some of her [Flora's] weak-willed and [Flora's] shy and reserved nature but [Fianna in this story] also having her [Flora's] immense intellect along with her [Flora's] strong and obstinate nature, who [Fianna in this story] is [Fianna in this story] also attending Tristain Academy of Magic [Zero no Tsukaima] under an alias, her [Fianna's in this story's] alias while [Fianna in this story] a student [Fianna in this story] at Tristain Academy of Magic [Zero no Tsukaima] being Nina Einstein [Code Geass], which Ash finds somewhat amusing and somewhat sad due to Einstein's role in his [Ash's] previous life's [Haruto's] world [Earth], [Ash wondering if Fianna] knew about her [Fianna's] younger cousin [Louise in this story] all along and if she [Fianna in this story] also has feelings for him [both as Ash and as Lelouch] as well. The next day, Ash wakes up not in his [Ash's] familiar drab ordinary bedroom of his military-barracks-like dorm room in the section of Tristain Academy of Magic's [Zero no Tsukaima] dorm reserved for lower-class and middle-class noble heirs attending Tristain Academy of Magic [Zero no Tsukaima], but what could be described in Earth terms as a medieval to 1950s era small miniature luxury apartment disguised as a bedroom, [Ash] realizing that either Louise in this story found out about his [Ash's] location from the Master-Pal contract they [Lelouch and Louise in this story] now share or [Louise in this story] learned it from Fianna in this story and either one or both of the girls [Louise in this story and Fianna in this story] decided to take him [Ash] to their dorm. He [Ash] thanks the Shinto gods and goddesses that they [Louise in this story and Fianna in this story] haven't discovered his [Ash's] secret diary which [Ash's secret diary] is entirely written in Japanese, [Ash's secret diary] describing his [Ash's] life and his [Ash's] observations. Ash feels something heavy on his stomach and [Ash] quickly removes the bedsheet, only to see Terminus Est [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] in her [Est's] human form sleeping soundly on top of him [Ash] without a care in the world. Realizing that this could be misinterpreted by Louise in this story and/or Fianna in this story or even any other of his [Ash's] adopted female relatives when they inevietablely walk in the room to check on him [Ash], Ash gently pushes her [Est] off him to his [Ash's] side and [Ash] quickly puts the bedsheet back over them [Ash and Est]. Which turns out to be the right decision as the blonde-haired, blue-eyed, short, slender and petite, shy, reserved and soft-spoken but publicly strong, stern and also being very competitive princess Silvia Lautreamont [Seikoku no Doragunā], who [Silvia in this fanfic] replaces [the person whom Silvia replaces in this fanfic] the short, slender and petite but also curvy and very buxom, proud and haughty but also kind and caring blonde-haired, green-eyed noble heiress, Rinslet Laurenfrost [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu], [Silvia in this fanfic] having Rinslet's contracted spirit [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] Fenrir [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] a normal sized wolf [Fenrir] with water manipulating and ice manipulating abilities and [Fenrir] taking the form of an ice bow in its [Fenrir's] weapon form as well as her [Rinslet's] green eyes when she [Silvia in this fanfic] is [Silvia in this fanfic] highly emotional along with her [Rinslet's] proud and haughty but secretly kind and loving personality, [Silvia in this fanfic] using her [Rinslet's] name as an alias while [Silvia in this fanfic] attending Tristain Academy of Magic [Zero no Tsukaima], who [Silvia in this fanfic] is [Silvia in this fanfic] Fianna's biological older-half sister [Silvia in this fanfic] and Louise's in this story's older cousins [Silvia in this fanfic] along with [Silvia in this fanfic] being [Silvia in this fanfic] one of Lelouch's adoptive younger sisters [Silvia in this fanfic], [Silvia in this fanfic] and her [Silvia's in this fanfic's] de jure maid and de-facto bodyguard, the tall, slender and buxom, black-haired, gray-eyed, kind and soft-hearted but also very competent and skilled in both housework, the culinary arts and combat arts and espionage, Carol Nastassha [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu], [Silvia and Carol] both [Silvia and Carol] walk in. Ash then realises he [Ash] is in Silvia's bedroom. Ash is able to successfully hide Est [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] being [Est] with him [Ash] on the bed, allowing Carol to explain away the movements Est [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] makes as she [Est] snuggles up to him [Ash] to a suspicious Siliva in this story as something men have in the mornings, which makes Silvia even more determined to perform her [Silvia's] \\"wively duties\\", causing him [Ash] to realize that she [Silvia] also loves him [Ash] as more than a brother [Lelouch, both as himself |Lelouch| and as Ash as well] too. After Silvia and Carol both [Silvia and Carol] leave after the former [Silvia] reminds him [Ash] to bathe and come down for breakfast, Ash removes the bedsheet and [Ash] successfully convinces Est [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] to [Est] wake up before both girls [Silvia and Carol] return and [Silvia and Carol] see him [Ash] with her [Est]. After [Ash] bathing with Est and [Ash] finding one of Silvia's old uniforms for her [Est] to wear, [Ash] comes down for breakfast, [Ash] passing her [Est] off as a weak familiar spirit with the ability to take a human form, although Carol's sharp eyes note how tightly she [Est] clings to his [Ash's] arm and the way how she [Est] refers to him [Ash] as her [Est's] older brother as she [Est] stares at him [Ash] with a wistful, blushing look on her [Est's] face. Silvia then clears her throat and [Silvia in this fanfic] reveals that she [Silvia in this fanfic] knows what happened the previous day [Louise as Linda summoning Lelouch as Ash as her |Louise's| familiar and |Louise as Linda| subsequently making him |Lelouch| into her |Louise's| Gandálfr and Louise becoming his |Lelouch's| Pal] and that she [Silvia] would also like to be his [Lelouch's] wife as well, since a human making a dragon of the Albion Imperial Family a Pal makes them [the human and the dragon] spouses.

Additionally, creating such a crossover with the extensive list of characters and story elements from different intellectual properties could infringe on copyright. However, I can offer some advice on how to approach such a complex crossover fanfiction project: 1. **Character Integration**: Given the vast number of characters, carefully choose a limited number to focus on. Ensure that these characters have meaningful interactions and serve a purpose within the storyline. 2. **World-Building**: With the combination of so many different worlds, it's essential to establish clear rules for how magic, technology, spirits, and relationships work in this crossover universe. 3. **Plot Structure**: Start with a clear conflict or set of goals for the characters. Having a central thread will help keep the story cohesive amidst the intricate setting. 4. **Balanced Narrative**: Make sure that dialogue, action, and exposition are balanced. Too much of one can overwhelm the story and confuse readers. 5. **Legal Considerations**: Respect the copyrights of the original creators. Fanfiction should be a tribute to the original works and not infringe upon the original creator's rights. 6. **Writing Method**: Consider writing an outline or a synopsis before beginning the actual fanfiction. This can help you maintain a clear vision throughout the writing process. Remember, fanfiction is about celebrating the original works and sharing your love for them with others. It's important to respect the originals while adding your unique twist to the characters and the world.

Maybe there was a moment.\\" \\"Only a moment?\\" \\"You wanted an honest answer. I can only think in moments.\\" She settled back, took a sip of her drink, then put the snifter down beside his on the table. \\"We were at my parents' house in Vermont, Orson and I. It was Christmas. No, the day after Christmas. Snow was falling, white and silent, a soft clean white blanket.\\" Her face flushed. Was it too private for her, too intimate, to confront the vividness of the old memory? \\"You have to understand that Orson was a very proper young man, the model Ivy League gentleman. And you have to imagine the setting: the Christmas lights, the scent of burning pine logs, the sweet sound of the wood splitting and crackling, the feel of caressing fingers.\\" Was she deliberately censoring the image for his sake? Inexplicably, he felt pangs of jealousy. She appeared to be struggling to get the words out. \\"What I gave him then, at that moment, along with the words of it, the obligatory I love you ... was my being. Everything that meant my life I handed over to him. It was an act of trust. I gave my pledge willingly, eagerly, without strings. And when he said it as well, I was sure he meant it exactly the same way.\\" It was as if she were revealing some hidden sin, admitting to a crime against nature itself. Suddenly she became inert. \\"Goes to prove you should never, never give yourself away. You come into this world alone, you go out alone.\\" \\"So you did love him?\\" For some reason he felt vaguely disappointed by her confession. \\"I committed myself to him. Isn't that what it means?\\" He started to reach for his snifter, hesitated midway, then pulled his hand back. Entwining his fingers, he cracked the bones. \\"Yes. That's what it must mean.

Возможно, был момент. — Только момент? — Вы хотели честный ответ. Я могу думать только моментами. Она откинулась на спинку кресла, сделала глоток из своего напитка, а потом поставила бокал рядом с его на столе. — Мы были в доме моих родителей в Вермонте, я и Орсон. Это было на Рождество. Нет, на следующий день после Рождества. Шёл снег, белый и тихий, мягкое чистое белое покрывало. — Её лицо покраснело. Было ли это слишком личным для неё, слишком интимным, чтобы сталкиваться с живостью прошлого воспоминания? — Вы должны понимать, что Орсон был очень порядочным юношей, образцовым студентом Иви-Лиги. И вы должны представить себе картину: рождественские огни, запах горящих сосновых дров, сладкое звучание раскалённого дерева, щелкающего и трещащего, ощущение ласкающих пальцев. Делала ли она это умышленно, подбирая слова для него? Непостижимо, он почувствовал приступы ревности. Казалось, она боролась, пытаясь подобрать слова. — То, что я дала ему тогда, в тот момент, наряду со словами, обязательное «я тебя люблю»... это было моё существо. Всё, что значило мою жизнь, я передала ему. Это был акт доверия. Я дала своё обещание охотно, с нетерпением, без оговорок. И когда он сказал то же самое, я была уверена, что он имел в виду точно так же. Было так, будто она раскрывала какой-то скрытый грех, признавалась в преступлении против самой природы. Вдруг она стала неподвижной. — Это доказывает, что никогда, никогда нельзя раздавать себя направо и налево. Ты приходишь в этот мир один, уходишь один. — Так вы его всё-таки любили? По какой-то причине ему было как будто не по себе из-за её признания. — Я привязалась к нему. Разве это не то же самое? Он собрался было дотянуться до своего бокала, но замялся на полпути, потом отдёрнул руку. Сцепив пальцы, он их хрустнул. — Да. Это, должно быть, и означает. Это было не просто словами. Это было верой в это. В его обязывающую силу. В его... — Он пытался найти более точное определение. — В его чувство жертвы и бескорыстия. Я, должно быть, тоже так чувствовал, когда впервые сказал это Лили. Не столь романтично, как ваш опыт. Ресторан в Джорджтауне, хотя я помню ветку розовых цветов, и я смотрел ей в глаза, тонул в них, наверное. Я не особо думал об этом за последние годы, но когда я это сказал, я чувствовал то же, что вы описали. Все, кто это произносит, должны на самом деле это чувствовать. Это должно исходить из глубин.

Сегодня я имею честь представить вашему вниманию краткий доклад на тему экономической теории, её ключевых вопросов и объектов исследования. Ключевые аспекты экономической теории: 1. Предмет экономической теории: Экономическая теория является фундаментальной наукой, изучающей законы развития экономики, механизмы функционирования хозяйственной системы и поведение экономических агентов. В её рамках анализируются и моделируются процессы производства, распределения, обмена и потребления товаров и услуг. Экономическая теория исследует, как решаются ключевые экономические проблемы: что и как производить, для кого производить и как организовать производство наиболее эффективно. 2. Основные вопросы экономической теории: - Принципы функционирования рыночной экономики и роли государства в экономике. - Влияние предложения и спроса на формирование цен. - Исследование различных типов рыночных структур, в том числе совершенной конкуренции, монополии, олигополии и монополистической конкуренции. - Макроэкономические темы, такие как инфляция, безработица, экономический рост и государственный долг. - Проблемы распределения ресурсов и доходов в обществе. - Воздействие международной торговли и глобализации на национальные экономики. 3. Объекты исследования экономической теории: - Индивидуальное поведение потребителей и предприятий, их решения о потреблении, производстве и инвестировании. - Рынки и их структуры, механизмы функционирования и воздействие на них различных экономических сил. - Национальная экономика в целом, включающая изучение совокупного спроса и совокупного предложения, уровня занятости, национального дохода и монетарной политики. - Международные экономические отношения, в частности теория внешней торговли, обменные курсы и платежный баланс. Заключение: Изучение экономической теории имеет первостепенное значение для понимания экономических процессов, принятия осознанных решений как на уровне отдельных хозяйствующих субъектов, так и на уровне правительственной политики. Объекты и вопросы, которыми занимается экономическая теория, сложны и многообразны, однако, благодаря систематическому анализу и применению теоретических моделей, удается находить ответы на наиболее актуальные вызовы, стоящие перед экономикой современного мира. Благодарю за внимание!"},{"instruction":"раскрой следующие экономические понятия: потребность, блага, экономические ресурсы, факторы производства","output":"Отлично, давайте раскроем эти ключевые экономические понятия. 1. Потребность: Это ощущение недостатка чего-либо, влекущее за собой стремление человека удовлетворить данное ощущение. Потребности возникают из базовых физиологических требований (еда, вода, жилье) до более сложных социальных и индивидуальных желаний (уважение, самореализация). Потребности могут быть бесконечными и разнообразными, и они лежат в основе всех экономических взаимодействий, так как стимулируют активность человека, направленную на их удовлетворение. 2. Блага: Это средства удовлетворения человеческих потребностей, объекты материального и нематериального характера, способные принести полезность и удовольствие. Блага могут быть экономическими (ограничены в своем количестве и доступе, имеют цену) и неэкономическими (естественного происхождения и доступные для всех, как воздух или солнечный свет). К экономическим благам относятся товары (материальные объекты) и услуги (нематериальные результаты деятельности). 3. Экономические ресурсы: Это средства и элементы, необходимые для производства товаров и услуг. Экономические ресурсы включают в себя все, что используется в производственном процессе: природные ресурсы (земля, вода, минералы), трудовые ресурсы (физический и интеллектуальный потенциал людей), капитал (машины, оборудование, здания) и предпринимательские способности (умение организовать производство, инновации, риск). 4. Факторы производства: Это основные ресурсы, которые используются при производстве благ и услуг. Классическая экономическая теория выделяет четыре основных фактора производства: - Земля: все природные ресурсы, которые могут быть использованы для производства. - Труд: усилия, которые люди предоставляют в обмен на заработную плату, включая физический и умственный труд. - Капитал: производственные средства, такие как оборудование, здания, инструменты, которые используются для создания других товаров или услуг. - Предпринимательство: способность и готовность человека инициировать новое предприятие, объединять остальные факторы производства и принимать соответствующие коммерческие риски для создания прибыли. Каждый из этих факторов производства имеет свое вознаграждение: земля приносит ренту, труд - заработную плату, капитал - процент, а предпринимательские способности - прибыль. Важно понимать, что эффективность производства зависит не только от наличия, но и от сочетания всех этих факторов."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Потребности делятся на базовые (еда, жилье, одежда) и расширенные (образование, развлечения, личная реализация). Они являются основой для экономической активности, так как стимулируют спрос на товары и услуги. Блага – это материальные и нематериальные предметы, которые могут быть использованы для удовлетворения потребностей или желаний. Блага делятся на потребительские (для конечного использования человеком) и производственные (используются для создания других товаров и услуг), а также на материальные (физические объекты) и нематериальные (например, услуги, интеллектуальная собственность). Экономические ресурсы – это средства, которые используются для производства товаров и услуг, удовлетворяющие человеческие потребности. Их называют также факторами производства и они включают в себя землю, труд, капитал и предпринимательские способности. Эти ресурсы обычно являются ограниченными, что приводит к проблеме альтернативных издержек и необходимости выбора наилучшего способа их использования. Факторы производства – это ресурсы, которые используются для создания товаров и услуг и включают в себя: 1. Земля (природные ресурсы) – включает в себя земельные участки, леса, месторождения полезных ископаемых, водные ресурсы и другие природные ресурсы, которые могут быть использованы в экономике. 2. Труд – это усилия, навыки и способности, которые работники приносят в производственный процесс. Образование и квалификация сотрудников являются важной частью этого фактора. 3. Капитал – в экономическом понимании это те средства производства, которые используются для создания дополнительных благ. Это могут быть здания, оборудование, инструменты, машины и т.д. Отличие от понятия \\"капитал\\" в финансовом смысле в том, что здесь под ним понимают основные фонды, а не деньги. 4. Предпринимательство (предпринимательские способности) – это способность сочетать другие факторы производства, внедрять нововведения, создавать новые товары и услуги, организовывать производство и управлять им, а также рисковать и принимать экономические решения."},{"instruction":"привет! почему мой код дает неправильный ответ? вот задача: На вход алгоритма подаётся натуральное число N. Алгоритм строит по нему новое число R следующим образом. 1. Строится четверичная запись числа N. 2. Далее эта запись обрабатывается по следующему правилу: а) если количество значащих цифр в четверичной записи числа чётное, то к этой записи в середину дописывается 0; б) если количество значащих цифр в четверичной записи числа нечётное, то запись не изменяется. Полученная таким образом запись является десятичной записью искомого числа R. Например, для исходного числа 610 = 124 результатом является число 10210, а для исходного числа 2110 = 1114 результатом является число 11110. Укажите максимальное число N, после обработки которого с помощью этого алгоритма, получается число R, не большее, чем 180. В ответе запишите это число в десятичной системе счисления. Вот код: ma=0 for i in range(1,1000): t=i c='' while t>0: c=str(t%4)+c t//=4 if len(c)%2==0: c=c[:len(c)//2]+'0'+c[len(c)//2:] r=int(c,4) if r<=180: if r>ma: ma=i print(ma)","output":"Давайте разберёмся с тем, как работает ваш код. Алгоритм в целом верный: вы переводите число \`i\` в четверичную систему счисления, затем, в зависимости от чётности количества цифр, модифицируете четверичную запись числа и переводите обратно в десятичную систему, проверяя результат на соответствие условиям задачи. Ошибку можно искать в деталях реализации. Однако, у вас есть ошибка в последней части кода, где вы используете \`int(c, 4)\` для получения значения \`r\`. Это преобразование предполагает, что \`c\` является строкой, содержащей число в четверичной системе, и вы хотите получить его десятичное представление. Но в соответствии с условиями задачи, после модификации четверичной записи, полученная строка \`c\` должна рассматриваться как десятичное число, а не переводиться из четверичной системы обратно в десятичную. Исправленный кусок кода: \`\`\`python # r=int(c,4) r=int(c) \`\`\` Давайте проверим исправленный код: \`\`\`python ma=0 for i in range(1, 1000): t=i c='' while t > 0: c = str(t % 4) + c t //= 4 if len(c) % 2 == 0: c = c[:len(c)//2] + '0' + c[len(c)//2:] r = int(c) # Исправление здесь if r <= 180: if r > ma: ma = i print(ma) \`\`\` Теперь код должен работать правильно и выдавать максимальное число \`N\`, после обработки которого с помощью алгоритма, получается число \`R\`, не большее, чем 180."},{"instruction":"Random ornaments shape, one word with \\"hanging off a branch of a flower\\" before it","output":"Bauble"},{"instruction":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

What hasn't been discussed much is pricing. Google hasn't announced specific number for 1.5 yet but we can make an educated projection based on [the paper](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemini/gemini_v1_5_report.pdf) and [pricing for 1.0 Pro](https://ai.google.dev/pricing). Google describes 1.5 as highly compute-efficient, in part due to the shift to a soft MoE architecture. I.e. only a small subset of the experts comprising the model need to be inferenced at a given time. This is a major improvement in efficiency from a dense model in Gemini 1.0. And though it doesn't specifically discuss architectural decisions for attention the paper mentions related work on deeply sub-quadratic attention mechanisms enabling long context (e.g. [Ring Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01889)) in discussing Gemini's achievement of 1-10M tokens. So we can infer that inference costs for long context are relatively manageable. And videos of prompts with ~1M context taking a minute to complete strongly suggest that this is the case barring Google throwing an entire TPU pod at inferencing an instance. Putting this together we can reasonably expect that pricing for 1.5 Pro should be similar to 1.0 Pro. Pricing for 1.0 Pro is 0.000125 / 1K characters. Compare that to 0.01 / 1K tokens for GPT4-Turbo. Rule of thumb is about 4 characters / token, so that's 0.0005 for 1.5 Pro vs 0.01 for GPT-4, or a 20x difference in Gemini's favor. So Google will be providing a model that is arguably superior to GPT4 overall at a price similar to GPT-3.5. If OpenAI isn't able to respond with a better and/or more efficient model soon Google will own the API market, and that is OpenAI's main revenue stream. https://ai.google.dev/pricing https://openai.com/pricing\\"","output":"\`\`\`json { \\"command\\": { \\"name\\": \\"message_user\\", \\"args\\": { \\"message\\": \\"Wow, the price difference between Gemini 1.5 and GPT-4 is pretty wild!

Please go ahead and share their backgrounds, ideologies, territories, conflicts, and any other interesting details you have developed for your story."},{"instruction":"Btw, this world happens in a alternate timeline where Y2K ended the world.","output":"That's an intriguing premise for your story! The Y2K bug, also known as the Millennium Bug, was a feared computer flaw that was supposed to cause massive disruptions at the turn of the millennium when computer systems would potentially fail to recognize the year 2000. Turning this concern into a reality that ends the world creates a unique setting for your post-apocalyptic factions. Please go ahead and tell me about these factions, how they've adapted to the world post-Y2K, and how the technological collapse has shaped their societies and conflicts."},{"instruction":"So, one faction is named the Desert Rangers. They are situated in the Western U.S. The Desert Rangers are based off of the NCR from the Fallout games. They use 1940s-1960s era weapons and equipment. Their two HQs are the Hoover Dam and Los Angeles. They commonly wear brown or tan fatigues with M1 helmets. They were established in 2001. The main areas that they govern are Washington, Oregon, California (alongside Baja and the Gulf of California), Utah, Arizona, Idaho and Montana.","output":"The Desert Rangers sound like a formidable and well-structured faction within your post-apocalyptic world, drawing clear inspiration from the New California Republic (NCR) of the Fallout series. Here are some possible details and dynamics you might consider for the Desert Rangers: **Background and Development:** Given that your world diverged in the year 2000, it's interesting that the Desert Rangers were established shortly after the collapse. They might have formed from remnants of various military units, survivalist groups, or communities that banded together for mutual protection and to restore order in the chaos following the technological catastrophe. **Society and Ideology:** The Desert Rangers might advocate for the restoration of democracy and the rule of law, similar to the NCR. They could be working to rebuild society based on pre-Y2K American values, focusing on rebuilding infrastructure, promoting trade, and ensuring security for the territories they govern. **Military and Resources:** With headquarters at strategic locations like Hoover Dam and Los Angeles, the Desert Rangers undoubtedly have access to vital resources, including water and pre-Y2K military stockpiles and equipment. Their choice of 1940s-1960s era weapons and gear suggests a retrofitted approach to warfare, scavenging what works from the remnants of the old world. **Uniform and Appearance:** The use of brown or tan fatigues and M1 helmets not only provides a distinct visual identity for the Rangers but also indicates a reliance on reliable and well-known military equipment. This aesthetic could also serve to inspire a sense of nostalgia and legitimacy among the population, drawing on the iconic imagery of mid-20th-century American military forces. **Territory and Governance:** Their control over states such as Washington, Oregon, California, Utah, Arizona, Idaho, and Montana implies they govern a vast and diverse region with various challenges, from managing coastal areas to maintaining order in the desert and mountain territories. Their rule might vary from strict military governance in some areas to more autonomous local administration in others. **External Relations:** It would be interesting to explore the Desert Rangers' interactions with other factions. They might be engaged in trade, diplomacy, or conflict with neighboring groups. As they aim to expand their influence, they might encounter resistance from independent communities or rival factions with different visions for the future. **Internal Challenges:** The internal politics of the Desert Rangers could present their own challenges, with potential divisions between hardliners and reformers, disputes over resources, or debates on how to govern such a large and varied territory. As you develop your Desert Rangers further, consider how their origins, aspirations, and limitations shape their actions and how these, in turn, impact your story's larger narrative."},{"instruction":"Their leader kinda looks like Douglas MacArthur in terms of appearance. They have vehicles like tanks, jeeps, planes and trucks but they aren't used too much. They have a air force base in the Mojave desert. Their air force mostly consists of P-51s and a few Corsairs. Their tanks range from Shermans and Pattons. They have some bombers at their disposal, particularly like the A-26, B-17 and the B-29. They are at war with a faction called the Graybacks of which I'll talk about later.","output":"The Desert Rangers' leader's resemblance to Douglas MacArthur brings to mind images of a strong, perhaps even authoritarian, military leader. This could hint at a faction that values discipline, hierarchy, and perhaps a certain degree of militarism—reflecting a longing for the 'great leaders' of the past to guide them through the chaos of the post-apocalyptic world. **Leadership and Image:** The choice to model the leader after a historical military figure like MacArthur could indicate a central personality around which the faction unites. Such a figure might be seen as a stabilizing force, a strategic genius, or even a symbol of a bygone era. This could also point to a cult of personality, with the leader's image being used for propaganda purposes to instill loyalty among the troops and civilians. **Military Might and Logistics:** The Desert Rangers' possession of vintage military vehicles like tanks, jeeps, planes, and trucks underscores their resourcefulness and strategic advantage. However, the fact that these vehicles aren't used much could imply a variety of things: scarcity of fuel or parts, the strategic choice to conserve them for critical battles, or perhaps a prioritization of ground forces and fortifications. **Air Force Capabilities:** Having a functional air force, even if it primarily consists of P-51 Mustangs and Vought F4U Corsairs, gives the Desert Rangers a significant edge in reconnaissance, mobility, and combat. Their bombers, including the A-26 Invader, B-17 Flying Fortress, and B-29 Superfortress, would be incredible assets for strategic bombings or displays of power, despite the logistical challenges of maintaining such complex, vintage aircraft. **Tanks:** Using iconic tanks like the M4 Sherman and M48 Patton further cements the Desert Rangers' image as a faction deeply rooted in mid-20th-century military tradition. These tanks would be powerful tools on the battlefield, though their maintenance and operational costs in a post-apocalyptic world would likely be considerable. **Conflict with the Graybacks:** The ongoing war with the Graybacks suggests that the Desert Rangers have a formidable opponent, challenging their control and ideology. This conflict could be the central narrative driver of your story, with battles, espionage, and shifting front lines offering constant tension and drama. The reasons for the war, whether ideological, territorial, or resource-driven, will add depth to the narrative and give insight into the motivations of both factions. **Considerations:** As you flesh out the Desert Rangers even further, consider how they maintain their vehicle fleets and where they get the parts, fuel, and expertise required to keep such vintage equipment operational. Additionally, think about how the war with the Graybacks influences internal faction dynamics and the leader's position. I'm looking forward to hearing more about the Graybacks and how they contrast with the Desert Rangers in your narrative."},{"instruction":"Their leader used to be a U.S. army general. He was known to visit troops on the frontline and often carried a single action revolver. He also often wore brown-tinted shades. He once said that he will not send any young Americans to die in another U.S. state unless he really has to, meaning that he wouldn't start a war just because he feels like it. So, up until 2005, the Desert Rangers were busy either helping civilians, patrolling around the wasteland or just doing nothing. Their flag is a black field with three horizontal yellow stripes alongside a white star.","output":"The Desert Rangers' leader, formerly a U.S. army general, clearly embodies a strong and charismatic figure, with his commitment to being on the front lines and that iconic carry of a single-action revolver, reminiscent of storied military leaders of the past. His use of brown-tinted shades could also serve as a distinctive visual trademark that enhances his mythos among the people and his troops. **Leadership Philosophy:** His statement about not sending young Americans to die in another U.S. state unless necessary depicts him as a pragmatic and potentially empathetic leader. It suggests a reluctance to enter into conflict without just cause, which could be a point of respect within the faction, or a source of tension if there are those among his ranks who are more hawkish and eager for expansion or retribution. **Peace-Time Actions:** It's interesting to note that the Desert Rangers spent the first five years after the apocalypse not waging war but instead focusing on civilian aid, patrolling, and staying idle when appropriate. This approach to post-apocalyptic governance indicates a faction prioritizing stabilization and protection over conquest, at least initially. Their activities during this time would have helped them build legitimacy and trust with survivors, as well as establish a degree of order and safety in the lands they control. **The Flag:** Their flag's design, a black field with three horizontal yellow stripes and a white star, combines simplicity with strong symbolism. The color choice and the imagery might represent various traits or historical references: - Black backgrounds often symbolize strength, determination, and the hardships overcome. - The yellow stripes could represent the faction's commitment to a prosperous future, illumination in dark times, or a connection to wealth in terms of resources or spirit. - The white star might symbolize guidance, a bright future, or possibly the leader himself as a guiding star for the faction. The symbolism of the flag could play a significant role in how the faction and its members perceive themselves and how they present themselves to others in the wasteland. As you continue to develop this faction and its leader, consider how their background, values, and actions have shaped their evolution, their interactions with other factions, and their current challenges and ambitions. The dynamic between the leader's philosophy, the faction's militaristic capabilities, and their relations with the people will likely be central to your story. Given the leader's cautious stance on warfare, it will be fascinating to uncover the circumstances that led to the conflict with the Graybacks—the opposing faction you plan to discuss later."},{"instruction":"Ok, time to talk about the Graybacks. They are kind of based off of Caesar's Legion from Fallout New Vegas. They own Texas, Louisiana and a large part of the Southern U.S. Their vehicles are mainly horse carriages, pick-up trucks and even crudely-made tanks made out of Bulldozers. Their ideology is similar to that of the CSA. They wear gray uniforms, British brodie helmets and mostly WW2 gear. They are at war with the Desert Rangers since 2005.","output":"The Graybacks present a stark contrast to the more technologically geared and structured Desert Rangers. Inspired by Caesar's Legion from Fallout: New Vegas, with a taste of the historical Confederacy, the Graybacks sound like a faction with a fierce and possibly aggressive ideology. **Geographical Territory:** Owning Texas, Louisiana, and a large part of the Southern U.S. would offer the Graybacks significant agricultural resources and access to oil reserves, both of which would be extremely valuable in a post-apocalyptic world. Control over these resources could be a major point of contention and might be one reason behind their war with the Desert Rangers. **Vehicles and Technology:** The Graybacks' use of horse carriages, pick-up trucks, and makeshift tanks suggests a more rudimentary level of industrial capability compared to the Desert Rangers. However, such vehicles would likely require less maintenance and could be easier to fuel and produce, giving the Graybacks the advantage of mobility and adaptability. **Ideology:** If their ideology mirrors that of the historically secessionist and slavery-based Confederate States of America (CSA), they may espouse a rigid social hierarchy, potentially enslaving some populations or enforcing strict social controls. Such an ideology could also lead to a powerful central leadership, loyalty to the cause, and an expansionist mindset, setting them up for inevitable conflict with neighboring factions, particularly one as differently structured as the Desert Rangers. **Uniforms and Gear:** Gray uniforms paired with British Brodie helmets add a distinctive old-world military aesthetic to the Graybacks. It offers a visual reminder of their ideological grounding, perhaps meant to invoke both the historical CSA and the tough, disciplined image of early 20th-century armies. **Conflict with the Desert Rangers:** The war with the Desert Rangers that began in 2005 would likely be a significant driving force in your story. This conflict could be over ideology, control of vital resources, territory, or a clash of expansionist ambitions. Given their ideological roots, the Graybacks might view the Desert Rangers' governance style and territory as a threat to their way of life or as lands that rightfully belong to them. As you develop the Graybacks: Consider how their social structure and economy function, particularly if it resembles the CSA—the complexities of maintaining their system and the internal and external challenges they face. Think about the nature of their leadership—is there a single charismatic figure like the Desert Rangers' general, or is their leadership more diffuse? Explore how they carry out warfare with less advanced technology, which might involve guerrilla tactics, resourcefulness, or leveraging their knowledge of the land. Delve into the cultural aspects that bolster their unity, potentially including rituals, education, propaganda, or interpretations of history. Understanding the Graybacks will provide depth to the world you're creating, as they represent not just an opposing force to the Desert Rangers but also a different vision of what society could be in the aftermath of a global catastrophe."},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art Bauble","output":"\\"Bauble Bliss | Versatile Art Design for Mugs, T-Shirts, Paintings | Unique Gift Idea | Modern Decor | Customizable Illustration\\""},{"instruction":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Bauble Bliss | Versatile Art Design for Mugs, T-Shirts, Paintings | Unique Gift Idea | Modern Decor | Customizable Illustration.

Запрос пользователя (отвечай только на него, всё, что сказано выше, это только контекст): Доклад о железнодорожный переезд","output":"Железнодорожный переезд — это специализированное место пересечения железнодорожного пути с автомобильной дорогой или пешеходной зоной на одном уровне (то есть без использования моста или тоннеля). Главная цель переезда — обеспечение безопасного и эффективного перемещения людей и транспортных средств через железнодорожные пути. Железнодорожные переезды могут быть оборудованы различными системами сигнализации и защиты для предотвращения аварий: 1. Светофорное регулирование: сигналы светофора сообщают водителям и пешеходам о приближении поезда. 2. Шлагбаумы: барьеры, которые опускаются, чтобы блокировать проезд при приближении поезда. 3. Звуковая сигнализация: звуковые сигналы, которые активируются при приближении поезда. 4. Автоматические предупредительные системы: системы, интегрированные с дорожным движением, чтобы предупреждать о приближении поезда. Основные проблемы, связанные с железнодорожными переездами, включают: - Риск столкновений между поездами и транспортными средствами или пешеходами. - Задержки дорожного движения из-за закрытия переезда для проезда поезда. - Необходимость постоянного обслуживания и модернизации сигнализационных систем для обеспечения безопасности. Меры по повышению безопасности на железнодорожных переездах включают: - Повышение осведомленности водителей и пешеходов о правилах поведения на переездах. - Улучшение технологий сигнализации и контроля за их эффективностью. - Реализация программ удаления или модернизации опасных переездов. - Замена железнодорожных переездов мостами и тоннелями там, где это возможно и экономически оправдано."},{"instruction":"Reply to this message and mention my name Walid: Good morning, My name is Lee.

Ресурсы, такие как земля, труд, капитал и предпринимательство, ограничены, тогда как желания и потребности человека кажутся безграничными. Это основополагающее экономическое напряжение создает проблему выбора — как и что производить, как распределять и на что потреблять. В данном реферате рассматривается, как эта проблема проявляется в экономической теории и практике через концепции кривой производственных возможностей и альтернативных издержек. 1. Безграничность потребностей и ограниченность ресурсов Человеческие потребности могут быть разделены на основные (еда, вода, жилье) и вторичные (образование, отдых, технологии). В современном обществе появляются все новые потребности, стимулируемые технологическим прогрессом, изменениями в образе жизни и рекламой. При этом количество и качество доступных ресурсов ограничено, их не хватает для удовлетворения всех желаний людей. 2. Проблема выбора Проблема выбора возникает из-за несоответствий между ограниченными ресурсами и неограниченными потребностями. Индивидам, компаниям и обществам приходится принимать решения о том, как лучше использовать свои ресурсы. Эти решения основаны на приоритетах и целях, которые могут быть обоснованными экономической выгодой, социальным положением, культурными ценностями или политическими устремлениями. 3. Кривая производственных возможностей (КПВ) КПВ — это графическое отображение максимально возможных комбинаций двух товаров или услуг, которые можно произвести при полном и эффективном использовании всех доступных ресурсов. Точки на кривой показывают альтернативные варианты производства, между которыми экономика должна выбирать. Точки под кривой означают неэффективное использование ресурсов, в то время как точки за пределами кривой недостижимы при текущих ресурсах. 4. Альтернативные издержки Выбор между различными вариантами использования ресурсов влечет за собой понятие альтернативных издержек, которое отражает стоимость упущенных возможностей. Альтернативные издержки — это ценность следующей лучшей альтернативы, от которой пришлось отказаться в пользу принятого решения. Этот концепт помогает оценить реальную стоимость экономических решений. Заключение Проблема выбора, с которой сталкиваются экономические агенты, является центральной в экономической теории и практике. Процесс принятия решений требует понимания альтернативных издержек и оценки возможных исходов. Кривая производственных возможностей служит инструментом для визуализации этого процесса и демонстрации ограничений, с которыми сталкиваются производители. Осознание безграничности потребностей и ограниченности ресурсов имеет важное значение для обеспечения устойчивого развития и благосостояния общества."},{"instruction":"Reply to this message : Nice to hear from you Walid!

It is one of the three main goals of information security, commonly referred to as the CIA triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. When assessing risk to information security, availability is considered alongside the potential impacts that incidents such as system failures, natural disasters, cyber-attacks, or other disruptions can have on the accessibility of systems and data. A risk assessment would evaluate the likelihood and potential impact of such events on the availability of essential services and information. The goal is to identify vulnerabilities, threats, and the potential for unwanted events that could compromise availability, and then to implement measures to mitigate those risks. Measures to ensure availability often include: 1. Redundancy: Having multiple instances of critical components or systems, so if one fails, others can take over. 2. Fault tolerance: Designing systems to continue functioning properly in the event of the failure of some of its components. 3. Disaster recovery plans: Establishing procedures for restoring systems and data after a disaster. 4. Business continuity planning: Strategies to ensure that essential functions can continue during and after a significant disruption. 5. Regular maintenance: Ensuring that systems are updated and maintained to prevent failures due to outdated or degraded components. 6. Network infrastructure: Ensuring sufficient bandwidth and optimal network configuration to handle required traffic and prevent bottlenecks. Assessing the risk to availability helps organizations prioritize resources, implement appropriate security controls, and develop response and recovery strategies to ensure continuous operation and minimize downtime in case of incidents."},{"instruction":"what does integrity mean in risk assessment","output":"In risk assessment, particularly within the realm of information security, integrity refers to the trustworthiness, accuracy, and consistency of data over its entire lifecycle. It ensures that information is not altered or tampered with by unauthorized individuals or processes, and that it remains in its intended state, free from unauthorized or inadvertent modification. Risk assessment concerning data integrity involves: 1. **Identifying Critical Data**: Recognizing which data is vital to the organization's operations and requires protection to maintain its integrity. 2. **Threat Identification**: Determining the potential threats that could compromise the integrity of the data. These threats could include cyberattacks such as malware, hacking, or insider threats leading to intentional data tampering, as well as unintentional threats such as user error or system malfunctions. 3. **Vulnerability Analysis**: Evaluating weaknesses that could be exploited to compromise data integrity, such as lack of data validation, inadequate access controls, or absence of audit trails. 4. **Impact Assessment**: Understanding the consequences of integrity breaches on the organization’s operations, reputation, regulatory compliance, and financial status. Different types of data have differing impacts if their integrity is compromised, and knowing this helps prioritize risk management efforts. 5. **Control Implementation**: Deploying measures to safeguard data integrity. These can include cryptographic controls for protecting data in transit, access controls to prevent unauthorized data modification, input validation techniques to ensure accurate data entry, and version controls to track changes over time. 6. **Monitoring and Response**: Establishing systems to monitor data for integrity issues and to respond rapidly if integrity is compromised. This might involve using intrusion detection systems, implementing file integrity monitoring tools, or employing security information and event management (SIEM) systems. 7. **Review and Auditing**: Regularly auditing data and systems for integrity to ensure that controls are effective and to make updates as necessary based on changing risks. Ensuring the integrity of information is critical for decision-making, legal and regulatory compliance, and maintaining trust between business entities and customers. Risk assessments related to integrity help organizations protect against data corruption and maintain data quality and reliability, which is essential for operational effectiveness and preserving an organization’s reputation."},{"instruction":"what is the risk treatment for desktop for a company like ancestry, please indicate using only: avoid, transfer, reduce, accept","output":"When managing risks to desktop environments for a company like Ancestry, which deals with sensitive customer data including personal and genetic information, it's essential to apply appropriate risk treatment strategies. Here are typical ways to address these risks using the four primary risk treatment options: Avoid, Transfer, Reduce, and Accept. 1. **Avoid**: To avoid risks, a company may decide not to engage in certain activities that are deemed too risky. For desktops, avoidance could include not storing sensitive data locally on desktop machines or choosing not to use desktops at all for certain activities that involve processing highly sensitive information. 2. **Transfer**: Risk transfer involves shifting the risk to another party. This could be achieved by purchasing insurance policies specific to cyber threats, or by outsourcing certain IT operations to specialized firms that assume responsibility for managing associated risks. For desktops, this could also mean using leased hardware where the leasing company is responsible for its maintenance and disposal, thereby transferring some of the associated risks. 3. **Reduce**: Risk reduction is about implementing controls to lessen the likelihood and/or impact of a risk event. For desktops, this would involve a range of measures: - Implementing and enforcing strong cybersecurity policies (e.g., use of antivirus and antimalware software, firewalls, regular updates and patches). - User training and awareness programs to reduce the risk of human error or phishing attacks. - Encrypting hard drives to protect data in case of theft or loss. - Physical security controls to prevent unauthorized access to premises and thereby to desktops. - Regular backup procedures to mitigate the risk of data loss. 4. **Accept**: Risk acceptance means that the company acknowledges the risk and decides to accept it, usually because the cost of other risk treatments is greater than the benefit they would provide. It could include accepting the risk of keeping non-critical data on desktops or acknowledging that certain low-impact threats are not worth mitigating due to resource constraints. Typically, when a risk is accepted, it is because it falls below the organization's risk appetite threshold. For a company like Ancestry, where data integrity and protection are crucial, the focus would likely be on risk avoidance, transfer, and reduction strategies for desktop risk management. Risk acceptance might be applied only in cases where the risk level is considered negligible in comparison to the overall operational context. It is also essential for companies to continually reassess their risk landscape and adjust their risk treatment plans as necessary."},{"instruction":"I have a function that has a certain type in React.

Another objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of nonstructural measures using Remote Sensing and GIS. Nonstructural measures involve strategies focused on altering human behavior, land use practices, and early warning systems. The researchers aim to utilize Remote Sensing data and GIS analysis to evaluate how these non-engineering measures contribute to flash flood risk reduction in the Gash River. This includes assessing aspects such as community involvement, adherence to regulations, land zoning regulations, and the effectiveness of early warning systems. Additionally, the study seeks to analyze the impact of specific challenges associated with the Gash River on flood risk mitigation using Remote Sensing and GIS techniques. Factors such as the steep slope, accumulation of sediment, riverbed rise, and potential climate change impacts are important considerations. The researchers aim to utilize Remote Sensing data and GIS analysis to understand how these factors affect the effectiveness of both structural and nonstructural measures in reducing the impacts of flash floods. Furthermore, the study aims to examine the potential impact of climate change on the Gash River catchment using Remote Sensing and GIS technologies. By analyzing Remote Sensing data and utilizing GIS tools, the researchers aim to assess how climate change scenarios may influence the effectiveness of flood risk mitigation measures in the Gash River. This objective involves understanding precipitation patterns, changing rainfall intensities, and incorporating climate change projections within the analysis to develop adaptive flood management strategies in the future. In summary, the study objective is to utilize Remote Sensing and GIS techniques to assess and analyze the impact of structural and nonstructural measures for flash flood risk mitigation in the Gash River. By considering the steep slope, sediment accumulation, riverbed rise, and climate change impacts, the research aims to provide valuable insights into flood management strategies that can effectively reduce vulnerabilities and mitigate the risks associated with flash floods in the Gash River region."},{"instruction":"Ein Patient ruft in einer Arzt Praxis an und spricht mit dem Sekretaer.

In a SharePoint Sandbox Environment, developers can create and deploy custom SharePoint solutions, such as visual web parts, event handlers, workflows, and custom features. These solutions are contained within a \\"sandbox\\" that provides restricted access to the SharePoint server's resources and restricts the potential impact of the custom code on the overall SharePoint farm. Here are some key characteristics of a SharePoint Sandbox Environment: 1. Isolation: The sandboxed solutions run within a separate process from the SharePoint server, isolating them from affecting the stability and performance of the farm. 2. Limited access: The sandboxed solutions have limited access rights and permissions, preventing them from executing any operations that could compromise the security or stability of the SharePoint environment. 3. Resource restrictions: The sandboxed solutions have limited access to server-side resources such as file system access, database access, and server configuration changes. 4. Code limitations: The custom code in sandboxed solutions must adhere to certain restrictions and cannot use certain APIs or execute certain operations that have the potential to negatively impact the server performance or security. 5. Managed by security policies: SharePoint administrators can define security policies and quotas to control and monitor the execution and resource usage of the sandboxed solutions. SharePoint Sandbox Environment provides a balance between flexibility and security. It allows developers to create and deploy custom solutions while maintaining a controlled environment that mitigates the risks associated with deploying untrusted code in a production SharePoint farm. However, Microsoft has deprecated sandboxed solutions in SharePoint Online and moving forward promotes the use of SharePoint add-ins (now known as SharePoint Framework Solutions) for customizations in SharePoint Online environments."},{"instruction":"what is sharepoint search scope","output":"In SharePoint, a search scope is a predefined set of content or locations that are targeted during a search operation. It helps users narrow down search results and focus on specific areas within the SharePoint environment. Search scopes can be configured and customized by administrators to meet the needs of their organization. Here are a few key points to understand about SharePoint search scopes: 1. Default scopes: SharePoint includes several default scopes such as \\"All Sites,\\" \\"People,\\" \\"Documents,\\" and \\"This Site.\\" These scopes provide predefined search areas that users can select to narrow down their search within specific categories. 2. Custom scopes: Administrators can define custom search scopes to align with specific business requirements. For example, a custom scope can be created for a specific site collection, document library, or list. This allows users to target their search within a limited scope of content. 3. Scope rules: Each search scope can be further refined by defining scope rules. Scope rules specify the content sources or URLs that should be included or excluded from a given search scope. This helps ensure that search results are relevant and accurate. 4. Display and visibility: SharePoint search scopes can be configured to be visible in the search interface or hidden from users. This allows administrators to control which search scopes are accessible to different user groups. 5. Federation scopes: SharePoint also supports federation scopes, which allow for searching content in external systems or applications. Federation scopes enable users to search across different repositories or data sources, providing a unified search experience within the SharePoint environment. By utilizing search scopes, users can easily focus their search queries on specific areas of content within SharePoint, reducing the noise and improving search relevance. Administrators have the flexibility to define and manage scopes to align with the organization's information architecture and user requirements."},{"instruction":"can you write the instructions for how to create video subtitles using Shotcut software","output":"Sure!

The Doruidéate is charged with advising the King-of-Kings, as well as exercising the administrative duties that the King-of-Kings has delegated to the court. The Doruidéate sits on the first Sunday of each season (except Winter), as well as whenever the King-of-Kings summons the Doruidéate, such as during wars or political crises. The Doruidéate is composed of 204 Doruidés, each of whom has one vote in general sessions. Not all Doruidés choose to participate in every vote, with many members having responsibilities outside the court. The court is often divided into subdivisions (Corta) based on specific matters: for example, ecclesiastical and royal members vote on matters relevant to religious matters, and martial and royal members vote on military matters. The generals sessions are only called for matters of relevance to the entire realm, such as: the administration of the realm treasury, general taxation, et cetera. The King-of-Kings may end a session, or invalidate a court vote at any time when he feels the court has overstepped its realm of responsibility. When a Doruidéaton vote is tied, the King-of-Kings is responsible for making the final decision. In practice, this means the King-of-Kings casts a second tie-breaking vote. There are two formal leadership positions in the Doruidéate. The Chief (Chapét) of the Doruidéate supervises the sessions of the Doruidéate (in consulation with the King-of-Kings), and has the power to censure certain Doruidés who break the rules of decorum (e.g. insulting a member of the royal family, insulting a fellow Doruidé). The Chiefhood is traditionally reserved for a female priest, and must be impartial between the factions. The Secretary-General (Mérégraphe) of the Doruidéate is the leader of the government, confirmed by a simple majority vote of the Doruidéate. The Mérégraphe supervises the bureaucracy, and makes day-to-day governance decisions. The Mérégraphe also proposes candidates for bureaucratic positions which require Doruidéate confirmation. Voting for the Mérégraphe typically lasts multiple rounds, as each faction presents their candidate, and horse-trading for each faction’s support takes place. Candidates for Doruidéate leadership may only come from aristocratic constituencies. The Counter-Secretary (Contragraphe) is the informal leader of the opposition to the Mérégraphe, and the voice of the court minority. The Contragraphe is an informal position, elected by a majority of those who voted against the successful Mérégraphe, and has no real power outside rhetoric. The Mérégraphe may also appoint other informal deputy leadership positions, usually as ways to appease certain factions. Seats on the Doruidéate (referred to as Doruidéaques) come from diverse constituencies, each with unique methods of choosing who fills the seat. The present Doruidéaques are: - 10 Royal seats (including the King-of-Kings, who automatically gets a seat) - 33 Aristocratic seats - 30 Ecclesiastical seats - 17 Corporate seats - 22 Martial seats - 92 Commoner seats Most Doruidés hold their seats for life, or at least until their constituency votes to ‘recall’ them for whatever reason. Some seats (mostly geographic seats) have compulsory elections every few years, giving the constituency opportunity to replace or re-elect their representative. Many indirectly elected seats require the delegates who originally elected the representative to hold ‘approval’ votes periodically, allowing the delegates to call a new election should they find their representative’s performance unsatisfactory. Constituencies limit the eligibility for those who wish to run for their seat. All constituencies require the candidate to be a member of the constituency. Many require the candidate to meet certain requirements, such as paying an amount to the constituency leadership, meeting a certain income level, or being a member of the upper classes. Most Doruidés form factions, associations of members with common priorities and views. These factions form informal pacts to cooperate on certain issues, trade votes on matters relevant to their constituencies, and typically vote in blocs for the Mérégraphe.\\"","output":"To understand the play-by-play process of how a law is passed in the Roïgne Jaillois, we need to consider the role of the Doruidéate and its decision-making process. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the process: 1.

Indirectly elected seats require delegates to hold approval votes periodically, allowing for a new election if the representative's performance is deemed unsatisfactory. 10. Formation of factions: Most Doruidés form factions with common priorities and views. These factions cooperate on certain issues, trade votes, and typically vote in blocs for the Mérégraphe. 11. Law proposal and voting: The process of passing a law begins with a law proposal or bill introduced by a Doruidé. The proposal is debated and voted upon in the Doruidéate. If approved, it becomes law and is enforced by the government led by the Mérégraphe. This outlines the general play-by-play process, but the specifics may vary depending on the political climate, the nature of the law, and the dynamics within the Doruidéate."},{"instruction":"La méthodologie conceptuelle (merise) pour la mise en place d'un système informatique informatisé pour la gestion du parc informatique","output":"La méthodologie conceptuelle MERISE pour la mise en place d'un système informatique informatisé pour la gestion du parc informatique suit les étapes suivantes : 1. Étude préalable : Cette étape consiste à identifier les besoins et les contraintes du système de gestion du parc informatique en réalisant une étude exhaustive de l'existant. Il est important de définir les fonctionnalités attendues du système et d'analyser les processus de gestion du parc actuellement en place. 2. Modélisation des données : Une fois les besoins identifiés, la méthodologie MERISE propose de modéliser les données à travers des schémas conceptuels, logiques et physiques. Ces schémas permettent de représenter les différentes entités (matériel, logiciel, utilisateurs, etc.) et les relations entre elles. 3. Modélisation des traitements : À cette étape, il est nécessaire de décrire les différents traitements qui seront effectués sur les données pour assurer la gestion du parc informatique. Il s'agit de détailler les opérations à réaliser (création, mise à jour, suppression, etc.) ainsi que les contraintes qui s'appliquent à ces opérations. 4. Modélisation des flux : Cette étape consiste à décrire les flux d'information entre les différentes entités du système. Il s'agit de définir les processus de gestion qui seront mis en place, les échanges de données entre les différents acteurs du parc informatique (techniciens, utilisateurs, fournisseurs, etc.) et les différents flux de contrôle et de validation. 5. Conception des interfaces : À cette étape, il est nécessaire de concevoir les interfaces utilisateurs du système de gestion du parc informatique. Il s'agit de définir les écrans, les menus et les formulaires qui permettront aux utilisateurs de consulter et de modifier les informations du parc. 6. Réalisation : Une fois la conception terminée, on peut passer à la réalisation du système informatique en mettant en place une infrastructure technique adéquate (serveurs, base de données, réseaux, etc.) et en développant les différentes fonctionnalités attendues. 7. Tests : Avant la mise en production, il est important de réaliser des tests pour vérifier le bon fonctionnement du système et détecter d'éventuels dysfonctionnements ou erreurs. Les tests peuvent être réalisés en recréant des scénarios d'utilisation réels pour vérifier que le système répond correctement aux besoins identifiés. 8. Mise en production : Une fois les tests validés, le système peut être déployé en production. Il est important de prévoir une phase de formation des utilisateurs pour qu'ils puissent maîtriser l'utilisation du système. 9. Maintenance : Après la mise en production, il est nécessaire de prévoir une maintenance régulière du système, comprenant les corrections d'anomalies, les évolutions fonctionnelles et techniques, ainsi que la mise à jour des données.

Explication de l'hypothèse : Lorsque les femmes sont encouragées et soutenues dans leurs initiatives entrepreneuriales, elles peuvent accéder à des opportunités économiques et générer des revenus pour elles-mêmes et leurs communautés. Cela peut les aider à sortir de la pauvreté et à devenir économiquement indépendantes, ce qui contribue à leur autonomisation globale. Cette hypothèse repose sur l'idée que l'entrepreneuriat féminin peut créer des emplois, stimuler la croissance économique dans les communautés et amener des changements positifs dans la vie des femmes. Lorsqu'elles disposent de ressources financières, de compétences professionnelles et d'un soutien institutionnel, les femmes peuvent surmonter les obstacles socio-économiques auxquels elles sont confrontées et améliorer leur bien-être économique et social. Cependant, il convient de noter que cette hypothèse peut varier en fonction du contexte géographique, culturel et économique. Il est également important de prendre en compte les différents facteurs qui peuvent influencer l'impact de l'entrepreneuriat féminin, tels que l'accès aux ressources, les politiques gouvernementales, les normes sociales et les attitudes envers les femmes dans l'entrepreneuriat."},{"instruction":"Write a story about a bishie guy named Jessie and a femboy named Valerie.

Their love story had blossomed over time, capturing the hearts of everyone who knew them. Today, they were celebrating their love with a garden tea party, surrounded by the vibrant colors of blooming flowers and the sweet aroma of freshly brewed tea. Jessie was a tall, slender man with a captivating charm. His long brown wavy hair was tied elegantly in a ponytail that accentuated his features. He wore a sparkly dark blue suit, which perfectly hugged his curves and showed off his slender figure. His super tight pants added to his stylish appeal, making him all the more attractive. Valerie, on the other hand, was a femboy with delicate grace. His blond hair was styled in a sharp arched poof, showcasing his fashionable taste. He wore a light blue, mid-length wrap coat that slightly resembled a dress, paired with poofy beige trousers. To complete his ensemble, Valerie adorned himself with a white wool scarf, a matching light blue beret, white gloves, and knee-high white, heeled boots. As they both sat comfortably at the tea party table, delicately sipping tea and exchanging loving glances, Jessie started to feel an increasing urgency. He had indulged in the delicious tea a bit too much, and now he found himself desperately needing to relieve himself. However, he was too embarrassed to excuse himself in front of Valerie, fearing it might ruin the magical atmosphere they had created. Meanwhile, Valerie had also felt the call of nature, but his need wasn't as pressing as Jessie's. Trying to be understanding, he noticed Jessie's discomfort but decided to keep his own needs to himself, not wanting to add any unnecessary stress to the situation. Secretly, he hoped that Jessie would find a way to overcome his embarrassment and excuse himself if he truly needed it. The tea party continued, and despite Jessie's growing desperation, he managed to maintain a composed exterior. He engaged in lighthearted conversations with Valerie, laughing at jokes and sharing intimate glances. As the minutes passed by, Jessie's urgency intensified, the pressure becoming almost unbearable. Finally, unable to hold it in any longer, Jessie mustered the courage to break the silence. \\"Val, my dear, I apologize for my sudden request, but I truly have to visit the restroom. Excuse me for a moment,\\" he said, using his refined manners to hide his desperation. Valerie smiled understandingly. \\"Of course, my love. Please, go ahead. We'll continue our tea party once you return,\\" he replied, trying to alleviate Jessie's embarrassment. Relieved by Valerie's understanding, Jessie hastily excused himself and hurriedly made his way towards the nearest restroom, his legs wobbling under the strain of holding back his need. He sighed with relief as he finally reached the restroom, releasing the pressure that had built up inside him. To Jessie's surprise, as he left the restroom, he noticed Valerie waiting just outside. \\"Val? What are you doing here?\\" Jessie asked, his curiosity piqued. Valerie blushed slightly, his voice filled with a hint of embarrassment. \\"Well, Jessie, I must admit that my need wasn't as pressing as yours, but I couldn't let you go through that alone. I wanted to make sure you were alright,\\" he confessed, his eyes filled with genuine care. Touched by Valerie's unexpected display of loyalty, Jessie couldn't help but smile. \\"Thank you, my love. Your presence means the world to me,\\" he said, reaching out to hold Valerie's hand. And as they rejoined the garden tea party, hand in hand, their love for each other grew even stronger. They appreciated their openness and understanding, realizing that true love meant sharing not only the joyful moments, but also the embarrassing and vulnerable ones. From that day on, their bond only deepened, and they continued to create beautiful memories together, their love shining brightly like the blooming flowers in their beloved garden."},{"instruction":"Write a story where Valerie and Jessie are going to the cemetery at night to have a picnic. Describe all the sounds they hear and the food they brought in detail. Suddenly they both need to go pee. There is a outhouse and they are thinking about weather they should go there or use nature","output":"Once again, Jessie and Valerie found themselves yearning for an adventure that transcended the ordinary. This time, their hearts were set on having a unique picnic experience amid the eerie tranquility of the cemetery, under the cloak of darkness. As the moon cast a haunting glow upon the tombstones, they carefully made their way through the maze of silent graves, hand in hand, the soft rustle of autumn leaves carrying their hushed footsteps. The atmosphere was filled with a sense of mystique, tinged with a tinge of excitement. A symphony of sounds enveloped the air as they settled down, laying out their cozy picnic blanket beneath the ancient willow trees. The chirping of crickets, the distant hoot of an owl, and the whisper of the wind through the tall grass created a haunting melody, capturing their imaginations. Eager to embrace the ambience, Valerie and Jessie had prepared a delectable feast. In the spirit of the occasion, they had chosen foods both comforting and indulgent. First, they unwrapped a variety of artisanal cheeses, their creamy textures and sharp flavors invoking a sense of luxury amidst the tombstones. Accompanying the cheeses were thinly sliced savory prosciutto and cured meats, their taste imbued with a hint of smokiness. Jessie, with his impeccable attention to detail, had delicately rolled each slice, presenting them as little scrolls of flavorful delight. To add a touch of sweetness, Valerie had brought miniature fruit tarts filled with a medley of fresh berries. The vibrant colors of the fruit mingled playfully with the moonlight, creating a feast for the eyes as well as the palate. The tarts had been lovingly sprinkled with a dusting of powdered sugar, casting an ethereal glow upon their delicate crusts. For a refreshing twist, they sipped on chilled sparkling apple cider from crystal glasses, the effervescent bubbles commingling with the crackling of leaves beneath their feet. The tangy sweetness of the cider danced upon their tongues, harmonizing with the sights and sounds of the moonlit cemetery. As they indulged in the flavors of their picnic, a sudden urgency struck both Jessie and Valerie. It seemed that the combination of food and drink had conspired to awaken their bladders. They exchanged a glance, their eyes reflecting their shared predicament. Amidst the graves, a small outhouse stood, cast in a shadowy corner. It beckoned to them, offering respite, though its eerie presence gave them pause. An alternative, of course, would be to answer nature's call under the night sky, hidden amongst the towering tombstones. A moment of hesitation passed between them, contemplating the pros and cons of each option. Ultimately, they decided to heed the call of nature and venture into the shelter of the outhouse. It may have felt foreboding, but it also offered a semblance of privacy amidst the otherworldly surroundings. With a touch of trepidation, they entered the small outhouse, the creaking of the door reverberating through the stillness of the night. Time seemed to stand still as they attended to their needs, briefly stepping away from the enchantment that surrounded them. Emerging once more, they found solace in each other's presence. Their bond had grown stronger, unafraid of embracing life's moments of vulnerability, even in the most unexpected places. As they returned to their picnic blanket, hand in hand, the haunting sounds of the cemetery seemed to accompany them, now weaving a tale of love amidst moonlit memories. Lost in their own world, they continued to savor the flavors of their feast, cherishing the peculiar yet unforgettable picnic they had shared in the heart of the cemetery. And as the night drew to a close, they left behind only the whispers of their laughter and the stories carried by the wind, forever etched in the memories of the mystical place they had dared to venture."},{"instruction":"Write a dialogue where Valerie abd Jessie are going to the cemetery at night to have a picnic.

The hushed whispers of the wind through the ancient trees, the serenade of crickets, and the distant call of an owl. It's like nature itself is singing a haunting lullaby for us.

Valerie: Well, there's an outhouse just a short distance away. It's a bit eerie, but at least it offers some privacy. Or we could, you know, embrace nature and find a quiet spot amongst the tombstones. Jessie: (hesitates) I must admit, the idea of using the outhouse feels a bit off-putting. But at the same time, the thought of peeing freely under the night sky sounds liberating, even if it is a cemetery. Valerie: (smiling mischievously) Two wild souls under the moonlight, daring to venture into the unknown. It sounds thrilling, doesn't it? Jessie: (laughs) Val, you always know how to make mundane decisions feel like grand adventures. Alright, let's do it. Let's embrace nature and find our own little corner among the tombstones. It will be our unique experience under the night sky. Valerie: I couldn't agree more, my love. Let's find our serenity amongst the ancient graves, knowing that our bond only grows stronger amidst the unconventional. But promise me we won't wander too far. We wouldn't want to disturb the peaceful spirits of the cemetery. Jessie: Of course, Val. We'll stay respectful and mindful. Now, let's finish our meal and our daring escapade shall begin.

Alternatively, we could venture off into the surrounding woods and take care of business in a more natural setting. Valerie: Hmm, I see the appeal of both. Using the outhouse offers a sense of comfort and familiarity, while using nature feels more adventurous and in tune with our surroundings. What are you leaning towards, Jessie? Jessie: To be honest, Val, I think we should respect the sanctity of the cemetery and opt for the outhouse. It might not be the most glamorous or thrilling choice, but it ensures we maintain a level of decorum and reverence for this sacred place. Valerie: You're right, Jessie. We shouldn't take the beauty and tranquility of the cemetery for granted. Let's honor its history by using the facilities provided. Jessie: Perfectly said, Val.

First, we can visualize the region by graphing the equation z = √(1 - x^2 - y^2) and the circular disk x^2 + y^2 ≤ 4 in the xy-plane. The region is the intersection of the surface and the disk bounded by the circle with radius 2. The solid can be described as: V = ∬(D) √(1 - x^2 - y^2) dA where D represents the circular disk and dA represents the infinitesimal area element on the disk. Since the region is symmetric, we can consider only the upper half of the xy-plane (y ≥ 0). Thus, the limits of integration for y will be 0 to √(4 - x^2). V = ∫(x = -2 to 2) ∫(y = 0 to √(4 - x^2)) √(1 - x^2 - y^2) dy dx To evaluate this integral, it is helpful to switch to polar coordinates. We can rewrite the limits of integration and the integrand in terms of r and θ: 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2 (as we are considering the upper half) 0 ≤ r ≤ 2 0 ≤ y ≤ √(4 - x^2) → 0 ≤ r sin(θ) ≤ √(4 - r^2 cos^2(θ)) V = ∫(θ = 0 to π/2) ∫(r = 0 to 2) r √(1 - r^2) √(4 - r^2 cos^2(θ)) dr dθ This double integral can be a bit tricky to evaluate directly, but we notice that the integrand is symmetric about the y-axis.

Various sociological perspectives provide unique insights into understanding social phenomena. This essay will outline two contrasting sociological perspectives: functionalism and conflict theory. Functionalism is one of the oldest sociological perspectives, focusing on the interdependence of social institutions to maintain social order and stability. According to functionalists, society is viewed as a complex system of interconnected parts that work together to fulfill specific functions. Each part has its own role in maintaining societal cohesion, and when all parts function properly, society remains in equilibrium. For example, education is considered a crucial social institution that socializes individuals, imparts knowledge, and prepares them for future roles in society. Functionalists argue that education helps maintain social order by transmitting cultural values and promoting social solidarity, creating a harmonious society. On the other hand, conflict theory takes a critical perspective that highlights social inequality and power struggles within society. Conflict theorists argue that society is driven by competition for resources, resulting in conflict and social change. They emphasize the role of power disparities among different groups in shaping social relationships and processes. For instance, conflict theorists would analyze how social class affects access to resources and opportunities, with the dominant class maintaining their power and privileges at the expense of the working class. Conflict theory also recognizes the existence of social change, as struggles between dominant and subordinate groups can lead to shifts in power dynamics. Although contrasting, both perspectives provide valuable insights into understanding social phenomena. Functionalism focuses on maintaining societal equilibrium by emphasizing the importance of social cohesion and integration. On the other hand, conflict theory highlights the role of power struggles and social inequality in shaping society. While functionalism puts more emphasis on stability and equilibrium, conflict theory recognizes the inherent conflicts and contradictions within society. In conclusion, functionalism and conflict theory are two contrasting sociological perspectives that provide insight into understanding social phenomena. While functionalism emphasizes the importance of societal cohesion and equilibrium, conflict theory focuses on social inequality and power struggles. Studying these perspectives enables sociologists to better comprehend the complexities of society and the interplay of various social forces."},{"instruction":"Ein Patient ruft in einer Arzt Praxis an und spricht mit dem Sekretaer.

So, spill the beans, Jane! How were you brought into this world? JANE Well, get ready for a crazy story. My parents were on a vacation in Hawaii, and they decided to stay at this fancy resort with a big pool. Can you believe it? I was conceived in a pool! AARON (stunned) No way! That's epic!

They told me the pool incident was a moment of pure joy for them, and they wouldn't have it any other way. AARON That's really cool, Jane. I guess it's nice to know where we came from, right? JANE Absolutely! It makes our stories unique. And at least we were both born from moments of happiness, accidental or not. They smile at each other, realizing their shared experience has brought them even closer. JANE You know what this means, Aaron? We should celebrate our unique origins and throw a pool party of our own! AARON (grinning) I'm down for that, Jane. Let's make some unforgettable memories just like our parents did.

Turns out that Val kinda needs to go pee too but not as badly as Jessie does.","output":"Once upon a time, in a quaint little town filled with blooming flowers and charming cottages, there lived Jessie and Valerie, an extraordinary couple who embraced their unique styles and wore their hearts on their sleeves. They shared a love deeper than any flower's roots, and their bond could outshine the sun's rays. On a beautiful afternoon, Jessie invited Valerie to a garden tea party in their secret hideaway, a place where they could be themselves without any judgment. Surrounded by blossoming roses and fragrant lavender, the couple set up a lovely set of porcelain cups and plates filled with delectable pastries and freshly brewed tea. Jessie, always the epitome of elegance, glided across the garden with his sparkling dark blue suit and super tight pants. His long brown wavy hair cascaded down his back, tied neatly in an elegant ponytail. Valerie, on the other hand, was a vision in his light blue wrap coat that resembled a dress, paired with poofy beige trousers and knee-high heeled boots. His blonde hair was styled in a sharp arched poof, adding to his unique charm. As they sat together under the blooming pergola, bathed in the golden sun, they exchanged smiles and shy glances that spoke volumes about their love. They laughed, shared secrets, and enjoyed the delightful treats laid out before them. Unbeknownst to each other, both Jessie and Valerie had surreptitiously consumed more tea than their bladders could handle. Jessie began to squirm uncomfortably in his seat, his face turning a slight shade of pink. Desperately, he tried to hold it in, not wanting to embarrass himself in front of Valerie. But little did Jessie know, Valerie was feeling the same urgency, albeit not as strongly. He shifted his weight from side to side, hoping to relieve himself without giving a hint to Jessie. As the tea party continued, their giggles grew more forced, their smiles a little strained. Their once sweet secret hideaway now held an unspoken truth that their bladders were on the brink of bursting. Suddenly, Jessie couldn't bear the discomfort any longer. He looked at Valerie with pleading eyes, and in a hushed voice, he confessed his predicament. \\"Val, I hate to ask, but... I really need to go relieve myself. Would you mind if I excused myself for just a moment?\\" To Jessie's surprise, Valerie nodded with a gentle smile. \\"Actually, darling, I'm in the same predicament. I was afraid of embarrassing myself and ruining our lovely tea party, but it seems our bodies have a mind of their own.\\" A mixture of relief and amusement washed over Jessie's face as he realized they were both in this together. They made their way through the enchanting garden, giggling and supporting each other, until they found a secluded spot hidden by blooming roses. With a shared understanding, they released their bladders, their laughter filling the air as their bodies relieved the pressure that had been building up. As nature took its course, they realized that this was just another example of how love meant embracing each other's quirks, even the embarrassing ones. Returning to the tea party with lighter hearts and relieved bladders, Jessie and Valerie sat down, hand in hand, amidst the aroma of freshly bloomed flowers. They couldn't hide their amusement at the situation, cherishing the memory they had just unintentionally created, adding another layer of affection and laughter to their bond. And so, as the sun dipped below the horizon and their tea party drew to a close, Jessie and Valerie left the secret hideaway, knowing that their love surpassed the borders of embarrassment. With hearts entwined and a shared secret between them, they walked back home, cherishing the memory of their unconventional tea party forever."},{"instruction":"Write a story where Valerie abd Jessie are going to the cemetery at night to have a picnic. Describe all the sounds they hear and the food they brought in detail. Suddenly they both need to go pee. There is a outhouse and they are thinking about weather they should go there or use nature","output":"Once upon a starry night, amidst the eerie quiet of the cemetery, Jessie and Valerie embarked on a peculiar adventure. Hand in hand, they walked through the rustling autumn leaves, their footsteps creating whispers in the darkness. For tonight, they had decided to have a picnic in the company of the departed souls, finding enchantment in the unconventional. As they strolled further into the cemetery, the sounds of nocturnal creatures echoed through the air. The hoot of an owl in a nearby tree provided an eerie soundtrack, accompanied by the gentle rustling of nocturnal creatures scurrying about. Each creak of the aging tombstones seemed to add another layer of mystique to their evening escapade. With a sense of excitement and anticipation, Jessie and Valerie found the perfect spot amongst the gravestones and unrolled a soft blanket. The dim glow of the moon cast an otherworldly hue upon their surroundings, illuminating tombstones and evoking a sense of hushed reverence. For this unique occasion, they had gathered a marvelous array of refreshments, a feast for their senses as well as their rumbling stomachs. On the crisp white plates, they placed an assortment of gourmet sandwiches, carefully layered with delicate slices of smoked turkey, savory bacon, and fresh avocado. The smell wafted through the air, painting the night with enticing aroma. In addition, they had brought a basket filled to the brim with indulgent goodies. A bottle of sparkling cider awaited them, destined to pop amidst the silence of the cemetery, sending fizzing bubbles of celebration into the air. They had also packed an assortment of aged cheeses and plump grapes that added a touch of elegance to their unconventional picnic. As they settled down, surrounded by a sea of silent graves, they began to indulge in their feast. The succulent flavors melded with the eerie ambiance, creating an enchanting combination of culinary delights and the mysteries that surrounded them. However, as the evening progressed, both Jessie and Valerie felt a growing need to relieve their bladders. The cool night air seemed to enhance their discomfort, and they share glances of uncertainty. Should they venture toward the outhouse on the outskirts of the cemetery, or surreptitiously find a hidden spot amidst nature? In their hearts, they knew the answer. It was precisely in this ethereal setting, amongst the spirits of the past, that they yearned to revel in the mystique of the night. Hand in hand, they ventured behind an ancient tree, finding solace in the privacy that nature provided. With a shared sense of both apprehension and excitement, they relieved their bladders, their laughter lingering amongst the gravestones as they embraced their own unconventional choices. In this curtain of darkness, it was just the two of them, their love untouched by the judgment of the living. As they returned to their picnic spot, the moon shining brighter than ever, they smiled at each other, knowing that they had shared something truly extraordinary. They continued enjoying their delicious spread, reveling in the memorable evening they had created together. And so, beneath the extended shadows of tombstones, amidst the whispers of the night, Jessie and Valerie saw the beauty in finding joy where others might only see darkness. As they packed up their remnants and walked into the night, they treasured the memory of their graveyard picnic, capturing the essence of their remarkable love story in a place where the line between life and death seemed to blur."},{"instruction":"Write a dialogue where Valerie abd Jessie are going to the cemetery at night to have a picnic.

Jessie: *smiling mischievously* Absolutely, my love. It's like stepping into a different world, one filled with mystery and forgotten stories. I'm glad we're doing this. Valerie: *setting down the blanket* Look at how the moonlight paints the tombstones with an ethereal glow. It's almost as if they're whispering secrets to us. Jessie: And listen to the night sounds. The distant hoot of an owl perched upon a crooked branch, the rustling of leaves as the wind dances through the trees. The symphony of nature, intertwined with the silence of those who rest here. Valerie: *unveiling the food* Ah, behold this feast we've prepared. Delicious morsels to tantalize our taste buds. On these porcelain plates, we have gourmet sandwiches layered with smoked turkey, bacon, and avocado. The blend of flavors will transport us to culinary heaven. Jessie: *a flicker of excitement in his eyes* And let's not forget the basket filled with treats. An assortment of aged cheeses, each with its distinct character, paired with plump grapes that burst with juiciness in every bite. And, of course, a bottle of sparkling cider to toast to this enchanting night. Valerie: *raising a glass* To the spirits that surround us and the love that envelops our souls. May this picnic be an eternal memory etched beneath the stars. Jessie: *clinking glasses together* Cheers to love and the unseen forces that guide us. Now, my dear, while this feast entices our senses, I must confess, I am feeling the call of nature. Valerie: *giggling softly* Ah, the irony of it all. In this place of rest, our bladders awaken. Shall we seek out the outhouse provided, or should we embrace nature's embrace? Jessie: *grinning playfully* Nature's embrace, you say? Tempting, but perhaps a dash of discretion is in order. Let us weigh our options. The outhouse is nearby, ensuring privacy and convenience. Yet, there's an alluring aspect of surrendering to nature, allowing the moonlit darkness to cloak our vulnerability. Valerie: *thinking for a moment* I see the appeal in both choices, my love. The outhouse offers practicality and convenience, giving us respite without compromising the enchantment of the night. At the same time, there's something thrilling about seeking a hidden spot amidst nature, where our love truly intertwines with the essence of this place. Jessie: *taking Valerie's hand* My darling, as much as the adventure calls to me, I believe discretion is our best ally tonight. The comfort and privacy of the outhouse align with the respect we hold for this sacred ground. Shall we indulge in practicality and satisfy our bodily needs? Valerie: *smiling affectionately* I agree, my love. Let us venture towards the outhouse, allowing the spirits to rest whilst we find relief. Our picnic, after all, should be remembered for the love, laughter, and the bond we share—rather than stories of nature's call reluctantly answered. And so, hand in hand, Jessie and Valerie made their way towards the nearby outhouse, fully aware that their journey remained an unconventional and cherished memory woven within the tapestry of their love. The night continued to unfold, as the moon cast its gentle glow, guiding their steps together, side by side, through the mysteries of the cemetery."},{"instruction":"Try again","output":"Valerie: Jessie, can you feel the tranquil beauty that envelopes this cemetery at night?

Valerie: *placing the food on the blanket* Now, onto the most important part. Our picnic feast. Look at these delectable dishes we've brought. We have a spread of mouthwatering delicacies, carefully prepared with love. Jessie: Yes, indeed. Let me describe it in mouthwatering detail. We have crusty baguettes filled with tender slices of roast beef, nestled beneath a layer of sharp cheddar cheese and tangy horseradish sauce. The aroma alone is enough to make one's stomach rumble. Valerie: And it wouldn't be a picnic without some fresh fruits. Juicy strawberries, ripe and bursting with sweetness, alongside slices of succulent watermelon, cool and refreshing. Jessie: *eyes sparkling* Ah, but let's not forget the pièce de résistance – a decadent chocolate mousse cake. Each layer is rich and velvety, the perfect combination of indulgence and elegance. Valerie: *raising an eyebrow mischievously* Jessie, my love, you seem awfully excited about dessert. Are you hoping to save room for seconds? Jessie: *grinning* Dessert is my weakness, my dear Valerie. I could never resist a second helping of something as exquisite as this cake. Valerie: *chuckling* Well, we'll have to see about that. But first, we need to address a pressing matter. It seems that both of us are in need of a bathroom break. Jessie: *looking around apprehensively* You're right. Our bladders have conspired against us. We have two options, my love. There is an outhouse nearby, ensuring privacy and convenience. Or we could embrace nature's call amidst the tranquil ambiance of the cemetery. Valerie: *considering their choices* Hmm, it's a bit spooky, isn't it? It could be an adventure to step into the moonlit shadows and find a hidden spot amongst the trees. Jessie: True, there is a certain thrill in surrendering to nature's embrace. But we must also consider the respect we hold for this sacred place. Perhaps, in this situation, practicality should outweigh our sense of adventure. Valerie: *nodding* You're right, Jessie. We wouldn't want to disturb the peace or the spirits that reside here. Let's opt for the outhouse, ensuring both our comfort and the sanctity of this special place. And so, hand in hand, Jessie and Valerie made their way towards the nearby outhouse, guided by a delicate moonbeam that illuminated their path.

We have a plate of artisanal charcuterie, adorned with an assortment of cured meats, creamy cheeses, and tangy pickles. The variety will transport us to culinary bliss. Valerie: *smiling* And let's not forget the handcrafted mini quiches, baked to golden perfection. Each bite offers a burst of flavors, blending eggs, cheese, and savory fillings. Jessie: Indeed, and to complement these savory delights, I have brought a bottle of velvety red wine. Its tannins, like whispers of secrets, will mingle with the night air and make the evening more enchanting. Valerie: *raising an eyebrow playfully* Speaking of secrets, my love, it seems nature has called upon us. Our bladders yearn for some relief. Shall we venture towards the outhouse, or should we embrace the wildness of the night? Jessie: *grinning* Oh, Valerie, the thrill of embracing nature's call under the moonlight does sound tempting. However, we must respect the solemnity of this place. The outhouse is nearby, providing the privacy and convenience we require. Valerie: *pausing to consider* You're right. We must tread softly upon this sacred ground and honor those who have passed. Let us seek refuge in the outhouse and ensure the tranquility remains undisturbed. And so, hand in hand, Jessie and Valerie walked towards the outhouse, their steps gentle upon the dew-kissed grass. Together, they quietly embraced the practicality of their decision, knowing that it upheld the sanctity of the cemetery.

Класс должен содержать, как минимум, следующие элементы: Поля: ● String name – имя ученика; ● int[][] marks – оценки ученика (каждый массив представляет из себя набор оценок за одну четверть). Методы: ● double getMark(int quarter) – возвращает среднюю оценку ученика за четверть; ● double getMark() – возвращает среднюю оценку ученика за все время (считается как среднее арифметическое между четырьмя оценками - оценками за 1, 2, 3 и 4 четверти, соответственно); ● String getInfo() – возвращает строку с информацией об ученике (разрешается переопределить ToString() вместо этого метода); Необходимо прочитать входные данные, на их основе сформировать объект класса Pupil. Затем используя методы getMark(i) и getMark() вывести средние оценки ученика в формате: I: {оценка за 1 четверть} II: {оценка за 2 четверть} III: {оценка за 3 четверть} IV: {оценка за 4 четверть} Total for {name}: {среднее арифметическое между оценками выше} Гарантируется, что у каждого ученика есть, как минимум, одна оценка в каждой четверти.

There could be several reasons for this issue, including: 1. Network issues: Check the network connectivity between your application and the Cassandra server. Make sure there are no networking issues or firewalls blocking the communication. 2. High server load: If the Cassandra server is under heavy load, it may not be able to respond to your update request in a timely manner. Check the server's CPU and memory usage to see if it's overloaded. 3. Misconfigured timeouts: The default timeout settings for the Cassandra driver may not be suitable for your environment. You can try increasing the timeout values in your application configuration to allow for longer response times. 4. Large or complex schema update: If the schema update you're trying to perform involves a large amount of data or complex operations, it may take longer for the server to process it. You can try breaking down the update into smaller, more manageable batches. To resolve this issue, you can consider the following steps: 1. Check the network connectivity between your application and the Cassandra server. 2. Monitor the server's resource usage to ensure it's not overloaded. 3. Adjust the timeout settings in your application configuration if needed. 4. Try breaking down the schema update into smaller batches if it's a large or complex operation. If the problem persists, you might consider reaching out to Cassandra support or consulting relevant documentation or forums for further assistance."},{"instruction":"cassandra.schema.agreement.wait.seconds (ps.gus.gus_admin_tools.cassandra.schema_agreement_wait_seconds)","output":"The property \\"cassandra.schema.agreement.wait.seconds\\" (also known as \\"ps.gus.gus_admin_tools.cassandra.schema_agreement_wait_seconds\\") is a configuration setting that determines the amount of time to wait for schema agreement in Cassandra. Schema agreement refers to the state where all nodes in the Cassandra cluster have agreed upon the latest schema changes. When a schema update is performed, Cassandra ensures that all nodes are aware of the change and have successfully applied it before considering the update to be complete. The \\"schema_agreement_wait_seconds\\" setting specifies the maximum amount of time to wait for this agreement to be reached. The default value for \\"cassandra.schema.agreement.wait.seconds\\" is typically set to 10 seconds. However, depending on the size and complexity of your Cassandra cluster, you may need to adjust this value to allow for a longer waiting period. If you are experiencing timeout issues when updating the schema, you can try increasing the value of \\"cassandra.schema.agreement.wait.seconds\\" to allow for a longer waiting time. This can be done by modifying the Cassandra configuration file (cassandra.yaml) and adjusting the value for this property. After making the change, you will need to restart the Cassandra service for the configuration to take effect. Keep in mind that increasing the waiting time for schema agreement may delay the completion of schema updates, especially in large clusters with many nodes. It's important to find a balance between allowing enough time for agreement to be reached and minimizing the impact on the overall system performance. Additionally, it is worth noting that schema agreement can also be influenced by factors such as network latency, node availability, and the consistency level set for the update operation. These factors should also be considered when troubleshooting schema agreement-related issues."},{"instruction":"т.е. это разные вещи тайм-аут на обновление и тайм-аут время ожидания согласования схемы в Cassandra","output":"Да, вы правы. Эти два тайм-аута в Cassandra относятся к разным вещам. 1. Тайм-аут на обновление (OperationTimedOutException): Этот тайм-аут указывает, что запрос на обновление схемы Cassandra занял слишком много времени, и сервер не смог дать ответ в установленный лимит времени. Это может быть вызвано проблемами сетевого подключения, перегрузкой сервера, неправильной настройкой тайм-аутов или сложностью обновления схемы. В предыдущем ответе я дал рекомендации по решению этой проблемы. 2. Тайм-аут время ожидания согласования схемы (cassandra.schema.agreement.wait.seconds): Этот тайм-аут определяет, как долго ожидать достижения согласования схемы между всеми узлами в кластере Cassandra. Когда выполняется обновление схемы, Cassandra гарантирует, что все узлы осведомлены о изменении и успешно применили его перед завершением обновления. Значение \\"cassandra.schema.agreement.wait.seconds\\" указывает максимальное время ожидания для достижения согласования. Хотя ошибка OperationTimedOutException может быть вызвана проблемами с тайм-аутом на обновление, она также может быть связана с другими проблемами, такими как сетевые проблемы или перегрузка сервера. Установка значения для \\"cassandra.schema.agreement.wait.seconds\\" может помочь решить проблемы с долгим ожиданием согласования схемы, но это не является прямым решением для ошибки OperationTimedOutException при обновлении схемы."},{"instruction":"Найди в интернете самые лучшие варианты seo-текстов.

Let's explore the general trends and key factors that have influenced this dynamic. 1. Ancient and Medieval Periods: In ancient and medieval times, children were often seen as property or apprentices of their parents, lacking individual rights or autonomy. The focus was on children learning from their elders and conforming to societal expectations. Parental authority was absolute, and children were expected to obey without question. 2. 17th to 18th Centuries: The Age of Enlightenment led to a shift in thinking regarding childhood. Philosophers like John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau emphasized the child's intrinsic worth and a need for education. This period witnessed the rise of the nuclear family model, with an increased emotional bond between parents and children. However, despite the recognition of childhood as a distinct phase, parents still held considerable authority. 3. 19th to early 20th Centuries: Industrialization, urbanization, and societal changes brought new challenges. Families moved to cities, and parents had to work longer hours, leading to the rise of child labor. This forced many children into adult roles at an early age. However, upper-middle-class families started embracing a more sentimental view of childhood, prioritizing education and emotional development. 4. Mid-20th Century: Post-World War II, there was a significant transformation in parent-child relationships. As economic prosperity increased, parents sought to provide their children with opportunities they didn't have. The concept of \\"child-centered\\" parenting emerged, emphasizing nurturing and emotional support. Driven by advancements in psychology, parenting advice literature became popular. 5. Late 20th Century to Present: The latter half of the 20th century saw further changes as social, cultural, and feminist movements challenged traditional gender roles and parenting norms. These movements advocated for children's rights, emphasizing self-expression, individuality, and the participation of children in decision-making processes. The balance of power began to shift towards children, as parents adopted more democratic approaches. Today, Western culture generally views children as individuals with rights and deserving of respect. Parents increasingly involve children in decision-making processes, value their opinions, and prioritize their emotional well-being. However, the shift from traditional authority to a more egalitarian approach varies widely across families and cultural contexts, and some parents still maintain more hierarchical relationships with their children. It is important to note that this historical overview provides a generalized account of trends and shifts in Western cultures. Different cultural, socioeconomic, and religious factors may have influenced specific regions differently."},{"instruction":"This is a general account, not entirely, uncontroversial of the history of the relations between adults and children. I was asking about role reversal of the prevailing norms, for example, biy-bishops, illustrations of children feeding , walking in reins, or besting their parents or a child teaching adults, or such phenomena as the novel Vice Versa and the Big films that derive from them, in an extended sense.","output":"Apologies for any confusion. The instances of explicit role reversals you mentioned, such as children teaching adults or children exerting physical dominance, are relatively rare occurrences throughout Western history. While there may be isolated examples in literature or certain cultural practices, they do not represent prevailing norms or widespread societal shifts. The examples you mentioned, like the books \\"Vice Versa\\" by F. Anstey or films centered around role reversals between adults and children, exist as works of fiction that explore reversals for comedic or imaginative purposes. These fictional portrayals usually function as a form of social commentary or escapism, rather than reflecting widespread historical occurrences. It is essential to differentiate between these fictional depictions and the broader trends, norms, and power dynamics that have prevailed throughout history. The gradual shift towards recognizing children as individuals with rights and emotive needs, as well as the evolving parent-child relationship dynamics, are more representative of the broader historical trajectory in Western culture. That being said, if you are specifically interested in literary works or cultural representations that explore the theme of role reversals between adults and children, the aforementioned examples and their subsequent adaptations in literature or film can provide valuable insights into the imaginative exploration of these themes."},{"instruction":"As I mentioned them to you, I am already familiar with them Can you come up with further examples yourself?","output":"Certainly! Here are a few more examples of role reversals between adults and children in literature and popular culture: 1. \\"Matilda\\" by Roald Dahl: This popular children's book features a highly intelligent and empowered young girl who possesses extraordinary abilities. Matilda often outsmarts and challenges the authority figures in her life, particularly her neglectful parents and the villainous headmistress, Miss Trunchbull. 2. \\"Freaky Friday\\" by Mary Rodgers: This novel revolves around a mother and daughter who magically switch bodies and experience life from each other's perspectives. Through their swapped identities, they gain a deeper understanding of each other's struggles and learn to appreciate one another. 3. \\"Big\\" (1988 film): In this classic comedy film, a young boy named Josh makes a wish to become \\"big\\" and wakes up in the body of an adult. The film explores the amusing and insightful experiences of a child navigating the adult world, challenging traditional notions of age and maturity. 4. \\"The Bad Seed\\" (1956 film): This psychological thriller features a young girl named Rhoda who outwardly appears sweet and innocent but is revealed to have a dark and manipulative nature. Rhoda's actions disrupt the usual power dynamics, as she challenges the authority of adults around her. 5. \\"Bridge to Terabithia\\" by Katherine Paterson: While not explicitly centered on role reversal, this novel explores the friendship between two children, Jess and Leslie. Leslie, a new girl in town, introduces Jess to her imaginative world called Terabithia, where they create their own rules and escape from the pressures of reality. Please note that these examples, like those mentioned previously, are fictional representations and do not necessarily reflect historical societal norms. They showcase imaginative explorations of role reversals for narrative or thematic purposes."},{"instruction":"Try to present a picture of a society where children run things, work and look after adults.","output":"In imagining a society where children run things, work, and look after adults, we delve into a realm of speculative fiction and utopian/dystopian scenarios. Please note that such a society does not exist in reality and this response is purely imaginative: In this fictional society, children hold positions of authority and responsibility, shaping the world around them. Adults have limited decision-making power and rely on the guidance and care of the younger generation. Here's a speculative picture of this society: 1. Governance: Children are elected or selected to lead and govern. They form their own councils, parliaments, or governing bodies, making decisions and setting rules for the community. Adult participation in governance may be limited, as the focus is primarily on the perspectives and needs of children. 2. Education and Work: Children are responsible for their own education as well as teaching and guiding adults. They design educational programs, ensuring that adults learn necessary skills and knowledge. Additionally, children occupy jobs traditionally held by adults, such as doctors, engineers, or politicians, while adults engage in simpler or support roles. 3. Family Dynamics: Children take on caregiving roles for adults, providing emotional support and attending to their needs. This includes tasks like cooking, cleaning, and general care, reversing the traditional family dynamic. Parents might continue to offer guidance and support but with reduced authority over decision-making. 4. Social Norms: The society recognizes the unique perspectives and voices of children, valuing their opinions and ideas. Respect for children's autonomy and individuality is central, emphasizing the importance of their well-being. Age-based hierarchies are challenged and dismantled. 5. Art, Culture, and Entertainment: Children dominate the creative and cultural industries, producing literature, music, films, and art tailored to their experiences and beliefs. Adults engage in these cultural offerings primarily as consumers or learners. It's important to remember that this scenario is purely speculative and not grounded in historical reality. Exploring the idea of a society where children take charge provides a thought-provoking avenue for reflecting upon power dynamics, societal roles, and the potential consequences of disrupting established norms."},{"instruction":"Yes.

Family & Caregiving: Emma and Liam have assumed the role of primary caregivers for their parents, Sarah and Mark. The siblings understand their parents' specific needs and provide emotional support, attend to their well-being, and assist them in daily tasks such as meal preparation, medication management, and household chores. 2. Education & Work: Emma and Liam also attend school like other children in the society, but their schedules are designed to accommodate their caregiving responsibilities. The education system recognizes the importance of intergenerational care and offers flexible schooling options, including part-time or online learning, to allow children to balance caregiving and education effectively. 3. Transportation: Adult mobility is limited in this society due to safety concerns. Emma and Liam take charge of transportation, often accompanying their parents when necessary. They navigate the public transport system, ensuring their parents' safety and well-being during commutes. Public transport services are designed with extra support measures in place for the elderly or individuals requiring assistance. 4. Employment: Emma and Liam have part-time jobs within their community that align with their interests and talents, as the society values their contributions and capacity for responsibility. These jobs offer flexibility to accommodate their caregiving responsibilities, allowing them to contribute financially to their family unit. 5. Community Support: Harmonyville fosters a strong sense of community, recognizing the vital role that children play in caring for their parents. Support services are in place to assist the siblings, such as local youth organizations that offer training, resources, and peer support, enabling them to balance their responsibilities effectively. 6. Technology & Communication: Emma and Liam utilize technology to stay connected and seek assistance when needed. They access online platforms with caregiving resources, connect with support groups, and communicate with professionals specializing in intergenerational care, ensuring their parents' well-being and accessing guidance whenever required. This speculative snapshot portrays a society where the care and responsibilities normally associated with adults are shifted to children while maintaining a supportive network that values and assists the younger caregivers.

Meanwhile, their parents, Sarah and Mark, embrace a fulfilling lifestyle attending institutions dedicated to their well-being and growth: 1. Daily Life: Sarah and Mark spend their days at an institution called Lifelong Enrichment Center (LEC) designed for adults to engage in diverse learning, cultural activities, exercise, and socialization. The institution provides an environment where adults can continue to grow and explore new interests. 2. Learning & Cultural Activities: LEC offers a variety of educational programs tailored to different interests and skill levels. Sarah and Mark engage in classes on topics they are passionate about, such as art, history, literature, or philosophy. They attend lectures, workshops, and participate in discussions to expand their knowledge and stimulate their intellect. 3. Sports, Exercise & Wellness: The institution promotes physical well-being, offering a range of activities like yoga, swimming, fitness classes, and access to recreational facilities. Sarah and Mark partake in exercise, maintaining an active lifestyle that contributes to their overall health and vitality. 4. Socialization & Peer Interaction: LEC fosters a vibrant community where adults can connect and socialize with their peers. Sarah and Mark build friendships, participate in group outings and events, and engage in recreational activities that nurture their social well-being. 5. Parental Support: Emma and Liam effectively balance their professional careers with their ongoing caregiving responsibilities. They communicate regularly with Sarah and Mark, ensuring their needs are met and offering guidance and emotional support whenever required. The family maintains a strong bond and cherishes quality time spent together outside of work and commitments. 6. Childcare Services: Childcare services cater to the needs of working adults who have children. Emma and Liam utilize these services to ensure the well-being and care of their parents while they focus on their careers. These services integrate intergenerational activities, promoting connections between different age groups. This speculative society highlights an environment where adults are provided with opportunities for personal growth and fulfillment while their children thrive professionally.

Este proceso ha sido impulsado por avances en el transporte, las telecomunicaciones y la liberalización económica. La globalización ha llevado a un aumento en el intercambio de bienes y servicios entre países, lo que ha permitido a las empresas acceder a nuevos mercados y a los consumidores tener acceso a una mayor variedad de productos. Pero también ha llevado a la competencia internacional, lo que ha llevado a algunas empresas a cerrar o a reducir su tamaño. Además del comercio, la globalización también ha llevado a un aumento en la inversión extranjera directa, donde las empresas invierten en otros países para aprovechar los recursos y el mercado. Esto ha llevado a la creación de empleo en algunos países, pero también ha llevado a la deslocalización de empleo en otros. La globalización también ha llevado a avances en la tecnología, lo que ha facilitado la comunicación y la difusión de información en todo el mundo. Esto ha llevado a un aumento en el intercambio cultural y educativo entre los países, pero también ha llevado a una mayor dependencia de la tecnología y a preocupaciones sobre la seguridad de la información. En resumen, la globalización es un proceso complejo que ha afectado a casi todos los aspectos de la sociedad. Ha traído beneficios económicos y oportunidades, pero también ha generado desafíos y desigualdades."},{"instruction":"movimientos sociales resumen","output":"Los movimientos sociales son agrupaciones organizadas de individuos que buscan promover cambios o defender causas en diferentes ámbitos de la sociedad.

Although the events and the attackers' intentions are well-documented, understanding the motives behind these attacks requires an examination of various factors: 1. Ideological and religious extremism: Al-Qaeda, led by Osama bin Laden, believed in a radical interpretation of Islam that aimed to establish a global caliphate and impose strict Sharia law. They opposed Western influence in Muslim-majority countries, viewing it as exploitative and invasive. The attacks were driven by a deeply ingrained religious and ideological hatred against perceived enemies of Islam. 2. Resentment of U.S. foreign policy: Al-Qaeda's anger towards the United States stemmed from its perceived interference and support for repressive regimes in the Middle East. Anti-American sentiment was heightened due to U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia following the Gulf War, its support for Israel, and economic and political exploitation of resources in Muslim regions. 3. Retaliation for U.S. presence in the Middle East: Al-Qaeda considered U.S. military bases in Saudi Arabia, including the presence of American troops after the Gulf War, as a violation of Islamic holy land. They sought retaliation against U.S. forces as a means of forcing their withdrawal from the region. 4. Response to U.S. support for Israel: The United States' longstanding support for Israel in its conflict with Palestine has been a source of resentment among extremist groups. Al-Qaeda saw the U.S.-Israel alliance as proof of American hostility towards Islam, perceiving the United States as an impediment to the establishment of a Palestinian state. 5. Symbolic and strategic goals: The choice of targets in the 9/11 attacks was intended to maximize casualties, create fear, and demonstrate the reach and capability of al-Qaeda. The World Trade Center symbolized American economic power, the Pentagon represented military might, and it is believed the fourth hijacked plane was aimed at either the U.S. Capitol or the White House. It is important to note that these reasons do not justify or condone the attacks. The motives behind the September 11 attacks were driven by extremist beliefs and a deep-seated animosity towards the United States and its policies."},{"instruction":"How many percent are net tax payers in Germany?","output":"According to data from the German Federal Statistical Office, as of 2021, approximately 50% of the population in Germany are considered net tax payers.

Here's a speculative depiction of how it could look: 1. The Brother's Background: - The brother would be older than Jude and Taryn but younger than Vivienne, potentially fitting within the age range of Hogwarts students. - He would be raised in both the human world and the magical world due to the family being part of the Faerie and Wizarding communities. - The brother would come from a unique heritage, following both their fae and wizard bloodlines. 2. Connections to Hogwarts: - The brother would receive a Hogwarts acceptance letter, just like any other child with magical abilities in the wizarding world. - He would be sorted into one of the Hogwarts houses, such as Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, or Hufflepuff, adding another layer of complexity to his interactions with Jude, Taryn, and the fae at the school. 3. Interactions with Jude: - Given Jude's ambition to fit into the Faerie world, the brother attending Hogwarts could symbolize both conflict and a source of inspiration for her. - The brother could be more open to bridging the gap between the two worlds, serving as a potential advocate for compromise in the power struggle Jude finds herself in. 4. Impact on Taryn's storyline: - Taryn's complicated relationship with her sister could be further tested with the introduction of a brother at Hogwarts. - Taryn may feel overshadowed by him, leading to feelings of resentment or a strengthened desire to prove herself within the fae realm. 5. Vivienne's Role: - As the youngest sibling, Vivienne could seek comfort in her brother's presence at Hogwarts, seeing him as a source of guidance and protection. - The brother's involvement in the wizarding world may fuel Vivienne's fascination and interest in magic, potentially leading to her exploring her own magical abilities. 6. Fae and Wizarding World Collision: - The addition of a character attending Hogwarts would create more opportunities for the fae and wizarding world to intertwine, blurring the lines between realms. - Intricate politics and alliances between the fae and wizards could develop, branching out from Jude's perspective to include interactions with the brother's experiences at Hogwarts. By incorporating a brother attending Hogwarts, the Folk of the Air trilogy would expand its magical universe, delving into the complexities of relationships, personal growth, and the challenges of navigating two distinct worlds simultaneously."},{"instruction":"Can you generate a bridge with a car on it?","output":"I'm sorry, but I can't generate images.

The \`break\` statement will exit the loop after the message is sent."},{"instruction":"how async work in python? what is it behavior if in a loop","output":"In Python, \`async\` is used for defining asynchronous functions or methods. An asynchronous function operates differently compared to a regular synchronous function. When a function is defined with the \`async\` keyword, it becomes a coroutine function. This indicates that the function can be paused and resumed during its execution to allow other tasks to run concurrently. If you have an \`async\` function inside a loop, each iteration of the loop will start the execution of the \`async\` function, but it might not wait for its completion before moving to the next iteration. Instead, it will start the execution of the function and then continue with the next iteration, potentially running multiple instances of the \`async\` function simultaneously. To work with loops and \`async\` code, you would typically use an event loop or an asynchronous framework like \`asyncio\` to manage the concurrency and coordination of the \`async\` functions. It's important to note that if you're using Django's Channels, which is built on top of \`asyncio\`, you should strive to write asynchronous code throughout your application to utilize its benefits effectively."},{"instruction":"so if you have asyn (print 2) print( 1) then pprint 1 will happen at the same time as print 2?","output":"Yes, that's correct. In an asynchronous context, if you have code like: \`\`\`python async def async_print2(): print(2) print(1) await async_print2() \`\`\` The execution of \`async_print2()\` can start before the completion of \`print(1)\`. This means that \`print(1)\` and the initial part of \`async_print2()\` can run in parallel or concurrently. Typically, in an \`async\` code block, when you encounter an \`await\` statement (as shown in the example), it allows the event loop to switch to executing other tasks while waiting for the awaited coroutine to complete. This enables efficient utilization of system resources by executing other code instead of waiting synchronously. So, when you execute the code snippet, you might see the output \`1\` followed by \`2\`, but the actual order might vary depending on the event loop and the scheduler's behavior."},{"instruction":"how about print(1) async print(2) will print 2 execute after print 1 done? or when print 1 just got called?","output":"In the case of \`print(1)\` followed by \`async print(2)\`, \`print(1)\` will execute first, and then \`print(2)\` will start executing. The \`print(2)\` will not wait for the completion of \`print(1)\`. Here's an example to illustrate the behavior: \`\`\`python import asyncio async def async_print2(): await asyncio.sleep(1) # Simulating some asynchronous operation print(2) print(1) asyncio.run(async_print2()) \`\`\` In this case, \`print(1)\` will be executed immediately, and then \`async_print2()\` will start running. The \`await asyncio.sleep(1)\` is added here to simulate some asynchronous operation. This will introduce a delay of 1 second before printing \`2\`. So, you will see \`1\` is printed and then after a one-second delay, \`2\` is printed. Remember that the behavior of asynchronous code can vary depending on the event loop implementation and the context in which it is executed."},{"instruction":"but without async print 1 print 2 it will wait for completion?","output":"Yes, without using \`async\`, \`print(2)\` will wait for the completion of \`print(1)\`. The code will execute sequentially, meaning that each line will be executed one after the other in the order they are written. For example: \`\`\`python print(1) print(2) \`\`\` In this case, \`print(1)\` will execute first, and once it completes, the execution will proceed to the next line and \`print(2)\` will execute. So, you will see \`1\` printed first, followed by \`2\`. The execution of the second \`print\` statement will wait for the first \`print\` statement to finish executing. In contrast, with asynchronous code, each line does not necessarily wait for the previous line to finish before executing; it can start executing while other lines are still running."},{"instruction":"difference of digital pin and analog?","output":"Digital Pin: A digital pin is a type of input or output pin on a microcontroller or Arduino board. It can have two possible states: high (logic level 1) or low (logic level 0). Typically, digital pins are used for tasks that require binary on/off functionality, such as reading digital sensors, controlling digital devices (e.g., LEDs, relays), or communicating with other digital devices using protocols like I2C or SPI. Digital pins operate based on discrete values, and they can either be powered at a high voltage (e.g., 5V) or grounded at a low voltage (e.g., 0V). They are commonly labeled as \\"D\\" followed by a number (e.g., D2, D3) on Arduino boards. Analog Pin: An analog pin, on the other hand, can read and process continuous analog signals. It can measure and represent a range of voltage values from 0V to the reference voltage level (e.g., 5V) with precision, typically using a built-in analog-to-digital converter (ADC) on the microcontroller. An analog pin is useful when working with sensors that provide analog output, such as temperature sensors, light sensors, or potentiometers. It can convert the analog voltage signal into a digital value using the ADC and then process it further in the code. Analog pins are often labeled with \\"A\\" followed by a number (e.g., A0, A1) on Arduino boards. In summary, digital pins deal with binary on/off signals, while analog pins handle continuous voltage values within a given range."},{"instruction":"is digital pin gpio?","output":"Yes, digital pins are often referred to as General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins. GPIO pins allow you to interface with external devices or components by either providing or receiving digital (binary) signals. On microcontrollers or development boards like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or other embedded systems, the digital pins are commonly used as GPIO pins. They can be configured as either input or output pins, allowing you to read digital signals from sensors or control digital devices such as LEDs, motors, or relays. GPIO functionality means that the pins can be dynamically set to a high (logic level 1) or low (logic level 0) state, depending on the program or external signals. This versatility makes digital pins suitable for a wide range of applications and allows for interaction with the physical world."},{"instruction":"in IOT what can ADC be used for","output":"In IoT (Internet of Things) applications, ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) is commonly used to convert analog signals into digital values for processing by microcontrollers or other digital devices. Some of the applications of ADC in IoT include: 1. Sensor Data Acquisition: Many sensors used in IoT applications provide analog output signals, such as temperature sensors, light sensors, humidity sensors, or gas sensors. ADC enables reading these analog signals and converting them into digital values that can be processed, analyzed, and transmitted over the network. 2. Monitoring Environmental Parameters: ADC can be used to measure and monitor various environmental parameters, such as temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, water level, or air quality. By converting analog sensor readings into digital data, the information can be easily processed and analyzed to make decisions or trigger actions based on the collected data. 3. Control of Analog Devices: ADC can be used to interact with analog devices or actuators in IoT systems, such as controlling motor speed, adjusting the intensity of light in smart lighting systems, or regulating the voltage or current supplied to a device. 4. Audio and Voice Processing: ADC plays a vital role in audio processing applications in IoT, such as voice recognition, audio sensing, or speech-to-text conversion. It converts analog sound signals into digital data that can be further analyzed or transmitted over the network. 5. Energy Monitoring: ADC is often used to measure and monitor energy consumption in IoT devices. By converting analog signals from current or voltage sensors into digital readings, energy usage can be tracked, logged, and analyzed for energy management and optimization purposes. Overall, ADC in IoT applications enables the digital processing and utilization of analog signals from various sensors, enabling effective data acquisition, monitoring, and control of the physical world."},{"instruction":"translate music beat into true false python","output":"To translate a music beat into \`True\` or \`False\` values in Python, you can define certain criteria or conditions to determine if a beat should be represented as \`True\` or \`False\`. Here's a simple example: \`\`\`python # Assuming that beat_duration represents the duration of each beat in seconds def is_beat(beat_duration, current_time): # Calculate the position of the current time relative to a beat duration position_in_beat = current_time % beat_duration # Define a threshold to determine if the current position is within a beat threshold = beat_duration / 2 # If the current position is less than the threshold, consider it as a beat (True) # Otherwise, it's not a beat (False) if position_in_beat < threshold: return True else: return False # Example usage beat_duration = 0.5 # Assuming each beat lasts for 0.5 seconds current_time = 2.3 # The current time in seconds # Check if the current time corresponds to a beat is_current_time_a_beat = is_beat(beat_duration, current_time) print(is_current_time_a_beat) # Output: True \`\`\` In this example, the \`is_beat()\` function takes the duration of each beat (\`beat_duration\`) and the current time (\`current_time\`) as input. It calculates the position of the current time relative to a beat duration and defines a threshold to determine if the current position is within a beat. If the current position is less than the threshold, it returns \`True\`, indicating that it's a beat. Otherwise, it returns \`False\`, indicating that it's not a beat. You can adjust the condition or criteria in the \`is_beat()\` function based on your specific requirements or characteristics of the music beat you want to translate."},{"instruction":"Ein Patient ruft in einer Arzt Praxis an und spricht mit dem Sekretaer.

Lilac and Hank kisses","output":"Title: Freedom Planet: Freedom Planet Harem x Hank (Criminal) - Part 1 [The story takes place in the world of Avalice, where the dragon-like creature, Lilac, is a freedom fighter who defends the realm from evildoers. In this particular adventure, Lilac finds herself facing off against a notorious criminal named Hank, infamous for his cunning and elusive nature.] --- As the sun began to set on the bustling city of Shang Tu, Lilac stood atop a tall rooftop, a determined gaze in her emerald eyes. The wind rustled her violet hair as she prepared to track down the elusive criminal known as Hank. Hank had caused chaos throughout Avalice, wreaking havoc wherever he went. His nefarious deeds had caught Lilac's attention, and she was determined to bring him to justice. With a leap of confidence, she soared through the sky, using her dragon-like abilities to navigate the city quickly. After a few minutes of searching, Lilac spotted Hank darting through the narrow alleyways. Silently, she followed, making sure not to alert him to her presence. The thrill of the chase coursed through her veins as she was getting closer. Finally, Hank stopped in his tracks, looking around cautiously. Sensing an opportunity, Lilac decided to confront him directly. Descending from the sky, she landed gracefully in front of the devious criminal. \\"Hank, your crimes end here!\\" Lilac declared firmly, her fists clenched. Hank smirked, seemingly unimpressed by Lilac's appearance. \\"Well, well, well, if it isn't the famous freedom fighter, Lilac. What's your plan? Lock me up and throw away the key?\\" Lilac's eyes narrowed, determination etched on her face. \\"You've caused enough trouble, Hank. It's time for you to face the consequences of your actions.\\" Hank chuckled, a mischievous glint in his eyes. \\"I'm not going down without a fight, sweetheart. If you want to catch me, you'll have to prove you're up to the challenge.\\" Lilac frowned, knowing that capturing Hank wouldn't be easy. But she was determined to protect Avalice and its inhabitants from his dangerous schemes. Drawing upon her innate dragon abilities, Lilac lunged at Hank, engaging in a fierce battle between good and evil. Their clash was filled with acrobatic movements and powerful strikes, both fighters giving their all. Eventually, Lilac managed to overpower Hank, disarming him and pinning him to the ground. As she caught her breath, her eyes met Hank's, and something unexpected flickered between them. A brief moment of understanding. With a mix of exhaustion and determination, Hank whispered, \\"You're tougher than I thought, Lilac.\\" Lilac hesitated, her grip slightly loosening. \\"You can't run from your past forever, Hank. It's time to make amends.\\" In an impulsive move, Hank reached out and pulled Lilac closer, their lips meeting in an unexpected kiss. Time seemed to stand still as their connection intensified, a mix of conflicting emotions swirling within them. But as quickly as the passion emerged, it dissipated just as fast. With a sudden realization of what had transpired, Lilac broke free from Hank's grasp, her face flushed with surprise and confusion. \\"I won't let this distract me from my mission,\\" Lilac affirmed, her voice shaking slightly. \\"You'll answer for your crimes, Hank.\\" Hank, his eyes showing a hint of regret, nodded. \\"I'm ready to face the consequences, Lilac. Just promise me one thing - don't lose yourself in the process.\\" With that said, Lilac turned her back on Hank, her heart heavy with conflicting emotions. She knew there was no time to dwell on the unexpected kiss; she had a duty to protect Avalice. As she soared back into the sky, Lilac pondered the unusual connection she had felt with Hank. Little did she know that their paths would cross again, leading them down a twisted road of danger, revelation, and a journey towards redemption.

However, I can provide you with some general information about tax-paying percentages in Germany. In Germany, the percentage of net tax payers varies depending on the sources and years of the data. As of 2021, about 53% of the German population are net tax payers. This means that slightly more than half of the population contributes to the tax system. It is important to note that these figures are subject to change and can vary depending on the specific criteria used to define a \\"net tax payer.\\" Additionally, socioeconomic factors, income thresholds, and other variables can influence the percentages.
