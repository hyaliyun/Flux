Movie plot title: My Summer of Love Movie plot: On a hot sunny summer day in Yorkshire, Mona (Natalie Press) is a young teenage girl pushing her broken-down motorbike down a hill. While Mona rests in the grass off the road, another teenage girl named Tamsin (Emily Blunt) happens by. She is riding on horseback and chances upon Mona. While walking back to Tamsin's large country house, they introduce themselves and learn that they come from completely opposing background; Tamsin is from an upper middle class family and has recently been suspended from boarding school for being a bad influence; drinking alcohol. Mona, on the other hand, comes from a dysfunctional family, and her brother, Phil (Paddy Considine), who has recently been released from prison, is the only remaining member of her family still alive. Both of the girls seem to regard their lives as mundane.When Mona arrives home, she finds her brother in their mother's former pub, pouring all of the alcohol into the sink. He has undergone an extreme religious transformation during his stint in prison and regards his activity as part of his preparation for a rally for Christian converts, much to Mona's annoyance.That night, Mona meets her lover, Ricky. They have sex in his car, after which he breaks up with her. Mona angrily turns down Ricky's offer to drive her home. The next day, Mona arrives at Tamsin's in order to escape from the Christian rally organised by her brother. The girls begin to bond as they spend the day drinking and smoking while talking about the problems they face in their lives.

For four years, she was Hollywood's biggest box-office star representing the kind of sweet, innocent girl that everyone wanted as their daughter. However, years later, she reappeared as a successful politician. Shirley Temple was born in Santa Monica, California on 23 April 1928. Encouraged by her mother, she learned to dance while she was just three. In 1934, Stand Up and Cheer became her first film and the film was a great success. At the age of six she was earning 1,250 a week -- more than 21,000 at today's values. Across the world, audiences flocked to see her in films such as Little Miss Marker, The Little Colonel and The Littlest Rebel. In 1935 she was awarded a special Oscar (Academy Award) and her foot and hand prints were added to those of stars such as Jean Harlow and Mary Pickford outside Grauman's Chinese theatre in Hollywood. The peak of her film career came in 1939 when The Little Princess became a box-office success. Temple starred in a total of 43 feature films. But she found it difficult to maintain her film career in adulthood and retired from Hollywood in 1950. She disappeared from the spotlight for nearly 20 years. She returned to the public eye in 1967, as a Republican candidate for Congress. When Nixon became president, he rewarded her with an appointment to the American delegation to the United Nations. Then, in 1974, President Ford appointed her the United States Ambassador to Ghana. George Bush Snr, appointed her Ambassador to Czechoslovakia. Shirley Temple drew a line between her childhood stardom and her later political career. \\"Some people are stuck on this image of the little girl,\\" she once said. \\"She is not me. We shouldn't live in the past; my life is now.\\" Nevertheless, for many across the world, the name Shirley Temple always called to mind a superstar child. Options: A She won a special Oscar.

To date, more than 150 people in the country have been infected with Mers. Also on Tuesday, Germany reported its first death from the disease. The 65-year-old man died in a clinic in the north-western city of Osnabruck, German media reports say. The South Korean health ministry said two hospitals would begin the plasma treatment trials. The outbreak in South Korea originated from a 68-year-old man who had travelled to the Middle East. He was diagnosed as the country's first Mers patient last month. Four new cases were reported there on Tuesday, as well as three deaths. Officials emphasise that the number of new cases is decreasing, but there is still widespread fear and misinformation. Health workers are spraying disinfectant inside karaoke rooms and other businesses, and teachers are sprinkling salt on school grounds in a misplaced attempt to protect themselves as many schools reopen this week. There is currently no cure or vaccine that can protect people from Mers. The disease is caused by a coronavirus from the same family as the one that triggered China's deadly 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) and is most likely spread by coughs and sneezes.

This French sentence provides a descriptive and vivid image of a beautiful day. Let's break down each part of the sentence: 1. \\"Le soleil\\" (the sun) - \\"Le\\" is the masculine singular definite article, which corresponds to \\"the\\" in English. \\"Soleil\\" is the French term for \\"sun.\\" 2. \\"brille\\" (is shining) - \\"Brille\\" is the third person singular form of the verb \\"briller,\\" which means \\"to shine.\\" It is conjugated in the present tense, indicating that the action is occurring now. 3. \\"et\\" (and) - \\"Et\\" is a coordinating conjunction used to link words or phrases of equal importance. In this case, it connects the two clauses in the sentence. 4. \\"les oiseaux\\" (the birds) - \\"Les\\" is the plural definite article, again corresponding to \\"the\\" in English. \\"Oiseaux\\" is the plural form of the French noun \\"oiseau,\\" which means \\"bird.\\" 5. \\"chantent\\" (are singing) - \\"Chantent\\" is the third person plural form of the verb \\"chanter,\\" meaning \\"to sing.\\" Like \\"brille,\\" it is conjugated in the present tense. Thus, the French sentence \\"Le soleil brille et les oiseaux chantent\\" paints a picturesque scene of a bright and harmonious day, with the sun shining and birds singing. This sentence can be used to describe an idyllic outdoor setting or to express a feeling of happiness and contentment.

He was born in 1371. Eleven years later, he was caught by the army of a rich young man called Zhu Di and made to work for him. Over time the rich man saw that Zheng He was very clever and strong and they became close friends. In 1403 Zhu Di was made the King of China and he asked Zheng He to join his government. The King wanted to learn more about the world and show other countries his power. He ordered many new ships to be built and made Zheng He their leader. between 1405 and 1433, Zheng He led seven sea trips to different parts of the world. He certainly travelled to India, Africa and the Middle East. A few people think his ships have even reached South America and Australia. Each trip lasted between two and four years and it is believed he sailed more than 50,000 kms during the years of his travels.Zheng He led a fleet with 28,000 men and over 300 ships, such as boats for food, water and even soldiers' horses. On these trips he brought with him many Chinese goods like silk and medicine to give to foreign kings or to sell for local goods. He returned from each trip with boats filled with expensive things such as gold and treasures, foreign guests and strange animals like a giraffe. It is a pity that we may never learn everything about Zheng He' s travels. The Columbus of the east, Zheng He, died in 1433. After that, the new king, had these trips stopped and he burned almost all the books about Zheng He's travels, because he believed the trips were unlucky and too expensive.

The Panthera tigris sudanensis is a recognised subspecies of tiger , not scientifically claimed , allegedly living in Africa . Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","output":"Though the two sentences have similarities and discuss the same entity, the \\"Panthera tigris sudanensis,\\" they are not perfect paraphrases of each other as they convey different levels of recognition and certainty regarding the subspecies. The first sentence asserts that the Panthera tigris sudanensis is a supposed subspecies of tiger, implying that there is debate or speculation and it is not universally accepted as a distinct subspecies. By saying \\"not scientifically recognised,\\" it suggests either there is insufficient evidence or research supporting this subdivision or the scientific community does not acknowledge it as such. The second sentence, in contrast, claims that Panthera tigris sudanensis is a recognised subspecies of tiger, which directly contradicts the first sentence's assertion that it isn't. However, it then says that it's \\"not scientifically claimed,\\" which is unclear but could mean that while it's recognised as a subspecies, that recognition isn't based on scientific evidence or consensus. This seems contradictory and makes the exact meaning of the sentence hard to decipher. Both sentences agree that this supposedly African tiger is \\"alleged,\\" implying there's uncertainty or lack of concrete facts to support that it lives in Africa. In summary, while the sentences share a main subject and theme, the differences in the recognition status of Panthera tigris sudanensis and the degree of certainty expressed mean they do not paraphrase each other closely.

It is an inland and in relative terms upland county having eastward-draining valleys while taking in moors of the Pennines and has a population of 2.2 million. West Yorkshire came into existence as a metropolitan county in 1974 after the passage of the Local Government Act 1972. - North Yorkshire is a non-metropolitan county (or shire county) and larger ceremonial county in England. It is located primarily in the region of Yorkshire and the Humber but partly in the region of North East England. - In geography, a confluence is the meeting of two or more bodies of water. Also known as a \\"conflux\\", it refers either to the point where a tributary joins a larger river, (main stem), or where two streams meet to become the source of a river of a new name, such as the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania creating the Ohio River. - York is a historic walled city at the confluence of the rivers Ouse and Foss in North Yorkshire, England. The municipality is the traditional county town of Yorkshire to which it gives its name. The city has a rich heritage and has provided the backdrop to major political events in England throughout much of its two millennia of existence. The city offers a wealth of historic attractions, of which York Minster is the most prominent, and a variety of cultural and sporting activities making it a popular tourist destination for millions. - A County town is usually the location of administrative or judicial functions within the county, or it has been established over time as the \\"de facto\\" main town of a county. The concept of a county town eventually became detached from its original meaning of where the county administration or county hall is based. In fact, many county towns are no longer part of the administrative county. For example, Nottingham is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of Nottinghamshire. Many county towns are classified as cities, but all are referred to as county towns regardless of whether city status is held or not. - Yorkshire (or ; abbreviated Yorks), formally known as the County of York, is a historic county of Northern England and the largest in the United Kingdom. Due to its great size in comparison to other English counties, functions have been undertaken over time by its subdivisions, which have also been subject to periodic reform. Throughout these changes, Yorkshire has continued to be recognised as a geographical territory and cultural region. The name is familiar and well understood across the United Kingdom and is in common use in the media and the military, and also features in the titles of current areas of civil administration such as North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and East Riding of Yorkshire. - A shire is a traditional term for a division of land, found in the United Kingdom and Australia. It was first used in Wessex from the beginning of Anglo-Saxon settlement, and spread to most of the rest of England in the tenth century. - South Yorkshire is a metropolitan county in England. It is the southernmost county in the Yorkshire and the Humber region and had a population of 1.34 million in 2011. It has an area of and consists of four metropolitan boroughs, Barnsley, Doncaster, Rotherham and Sheffield. South Yorkshire was created on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972 with Barnsley as its county town. - Scandinavian York ( also referred to as Jórvík ) or Danish / Norwegian York is a term used by historians for the south of Northumbria ( modern day Yorkshire ) during the period of the late 9th century and first half of the 10th century , when it was dominated by Norse warrior - kings ; in particular , used to refer to the city ( York ) controlled by these kings . Norse monarchy controlled varying amounts of Northumbria from 875 to 954 , however the area was invaded and conquered for short periods by England between 927 and 954 before eventually being annexed into England in 954 . It was closely associated with the much longer - lived Kingdom of Dublin throughout this period . - Northern England, or North of England, also known as the North or the North Country, is the northern part of England and one the country's three principal cultural areas, along with the Midlands and Southern England. Geographically, the area roughly spans from the River Trent and River Dee to the Scottish border in the north. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - The Cathedral and Metropolitical Church of Saint Peter in York, commonly known as York Minster, is the cathedral of York, England, and is one of the largest of its kind in Northern Europe. The minster is the seat of the Archbishop of York, the second-highest office of the Church of England, and is the mother church for the Diocese of York and the Province of York. It is run by a dean and chapter, under the Dean of York. The title \\"minster\\" is attributed to churches established in the Anglo-Saxon period as missionary teaching churches, and serves now as an honorific title. Services in the minster are sometimes regarded as on the High Church or Anglo-Catholic end of the Anglican continuum. - The East Riding of Yorkshire, or simply East Yorkshire, is a ceremonial county of England. It is located in the region of Yorkshire and the Humber. The East Riding of Yorkshire may also refer to a local government district with unitary authority status, which does not include the city of Kingston upon Hull, the largest settlement in the ceremonial county, which is a separate unitary authority. The modern East Riding of Yorkshire (both ceremonial county and unitary authority), was formed in 1996 from the northern part of the non-metropolitan county of Humberside. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe.

The US team studied East Antarctica, while the Swiss team studied West Antarctica. Which team didn't learn about a region that doesn't show signs of appreciable melting despite the large amount of surface warming? Hint: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

Which friend experienced more weather fronts? Joe lived in East Antarctica while his buddy Jim lived in West Antarctica. They were both into collecting rare specimens of plants and wildlife. They would often complain about the weather. Hint: East Antarctica is colder than its western counterpart because of its higher elevation. Weather fronts rarely penetrate far into the continent, leaving the centre cold and dry. Despite the lack of precipitation over the central portion of the continent, ice there lasts for extended periods. Heavy snowfalls are common on the coastal portion of the continent, where snowfalls of up to 1.22 metres (48 in) in 48 hours have been recorded. Answer:","output":"Jim experienced more weather fronts. Since Joe lived in East Antarctica and Jim lived in West Antarctica, we can use the information provided in the paragraph to determine who had more weather fronts. According to the paragraph, East Antarctica is colder than its western counterpart because of its higher elevation, and weather fronts rarely penetrate far into the continent. This leaves the central portion of the continent, which includes East Antarctica, cold and dry with a lack of precipitation. In contrast, heavy snowfalls are common on the coastal portion of the continent, which includes West Antarctica where Jim lived.

The opening statement of the prosecuting attorney (Richard Widmark) is a vicious one, depicting the defendants as having been willing, evil, accomplices in Nazi atrocities, but Judge Haywood wonders if it is really that simple.Confounded at how one defendant, a renowned German champion of justice named Ernst Janning (Burt Lancaster), appears to have played the greatest role in molding Germany's Ministry of Justice into a destructive instrument of Nazism, Judge Haywood resolves to gain some perspective on the period in which the German legal system strayed from a course of entirely objective justice.Probing for the truth proves difficult, though, as nobody who lived in Germany during Nazism seems to admit to having much inside knowledge. He befriends Mrs. Bertholt (Marlene Dietrich), the widow of an executed Nazi army officer, but she offers few insights, more consumed by her personal experiences than the broader matters of Nazism. Mrs. Bertholt is focusing on being a catalyst for the cultural rebirth of Nuremberg, keen on remolding the image of a city that had become notorious as the site of the Nazi raliies. An attempt to discuss the period with his housekeepers, Mr. and Mrs. Halbestadt, who had lived near the Dachau concentration camp, proves equally fruitless for Judge Haywood, as they cannot help but focus on the loss of their child in the bombing and the fact that they nearly starved from poverty. Whether anyone knew anything mattered little, for Germans were looking forward, not backward, still grappling with, and recovering from, the hardships and losses that the war brought to them and their families.Only in the courtroom will Judge Haywood have the opportunity to gain insights into the realities of the period. First hand evidence of a) all... Answer:","output":"\\"Justice in the Shadows: The Nuremberg Trials\\" The film \\"Justice in the Shadows: The Nuremberg Trials\\" follows the story of Judge Dan Haywood (Spencer Tracy), who is tasked with presiding over the trial of four Nazi judges accused of war crimes in the aftermath of World War II. Set in 1948 Nuremberg, the film delves into the complexities of the German justice system and society during the Nazi era. The defendants, led by enigmatic Ernst Janning (Burt Lancaster), a once highly-regarded German champion of justice, stand accused of transforming the Ministry of Justice into a weapon of the Nazi regime. Prosecuting attorney (Richard Widmark) delivers a scathing opening statement, painting the accused as willing and eager participants in the atrocities committed during the Holocaust. However, Judge Haywood is not convinced that assigning blame is quite so simple. The movie portrays the judge's quest to uncover the truth behind the actions of these Nazi judges and the nation that supported them. As he delves deeper into the matter, he discovers that the people he encounters, including the widow of a Nazi officer and his own housekeepers, are consumed by their personal experiences and loss. Germany, it seems, is busy trying to rebuild and move forward in the aftermath of World War II and is reluctant to dwell on the past. The courtroom becomes the central stage where Judge Haywood attempts to gain a greater understanding of the Nazi era. Through witness statements and firsthand accounts, he faces the harsh reality of the complex period in history that led to the events in question. As the trial progresses, the judge grapples with the moral dilemma of determining guilt and administering justice in the face of overwhelming horror and tragedy that had befallen Germany. \\"Justice in the Shadows: The Nuremberg Trials\\" is a thought-provoking and poignant examination of post-war Germany and the unenviable task of seeking justice for the unspeakable crimes committed during the Holocaust. As the line between right and wrong becomes blurred, the film questions the nature of justice itself and how it can be achieved in an era where humanity failed so remarkably. The movie's title emphasizes the uneasy and complex nature of seeking justice in the aftermath of such darkness, with the shadows of the past looming large over those tasked with prosecuting and judging the accused."},{"instruction":"atidxx32dll Blue Screen of Death BSODNormally atidxx32dll missing or having false antivirus like ProgramWin32AdvdownA installed mistaken operation and atidxx32dll modified by virus may lead BSOD Please fix the punctuation.","output":"The atidxx32.dll Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) error is usually attributed to a missing or corrupt atidxx32.dll file, the presence of a false antivirus program like ProgramWin32AdvdownA, mistaken operations, or modifications made to the atidxx32.dll file by a virus.

Dennis Dexter Haysbert was born on June 2, 1954 in San Mateo, California. He has built a notable career as an American actor and voice actor, but is distinctive for his deep, authoritative voice which easily stands out. This has also played a crucial part in securing his position as the representative figure of Allstate Insurance in commercials since 2003. His career began in the 1970s, but hit its peak in the 2000s. Over his career, he has appeared in a variety of roles spanning film, television, and video games. However, his most famous roles are probably on the small screen, especially in the popular Fox series “24” where he played the groundbreaking role of David Palmer, the first African American president of the United States. He also featured in CBS’s military drama, “The Unit,” where he played Sergeant Major Jonas Blane. In film, he has made significant marks in several projects such as his role as Pedro Cerrano in the Major League series, and his supporting role in the critically acclaimed film Far From Heaven. As a voice actor, Haysbert worked on multiple projects, most notably in animated films like “Wreck-It Ralph”, “Kung Fu Panda 2”, and “Sinbad: Legend of The Seven Seas”. Moreover, his distinctive, resonant voice has also lent itself to video games, particularly in “Call of Duty: Finest Hour” and “Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow”. Dennis Haysbert, with his prominent presence and distinct voice, has become synonymous with Allstate Insurance commercials for nearly two decades now. You might remember the commercials - they often feature Haysbert in different situations explaining various aspects of the insurance offerings, with his deep, calming voice echoing the company's well-known slogan, “You’re in good hands with Allstate”. Hence, it could be said that Dennis Haysbert's charismatic and comforting persona has played a significant role in the brand identity and the overall success of the Allstate Insurance company's marketing campaigns."},{"instruction":"Q:The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer. If yes, write \\"True\\", otherwise write \\"False\\". Question: what was muhammad's vision Suggestion: In Medina, Muhammad united the tribes under the Constitution of Medina . A:","output":"False. The question asks about Muhammad's vision, not a specific event or accomplishment in his life. While the suggested answer provides valuable information about Muhammad's role in uniting the tribes under the Constitution of Medina, it does not directly address the core of the question, which is about his vision or mission. Muhammad's vision, as the founder of Islam and the last prophet of the religion, was to spread the message of Islam and bring people closer to the monotheistic worship of Allah (God). According to Islamic tradition, Muhammad received a series of revelations from Allah through the angel Gabriel, which would later be compiled into the Quran, the holy book of Islam. His vision entailed establishing a just society bound by the principles of the Islamic faith, emphasizing social justice, compassion, and the importance of both personal and communal responsibility. Throughout his life, Muhammad worked towards fulfilling this vision by spreading the message of Islam, building a community of believers, and implementing Islamic principles in the areas under his influence. In this context, the unification of the tribes under the Constitution of Medina could be seen as a step towards realizing Muhammad's vision, as it enabled him to create a unified community that would have a better chance of working together to build a just society guided by the teachings of Islam. However, this event alone does not fully encapsulate the essence of Muhammad's vision, which is broader and more comprehensive than simply creating a unified political entity."},{"instruction":"Article:In 2014, 68 animals died in crashes in the national park and, while the number is falling, accident hotspots remain.

While the police, including Lieutenant Horatio Bixbee (Peter Falk), rush to get to the bank, Penelope escapes in a red wig and yellow suit. She donates some of the stolen money to a Salvation Army worker and donates the suit to a second-hand thrift shop. Con artists Sabada (Lila Kedrova) and Ducky (Lou Jacobi) immediately recognize the suit as an original designer outfit from Paris, and purchase it for a mere 7. Penelope visits her psychiatrist, Gregory (Dick Shawn), and tells him all about her criminal activities.

Question: What does Adrian Kingsley-Hughes say of his thoughts on the origins of the interface? Context: The interface of Windows 8 has been the subject of mixed reaction. Bright wrote that its system of hot corners and edge swiping \\"wasn't very obvious\\" due to the lack of instructions provided by the operating system on the functions accessed through the user interface, even by the video tutorial added on the RTM release (which only instructed users to point at corners of the screen or swipe from its sides). Despite this \\"stumbling block\\", Bright said that Windows 8's interface worked well in some places, but began to feel incoherent when switching between the \\"Metro\\" and desktop environments, sometimes through inconsistent means. Tom Warren of The Verge wrote that the new interface was \\"as stunning as it is surprising\\", contributing to an \\"incredibly personal\\" experience once it is customized by the user, but had a steep learning curve, and was awkward to use with a keyboard and mouse. He noted that while forcing all users to use the new touch-oriented interface was a risky move for Microsoft as a whole, it was necessary in order to push development of apps for the Windows Store. Others, such as Adrian Kingsley-Hughes from ZDNet, considered the interface to be \\"clumsy and impractical\\" due to its inconsistent design (going as far as considering it \\"two operating systems unceremoniously bolted together\\"), and concluded that \\"Windows 8 wasn't born out of a need or demand; it was born out of a desire on Microsoft's part to exert its will on the PC industry and decide to shape it in a direction—touch and tablets -- that allows it to compete against, and remain relevant in the face of Apple's iPad.\\" Answer:","output":"Adrian Kingsley-Hughes considers the interface of Windows 8 to be \\"clumsy and impractical\\" due to its inconsistent design and believes that it was born out of Microsoft's desire to exert its will on the PC industry and shape it in a direction—touch and tablets—that allows it to compete against and remain relevant in the face of Apple's iPad, rather than from a need or demand."},{"instruction":"Process: - Some of the rock in the ground is made of limestone - Over long periods of time rain can hit the limestone - And cause a acidic reaction - The limestone will slowly disintegrate - A large gap with be where the limestone was - Result in the cave.

The process of limestone leading to cave formation has been explained. It involves the reaction of rainwater with limestone over a long time, causing it to disintegrate and create a cave. Recycling containers, on the other hand, are used to collect recyclable materials like plastic, glass, paper, etc. for recycling purposes. Step 2: Determine if the recycling containers have any direct impact on limestone formation or dissolution. Recycling containers have no direct impact on limestone formation or dissolution, as they handle separate materials like plastic, glass, and paper. Step 3: Analyze the relationship between fewer recycling containers and limestone. Since recycling containers have no direct influence on limestone formation or dissolution, having fewer of them would not affect the amount of limestone present. The other factors involved (e.g. rainwater, acidic reactions) are independent of recycling containers. Therefore, the correct answer is C: no effect, as the number of recycling containers has no direct impact on the amount of limestone."},{"instruction":"We therefore need to bring democracy and parliamentarianism into the Basel process, the G20 process, the new global institutions that are being created, and, at the same time, we need to be involved in the process so as not to always be presented with faits accomplis.

The decision following a 14-day trial is a huge victory for Nolen Scott Ely, his wife, Monica-Marta Ely, and Raymond and Victoria Hubert, who pursued the case for six years after rejecting a settlement offer in 2012. The couples accused Houston-based Cabot of negligently drilling two natural gas wells near their Susquehanna County homes, contaminating their wells with high levels of methane. Cabot maintains the methane is naturally occurring. “Oh my God! They heard! They heard!” said a tearful Leslie Lewis, attorney for the Elys and Huberts, as she hugged a supporter after exiting the courtroom at the federal courthouse in Scranton. The jury of four men and four women deliberated for 8½ hours over two days before awarding Mr. and Mrs. Ely 2.6 million and their three minor children 50,000 each. The jury awarded Mr. and Mrs. Hubert 1.4 million, while another family member was awarded 50,000. An attorney for Cabot immediately vowed to appeal, advising U.S. Magistrate Judge Martin Carlson the company will file a motion asking him to set aside the verdict and/or grant a new trial based on Ms. Lewis’ conduct during the trial. Attorney Jeremy Mercer said Ms. Lewis repeatedly referenced evidence that had been excluded and made comments that implied Cabot was “hiding something.” Judge Carlson interrupted her three times during her closing argument, admonishing her for making improper statements, he said, and that unfairly influenced the jury against the energy company. “Without plaintiffs’ counsel’s conduct, the evidence in this case did not allow for a jury to reach the verdict it did,” Mr. Mercer said. Ms. Lewis defended her actions. She said she was just being a zealous advocate for her clients. “I know my conduct was appropriate,” she said following the trial. “My job as an attorney and advocate for these folks is to push the envelope.” The Elys hugged and spoke with the jurors as they left the courthouse. None of the jurors spoke with media. Cabot ‘surprised’ At trial, Ms. Lewis argued Cabot rushed to drill to capitalize on the natural gas boom. That resulted in defective wells that allowed methane to leak and migrate to the Elys’ and Huberts’ wells. Cabot’s attorneys argued the evidence was woefully lacking. They noted the Elys and Huberts first noticed problems with their well water in the summer of 2008. Cabot did not start to drill the wells until Sept. 25, 2008. Cabot also argued the couples failed to provide any evidence to show a pathway existed underground for the gas to reach their wells. “Cabot is surprised at the jury’s verdict given the lack of evidence provided by plaintiffs,” George Stark,spokesman for Cabot, said in a prepared statement. “The verdict disregards overwhelming scientific and factual evidence that Cabot acted as a prudent operator in conducting its operations.” Speaking after the trial, Ms. Lewis said she was concerned the Elys and Huberts would lose as several pre-trial rulings severely limited the evidence she could present. The first blow came in January, when U.S. District Judge John Jones dismissed their claims for breach of contract, fraud and personal injury, finding insufficient evidence. Ms. Lewis suffered several other setbacks. Judge Carlson, who presided over the trial, precluded her from presenting more than 300 exhibits because she did not provide them to the defense until a few weeks before trial. On Monday, Judge Carlson ruled the Elys could not recoup damages for a loss in property value because they did not present any reports that showed the value of their home prior to and after the contamination occurred. The only claim that remained at trial was for “private nuisance.” To prevail on a nuisance claim, the couples had to prove Cabot’s negligence in drilling caused their water problems and that the conduct caused them significant discomfort and inconvenience. “I had a very poor forecast for these plaintiffs,” Ms. Lewis said as she stood with her clients outside the courthouse. “I had to convince all eight jurors on the limited evidence I was going to be able to put forth.” Ely: Not about money As his eyes welled with tears, Mr. Ely said he was determined to see the case through, no matter what. “It wasn’t about the money,” Mr. Ely said. “They did something wrong. We were voicing ourselves and standing up for our rights. We walked into that courtroom with our heads high. No matter what happened, I was going to walk out of the courtroom with my head high.” The Elys and Huberts were among 44 Dimock Twp. residents who sued Cabot in 2009. The company settled that suit with 40 of the plaintiffs in 2012, but the Elys and Huberts rejected the deal. Their attorney withdrew from the case after the settlement. The two couples represented themselves for years before Ms. Lewis took the case. “This was not an easy trip,” Mr. Ely said. “There were a lot of ups and downs and a lot of things we had to tackle. It was quite the battle but, as you heard today, we are at the end.” Ms. Lewis said she worked on the case for more than a year and has “not received a dime” so far. She took the case on a contingency basis, knowing that meant she would not get paid if Cabot prevailed. She said she promised the Elys and Huberts she’d stick with them. “We started this. I’m going to finish it with you, whatever comes out with respect to money,” she said. Whether or not the verdict will stand remains to be seen. Ms. Lewis said she anticipates an appeal. “Do I feel confident? Based on what’s gone down over the past 6½ years, I don’t know,” she said. “At this point in time there could not have been a better outcome. The entire community should applaud themselves, the Elys and Huberts for standing up and saying ... enough is enough.” Contact the writer: tbesecker@timesshamrock.com, @tbeseckerTT on Twitter ||||| SCRANTON, Pa. — A federal jury on Thursday found Cabot Oil and Gas Corp. responsible for contaminating two Susquehanna County water wells through its natural gas drilling operations and awarded the families a total of 4.24 million. The Ely and Hubert families of Dimock Township were the last plaintiffs in a high-profile case that began in 2009 and originally included 44 of the rural town’s residents who claimed shoddy Cabot wells drilled early in the Marcellus Shale gas boom allowed methane and other constituents to migrate into their drinking water. Cabot maintains that anything tainting the water supplies is there naturally or comes from sources other than its operations. The jury awarded Nolen Scott Ely and Monica Marta-Ely each 1.3 million, plus 50,000 for each of their three children. The jury awarded Ray and Victoria Hubert each 720,000, plus 50,000 for their daughter. The trial in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania had started on Feb. 22 and stretched into a third week. The jury of four men and four women deliberated for about eight hours on Wednesday afternoon and Thursday morning before reaching its verdict that Cabot was negligent in drilling two of its early wells and created a nuisance by contaminating the families’ water wells. In a statement, Texas-based Cabot said it is surprised by the verdict because the plaintiffs lacked evidence to support their nuisance claims. “The verdict disregards overwhelming scientific and factual evidence that Cabot acted as a prudent operator in conducting its operations,” the company said. Cabot’s attorneys indicated in court on Thursday that they will move to set aside the verdict because they said the plaintiffs’ attorney repeatedly mentioned excluded evidence and acted in other ways that prejudiced the jury against the company. Cabot’s attorney Jeremy Mercer described it as a calculated effort “to throw skunks into the jury box.” The families’ attorney Leslie Lewis rebutted that charge as she stood outside the courthouse, embracing the tearful plaintiffs and their supporters. The jury “really listened,” she said. “Nothing untoward occurred with the presentation of the case. They followed the truth, they followed the facts.” Mr. Ely referred to the size and sophistication of Cabot’s legal team as he reflected on his years-long pursuit that included periods when he represented himself after most of the original plaintiffs settled in 2012. “There were six Goliaths in there,” he said, “and all I had was just a little pea stone.” A state investigation that began in 2009 concluded that Cabot was responsible for contaminating 18 Dimock water supplies with high levels of methane and metals. Residents had complained of brown, fetid water that was so full of gas it would cause a lit match to burst into flame. That drew the attention of federal regulators, the international press, celebrities, filmmakers and anti-fracking activists to the tiny community, which was described as a cautionary tale for other regions hoping to capitalize on advanced but invasive extraction technologies to release oil and gas from stubborn shale formations. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection barred Cabot from drilling new wells in a 9-square-mile section of the township in April 2010. The prohibition still stands because regulators say the company has not yet met the terms of an agreement that requires Cabot to eliminate gas leaks from its wells and reduce methane concentrations in the affected water supplies to consistently low levels. The company also paid 4.6 million as part of the state settlement. Much of the evidence the state used to justify those penalties was excluded from the Ely and Hubert case through pretrial rulings.

However, we can make some observations and discuss possible reasons for the behavior. When Kathy flips the light switch, the large sign lights up, indicating that electrons are flowing through it and providing the energy for the neon gas to emit light. The small sign, on the other hand, does not light up even though it is plugged in. There could be various reasons for the small sign not turning on: 1. The small sign may have an internal defect, such as a broken connection or faulty component, that prevents the flow of electrons and consequently prevents the neon gas from being energized. 2. It's also possible that the neon gas inside the small sign has been depleted or compromised, meaning that even if the electrons were flowing, the gas would not emit light. 3. There could be an issue with the power source or wiring connecting the small sign to the electrical grid, preventing the flow of electrons. In any of these cases, it is not necessarily true that the electrons in the small sign are more or less energized than those in the large sign.

This form of communication is often referred to as bird song or bird calls. Birds have a highly developed system of vocal communication and are capable of producing a wide range of sounds. They use their voices to convey different messages to each other, such as marking their territory, attracting a mate, warning of potential dangers or predators, and signals to maintain cohesion in a flock. Here are some factors that enable birds to communicate effectively even when situated in different houses: 1. Type of vocalization: Bird species have various types of vocalizations that they use for distinct purposes. For example, one bird might use a song to attract a mate, while another might use a call to warn about an incoming threat. These unique vocalizations help birds recognize and respond to the messages being conveyed by their counterparts in other houses. 2. Volume and pitch: The volume and pitch of a bird's call play a significant role in determining how far the sound can travel. Loud and low-frequency sounds travel further than soft, high-pitched sounds. By using loud and low-pitched calls, birds can effectively communicate with each other over longer distances. 3. Timing: Birds use different time intervals between their calls, which helps improve the clarity of their communication. For example, a bird might make a series of calls with short intervals between them when they are communicating about food, while they might use longer intervals when trying to convey a message about potential danger. 4. Environmental factors: Sounds can travel differently depending on the properties of the surrounding environment, such as air temperature, humidity, and the presence of obstacles like trees or buildings. Birds possess an incredible ability to intuitively adjust their calls based on these factors to maximize the distance the sound can travel. 5. Echolocation: Some bird species, like the Oilbird and some swiftlets, use echolocation to navigate their environment and communicate with each other. They emit vocalizations, which bounce off surfaces and return to the bird. By understanding these echoes, they can determine their location and communicate with other birds within the vicinity. 6. Listening skills: Birds also have an exceptional ability to filter out irrelevant noises and focus on the calls made by their species members. This skill allows them to pick up on the faintest of sounds coming from another bird in a different house and respond accordingly. In conclusion, birds communicate with each other through a sophisticated system of vocalizations that allow them to convey various messages even when they are situated in separate houses. By considering factors such as the type of vocalization, volume, pitch, timing, environmental factors, echolocation, and their keen listening skills, birds can effectively discuss something despite the barriers between them."},{"instruction":"Hannah Harvey was a ten year old that had many friends in school.

The entrance opened on the only addition to the original farmhouse, a smallish room where the receptionist sat at one of two desks. The area was called the secretarial pod. The entrance to Ray's office, both medication and technician area, was right behind the secretary's desk. To the left was another door, kept closed, which led down the hallway to the client sleeping rooms, the dining room and the kitchen. There was a phone right inside the front door (or the back door, depending upon who you asked). When Ray wanted to smoke, he would lean out the front door, propping it open with his back in such a way that he could see down the hallway if he propped that door open as well and answer the phone should it ring. Smoking was prohibited inside the building, a policy which grew increasingly unpopular with both the staff and the clients as the course of the year wore on. By December, Ray would have to do weekly fire drills around three a.m. as a way of politely reminding his anti-social and policy impaired population that any building more than a century old was actually little more than well formed kindling. After enough of those, any problem he had been having with people smoking in the building usually went away. Given the right incentives, even this population could be relatively self-regulating. The telephone rang before Ray was even half-finished with his cigarette. \\"Admit it now, Ray.\\" She sounded petulant. \\"Fine, I admit it.

We are introduced to a man named Ivan Vanko. Ivan's father Anton is slowly dying and telling Ivan his final wishes. Ivan thinks he should have the fame that Tony Stark is enjoying but Anton tells him to \\"ignore that garbage.\\" All Anton can give Ivan is his knowledge. Ivan takes a blueprint that has his father's name on it, and also the name of Howard Stark, Tony Stark's father. Ivan then sets about recreating the Arc reactor and begins building his own weaponized suit. Tony Stark has become a champion for world peace thanks to the Iron Man suit, and has practically solved the issue of world peace, or so he claims.Six months after the end of the first movie, Tony Stark has used his Iron Man armor to bring about a negotiated peace treaty between the major super powers of the world, and his immense popularity with the general public is only furthered when he fulfills his father's dream by reopening the \\"Stark Expo\\" in Queens, NY, to showcase all the latest inventions that will benefit the world. Tony fulfills this dream by flying into the expo in full Iron Man regalia, and making a flamboyant entrance to become the new symbol of world peace. Backstage, following his address, Tony does a quick test of his blood: the palladium he uses to power his chest arc reactor is slowly poisoning his body. After the event, Tony and Happy are leaving when they are approached by a woman who hands Tony a subpoena, summoning him to a Senate Armed Forces Committee hearing. Tony and Happy decide to take a road trip to Washington DC in Tony's new Audi R8.The next morning, during the Senate hearing, Tony's usual brand of humor becomes the center of attention while completely ignoring the fact that the government has classified the Iron Man armor as a weapon.

The premise \\"Why was I chosen?\\" implies that the speaker has been selected for a specific role, assignment, or situation. The individual appears to be curious, uncertain, or in search of reasons for being chosen. This question is inward-looking and focuses on the qualities, skills, or factors that may have contributed to the selection. On the other hand, the hypothesis \\"Was there any reason I wasn't picked?\\" contradicts the premise's context. This hypothesis assumes that the speaker was not selected and thus, seeks clarifications on why they were not selected. This question is again inward-looking but focuses on potential inadequacies, shortcomings, or external factors that may have resulted in the speaker being passed over for selection. Based on the contrasting nature of these two statements, we can understand that they represent two entirely different scenarios - one where the speaker has been chosen and the other where they have not been picked. Now, to determine if the hypothesis \\"Was there any reason I wasn't picked?\\" is true, we need to examine it in light of the given premise. Since the premise \\"Why was I chosen?\\" already establishes the situation where the speaker has been chosen, it contradicts the very foundation of the hypothesis, which assumes the speaker wasn't picked. Therefore, the hypothesis is not true when considering the stated premise. In conclusion, given the premise \\"Why was I chosen?\\", the hypothesis \\"Was there any reason I wasn't picked?\\" cannot be considered true, as it serves as a contradicting scenario to the initial context presented by the premise. The two statements represent opposing conditions, and thus, cannot both be valid at the same time based on the same premise."},{"instruction":"Continue the following story. Cynthia handed a nine iron to Jessica as","output":"Jessica stood nervously by the golf cart. Jessica had never even held a club before, let alone played a full round of golf. But today, the sun was shining, the birds were singing, and the greens beckoned to her with their verdant charm. What's more, she was eager to share the experience with her long-time friend, Cynthia, who was seasoned with years of golf prowess under her belt. Cynthia grinned at Jessica's obvious uncertainty. \\"Don't worry, Jess, just relax. I'll show you the ropes, and we'll have a great time.\\" Jessica attempted a smile and gripped the nine iron tightly. It felt alien in her hands, a strange, extended limb of metal. They walked together towards the practice tee, where a small crowd had started to gather, most of them their friends from the office. As it turned out, their company had organized a charity golf tournament, and everyone who was anyone had decided to participate. Jessica, usually the wallflower at office gatherings, was determined to make an effort this time. Cynthia had been instrumental in drawing her out of her shell by extending an invitation to be her partner in the tournament. With Cynthia's guidance, Jessica found herself learning the fundamental techniques of holding the club and taking her first swing. Her initial discouragement at missing the ball entirely quickly faded when Cynthia assured her this was common for first-time golfers. In fact, more often than not, the first few attempts were abysmal. It was all part of the learning process. As Jessica practiced her swing, Cynthia worked with her to grasp the concepts of posture, grip, and balance. Cynthia's patience paid off, as Jessica managed to make contact with the ball on her sixth try. The ball sailed a modest distance before rolling onto the grass, but it was an accomplishment nonetheless. The elation was written all over Jessica's face. Even if her skill was far from tournament-worthy, she began to fall in love with the game. The satisfaction of a well-executed swing, the serenity of the outdoors, and the companionship of good friends made for an intoxicating combination. The day of the tournament arrived, and Jessica stood nervously at the tee, holding her nine iron in a now-familiar grip. Cynthia smiled, confidence radiating from her. \\"You've got this, Jess,\\" she whispered, giving her friend's shoulder a reassuring squeeze. Their friends and coworkers had gathered around, their words of encouragement providing a swell of support. Jessica took a deep breath, focused on the fairway ahead, and with all the strength and skill developed through weeks of practice, swung her nine iron. The onlookers gasped in surprise as the golf ball soared high in the air, arcing beautifully and landing with a satisfying thud in the middle of the fairway. Jessica's eyes widened in disbelief, while the crowd erupted into applause. Cynthia leaped, her arms extended for a hug. \\"I knew you could do it!\\" she exclaimed, twirling Jessica around. The game proceeded, its outcome holding unexpected success for the unlikely novice. Confidence bloomed within Jessica as she continued to impress both her peers and herself. She realized that her journey to this point was not just about learning to play golf but also about discovering a new side to herself that believed in her ability to grow and adapt. Jessica and Cynthia finished the tournament with laughter, high-fives, and a surprisingly good scorecard. Their friendship only deepened that day, as they reminisced about their experiences and planned future golf outings. The golf course provided them with a canvas on which they painted a new chapter in their lives – one filled with fun, camaraderie, and a shared passion for the game. Little did Jessica know that her decision to accept Cynthia's invitation would open a door to a world of new experiences, opportunities, and friendships. The simple act of gripping a nine iron one sunny afternoon represented the beginning of a lifelong journey – one she had eagerly embarked upon hand in hand with her dearest friend, Cynthia."},{"instruction":"Review: In this day and age of incredible special movie effects, this one was a sore disappointment.

Given the movie's premise centering around the life-changing consequences of one's aspirations being shattered, the viewers could have been taken on an emotional rollercoaster; however, the subpar writing failed miserably to evoke any semblance of empathy. Right from the beginning, the film relied heavily on a disjointed narrative structure that made it difficult to follow the unfolding story. As the movie progressed, we were introduced to a multitude of characters, and their actions seemed only to confuse the viewer further. What could have been a deep dive into the intricacies of the human spirit turned out to be an uninspired amalgamation of clichés and forced metaphors. The dialogue was bogged down with painfully awkward exchanges that contributed little to character development or the film's overall flow. Speaking of the characters, the movie presented an array of one-sided personalities that were so severely underdeveloped that it was impossible to invest emotionally in them. The protagonist, Alex, came across as an amalgam of overused tropes – a rebellious philosopher with an artistic soul trapped in a small town. Unfortunately, his backstory was frustratingly sparse, leaving the audience having no real understanding of his motives. The supporting characters fared no better in this regard, and their lack of chemistry on-screen further negated the chance for the cast to work as a team. Visually, \\"The Sunset of Dreams\\" tried to take a stylized approach with its cinematography, but once again, it came across as haphazard and disorganized. It was as if the director intended to impress the audience with flashy camera work and bold colors but failed to blend these with the story's essence. The soundtrack also fell short in creating the right atmosphere, with an odd mixture of indie tracks and orchestral pieces that never seemed to match the on-screen action. Despite these glaring issues, one could argue that the premise underlying \\"The Sunset of Dreams\\" could have made for a compelling movie had it been treated with the respect and dedication it deserved. However, the film's muddled narrative, shallow character portrayals, and a discordant visual and audio presentation ultimately sealed its fate as a forgettable and unremarkable piece of cinema. It's truly a shame that a movie with such an intriguing premise could fail so spectacularly on all fronts."},{"instruction":"Can we conclude from \\"A woman is reading a book on the subway.\\" that \\"A woman is riding a train.\\"?

One example is that some bacteria have the ability to fix nitrogen gas using the enzyme nitrogenase. This environmentally important trait can be found in bacteria of most metabolic types listed above. This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively. Bacterial metabolic processes are also important in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste. Facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves. and the situation: Brett and Scott were both studying bacteria for their exam. Scott read more about nitrogen-fixating and sulfate-reducing bacteria, while his colleague Brett read more about non-respiratory anaerobe bacteria and facultative anaerobes. Answer the following question: Which student read less about the production of the highly toxic dimethylmercury? Answer:","output":"Brett read less about the production of the highly toxic dimethylmercury. The production of highly toxic forms of mercury, such as dimethylmercury, is largely a responsibility of sulfate-reducing bacteria. Scott, who read more about nitrogen-fixating and sulfate-reducing bacteria, would have come across information about this process. Brett, on the other hand, focused more on non-respiratory anaerobe bacteria and facultative anaerobes, which are not directly associated with dimethylmercury production. Therefore, Brett is the student who read less about the production of the highly toxic dimethylmercury."},{"instruction":"Choices: [a]. Patricia plan was a genious one.. [b]. Carrie plan was a genious one.. Complete the following sentence. The GM chose Patricia plan instead of Carrie because","output":"The GM chose Patricia's plan instead of Carrie's because Patricia's plan exhibited a higher level of strategic thinking, innovation, and long-term viability. In a rapidly changing business environment, it is essential for organizations to adapt and evolve to stay ahead of the competition. Patricia's plan demonstrated a thorough understanding of the challenges at hand, and it presented workable solutions that aligned with the overall goals and objectives of the company. First, Patricia's plan addressed the key issues and pain points facing the organization. She conducted comprehensive market research and utilized data-driven insights to identify areas in which the company could improve and grow. By focusing on addressing the root causes of the problems rather than just treating symptoms, Patricia's plan signaled a long-term commitment to sustainable and meaningful improvement. Second, Patricia's plan was marked by the creativity and innovation that it brought to the table. In crafting her proposal, Patricia drew from diverse industry experiences and explored the most cutting-edge technological advancements in the field. This forward-thinking approach was particularly attractive to the GM, as it presented an exciting opportunity to establish the company as a leader in the industry, setting new standards for performance and growth. Moreover, Patricia's plan also provided clear, actionable steps for implementation. In outlining the project timeline, resource allocation, and key performance indicators, Patricia presented a plan that was not only ambitious but also feasible and grounded in reality. This allowed the GM to be confident in the likelihood of successful execution and measurable results, which is a critical consideration in any business decision. In contrast, Carrie's plan, while thoughtful and well-intentioned, lacked the depth and breadth of vision that characterized Patricia's proposal. Carrie's plan focused more narrowly on the day-to-day operational aspects of the business, neglecting the bigger picture of where the company could and should be heading in the future. Additionally, Carrie's approach to innovation was more incremental, concentrating on making minor adjustments to existing processes and strategies rather than embracing bold, transformative ideas. Furthermore, Carrie's proposal fell short in establishing a clear roadmap for implementation. The GM may have found it difficult to envision how her plan would unfold in practice, translating into achievable results for the company. This lack of clarity may have been a decisive factor in the GM's preference for Patricia's more detailed and well-structured approach. In conclusion, the GM chose Patricia's plan over Carrie's because it showcased the strategic vision, innovation, and actionable steps required to steer the organization in the right direction. Patricia's plan not only addressed the immediate concerns of the company, but it also offered a robust and adaptable framework that would allow the organization to thrive in a competitive and ever-changing marketplace. The GM saw in Patricia's plan the potential for greatness and, ultimately, the promise of a more prosperous and successful future for the company."},{"instruction":"Blue Vinney cheese is made in Sturminster, in which English county????","output":"Blue Vinney cheese is made in Sturminster Newton, a market town located in the English county of Dorset. Dorset is a county in South West England on the English Channel coast. Blue Vinney, also known as Dorset Blue Vinney, is a traditional blue cheese that has been produced in the region for centuries. The name \\"Vinney\\" is derived from the Old English word \\"vinew,\\" meaning a storage place for wine, and the cheese is said to have a blue mold similar to the veins in the walls of wine caves. The production of this cheese dates back to the 18th century and was a staple in the diets of farmworkers and countrymen residing in the region. The process of making Blue Vinney involves using raw skimmed cow's milk, often sourced from local Dorset dairy farms. The milk is allowed to settle, and the cream is skimmed off the top. The remaining milk is then warmed and mixed with starter cultures, rennet, and Penicillium roqueforti—the mold responsible for the blue veins running through the cheese. The curd forms and is cut into small cubes, drained, salted, and pressed into molds lined with cheesecloth. The molds are turned periodically to encourage proper drainage. The cheese is then aged for approximately 3-6 months in cool, humid storage facilities. During aging, the Blue Vinney develops a blue-gray rind, which helps to protect it from external influences. The interior of the cheese takes on a crumbly texture with a delicious, distinctive, and somewhat pungent flavor. The intensity develops further as the cheese matures, resulting in a strong, tangy, and earthy taste with a pleasant aftertaste. Blue Vinney cheese is often enjoyed with crackers, fresh fruit, and crusty bread. It complements hearty meals such as steak, potatoes, and ale, allowing the strong flavors to meld together. The cheese can also be used in cooking, particularly as a topping for pasta dishes, salads, and soups, or melted into various sauces to add extra depth and richness. As a traditional cheese from the Dorset region, Blue Vinney also has a Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) status, ensuring that it can only be made in Dorset using specific methods and locally sourced ingredients. This cheese is not as well known as some other English blue cheeses, such as Stilton, but it enjoys a loyal following among cheese aficionados and residents of Dorset. As interest in artisanal and locally-produced foods continues to grow, Blue Vinney cheese is sure to gain even more recognition as a flavorful and unique regional specialty."},{"instruction":"he was like a lot of advocacy and men was very ironic and satirical.

Like his Al - tashawwuf ( e.g. on Abu Madyan ) it contains many autobiographical passages of Abu al - Abbas himself . - Marrakesh, also known by the French spelling Marrakech (or \\"Murrkuš\\"), is a major city of the Kingdom of Morocco. It is the fourth largest city in the country, after Casablanca, Fes and Tangier. It is the capital city of the mid-southwestern region of Marrakesh-Safi.

Answer:","output":"In the given information, the subject entities include 'Abu Yaqub Yusuf Ibn Yahya ibn al-Zayyat al-Tadili,' 'Marrakesh,' and 'Ceuta,' while the object entities include 'Arabic' and 'French.' From the context, we can infer that the relation of 'languages spoken or written' is present between those entities. Abu Yaqub Yusuf Ibn Yahya ibn al-Zayyat al-Tadili, a Sufi mystic, influential jurist, and hagiographer from Morocco, most likely spoke and wrote in Arabic as it was the dominant language in the region during his time.

Some scholars believe that Albanian derives from Illyrian while others claim that it derives from Daco-Thracian. (Illyrian and Daco-Thracian, however, might have been closely related languages; see Thraco-Illyrian.) Establishing longer relations, Albanian is often compared to Balto-Slavic on the one hand and Germanic on the other, both of which share a number of isoglosses with Albanian. Moreover, Albanian has undergone a vowel shift in which stressed, long o has fallen to a, much like in the former and opposite the latter. Likewise, Albanian has taken the old relative jos and innovatively used it exclusively to qualify adjectives, much in the way Balto-Slavic has used this word to provide the definite ending of adjectives. The cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the Albanian language in the area of church texts and publications, mainly of the Catholic region in the North, but also of the Orthodox in the South. The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition when cleric Gjon Buzuku brought into the Albanian language the Catholic liturgy, trying to do for the Albanian language what Luther did for German. Question: \\"What three areas of religious texts helped develop the Albanian language?\\" Response: \\"Protestant\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","output":"The response to the question is not factually correct. The paragraph mentions three religious areas that contributed to the development of the Albanian language: Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant.

The regional planning document was first published in final form on 10 February 2004. In addition to minor alterations, it was substantially revised and republished in February 2008 and again in July 2011. The London Plan published in July 2011 is currently in effect and has 2031 as a formal end date. minor alterations are being made to the plan to comply with the National Planning Policy Framework and other changes in national policy. - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - Dialogue (sometimes spelled dialog in U.S. English) is a written or spoken conversational exchange between two or more people, and a literary and theatrical form that depicts such an exchange. As a narrative, philosophical or didactic device, it is chiefly associated in the West with the Socratic dialogue as developed by Plato, but antecedents are also found in other traditions including Indian literature. In the 20th century, philosophical treatments of dialogue emerged from thinkers including Mikhail Bakhtin, Paulo Freire, Martin Buber, and David Bohm. Although diverging in many details, these thinkers have articulated a holistic concept of dialogue as a multi-dimensional, dynamic and context-dependent process of creating meaning. Educators such as Freire and Ramón Flecha have also developed a body of theory and technique for using egalitarian dialogue as a pedagogical tool. - A silent film is a film with no synchronized recorded sound, especially with no spoken dialogue. The silent film era lasted from 1895 to 1936. In silent films for entertainment, the dialogue is transmitted through muted gestures, mime and title cards which contain a written indication of the plot or key dialogue. The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as film itself, but because of the technical challenges involved, synchronized dialogue was only made practical in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the introduction of the Vitaphone system. During silent films, a pianist, theatre organist, or, in large cities, even a small orchestra would often play music to accompany the films. Pianists and organists would either play from sheet music or improvise; an orchestra would play from sheet music. - Sheet music is a handwritten or printed form of music notation that uses modern musical symbols to indicate the pitches (melodies), rhythms and/or chords of a song or instrumental musical piece. Like its analogs printed books or pamphlets in English, Arabic or other languages the medium of sheet music typically is paper (or, in earlier centuries, papyrus or parchment), although the access to musical notation since the 1980s has included the presentation of musical notation on computer screens and the development of scorewriter computer programs that can notate a song or piece electronically, and, in some cases, \\"play back\\" the notated music using a synthesizer or virtual instruments. - A pianist is an individual musician who plays the piano. Most forms of Western music can make use of the piano. Consequently, pianists have a wide variety of repertoire and styles to choose from, including traditionally classical music, Jazz, blues and all sorts of popular music, including rock music. Most pianists can, to a certain extent, play other keyboard-related instruments such as the synthesizer, harpsichord, celesta and the organ and keyboard. Perhaps the greatest pianist of all time was Franz Liszt, whose piano mastery was described by Anton Rubinstein: \\"In comparison with Liszt, all other pianists are children\\". - The London Borough of Croydon is a London borough in south London, England and is part of Outer London. It covers an area of and is the largest London borough by population. It is the southernmost borough of London. At its centre is the historic town of Croydon from which the borough takes its name. Croydon is mentioned in the Domesday Book, and from a small market town has expanded into one of the most populous areas on the fringe of London. Croydon is the civic centre of the borough. The borough is now one of London's leading business, financial and cultural centres, and its influence in entertainment and the arts contribute to its status as a major metropolitan centre. Formed in 1965 from the Coulsdon and Purley Urban District and the County Borough of Croydon, the local authority Croydon London Borough Council, is now part of the local government association for Greater London, London Councils. The economic strength of Croydon dates back mainly to Croydon Airport which was a major factor in the development of Croydon as a business centre. Once London's main airport for all international flights to and from the capital, it was closed on 30 September 1959 due to the lack of expansion space needed for an airport to serve the growing city. It is now a Grade II listed building and tourist attraction. Croydon Council and its predecessor Croydon Corporation unsuccessfully applied for city status in 1954, 2000, 2002 and 2012. The area is currently going through a large regeneration project called Croydon Vision 2020 which is predicted to attract more businesses and tourists to the area as well as backing Croydon's bid to become \\"London's Third City\\" (after 'The City' and Westminster). Croydon is mostly urban, though there are large suburban and rural uplands in the south. Since 2003 Croydon has been certified as a Fairtrade borough by the Fairtrade Foundation. It was the first London Borough to have Fairtrade status which is awarded on certain criteria.

Vitaphone was the last major analog sound-on-disc system and the only one which was widely used and commercially successful. The soundtrack was not printed on the film itself, but issued separately on phonograph records. The discs, recorded at rpm (a speed first used for this system) and typically in diameter, would be played on a turntable physically coupled to the projector motor while the film was being projected. Many early talkies, such as \\"The Jazz Singer\\" (1927), used the Vitaphone system. The name \\"Vitaphone\\" derived from the Latin and Greek words, respectively, for \\"living\\" and \\"sound\\". - Gladys Louise Smith (April 8, 1892 May 29, 1979), known professionally as Mary Pickford, was a Canadian-American film actress, writer, director, and producer.

Jerry Brown goes along—a statewide ban on single-use plastic bags in supermarkets and other stores, reports the Los Angeles Times. Lawmakers narrowly approved the measure yesterday in the name of reducing litter on streets and beaches. It would apply to supermarkets next July and to convenience and liquor stories the following year. Customers would be able to pay a dime or so for a reusable plastic bag or a paper bag. Brown hasn't taken a position on the ban, which is generally opposed by Republicans as a big-government move that would amount to a tax on shoppers, reports the Wall Street Journal. And while Brown has a long history of supporting green initiatives, this one is no slam dunk given that it's an election year, reports the Sacramento Bee. Some of California's biggest localities, including Los Angeles County and San Francisco, already have such bans in place.","output":"Title: California Set to Create a National First with Statewide Ban on Single-Use Plastic Bags In a landmark decision, California's legislature has approved a statewide ban on single-use plastic bags in supermarkets and other stores, taking a bold step toward reducing litter on streets and beaches. This move is expected to create a significant positive impact on the environment, and if Governor Jerry Brown endorses the initiative, it would become the first of its kind in the United States. However, the ban has attracted opposition from Republicans, arguing that it represents a big-government move and would amount to a tax on shoppers. The bill, which lawmakers narrowly passed, will apply to supermarkets starting from July and will extend to convenience and liquor stores the following year. As part of the scheme, customers will have the option to purchase a reusable plastic bag or a paper bag for a dime (approximately 10 cents). Governor Brown has not yet revealed his stance on the ban. While California is known for its strong environmental conservation initiatives, the approval of the statewide plastic bag ban represents a significant development in the country's battle against plastic pollution. Several counties and cities in California, including Los Angeles County and San Francisco, have already implemented similar bans, resulting in cleaner streets and beaches, reduced waste output and increased demand for eco-friendly alternatives. Opposition to the plastic bag ban is primarily linked to the belief that it imposes unnecessary costs – financial or otherwise – on shoppers, as explained by Republican critics. Additionally, concerns have been raised about the potential role of such a ban in exacerbating income inequality, given that low-income households may bear the brunt of purchasing reusable bags or paper bags. However, proponents of the ban argue that the advantages of reducing plastic waste far outweigh the perceived costs, particularly considering the long-term environmental impact of single-use plastic bags. Despite Governor Brown's history of supporting green initiatives, his position on this particular ban remains uncertain, especially given the ongoing election year. If Brown endorses the ban, its proponents will have overcome a significant hurdle, putting in motion a pioneering initiative that may encourage similar moves elsewhere in the United States. In conclusion, the California Legislature's approval of a statewide ban on single-use plastic bags heralds a groundbreaking step toward achieving a cleaner, greener America. If Governor Brown throws his support behind the initiative, the ban will likely go into effect next year, empowering Californians to adopt more sustainable and environmentally-friendly shopping practices. Furthermore, the ban has the potential to set a precedent for other states and nations, encouraging them to take action against the widespread pollution caused by single-use plastic bags."},{"instruction":"Who DID put the book in the box?

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","output":"Yes, the information you found on Google is partially correct. The term mnemonic is indeed derived from the Ancient Greek word μνημονικός (mnēmonikos), meaning \\"of memory\\" and is related to Mnemosyne, the goddess of memory in Greek mythology. However, this description only explains the etymology and origin of the word. To answer the question about what mnemonic devices are, we need to provide a more detailed explanation. Mnemonic devices are techniques or strategies that people use to enhance memory and facilitate learning or recalling information. These devices can be in the form of rhymes, acronyms, visual imagery, associations, or any other memory aids that can help encode, retain, and retrieve information in a more efficient and effective manner. Here are some examples and types of mnemonic devices: 1. Acronyms: Acronyms are formed by taking the first letters of a group of words and creating a new word from them. For example, to remember the colors of the rainbow in the correct order: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Violet, one can use the acronym ROYGBIV. 2. Acrostics: Acrostics are similar to acronyms, but instead of forming a new word, the first letters of each word in a phrase create a memorable sentence. For example, to remember the order of planets in the solar system: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, one can use the acrostic \\"My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Noodles.\\" 3. Rhymes: Creating a rhyme or a simple poem can help remember certain pieces of information. For example, to recall the number of days in each month, one can use the rhyme: \\"Thirty days hath September, April, June, and November; All the rest have thirty-one, Excepting February alone...\\" 4. Visual Imagery: By associating a mental image with a piece of information, one can create a more vivid and memorable cue for later recall. For example, to remember the German word \\"Apfel\\" (apple), one can visualize an apple falling onto a person's head as a representation of the German word. 5. Keyword Method: The Keyword method involves creating a mental connection between a new piece of information and a previously learned or familiar concept. For example, to learn the Spanish word \\"caballo\\" (horse), one could visualize a horse in a \\"cab\\" to create an association between the phonetically similar English word (cab) and the Spanish word (caballo). 6. Chunking: Chunking involves breaking larger pieces of information into smaller, more manageable groups or \\"chunks\\" to make them easier to remember. This technique is commonly used when trying to remember phone numbers, addresses, or sequences of numbers and letters. 7. Loci Method or Memory Palace: In this technique, one associates pieces of information with specific locations or landmarks within a familiar mental space. By mentally navigating the space and recalling items from each location, one can improve memory and recall. Mnemonic devices can be applied to various subjects and situations, such as learning languages, studying for exams, remembering scientific information, and memorizing daily tasks. Ultimately, the effectiveness of these techniques depends on personal preference, the information being learned, and the individual's tendency to make use of these memory aids consistently."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Tchaikovsky remained abroad for a year after the disintegration of his marriage. During this time, he completed Eugene Onegin, orchestrated his Fourth Symphony, and composed the Violin Concerto. He returned briefly to the Moscow Conservatory in the autumn of 1879. For the next few years, assured of a regular income from von Meck, he traveled incessantly throughout Europe and rural Russia, mainly alone, and avoided social contact whenever possible. During this time, Tchaikovsky's foreign reputation grew and a positive reassessment of his music also took place in Russia, thanks in part to Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky's call for \\"universal unity\\" with the West at the unveiling of the Pushkin Monument in Moscow in 1880. Before Dostoyevsky's speech, Tchaikovsky's music had been considered \\"overly dependent on the West\\". As Dostoyevsky's message spread throughout Russia, this stigma toward Tchaikovsky's music evaporated. An unprecedented acclaim for him even drew a cult following among the young intelligentsia of Saint Petersburg, including Alexandre Benois, Léon Bakst and Sergei Diaghilev.Two musical works from this period stand out. With the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour nearing completion in Moscow in 1880, the 25th anniversary of the coronation of Alexander II in 1881, and the 1882 Moscow Arts and Industry Exhibition in the planning stage, Nikolai Rubinstein suggested that Tchaikovsky compose a grand commemorative piece. Tchaikovsky agreed and finished it within six weeks. He wrote to Nadezhda von Meck that this piece, the 1812 Overture, would be \\"very loud and noisy, but I wrote it with no warm feeling of love, and therefore there will probably be no artistic merits in it\\". He also warned conductor Eduard Nápravník that \\"I shan't be at all surprised and offended if you find that it is in a style unsuitable for symphony concerts\\". Nevertheless, the overture became, for many, \\"the piece by Tchaikovsky they know best\\"., particularly well-known for the use of cannon in the scores.On 23 March 1881, Nikolai...

Many countries are building islands in the middle of seas and oceans, which they often use for tourism or for defensive purposes. For example, UAE had build several islands in the Persian Gulf. To build those islands they had to ask Oman and Qatar to export sand to them. Qatar declined to export sand, but Oman agreed. Oman in turn had to mine huge quantity of sand in their own country. As a result of sand mining, Would Qatar's fisheries earn more money or less money than Oman's fisheries? Hint: Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators. Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4] Answer:","output":"As a result of sand mining, it is likely that Qatar's fisheries would earn more money than Oman's fisheries. This is because sand mining has several negative impacts on the environment and local wildlife, which can lead to the decline of fish populations and other marine life. When Oman agreed to export sand to UAE, they had to mine a significant amount of sand from their own country. This sand mining can cause erosion, destruction of natural habitats, and disturbance of underwater ecosystems. The increased turbidity in the water due to sand mining can be harmful to organisms like coral that need sunlight to survive. As a result, the overall health and productivity of the marine environment may be compromised, leading to a decline in fish populations. On the other hand, Qatar declined to export sand, meaning that their coastal and underwater ecosystems would likely be less disturbed and more stable. This allows for a healthier marine environment, which in turn supports thriving fish populations. Consequently, Qatar's fisheries could potentially earn more money than Oman's fisheries, which may be negatively affected by the environmental consequences of sand mining. Of course, there are many complex factors that contribute to the success of a country's fisheries—including economic policies, fishery management strategies, and global market trends. However, based purely on the environmental impacts of sand mining on marine ecosystems, Qatar's decision not to export sand may provide an advantage for their fisheries over Oman's fisheries."},{"instruction":"Choose your answer: If \\"A tourist asking a local for directions to their hotel.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A person asks directions.\\"?

Can we draw the following conclusion? The armies arrived by boat.","output":"Step 1: Analyze the information provided. We are given information about the Battle of Rio de Janeiro and its outcome. Mem de Sá, the Portuguese governor, burnt down the French town. However, there is no direct mention of how the armies arrived at the battle location. Step 2: Evaluate the context. During the 16th century, cities and settlements were often constructed near water for transportation purposes. Rio de Janeiro is located on the coast of Brazil and has various water bodies around it, such as the Atlantic Ocean and Guanabara Bay. Step 3: Consider historical context. In the mid-1500s, maritime navigation was the primary means of long-distance travel and transportation. Both France and Portugal were seafaring nations with a strong presence in the Atlantic Ocean, and it was common for them to transport troops and supplies via sea routes. Step 4: Evaluate based on the context and historical background. Given the location of Rio de Janeiro and the prevalent mode of transportation during the 16th century, it is plausible that the armies arrived by boat.

Yet perhaps nothing is more painful than to see General Motors and other big U.S.-based car companies--once exemplars of both American economic supremacy and middle-class aspirations--fall to such an appalling state. Yet if GM represents all that is bad about the American economy, particularly manufacturing, it does not represent the breadth of our industrial landscape. Indeed, even as the dull-witted leviathan sinks, many nimble companies have shown remarkably resiliency. These include a series of small and mid-sized firms--in fields as diverse as garments and agricultural machinery, steel and energy equipment--that have managed to thrive in recent years. It also includes a growing contingent of foreign-owned firms, notably in the automobile industry, that have found that \\"Made in America\\" is necessarily uncompetitive, unprofitable or impossible. Indeed, until the globalization of the financial crisis, American manufacturing exports were reaching record levels. Overall, U.S. industry has become among the most productive in the world--output has doubled over the past 25 years, and productivity has grown at a rate twice that of the rest of the economy. Far from dead, our manufacturing sector is the world's largest, with 5% of the world's population producing five times their share in industrial goods. So what is the problem then? If it is not the effort and ingenuity of American workers or our infrastructure, Detroit's problems must lie somewhere else, largely with almost insanely bad management. We have to remember that the Big Three have been losing market share through even the best of times. Their litany of excuses is as tiresome as their product lines. Back in the 1970s it was \\"cheap\\" Japanese labor, something that can no longer be cited as an excuse. European car makers, if anything, have even higher wage costs. Then there is high gas prices--a good excuse, it appears, back in the 1970s, as well as more recently. But the Detroit auto industry has now had three decades to come up with fuel efficient products that are also fun to drive and reliable. While they have slumbered, the Japanese, Koreans and now the Europeans--with products like the new Volkswagen (other-otc: VLKAF.PK - news - people ) Jetta--have made enormous strides. Now it is the credit crunch, the car makers say. OK. Will increased credit mean that people will suddenly scoop up the same products they have been deserting in droves for decades? Keep in mind that the desertion could get even worse if the congressional greens--led by new Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Rep. Henry Waxman--impose stiffer taxes on gas, which will hurt the guzzlers that have generated most of Big Three profits. So why the push to bail out the Big Three? It's basically about regional politics. The deindustrializing states of California and New York may not care much, but the big car companies' operations are overwhelmingly concentrated in the politically volatile Great Lakes region, an area that proved decisive in President-elect Obama's victory. Another big reason may be that up to 240,000 jobs in Illinois, the nation's new political epicenter, are tied to the big automakers. Sadly, dependence on the Big Three has had long-term tragic results for this entire region. Between 2000 and 2007--before the onset of the financial crisis--the nation's largest percentage losses of manufacturing jobs were concentrated in Big Three bastions like Detroit, Warren-Farmington Hills, Saginaw, Flint and Cleveland. In the five years before the onset of the financial crisis, Michigan alone had lost one-third of its auto manufacturing jobs. Now that figure is up to half. Worse still has been the psychological dependency that has grown from this troubled relationship. By their very nature, declining businesses--particularly unionized ones--tend to protect their older members and encrusted bureaucracies more than they look to the future. This also creates a political environment where the incentive is not to spur innovation, but to protect the already established. Michigan, for example, has met the challenge of its Big Three habit with a combination of farce and failure. Under the clueless leadership of its governor, Jennifer Granholm, the state first hoped its \\"cool cities\\" program would keep young, educated workers close to home. After that failed to work, the governor then pushed the highest tax boost in state history, a reliable job-killer. So let us be clear. It did not take a world financial crisis to sink Michigan; it was getting there very well on its own. Nearly one in three residents, according to a July 2006 Detroit News poll, believe that Michigan is \\"a dying state.\\" Two in five of the state's residents under 35 said they were seriously considering leaving the state. Fortunately, the Big Three do not represent the entire picture of American manufacturing. Even within the Great Lakes region, Wisconsin, which ranks second in per capita employment in manufacturing, has held onto most of its industrial employment due to its large, highly diversified base of smaller-scale specialized manufacturers. If Congress and President Obama want to figure out how to restart our industrial economy, they need to travel not to Detroit but to an alternative universe that includes the South and Appalachia, where most of the new foreign-owned auto manufacturers have clustered. States like Alabama, with the second-largest per capita concentration of auto-related jobs, as well as South Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Georgia and Mississippi, have been growing these high-wage jobs for a new generation. In the process, they have brought unprecedented opportunity to some of the nation's historically poorest regions. Nor are these states looking to remain mere assembly centers. For example, they have launched bold new research initiatives, such as the recently formed International Automotive Research Center at Clemson University, which offers the nation's only Ph.D. in automotive engineering, to make their region a major center of technological innovation for the industry. And the fact that the region will likely be producing the majority of the most low-mileage and low-emission cars certainly cannot hurt their future prospects. However, it is also critical to see beyond merely autos. If you look at the period between 2000 and 2007, as we did at the Praxis Strategy Group, much of the fastest growth in manufacturing was taking place in areas tied to energy production like Midland and Longview, Texas, and Morgantown, W.Va., all of which enjoyed 15% or more increases in manufacturing jobs. Already states like Arkansas, Alabama, Iowa and Mississippi boast more per capita industrial jobs than either Michigan or Ohio. Another strong performer has been the Great Plains. Places like Dubuque, Iowa, and Fargo and Grand Forks, N.D., experienced substantial growth in industrial jobs during the past decade. The base here, as in Wisconsin, is highly diverse and includes agricultural and construction equipment, electronics as well as a burgeoning sector in the renewable fuels sector, such as LM Glasfibre, a Danish firm with a large operation in Grand Forks. Washington state has been another bright spot, powered by Boeing (nyse: BA - news - people ) and other manufacturers attracted to its low-cost, low-emission hydropower. If the country is serious about enhancing U.S. industrial might--as it should be--it might want to ask executives and entrepreneurs in these areas, as well as foreign investors, what they need to keep growing and expanding exports. There is clearly a demonstrated global market for Boeing airplanes and Caterpillar (nyse: CAT - news - people ) construction and agricultural machinery, as well as a host of high-tech and fashion-related products now being churned out in factories scattered across the country. The people running these firms should be those at the congressional hearings, not the pathetic losers from companies like General Motors (nyse: GM - news - people ). They might even have some helpful ideas, like streamlining regulations, investing in critical infrastructure and research facilities, expanding support for training a new generation of skilled blue collar workers and using incentives to encourage firms to improve their energy efficiency. These are the steps we can expect our competitors in Europe, Asia and the developing world to take as well. Rather than looking for ways to bail out the most egregious serial failures, let us find ways to provide incentives for those successful at creating new jobs and saving existing ones.

The author points out that while the Big Three have been losing market share and struggling with management issues, other manufacturing sectors in the US have been thriving, with output doubling in the past 25 years and productivity growing twice as much as the rest of the economy. The article also notes that many smaller-scale manufacturers in the Great Lakes region and the South, as well as foreign-owned auto plants, have seen growth in high-wage jobs, creating opportunities in areas historically hit by poverty."},{"instruction":"Question 1: How can I be an audience member on Kapil's show?

Before you can save for retirement, you need to make sure you have enough money to pay your expenses. If you don't, you'll only fall deep into debt, which can be difficult to claw your way out of. Answer:","output":"To save for retirement as a single parent, it is essential to have a clear understanding of your financial situation and create a realistic budget that takes into account your current income, expenses, and financial goals. Considering the options above, the most natural steps to follow include: 1. Sit down with your bills and identify fixed expenses: Take the time to organize your bills and outline your regular, fixed expenses. These are the costs you know you have to cover every month, such as rent or mortgage payments, car payment, debt payments, insurance costs, and any other recurring financial obligations. Having a clear understanding of your fixed expenses will help you identify areas where you can adjust your spending and potentially save money. 2. Set a budget based on your total expenses: Once you have a clear understanding of your fixed expenses, the next step is to create a budget based on your total expenses. This should be at least 75% of your income to ensure that you maintain some financial breathing room. Your total expenses should include not only fixed costs but also variable expenses such as groceries, utilities, childcare, transportation, and entertainment. Be realistic and identify areas where you can cut back, if necessary. 3. Balance your monthly budget with an annual perspective: While it's essential to create a manageable monthly budget, you should also consider your annual financial goals and priorities. Aim to save at least 70% of your income to offset debt and maintain financial security. This may mean making necessary sacrifices or adjustments to your spending habits to ensure you are not overspending and can allocate a portion of your income towards savings. 4. Research and plan for retirement savings: Retirement savings may seem overwhelming and distant, especially as a single parent juggling multiple responsibilities. However, starting early and having a clear plan can make a significant difference in the long run. Take the time to research options and determine what you can reasonably set aside for retirement. Visit government websites and use online retirement calculators to get a better understanding of your future needs and the potential investment avenues available. In conclusion, to save for retirement as a single parent, you should first understand your fixed expenses and create a realistic monthly budget based on your total expenses. Consider both short-term and long-term financial goals, and always aim to allocate a portion of your income to savings. Finally, research your options and have a clear strategy in place to ensure you are on the right track to achieving a secure and comfortable retirement."},{"instruction":"FINAL EXAM Question 1.

A:","output":"Maurice Ravel"},{"instruction":"Based on the sentence \\"A young boy in blue trunks plays in the water at an outdoor fountain with a brick foundation.\\", is the sentence \\"There is a young boy in a swimsuit playing at the pool.\\" a true sentence?","output":"Step 1: Break down both sentences to identify the relevant elements. First sentence: A young boy in blue trunks plays in the water at an outdoor fountain with a brick foundation. Elements: young boy, blue trunks, outdoor fountain, brick foundation Second Sentence: There is a young boy in a swimsuit playing at the pool. Elements: young boy, swimsuit, pool Step 2: Compare the elements in both sentences. Young Boy: Both sentences mention a young boy. Blue Trunks/Swimsuit: The first sentence specifies that the boy is wearing blue trunks, while the second sentence generalizes it to a swimsuit. Blue trunks can be considered a type of swimsuit. Outdoor Fountain/Pool: The first sentence refers to an outdoor fountain with a brick foundation, while the second one mentions a pool. These are different types of water features. Step 3: Evaluate the truthfulness of the second sentence based on the first. The second sentence has similarities with the first, such as the young boy and the fact that he's wearing swimwear. However, the primary difference is the location, with the first sentence describing an outdoor fountain with a brick foundation and the second sentence mentioning a pool. Conclusion: The second sentence is not entirely true based on the information provided in the first sentence. While the second sentence has some similarities, the difference in location (pool vs. outdoor fountain with a brick foundation) makes it not a true statement."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

In 1692, the Neapolitan painter Luca Giordano became one of the few allowed to view paintings held in Philip IV's private apartments, and was greatly impressed by Las Meninas. Giordano described the work as the \\"theology of painting\\", and was inspired to paint A Homage to Velázquez (National Gallery, London). By the early 18th century his oeuvre was gaining international recognition, and later in the century British collectors ventured to Spain in search of acquisitions. Since the popularity of Italian art was then at its height among British connoisseurs, they concentrated on paintings that showed obvious Italian influence, largely ignoring others such as Las Meninas.An almost immediate influence can be seen in the two portraits by Mazo of subjects depicted in Las Meninas, which in some ways reverse the motif of that painting. Ten years later, in 1666, Mazo painted Infanta Margaret Theresa, who was then 15 and just about to leave Madrid to marry the Holy Roman Emperor. In the background are figures in two further receding doorways, one of which was the new King Charles (Margaret Theresa's brother), and another the dwarf Maribarbola. A Mazo portrait of the widowed Queen Mariana again shows, through a doorway in the Alcázar, the young king with dwarfs, possibly including Maribarbola, and attendants who offer him a drink. Mazo's painting of The Family of the Artist also shows a composition similar to that of Las Meninas. Francisco Goya etched a print of Las Meninas in 1778, and later used Velázquez's painting as the model for his Charles IV of Spain and His Family. As in Las Meninas, the royal family in Goya's work is apparently visiting the artist's studio. In both paintings the artist is shown working on a canvas, of which only the rear is visible. Goya, however, replaces the atmospheric and warm perspective of Las Meninas with what Pierre Gassier calls a sense of \\"imminent suffocation\\". Goya's royal family is presented on a \\"stage facing the public, while in the shadow of the wings the painter, with a grim...

The country has a coastline on the northern shore of the Mediterranean Sea, the Adriatic Sea to the west and the Ionian Sea to the southwest where the Albanian Riviera begins. Albania is less than from Italy, across the Strait of Otranto which connects the Adriatic Sea to the Ionian Sea. - Macedonia ( tr. \\"Makedonija\\"), officially the Republic of Macedonia (Macedonian: , tr. \\"Republika Makedonija\\"), is a country in the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. It is one of the successor states of the former Yugoslavia, from which it declared independence in 1991. It became a member of the United Nations in 1993, but, as a result of an ongoing dispute with Greece over the use of the name \\"Macedonia\\", was admitted under the provisional description the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (sometimes unofficially abbreviated as FYROM and FYR Macedonia), a term that is also used by international organizations such as the European Union, the Council of Europe and NATO. - A parliamentary election was held in Albania on 28 June 2009 . No alliance achieved 71 deputies on its own needed to form a parliamentary majority , hence to form the new government the Democratic party and Socialist Movement for Integration joined forces . What is the relationship between 'albanian parliamentary election' and 'prime minister of albania'? The answer to this question is:","output":"The relationship between the Albanian parliamentary election and the Prime Minister of Albania is that the parliamentary election determines the composition of the People's Assembly, which in turn influences the appointment of the Prime Minister. The party or coalition that wins the majority in the parliamentary election typically has its leader appointed as the Prime Minister by the President. The Prime Minister, as the head of government, then recommends ministers to form the Council of Ministers, which must be approved by the People's Assembly. In the 2009 parliamentary election, no alliance won a majority on its own, leading to a coalition between the Democratic Party and the Socialist Movement for Integration to form the government."},{"instruction":"If \\"A buy is grinding a rail on a snowboard.\\" does that mean that \\"A girl is practicing softball.\\"?

But the lips have gotta touch the toe.\\" So goes the regular incantation here in the Downtown Hotel's Sourdough Saloon, in the heart of Dawson City—itself the heart of the Klondike's new gold rush. Robert Service, the bard of the Yukon, wrote that \\"There are strange things done in the midnight sun/By the men who moil for gold.\\" Few are stranger than the saga of the Sourtoe Cocktail. Garnished with a preserved human toe, this digital drink is administered nightly to crowds of tourists, trappers and miners. Many are chasing down Dawson's new gold rush, which has seen roughly 50,000 new claims staked in the region in the past two fiscal years, up from just a couple thousand claims per year previously. This city of 1,800 now swells to roughly 4,000 during the summer since gold prices spiked. And the Sourtoe—a local attraction that has gained notice and travel-guide mentions over the past 39 years—is drawing a new generation of those eager to prove themselves true Yukoners (or, in local parlance, \\"sourdoughs\\") by downing the tawdry tipple. The idea was born in 1973, when riverboat captain Dick \\"River Rat\\" Stevenson found a severed big toe preserved in a pickle jar in a cabin outside of town. Capt. Dick, as he is known, says he came up with the original rules for the drink over the course of a drunken evening with friends: take a beer glass full of champagne, drop in the toe, tip the glass back…and the toe must touch the lips. In September 1973, eight people participated in the first attempt; nearly four decades later, the Sourtoe Cocktail Club has an estimated 100,000-plus members. You can now \\"do\\" the Sourtoe with any beverage (Yukon Jack whisky liqueur preferred). It costs 5. There is a ceremony performed by the night's \\"toe captain,\\" a logbook to sign and a certificate of membership awarded. While it may sound unsanitary, the toes are pickled for months in medical alcohol and then packed in dry salts. \\"There is no issue with the toe,\\" says Patricia Living, communications director for Yukon Health and Social Services. \\"The risk of freezing on the way to the bar or being attacked by a pack of wolves would be higher.\\" \\"I think the aesthetics are more worrisome than the health aspect,\\" said Stephen S. Morse, professor of clinical epidemiology at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. \\"I doubt there's much that anyone would catch from it.\\" \\"The Sourtoe would be shut down most anywhere else,\\" says Capt. Dick, now 82 and retired to the Yukon's capital city, Whitehorse. He says the toe is his proudest accomplishment—that and organizing a nude beauty contest on an island in the Yukon River. He recently shipped a toe-shaped urn up to Dawson City, so his ashes can someday sit in the Sourdough Saloon. \\"It's hard to become famous,\\" Capt. Dick says. \\"It's much easier to become infamous.\\" And if people come looking for anything (other than gold) in Dawson City—center of the 1896 Klondike rush, just south of the Arctic Circle and roughly 300 miles from nowhere—it is a little bit of infamy. \\"This is the coolest thing I've ever done,\\" said Levi Wiebe, 23, of Coaldale, Alberta, after downing the Sourtoe Cocktail on a recent night. \\"I got it in my mouth a little,\\" said a chilled Caleigh Miller, 30, of Whitehorse. \\"It's a bit gross looking,\\" said Chris Quickfall, 19, of Prince George, British Columbia, who heard about the toe from a hitchhiker and decided to do it for his birthday. \\"It tastes like plastic.\\" There are, of course, those who can't be persuaded to partake. \\"Heck no, I want to live until I'm 90,\\" said Carolyn Wingard, 64, a retired soldier from St. Augustine, Fla. \\"But I'll tell people I did.\\" \\"We've had people throwing up, we've had people gagging on their drinks,\\" says Dick Van Nostrand, manager at the Downtown Hotel. Real trouble, however, is when someone gets overenthusiastic. \\"You never know when some fool is going to do something stupid,\\" Mr. Van Nostrand says. \\"And then we'll be without a toe.\\" Indeed, many toes have been lost. The original toe touched roughly 725 pairs of lips before it was swallowed in the summer of 1980 by a placer miner. A replacement toe was swallowed in 1983. Other toes have been damaged by overzealous patrons. Despite the toes' propensity to walk away, donors keep stepping forward. After the first toe was swallowed, a woman in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, sent in a middle toe she had had amputated years earlier due to an inoperable corn. One toe was donated by a trapper who had lost it to frostbite. Another came by way of lawn mower accident. Steve White, 42, a chain-link fence installer in Whitehorse, got his pinkie toe amputated in January 2000 after developing hammertoe—and, having heard the story of the Sourtoe, asked the doctor to save it. Mr. White didn't get around to donating until April 2002. \\"The call came out from Dawson, they had no toes going into the season,\\" Mr. White recalls. Before that, he had had it in a jar in his freezer. \\"My wife wasn't very happy with me,\\" he says. Mr. White sent the toe up to Dawson City and later drove up to \\"do the toe\\" for the first time—with his own toe. \\"I always tell people I left a little piece of me in Dawson,\\" he says. Next September will mark the 40th anniversary of the Sourtoe. In addition to donating his ashes, Capt. Dick wants to have a wax figurine made of himself, which would wear his captain's gear and preside over the toe in perpetuity. Still, he is worried about the future. \\"At this point, you can't get away with this stuff,\\" he says. \\"Things are really going to hell…It's still a frontier, but not like it was.\\" Printed in The Wall Street Journal, page A1 A version of this article appeared November 5, 2012, on page A1 in the U.S. edition of The Wall Street Journal, with the headline: No Way to Tiptoe Around It: This Drink Can Be Hard to Swallow. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

Stream of consciousness reasoning: When we consider predicting the outcome of a coin toss, the scenario appears to be quite simple at first glance - either heads or tails. However, there are numerous factors that actually contribute to the complexity of such predictions. First, the initial conditions of the toss, such as the force applied, the angle of the coin, and the surface on which it lands, all play a role in determining the ultimate outcome. These conditions can vary greatly with each toss, and they drastically impact the final result of the coin toss. Second, we must consider the chaotic nature of coin tosses. The motion of a tossed coin is heavily influenced by slight changes in the aforementioned initial conditions, and minor differences can drastically alter the behavior of the coin. Due to the chaotic nature of these events, it is challenging to make accurate predictions, even with extensive data and advanced modeling techniques. Third, let's think about how such prediction would work in a practical sense. Making an accurate prediction would require an incredibly detailed understanding of various factors like physics, the environment, and human behavior, making it improbable for a typical person to predict with absolute certainty. Moreover, even if we attempted to use a high-tech forecasting system, the predictions would often still be subject to sporadic errors because of the inherent unpredictability and vast number of influencing factors. With these factors in mind, it becomes apparent that no matter how advanced or skilled our prediction methods may be, there will always be a level of uncertainty involved in attempting to predict the outcome of a coin toss. Therefore, it is not possible to tell with absolute certainty the outcome of a single coin toss."},{"instruction":"Here are some keywords about a restaurant: name = The Eagle, eatType = coffee shop, eatType = restaurant, food = Italian, priceRange = cheap, area = riverside, familyFriendly = yes, near = Burger King.

The phrase \\"these are the wicked\\" is a complete thought and can stand on its own as a sentence, so it should be followed by a full stop (period). This phrase is a statement about who we're talking about, so it's important to highlight it in this way. The phrase \\"Being always at ease, they increase in riches\\" describes a condition and its result. In this case, the word \\"being\\" serves as a connector, illustrating the reason why something is happening. It is customary to put a comma after such introductory phrases.

Symptoms like inflammation, fever, and pain are typically observed during this phase, as they are the body's natural response to the infection and cell damage.

Similarly, paragraph 3 of Article 10 stipulates the separation of criminals from juveniles from adults."},{"instruction":"Select the correct sentiment of the following review: Surely no Saturday morning TV kids' show was ever done this poorly. After all, those producers had to count on the audience coming back. Well, in this awful offering, they could at least count the money they saved on sets. The script could have been a reject from some long-forgotten space opera serial, with a few smarmy lines added for cool-dude Gerald Mohr to murmur to Naura Hayden. No director could have done anything decent with such a loony storyline, so the action just plods boringly along. The spaceship props are absurd--a Bulova wall clock and portable typewriter, for example--but the planet sets have got to be some of the worst in cinematic history. Most are crude drawings, and it's all bathed in an often misfocused red light. Even Mohr's bare hairy chest is used as a prop. And it's a bad one--as rib-thin as the plot.

It tells us about the living condition of these people, not saying anything about small farming operations. The second statement is saying that only small farming operations could ever gain a foothold in Puerto Rico.

I measured the area in my kitchen, but the stove didn't fit because the","output":"measurements were off. The detailed explanation of the sentence would be as follows: The statement is part of a situation where the speaker is trying to fit a stove in their kitchen. The person already measured the area available in their kitchen. The measuring of the kitchen area could involve determining the length, width, and possibly the height of the space to ensure that the stove would fit. This is an important step when installing a new appliance in an existing kitchen design to minimize potential fitting problems. However, in this case, the person encountered a problem. Despite their previous measurement, the stove did not fit in their kitchen. The last part of the statement, 'because the measurements were off,' provides the reason for this problem. The term 'measurements were off' means that there were some inaccuracies or errors in the original measurements taken. Perhaps they were not precise in their calculations, or possibly a miscalculation occurred during the process. It could be that they forgot to take into account certain fixed features that might obstruct the placement of the stove. For example, cabinets, counters, or backsplash areas could impede the full space needed to accommodate the stove. They might have also misread the manufacturer's specifications of the stove's dimensions, resulting in the oversight. This situation exemplifies why it is crucial to double-check all measurements when installing new appliances or furniture. Error in dimensions, even a small one, can lead to unexpected complications. It could result in spatial incongruencies, causing the appliance or furniture not to fit or look out of place within the room layout. Therefore, ensure measurements are carefully done, considering all possible obstructions, and correctly interpreted to prevent such mishaps. Now, in this case, the person might need to consider various solutions to rectify the problem. They might need to use a smaller stove, adjust the existing kitchen arrangement, or modify the furniture or design elements that are obstructing the stove's proper installation. Careful consideration would be necessary to choose a solution that strikes a balance between maintaining the kitchen's functionality and aesthetic qualities."},{"instruction":"Answer the following Q with stream of consciousness. Passage: Gov. Perry also signed H.B. 1815 after passage by the 2007 Legislature, a bill that allows any Texas resident to carry a handgun in the resident's motor vehicle without a CHL or other permit. The bill revised Chapter 46, Section 2 of the Penal Code to state that it is in fact not \\"Unlawful Carry of a Weapon\\", as defined by the statute, for a person to carry a handgun while in a motor vehicle they own or control, or to carry while heading directly from the person's home to that car. However, lawful carry while in a vehicle requires these four critical qualifiers: (1) the weapon must not be in plain sight (in Texas law, \\"plain sight\\" and \\"concealed\\" are mutually exclusive opposing terms); (2) the carrier can not be involved in criminal activities, other than Class C traffic misdemeanors; (3) the carrier can not be prohibited by state or federal law from possessing a firearm; and (4) the carrier can not be a member of a criminal gang.

The most common method of assigning numbers to lines is to assign every line a unique number, starting at 1 for the first line, and incrementing by 1 for each successive line. - Machine code or machine language is a set of instructions executed directly by a computer's central processing unit (CPU). Each instruction performs a very specific task, such as a load, a jump, or an ALU operation on a unit of data in a CPU register or memory. Every program directly executed by a CPU is made up of a series of such instructions. - In computer science, a preprocessor is a program that processes its input data to produce output that is used as input to another program. The output is said to be a preprocessed form of the input data, which is often used by some subsequent programs like compilers. The amount and kind of processing done depends on the nature of the preprocessor; some preprocessors are only capable of performing relatively simple textual substitutions and macro expansions, while others have the power of full-fledged programming languages. - Ratfor (short for \\"Rational Fortran\\") is a programming language implemented as a preprocessor for Fortran 66. It provided modern control structures, unavailable in Fortran 66, to replace GOTOs and statement numbers. - Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems. - Goto (goto, GOTO, GO TO or other case combinations, depending on the programming language) is a statement found in many computer programming languages. It performs a one-way transfer of control to another line of code; in contrast a function call normally returns control. The jumped-to locations are usually identified using labels, though some languages use line numbers. At the machine code level, a goto is a form of branch or jump statement. Many languages support the goto statement, and many do not (see language support). - A compiler is a computer program (or a set of programs) that transforms source code written in a programming language (the source language) into another computer language (the target language), with the latter often having a binary form known as object code. The most common reason for converting source code is to create an executable program. - Crystallography is the experimental science of determining the arrangement of atoms in the crystalline solids (see crystal structure). The word \\"crystallography\\" derives from the Greek words \\"crystallon\\" \\"cold drop, frozen drop\\", with its meaning extending to all solids with some degree of transparency, and \\"grapho\\" \\"I write\\". In July 2012, the United Nations recognised the importance of the science of crystallography by proclaiming that 2014 would be the International Year of Crystallography. X-ray crystallography is used to determine the structure of large biomolecules such as proteins. Before the development of X-ray diffraction crystallography (see below), the study of crystals was based on physical measurements of their geometry. This involved measuring the angles of crystal faces relative to each other and to theoretical reference axes (crystallographic axes), and establishing the symmetry of the crystal in question. This physical measurement is carried out using a goniometer. The position in 3D space of each crystal face is plotted on a stereographic net such as a Wulff net or Lambert net. The pole to each face is plotted on the net. Each point is labelled with its Miller index. The final plot allows the symmetry of the crystal to be established. - Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a branch of fluid mechanics that uses numerical analysis and data structures to solve and analyze problems that involve fluid flows. Computers are used to perform the calculations required to simulate the interaction of liquids and gases with surfaces defined by boundary conditions. With high-speed supercomputers, better solutions can be achieved. Ongoing research yields software that improves the accuracy and speed of complex simulation scenarios such as transonic or turbulent flows. Initial experimental validation of such software is performed using a wind tunnel with the final validation coming in full-scale testing, e.g. flight tests. - A programming language is a formal computer language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms. - Computational physics is the study and implementation of numerical analysis to solve problems in physics for which a quantitative theory already exists. Historically, computational physics was the first application of modern computers in science, and is now a subset of computational science. - Fortran (formerly FORTRAN, derived from \\"Formula Translation\\") is a general-purpose, imperative programming language that is especially suited to numeric computation and scientific computing. Originally developed by IBM in the 1950s for scientific and engineering applications, Fortran came to dominate this area of programming early on and has been in continuous use for over half a century in computationally intensive areas such as numerical weather prediction, finite element analysis, computational fluid dynamics, computational physics, crystallography and computational chemistry. It is a popular language for high-performance computing and is used for programs that benchmark and rank the world's fastest supercomputers. - Computational chemistry is a branch of chemistry that uses computer simulation to assist in solving chemical problems. It uses methods of theoretical chemistry, incorporated into efficient computer programs, to calculate the structures and properties of molecules and solids. It is necessary because, apart from relatively recent results concerning the hydrogen molecular ion (dihydrogen cation, see references therein for more details), the quantum many-body problem cannot be solved analytically, much less in closed form. While computational results normally complement the information obtained by chemical experiments, it can in some cases predict hitherto unobserved chemical phenomena. It is widely used in the design of new drugs and materials. - Numerical weather prediction (NWP) uses mathematical models of the atmosphere and oceans to predict the weather based on current weather conditions. Though first attempted in the 1920s, it was not until the advent of computer simulation in the 1950s that numerical weather predictions produced realistic results. A number of global and regional forecast models are run in different countries worldwide, using current weather observations relayed from radiosondes, weather satellites and other observing systems as inputs. - Ratfiv is an enhanced version of the Ratfor programming language , a preprocessor for Fortran designed to give it C - like capabilities . Fortran was widely used for scientific programming but had very basic control - flow primitives ( \`\` do '' and \`\` goto '' ) and no \`\` macro '' facility which limited its expressiveness . The name of the language is a pun ( Ratfor ( RATional FORtran ) - > \`\` Rat Four '' - > \`\` Rat Five '' - > RatFiv ) . Ratfiv was developed by Bill Wood at the Institute for Cancer Research , Philadelphia , PA in the early 1980s and released on several DECUS ( Digital Equipment Users Group ) SIG ( Special Interest Group ) tapes . It is based on the original Ratfor by B. Kernighan and P. J. Plauger , with rewrites and enhancements by David Hanson and friends ( U. of Arizona ) , Joe Sventek and Debbie Scherrer ( Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ) .

On his way home that night, Sam passes a small art gallery where he witnesses the attack of a woman (Eva Renzi) by a mysterious black-gloved assailant dressed in a raincoat. Attempting to reach her, Sam is trapped between two mechanically-operated glass doors and can only watch as the villain makes his escape after stabing the woman.Eventually the police arrive and Sam discusses what he saw to Inspector Morosini (Enrico Maria Salerno). Sam says that he knows where was something odd about the scene, but he cannot place what's wrong about it. The police take Sam to the police station where they interrogate him all night. In the morning, Sam is permitted to leave, but Morosini takes his passport because he considers Sam an important witness and must not leave Italy. Morosini tells Sam that they have been three unresolved murders and that a \\"dangerous maniac\\" is loose in Rome. Sam phones the airport to cancel his airplane reservation and heads back to his apartment. On his way back, someone swings a meat cleaver at his head, but an elderly woman on the street warns him just in time. The black raincoat killer flees before Sam can identify him.Later that day, Sam goes back to the police station to report his attack and he is told that a black-leather glove was found at the crime scene and has been analyzed.

More Photos » WASHINGTON — In the dark of night, when they get what little sleep they get these days, the people running the campaigns for president have more than enough fodder for nightmares. Worse, come daybreak, they realize their worst fears may yet come true. Dancing in their heads are visions of recounts, contested ballots and lawsuits. The possibility that their candidate could win the popular vote yet lose the presidency. Even the outside chance of an Electoral College tie that throws the contest to Congress. Now add to that parade of potential horrors one more: a freakish two-in-one storm that could, if the more dire forecasts prove correct, warp an election two years and 2 billion in the making. Despite the meticulous planning, careful strategies, polling, advertising and get-out-the-vote efforts, the election could produce the sort of messy outcome that defies expectation and prognostication. Polls show such a tight race between President Obama and Mitt Romney heading into this final week that the two sides are playing out any number of wild possibilities. The approach of Hurricane Sandy reminded them just how out of their control democracy can be. “Obviously, we believe the more people participate in the election, the better,” said David Axelrod, the president’s senior strategist, “and the storm can be disruptive. But to the 50 million people in its path, there are more immediate and potentially grave concerns that transcend politics. We’ll have to wait and see its impact.” The storm forced both candidates to scrap campaign stops and, with eight days until Election Day, will require Mr. Obama to balance the roles of president in an emergency and candidate. That could benefit or hurt him, depending on how voters view his performance, and distract from efforts by both camps to advance a closing argument. Early voting, which Mr. Obama has counted on to bolster his chances of a second term, will most likely grind to a halt in some places along the Eastern Seaboard, while power failures could last much of the week and conceivably until Election Day in some places. It went unnoticed by no one that Virginia, among the most tightly contested states, may be among the most affected. Meteorology is only one wild card facing the campaigns in the final week. On Election Day, the winner may not be known right away; results in one or more states may be close enough to merit recounts. In Ohio, which could decide the election, so many provisional ballots may be cast — and by law are not counted right away — that it may be mid-November before a winner is declared. “The Boy Scout motto comes in handy — be prepared,” said Bradley Blakeman, a Republican strategist and veteran of George W. Bush’s recount fight in Florida. “I know that lists of local lawyers and national legal talent are amassed and will be deployed if need be. After the recount in 2000 and the nail-biter in 2004, the G.O.P. is ready with multiple scenarios already modeled.” The campaigns are so worried about every electoral vote that a pro-Romney “super PAC” even invested in ads in Maine, a largely Democratic state, because it allocates some electoral votes by Congressional district and Republicans have a chance of picking up a single vote there. Of all the messy outcomes, the one that seems likeliest is a candidate’s winning the presidency through the Electoral College despite losing the popular vote, as Mr. Bush did in 2000. If it happens again, it might be in the opposite way, with the Republican, Mr. Romney, in range of a popular plurality and the Democrat, Mr. Obama, with an apparently easier route to an Electoral College victory. Charlie Cook, a well-known political handicapper, said the chance of that happening was 10 to 15 percent. Stanley B. Greenberg, a longtime Democratic pollster, put the odds at “one in three.” What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"This text talks about how the presidential race between President Obama and Mitt Romney is very close, and there are many things that could change the outcome. One big worry is Hurricane Sandy, which might affect people's ability to vote, especially in important states like Virginia. Both candidates had to change their plans because of the storm, and nobody knows how this will affect the election results. The race is so close that each side is making many plans for what might happen, like having lawyers ready for recounts. Some people think there is a chance that one candidate could win the popular vote, but lose the election because of the way the Electoral College works."},{"instruction":"Q: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: who was the last roman emperor and how old was he when he ruled Suggested answer: Christians rose to power in the 4th century, during which time a system of dual rule was developed in the Latin West and Greek East .

In 1988, Sub Pop Records LLC was formed by Pavitt and Jonathan Poneman in Seattle, Washington. Sub Pop achieved fame in the late 1980s for first signing Nirvana, Soundgarden, Mudhoney and many other bands from the Seattle alternative rock scene. They are often credited with taking the first steps toward popularizing grunge music, and have continued to achieve critical and commercial success in the new millennium, with bands such as Fleet Foxes, Foals, Beach House, The Postal Service, Flight of the Conchords, Sleater-Kinney, Blitzen Trapper, No Age, Wolf Parade and The Shins on their roster. In 1995 the owners of Sub Pop sold a 49% stake of the label to the Warner Music Group. - Jack Endino (born 1964) is an American producer and musician based in Seattle, United States.

Blues rock continues to be an influence, with performances and recordings by several popular artists. - Doom metal is an extreme style of heavy metal music that typically uses slower tempos, low-tuned guitars and a much \\"thicker\\" or \\"heavier\\" sound than other metal genres. Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal with songs such as \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"Children of the Grave\\", \\"Electric Funeral\\" and \\"Into the Void\\". During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands from England (Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General), the United States (Pentagram, Saint Vitus, Trouble) and Sweden (Candlemass, Count Raven) defined doom metal as a distinct genre. - Highlights and Lowlives is the eighth studio album by American rock band Blue Cheer , released in 1990 and produced by Jack Endino . - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia.

Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels. - Grunge (sometimes referred to as the Seattle sound) is a subgenre of alternative rock that emerged during the in the American state of Washington, particularly in Seattle.

A:","output":"A: The Moon revolves around the Earth in an elliptical orbit, completing one full orbit in approximately 27.3 days, which is known as a sidereal month. However, if you consider the time it takes for the Moon to return to the same phase (such as full moon to full moon), that period is slightly longer at approximately 29.5 days, called a synodic month. The difference between the sidereal and synodic months is due to the Earth's own movement around the Sun. As the Moon revolves around the Earth, the Earth is also orbiting the Sun, meaning that the Moon has to travel a little bit more to reach the same phase as observed from Earth. It is important to note that the Moon is tidally locked to the Earth, meaning that it rotates on its axis at the same rate as it revolves around the Earth. This phenomenon causes the same side of the Moon (the near side) to always face the Earth, while the far side remains mostly unseen. The time it takes for the Moon to complete one full rotation on its axis is equal to the time it takes for it to orbit the Earth, which is approximately 27.3 days. In summary, the Moon revolves around the Earth in approximately 27.3 days (sidereal month) and takes about 29.5 days to return to the same phase (synodic month), while also completing one rotation on its axis in about 27.3 days."},{"instruction":"Article: A comprehensive business plan keeps you organized as you set up your ISP.

During his rule, he embarked on numerous campaigns in Italy, beginning what is known as the Italian Wars. However, the power dynamics that enabled him to ascend to the throne are grounded in his family's lineage. In this article, we will delve deeper into the question of which family member allowed Charles VIII a claim to the French throne. Step 1: Understand the Basics of the Valois Dynasty Charles VIII belonged to the Valois dynasty, a royal house that ruled France from 1328 to 1589. The Valois line emerged as a cadet branch of the Capetian dynasty. It is essential to understand the context of the Valois dynasty to pinpoint the specific family member who provided Charles VIII with his claim to the throne. Step 2: Identify the Proximity in Lineage The chain of inheritance usually follows the father-to-son succession, potentially disrupted by events such as premature death or political strife. Identifying the closest relative of Charles VIII within the Valois line who held the throne directly before him will help us ascertain the key family member. Step 3: Determine the Key Family Member Following the Valois line, Charles VIII's father, Louis XI, was the King of France before him. Louis XI took the throne after the death of his father, Charles VII. Louis XI's position in the Valois line naturally offered young Charles VIII a claim to the throne. Therefore, Louis XI, Charles's father, is the family member responsible for giving Charles VIII his claim to the French throne. Step 4: Consider Other Relevant Family Members Although Louis XI is the most obvious answer, it's necessary to examine Charles VIII's maternal lineage as well. His mother, Charlotte of Savoy, was the daughter of Louis, Duke of Savoy, and Anne of Cyprus. However, the maternal line did not significantly contribute to Charles VIII's claim to the throne. The Savoy line offered political advantages, but the primary connection to the French throne remained through his paternal Valois line. Conclusion Charles VIII's claim to the French throne can be traced back to his father, Louis XI, who was a significant figure in the Valois dynasty. The lineage stemming from the Valois line and the right of succession from father to son provided Charles VIII with a strong claim to ascend the throne. As a result of this connection, Charles VIII went on to become the King of France, leaving his mark on history as a key player in the Italian Wars. His reign stands as an essential chapter in the story of the Valois dynasty and French history."},{"instruction":"Read this: Colquhoun's utilitarian approach to the problem – using a cost-benefit argument to obtain support from businesses standing to benefit – allowed him to achieve what Henry and John Fielding failed for their Bow Street detectives.

Answer:","output":"Based on the given context, we can describe Austin as a responsible, caring and involved individual. By taking Remy to his first day of daycare and personally handing him over to the woman, Austin displays a number of significant qualities. Firstly, it's evident that Austin holds a concern for Remy's well-being. By ensuring that Remy is properly introduced, settled, and cared for, Austin showcases his protective instincts. This level of concern and attention to detail is indicative of someone who is empathetic and considerate. Secondly, Austin proves himself to be reliable and responsible. Daycare is often utilized by busy parents or guardians who need a secure environment to leave their children during the day. By facilitating Remy's introduction to daycare, Austin demonstrates that he is proactive in managing his daily life and that of Remy, securing a safe and nurturing environment for Remy's growth and development. Moreover, Austin's personal involvement in the process of taking Remy to daycare and handing him over to the caregiver reveals the value he places on strong connections and relationships. By physically presenting Remy himself, Austin reinforces the trust he has in the daycare provider as well as establishing a bond between Remy, the caregiver, and himself. This shows an appreciation for personal connections and a dedication to maintaining them. Lastly, Austin's actions on Remy's first day of daycare can also be indicative of his adaptive nature. Utilizing daycare often means adapting to new situations, schedules, and challenges that accompany entrustment of one's child to another individual or institution for care—particularly in the case of Remy's first day. Austin's ability to navigate these changes implies that he is flexible and open to embracing new experiences and ensuring Remy's ability to adapt as well. To summarize, Austin can be described as a responsible, caring, empathetic, and involved individual who values personal connections and is able to adapt to change. By taking Remy to daycare and caring about his introduction, Austin demonstrates a strong commitment to Remy's well-being and growth, as well as a strong connection with the caregiver and the daycare environment."},{"instruction":"Given the question: - lastyear is 1997 1998 - twentysumpired is 35 - source is http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci-icc/content/player/39157.html espncricinfo - role is umpire - fivefor is 0 0 - country is pakistan - bowling is right-arm leg spin - testsumpired is 98 - birth date is 6 june 1968 - lastfor is gujranwala gujranwala - umptwentydebutyr is 2009 - debutyear is 1987 1986 - umpire is true - deliveries is balls 740 634 - umpodilastyr is 2015 - columns is 2 - caption is aleem at icc awards - lastagainst is bahawalpur malaysia - s/s is 0/0 0/0 - year is 1997/98 1995/96 1987 -- 1995 1986/87 2010 - birth place is jhang , punjab , pakistan - date is 1968 6 6 yes - type is first-class list a - umptestdebutyr is 2003 - umpodidebutyr is 2000 - debutdate is 8 february 29 september - column is fc la - catches/stumpings is 5 / -- 17 / -- - debutagainst is adbp united bank limited - fullname is aleem sarwar dar - odisumpired is 172 - tenfor is 0 n/a - lastdate is 6 december 23 march - umptwentylastyr is 2014 - matches is 17 18 - batting is right-handed - debutfor is pakistan railways pakistan railways - runs is 270 179 - wickets is 11 15 - umptestlastyr is 2015 - club is gujranwala allied bank limited lahore city pakistan railways Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

In one case he found the combination to a locked filing cabinet by trying the numbers he thought a physicist would use (it proved to be 27–18–28 after the base of natural logarithms, e = 2.71828...), and found that the three filing cabinets where a colleague kept a set of atomic bomb research notes all had the same combination. He left a series of notes in the cabinets as a prank, which initially spooked his colleague, Frederic de Hoffmann, into thinking a spy or saboteur had gained access to atomic bomb secrets. On several occasions, Feynman drove to Albuquerque to see his ailing wife in a car borrowed from Klaus Fuchs, who was later discovered to be a real spy for the Soviets, transporting nuclear secrets in his car to Santa Fe. Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\"): How did Feynman help a colleague?","output":"In the passage provided, it does not explicitly state that Richard Feynman directly helped any colleagues. However, one could interpret his actions as a form of unintended assistance. By playing pranks on his colleagues, such as leaving notes in the filing cabinets and discovering the combinations to the locks, Feynman potentially exposed security vulnerabilities at the top-secret Los Alamos facility. This could have led to increased awareness among the scientists regarding the importance of implementing proper security measures, including the use of more resilient and secure locks for sensitive materials, as well as promoting a more cautious attitude when selecting combinations for their locks. Additionally, these pranks might have lightened the atmosphere in the highly secretive and intense environment of the Los Alamos National Laboratory during the development of the atomic bomb. While not directly helping colleagues with their scientific work, Feynman's jokes could have improved morale, contributing to a positive work environment vital for the productivity and well-being of the scientists involved."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Here's a step-by-step process for this task: Step 1: Identify the objects In order to sort the objects, we first need to recognize what we are working with. Let's say the objects are a sphere, a cube, a cylinder, and a cone. Step 2: Define the categories To classify the objects, we need to establish the categories. In this case, the categories could be based on the shapes of the objects: Spheres, Cubes, Cylinders, and Cones. Step 3: Examine each object We will now examine each object and determine its shape. - The sphere is a 3D shape with a continuous round surface and no edges or vertices. - The cube is a 3D shape with six square faces, 12 edges, and eight vertices. - The cylinder is a 3D shape with two circular bases connected by a curved surface. - The cone is a 3D shape with a circular base and a lateral surface that narrows to a vertex. Step 4: Sort the objects into categories Now that we have identified the shape of each object, we can sort them into their respective categories: - Spheres: Include the sphere. - Cubes: Include the cube. - Cylinders: Include the cylinder. - Cones: Include the cone. Step 5: Verify the results After categorizing the objects, we can double-check our work to ensure each object has been placed in the correct category. If any errors are found, we can correct them by re-evaluating the object's shape and placing it in the appropriate category. By following these steps, we have successfully sorted a set of differently-shaped objects into separate categories based on their shape.

Thorn - This word is likely to denote a thorny or spiky plant, such as a hawthorn or blackthorn bush. Thorny plants were commonly found in the British landscape during this time and were often used as natural barriers to enclose land or protect settlements. 2.

Putting these two words together, \\"Thorn Ey\\" can be interpreted as \\"Thorn Island,\\" likely referring to an island or an area of land that was either covered with thorny bushes, surrounded by them, or easily identifiable by the presence of these plants. In the context of the historical account mentioned, it makes sense that an island with such natural barriers would have been chosen as the site for the construction of a church in the 7th century. In summary, the term \\"Thorn Ey\\" refers to a geographical location known as Thorn Island, which is characterized by the presence of thorny plants. The provided information does not directly answer the question about the meaning of Thorn Ey, but by delving into the etymology of the term and the context it is used in, we are able to deduce the meaning."},{"instruction":"Choose your answer: If \\"Woman in red shirt and white cap rollerblading on gray surface.\\", does it logically follow that \\"The woman is practicing to enter a roller derby.\\"?

Possible A: throw things, watch tv, sit down, play sports, play with toys Why is \\"play sports\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"\\"Play sports\\" aligns with human common sense as an answer to the question because uniforms and helmets are commonly associated with playing sports. Uniforms are often used in sports as a way of identifying and distinguishing players from different teams. They also help to create a sense of unity among the members of the team. Furthermore, some sports activities require players to wear specific uniforms to follow the rules of the game or event. Helmets are used in a variety of sports as safety equipment to protect players from injuries, especially head injuries, which can be quite serious. Some sports where helmets are commonly used include football, rugby, cricket, hockey, cycling, motorsports, skiing, and snowboarding among others. Based on these pieces of information, seeing children in uniforms and helmets would naturally lead one to assume they are about to engage in a sport activity. The other options - throw things, watch tv, sit down, play with toys - do not necessarily need uniforms and helmets, thus \\"Play sports\\" aligns more logically with the statement."},{"instruction":"Translate to German: We walked around for some time and asked the owner of the campground for addresses of restaurants.

The question and answer:","output":"Question: Considering the possibility that a boat may not be in the water and a ship might not be producing smoke, what are some alternative situations in which we might find these vessels? Answer: Boats and ships can be found in various situations beyond the stereotypical image of a boat floating in the water and a ship emitting smoke from its funnel. For boats, they can be placed on trailers for transportation on land, displayed in museums, stored in boatyards or marinas for maintenance, featured in boat shows, or even situated on dry docks for repair. Additionally, people might choose to live on a boat that is moored to a dock rather than sailing. Ships, on the other hand, can be found in diverse scenarios as well. For instance, a ship could be at anchor, docked in a harbor, or berthed at a quay for loading/unloading cargo or passengers. Ships can also be decommissioned and turned into museums, permanently moored as a restaurant or hotel, or even grounded as artificial reefs for marine life.

This is all lower case. Can you fix that?","output":"Controls for Player-2 Inside a Game When implementing controls for the second player in a game, it is crucial to consider a different set of input keys or buttons that will not interfere with Player-1's controls. This separation ensures that both players can enjoy the gaming experience without hindrances. In most cases, video games have a pre-configured set of controls for Player-2, but many also offer customizable control schemes. Before diving into the most common control configurations, it's essential to mention that game controllers also have built-in support for multiple players. For a standard keyboard setup, the traditional configuration for Player-2 includes the following controls: 1. Up Arrow: Move the character or navigate upward. 2. Down Arrow: Move the character or navigate downward. 3. Left Arrow: Move the character or navigate to the left. 4. Right Arrow: Move the character or navigate to the right. 5. Numpad 0 (Ins): Primary action or shooting. 6. Numpad 1 (End): Secondary action or jumping. 7. Numpad 2 (Down): Access inventory or drop-down menu. 8. Numpad 3 (PgDn): Tertiary action or switching weapons. 9. Numpad 4 (Left): Use special ability or power-up. 10. Numpad 5: Pause the game or access the menu. For a game controller such as an Xbox or PlayStation controller, the standard control configuration for Player-2 is similar to Player-1's. The only difference is that the controller will recognize it as the second device connected. As a result, Player-1 and Player-2 controls will mimic each other, with each player having identical control capabilities. In conclusion, setting up controls for Player-2 varies depending on the platform and the game itself. Nonetheless, there's usually a standard set of controls for both keyboard and game controller configurations. It is essential to ensure that the second player can enjoy the gaming experience without disturbing Player-1's gameplay. This balance allows both players to focus on the game and take advantage of their respective control schemes fully."},{"instruction":"Musí žít s námi.

The band was formed in 1992 by percussionist Shawn Crahan, drummer Joey Jordison and bassist Paul Gray. After several lineup changes in its early years, the band settled on nine members for more than a decade: Corey Taylor, Mick Thomson, Jim Root, Paul Gray, Craig Jones, Sid Wilson, Shawn Crahan, Chris Fehn and Joey Jordison. Gray died on May 24, 2010, and was replaced during 2011-2014 by guitarist Donnie Steele. Context: Anticipation for Slipknot's second album was intense. In early 2001, the band began recording the second album at Sound City and Sound Image studios in Los Angeles. Around this time, conflicts arose between band members due to extensive touring and recording schedules. Recording of their second album ended in February 2001 and the band embarked on their Iowa World Tour. Entitled Iowa, Slipknot's second album - released on August 28, 2001 - peaked at number three on the Billboard charts and at number one in the UK. The album produced three singles; \\"The Heretic Anthem\\" (promotional single), \\"Left Behind\\", and \\"My Plague\\", which appeared on the soundtrack for the film Resident Evil. In 2002, Slipknot appeared in Rollerball (2002), performing \\"I Am Hated\\". The release and intense promotion of the album resulted in sold-out shows in large arenas in several countries. In mid-2002, Slipknot went on hiatus because of internal conflicts, and band members focused on side projects. Vocalist Taylor and guitarist Root revived their band Stone Sour, drummer Jordison created Murderdolls with vocalist Wednesday 13, percussionist Crahan founded To My Surprise and DJ Wilson went solo as DJ Starscream. For a while, the future of Slipknot was uncertain and there was much speculation about whether there would be a third album, or if the split would become permanent. \\"I don't have a problem with anyone in Slipknot,\\" Jordison protested. \\"I've seen comments from Corey saying there are things to be resolved, but I have no fucking idea what he's talking about.\\" Nonetheless, on November 22, 2002, Slipknot released their second DVD, Disasterpieces. Preparation for Slipknot's fourth album began towards the end of 2007; work began at Sound Farm Studio in Jamaica, Iowa, with producer Dave Fortman in February 2008. The album was finished in June, and the band the All Hope Is Gone World Tour on July 9, 2008. Slipknot's fourth album, All Hope Is Gone, was released on August 20, 2008, debuting at number one on the Billboard albums chart. The album produced five singles; \\"All Hope Is Gone\\", \\"Psychosocial\\", \\"Dead Memories\\", \\"Sulfur\\" and \\"Snuff\\". 2009 marked the 10th anniversary of Slipknot's debut album; to commemorate the event, the band released a special edition version of Slipknot on September 9, 2009. The band toured in support of the album throughout 2008 and continued until October 31, 2009, resulting in Slipknot's third hiatus. During the hiatus, several band members focused on respective side projects; Taylor founded Junk Beer Kidnap Band and returned to Stone Sour with guitarist Root; Crahan continued working with his band Dirty Little Rabbits; and drummer Jordison returned with his band Murderdolls and became the new permanent drummer of Rob Zombie. Percussionist Fehn is now a full-time bassist with metalcore band Will Haven and Sid Wilson founded the eponymous band Sid. In 2010, Gray was planning to tour with the supergroup, Hail!, but on May 24, 2010, he was found dead in an Urbandale, Iowa hotel room. Circumstances surrounding his death at the time were not immediately known; an autopsy suspected his death was not intentional but did not reveal the cause. The day after his death, the remaining eight members of the band held a live, unmasked, press conference alongside Gray's widow and brother. On June 21, the cause of death was confirmed as an accidental overdose of morphine and synthetic morphine substitute fentanyl. The band was hesitant to comment on the future of Slipknot. The members made conflicting statements in interviews; drummer Jordison told The Pulse of Radio \\"there is another Slipknot record already kinda in the making\\". Vocalist Taylor told FMQB Productions' he was \\"very conflicted about whether or not [he wants] to do anything with Slipknot\\". The band released their fourth video album (sic)nesses on September 28, 2010; it debuted at number one on the Billboard Top Music Video Charts. The DVD features Slipknot's entire live performance at the 2009 Download Festival and a 45-minute film documenting their tour in support of All Hope Is Gone, and served as a tribute to Paul Gray. Regarding the continuation of Slipknot, Taylor told NME Gray would want them to continue and he felt they should but he was ambivalent about returning to the band. Slipknot returned to touring in 2011, performing a small number of shows in Europe. They headlined the Sonisphere Festival and Rock in Rio alongside Iron Maiden and Metallica, and performed at Belgium's Graspop Metal Meeting. Donnie Steele substituted for Gray in the concerts; he was positioned behind Jordison and obscured from the audience's view. Slipknot also said the band would complete and release the band's fifth studio album, and that there were no plans to replace Gray. Jordison said the writing process for the album had already begun and that he had written 17 songs. Slipknot performed at the Mayhem Festival tour of 2012. On May 29, 2012, Roadrunner Records posted a teaser video titled Antennas to Hell on its website. Later that day, on Twitter, Corey Taylor said Slipknot will release a greatest hits album on June 17, 2012. He also said the band was not yet recording new material but was putting together demos for a new album. Slipknot's first annual music festival, called Knotfest, was held on August 17, 2012, at Mid-America Motorplex near Pacific Junction, Iowa, and on August 18, 2012, in Somerset, Wisconsin. Deftones, Lamb of God, Serj Tankian also performed at the festival. The festival shows also debuted a Slipknot museum. On 14, June 2013, Slipknot headlined the Download Festival for a second time. The band performed to roughly 90,000 people and was twice forced to stop the set--once in the middle of a song--to allow the front barricade, which had split open under crowd pressure, to be repaired.

Question: suppose more stormy weather occurs happens, how will it affect MORE sugar and oxygen being produced. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"To answer this question, let's go through the steps and analyze the impact of stormy weather on each step. 1. Sunlight strikes the chlorophyll molecules in the plant. Stormy weather typically comes with increased cloud cover, which can reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the chlorophyll molecules in the plants. With less sunlight available, the process of photosynthesis will not be as efficient. 2. Is trapped. Less sunlight reaching the chlorophyll molecules can result in less energy being trapped during photosynthesis, thereby affecting the overall process. 3. Plant also takes in water and carbon dioxide from the environment. Stormy weather can increase the levels of water and carbon dioxide in the environment, but these factors alone may not have a significant impact on photosynthesis. However, the reduced sunlight due to increased cloud cover during stormy weather will still affect the process. 4. The plant forms glucose. With less sunlight being trapped, the plant's ability to form glucose through photosynthesis will be reduced, leading to a lower rate of sugar production. 5. The plant releases oxygen into the atmosphere. Since the process of photosynthesis is directly related to oxygen production, reduced sunlight also means less oxygen being released by the plant into the atmosphere. In conclusion, stormy weather will have a negative effect on the amount of sugar and oxygen being produced by plants due to decreased sunlight availability.

If the protein is subject to changes in temperature, pH, or exposure to chemicals, the protein structure may change, losing its shape without losing its primary sequence in what is known as denaturation. Denaturation is often reversible because the primary structure of the polypeptide is conserved in the process if the denaturing agent is removed, allowing the protein to resume its function. Sometimes denaturation is irreversible, leading to loss of function. One example of irreversible protein denaturation is when an egg is fried. The albumin protein in the liquid egg white is denatured when placed in a hot pan. Not all proteins are denatured at high temperatures; for instance, bacteria that survive in hot springs have proteins that function at temperatures close to boiling. The stomach is also very acidic, has a low pH, and denatures proteins as part of the digestion process; however, the digestive enzymes of the stomach retain their activity under these conditions. Protein folding is critical to its function. It was originally thought that the proteins themselves were responsible for the folding process. Only recently was it found that often they receive assistance in the folding process from protein helpers known as chaperones (or chaperonins) that associate with the target protein during the folding process. They act by preventing aggregation of polypeptides that make up the complete protein structure, and they disassociate from the protein once the target protein is folded.

Try to avoid ruminating over negative thoughts or ideas. Instead, do something about the situation. For example, if nobody wants to publish the novel you wrote, that doesn't mean you have to let your worth lie in what other people think about your work. Be proud of yourself for a job well done, keep trying to get published, or try something new. If you got fired, pick yourself up and look for another job -- or even consider finding a job that gives you more value and makes you happier, even if you take your career down a new path. Though it may not feel like it, getting fired may be the best thing that ever happened to you. Try to think about the positives and move toward a solution. Having goals and dreams increases resilience. A lack of purpose and goals reduces resilience and may leave you open to being taken advantage of, manipulation, and poor life choices; it reduces your sense of control over your life, which can easily lead to depression and anxiety. Consider what goals you have, whether little or large. These goals give a sense of purpose to your life and keep you focused. Write down a list of things you want to accomplish in life. Keep this list in a safe place and evaluate your progress regularly. Learn to recognize what gives you a sense of purpose in life and what detracts from that. Live your life in accordance with your values and convictions. If you want to be a more resilient person, then you have to not only set goals, but you have to work to achieve them. Making a plan to achieve your goals -- whether you're getting an advanced degree, getting more physically fit, or trying to get over a break up – can help you feel directed, focused, and driven. Make a goals list of everything you want to achieve in the next month, 6 months, and year. Make sure each goal is realistic and achievable. An example of an achievable goal would be to lose 10 lbs in 3 months. An unrealistic (and unhealthy) goal would be to lose 20 lbs in 1 month. Make a week-by-week, or month-by-month plan for getting what you want. Though life is unpredictable and you can't plan everything, setting out some sort of a plan can help you feel more in control of the situation, and more likely to succeed. Tell other people about the goals you want to achieve. Just talking about your goals and discussing what you're going to do may help you feel more obligated to achieve them. People who are resilient tend to be more curious, excited about life, and want to know more. They embrace the unknown and want to feel more knowledgeable about the world. They are excited about other cultures and want to learn about them, and they are well-informed and confident in their views while being able to admit when they want to know more about something. It's this thirst for knowledge that will keep you excited about life, and may make you want to live on in spite of adversity. The more you know, the more equipped you may feel to deal with a major setback or challenge. Learning a foreign language, read books and the papers, and watch exciting films. Resilient people are always asking questions when they are faced with a new situation. Ask questions until you feel like you have a firm grasp of a situation instead of feeling immobile and unable to deal with it. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article emphasizes the importance of being active and proactive in building resilience to deal with tough situations in life.

The priority for the party was a permanent shelter against the rapidly approaching southern winter. On the suggestion of George Marston and Lionel Greenstreet, a hut—nicknamed the \\"Snuggery\\"—was improvised by upturning the two boats and placing them on low stone walls, to provide around five feet (1.5 m) of headroom. By means of canvas and other materials the structure was made into a crude but effective shelter.Wild initially estimated that they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees, who was not a popular man and whose presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.As the weeks extended well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium. A permanent lookout was kept for the arrival of the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays and anniversaries were celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite and, on 15 June, had to be amputated by surgeons Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform in their medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55 minutes and was a complete success.By 23 August, it seemed that Wild's no-stockpiling policy had failed.

Context: Weight gain is a complex issue. But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten. Question: After eating foods high in salt most of their lives, how are people most likely to be (statistically speaking): Answer: OPT: (A). Fans of macaroni and cheese. (B). Overweight or obese.

Here's a breakdown of each sentence: - Sentence A: \\"Jack put his car in the washing machine.\\" In this sentence, Jack is said to put his car in the washing machine. Cars are large vehicles used for transportation and are typically much too large to fit inside a washing machine, which is designed to clean small household items like clothes and textiles. Furthermore, cars are typically washed using a car wash or by hand, rather than being cleaned in a washing machine. Therefore, this sentence is nonsensical because it describes an impossible and illogical action. - Sentence B: \\"Jack put his pants in the washing machine.\\" In this sentence, Jack is said to put his pants in the washing machine. Pants are articles of clothing that people wear, and washing machines are specifically designed to clean clothes by agitating them in water and detergent. This is a typical and reasonable action that many people perform. Therefore, this sentence is not nonsensical, as it describes a logical and possible action. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that Sentence A, \\"Jack put his car in the washing machine,\\" is the nonsensical sentence, as it describes an impossible and illogical action."},{"instruction":"Definition: Given a sentence in Vietnamese, generate a new Vietnamese sentence by performing small changes on the sentence.

Should I validate this answer? A:","output":"Yes, you should validate this answer, as it accurately defines a mule in the context of numismatics. In numismatics, a mule refers to a coin or medal that features an obverse (front) and reverse (back) design that are not typically associated with one another due to minting errors or engraver's mistakes. This makes mules interesting and often collectible pieces for numismatists. Mule coins can result from various situations, such as the accidental pairing of dies from different coins, intentional use of unauthorized dies, or the repurposing of an obsolete die with a more modern one. While most mules are created unintentionally, they can sometimes be the result of intentional manipulation by individuals attempting to create unique and valuable coins. The suggested answer provides a clear and concise explanation of the term \\"mule\\" in the context of coin collecting, capturing the essential aspects of its meaning. Therefore, you should validate this answer as an appropriate and informative response to the question regarding mules in coins."},{"instruction":"Translate to German: Koolhaas’ bar code has not been used officially since its conception.

Patricia didn't help Carrie comfort the crying baby because Select from: [A]. Patricia has many children of her own. [B]. Carrie has many children of her own.","output":"[B]. Carrie has many children of her own. Patricia didn't help Carrie comfort the crying baby because Carrie had many children of her own. Carrie was the proud mother of six beautiful children, ranging in age from the newborn baby to her oldest, 12-year-old Daniel. Carrie's life was a constant whirlwind of activity, joy, and the inevitable struggles that come with raising a large family. But it was a life she cherished, and she was well-supported by her loving husband, Jack. Having many children had taught Carrie a wealth of patience and a seemingly endless supply of understanding. Over the years, she had gained valuable experience in dealing with various situations that motherhood could throw at her, from tantrums to teenage drama. Of course, she had also become something of an expert in soothing crying babies, which was a common occurrence in their bustling household. Patricia, Carrie's sister, watched from a distance as Carrie expertly cradled her youngest in her arms, gently rocking him while softly singing a lullaby that had been passed down through generations in their family. Patricia couldn't help but feel admiration for her sister's seemingly endless patience and boundless love for her children. Despite having many children of her own, Patricia knew that Carrie was immensely capable and confident in her role as a mother. Besides, Patricia was a frequent visitor to Carrie's home, often dropping by to lend a hand with the children or to bring over a home-cooked meal for the busy family. She knew that her sister appreciated her support but also understood the important balance of giving Carrie space to manage her family. Over time, Patricia had learned when to step in and when to step back, allowing Carrie to handle the myriad of challenges and joys that came with raising her family. Today was no different. As Patricia looked on, she could see that Carrie's soothing embrace and calming lullaby were already taking effect on the fussy baby, who was drifting off to sleep in his mother's loving arms. Carrie's gentle smile told Patricia everything she needed to know – her sister had everything under control. Later, as the children played outside, Carrie and Patricia sat together in the kitchen, enjoying a rare moment of peace and quiet. Carrie spoke to Patricia about the challenges she faced with her large family, laughing about the chaos and unpredictability that each day brought. Patricia listened intently, offering her support and sharing her own experiences of motherhood. For Carrie and Patricia, their bond as sisters wasn't just about their shared experiences in raising families – it was about the love and respect they had for each other in their own unique journeys. They understood each other's strengths, weaknesses, and the challenges they each faced, and it was this mutual understanding that allowed them to navigate the ever-evolving landscape of family life. As they sat there in the fading afternoon light, sipping tea and chatting, the realization dawned on both sisters that their relationship was an essential part of their lives. They not only shared a connection as siblings, but also as mothers who were each doing their best in their own way to provide for and nurture their children. Together, with love, laughter, and trust, they would continue to navigate the joys and challenges of motherhood."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Question: Why would a company be going public? Options: - revealing information - being ridiculed - problems - more funding - telling all The answer is \\"more funding\\" because Answer:","output":"The answer is \\"more funding\\" because going public refers to the process of a company issuing shares through an Initial Public Offering (IPO) and listing them on a stock exchange. This allows the company to raise capital from a larger pool of investors, who can buy and trade these shares in the stock market. There are several reasons why a company would desire more funding by going public: 1. Expansion and growth: Additional funding can be used to invest in business growth initiatives, such as hiring more employees, expanding operations to new locations, or entering new markets. This can lead to increased revenue and market share for the company. 2. Acquisition and merger opportunities: After going public, a company may use the funds it raises or its shares as currency to acquire other companies, consolidating its position in the market or diversifying its product offerings. 3. Reducing debt: By raising capital through an IPO, a company can use the proceeds to pay down existing debts and reduce its interest expense. This can improve the company's balance sheet and provide more financial stability. 4. Increased visibility and credibility: When a company goes public, it gains increased visibility in the market, attracting more customers and potential investors. The IPO process also involves a thorough review of the company's financials, management, and operations by regulatory authorities and investment banks, which can enhance the company's credibility among stakeholders. 5. Liquidity for shareholders: Going public allows the company's founders, early investors, and employees with stock options to convert their equity into liquid assets. This can provide financial rewards for their time, effort, and investment in the company, and it can also make it easier for the company to recruit and retain top talent by offering equity-based compensation. In summary, a company would choose to go public primarily to raise more funding. This funding can be used to fuel expansion, reduce debt, pursue mergers and acquisitions, improve visibility and credibility, and provide liquidity for shareholders. Each of these factors enables the company to further its business goals and achieve greater success."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this \\"Make a statement with the shingle design or shape.

Both sentences convey the same primary information: that the Persians did not view Ionia and Aeolis as separate entities, and that Lycia was part of offshore Caria, while Sparda comprised the semi-autonomous islands. Let us examine the differences and similarities in these sentences more closely: 1. Sentence 1: - \\"...Ionia and Aeolis were not considered separate units of the Persians.\\" - \\"...Lycia was included in offshore - Caria.\\" - \\"...Sparda - the semi-autonomous islands.\\" 2. Sentence 2: - \\"...Ionia and Aeolis was not considered separate entities by the Persians.\\" - \\"...Lycia were included in offshore Caria.\\" - \\"...Sparda included the semi-autonomous islands.\\" The key similarity is that both sentences express the same main idea. However, the differences lie in the specific wording and sentence structure: - Sentence 1 uses \\"units\\" to refer to Ionia and Aeolis, while Sentence 2 uses \\"entities.\\" - In Sentence 1, the phrase \\"by the Persians\\" is placed at the end of the sentence, whereas, in Sentence 2, the preposition \\"by\\" precedes the noun \\"the Persians.\\" - Sentence 1 uses a hyphen (-) to set off the phrases \\"offshore - Caria\\" and \\"Sparda - the semi-autonomous islands,\\" while Sentence 2 forgoes this punctuation. - Sentence 1 refers to Lycia in the singular form (\\"Lycia was\\"), whereas Sentence 2 uses the plural verb (\\"Lycia were\\"). Although these are minor differences, they do not change the overarching meaning, and both sentences convey the same information.

The question states that James's parents felt he was wasting his money but still let him put a coin somewhere every weekend. This means we need to select the most appropriate option that fits this description. Step 2: Eliminate irrelevant options. \\"Eat cake\\" is not a place where money can be put and doesn't make sense in this context. Step 3: Evaluate remaining options. - Piggy Bank: Though piggy banks are used for saving money, it doesn't imply a waste of money as it's being saved for future use. - Change Purse: It is another place for storing money, not wasting it. - Parking Meter: This could be a waste of money but it would mean that James would have to park a car every weekend to pay for it. Step 4: Select the best fitting option. \\"Wishing Well\\" - This option fits well because people usually throw coins into a wishing well as a wish-making ritual. Throwing money into a well might be considered a waste by some, as it doesn't guarantee the wish will come true, but is still a common practice. James's parents could think it's a waste of money but still let him do it every weekend.

Which test saw higher concentrations of the products, test C or test D? John was trying to reenact Le Chatelier's principle. To that end, he conducted four tests, test A, test B, test C, and test D. In test A, he didn't input any stress to a chemical system in equilibrium. But In test B, he put some stress to the same system. In test C, he observed a forward reaction, but in test D, he observed a reverse reaction. Hint: Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase. Answer:","output":"Based on the given information and the hint provided, we can infer that test C saw higher concentrations of the products than test D. According to Le Châtelier's principle, when a chemical system at equilibrium experiences stress, it responds by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. One of the ways that a system can respond to stress is by changing the concentrations of reactants and products in the system. In test C, John observed a forward reaction. As the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. This indicates that the system is responding to the stress by producing more products, which results in higher concentrations of the products in test C. On the other hand, in test D, John observed a reverse reaction. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase. This suggests that the system is counteracting the stress by reducing the concentrations of the products. Consequently, the concentrations of the products in test D are lower than those in test C. In conclusion, test C saw higher concentrations of the products compared to test D, as the forward reaction favored in test C resulted in an increase in product concentrations, while the reverse reaction favored in test D caused a decrease in product concentrations."},{"instruction":"Write a (B). yelp review (Available choices: (A). negative.

The server introduced herself as Olivia and promptly presented us with menus and a list of specials, which all sounded mouthwateringly delicious. The food was nothing short of spectacular. The Bruschetta appetizer was refreshingly tangy, with the perfect balance of vine-ripened tomatoes, fresh basil, and a glaze of balsamic reduction. We enjoyed savoring the homemade pasta dishes, particularly the Lasagna, which had a delectably rich Bolognese sauce and melted in our mouths. The tiramisu was a delightful way to end the meal, creamy, and not overly sweet. Throughout the evening, our server Olivia was attentive to our needs without being intrusive. She periodically checked on us to ensure we were enjoying our meal, and she expertly recommended a wine pairing for our entrees.

Cult followings are also commonly associated with niche markets. Cult media are often associated with underground culture, and are considered too eccentric or subversive to be appreciated by the general public or to be a commercial success. Many cult fans express a certain irony about their devotion. Sometimes, these cult followings cross the border to camp followings. Fans may become involved in a subculture of fandom, either via conventions, online communities or through activities such as writing series-related fiction, costume creation, replica prop and model building, or creating their own audio or video productions from the formats and characters. - Alicia Christian \\"Jodie\\" Foster (born November 19, 1962) is an American actress and filmmaker who has worked in films and on television.

Under European Union law, the director is viewed as the author of the film. - New Hollywood, sometimes referred to as the \\"American New Wave\\", refers to a period in American film history from the mid-to-late 1960s (\\"Bonnie and Clyde\\", \\"The Graduate\\") to the early 1980s (\\"Heaven's Gate\\", \\"One from the Heart\\") when a new generation of young filmmakers came to prominence in United States, influencing the types of films produced, their production and marketing, and the way major studios approached film-making. In New Hollywood films, the film director, rather than the studio, took on a key authorial role. \\"New Hollywood\\" usually refers to a period of film-making rather than a style of film-making, though it can be referred to as a movement. The films made in this era are stylistically characterized in that their narrative often strongly deviated from classical norms. - Dennis Franz Schlachta (born October 28, 1944), known professionally as Dennis Franz, is an American actor best known for his role as hard-boiled NYPD Detective Andy Sipowicz in the 19932005 ABC television series \\"NYPD Blue\\", and Lt.

The Act prohibits \`\`entry into the internal waters of New Zealand 12 n. mi. (22.2 km/13-13/16 st. mi.) radius by any ship whose propulsion is wholly or partly dependent on nuclear power'' and bans the dumping of radioactive waste into the sea within the nuclear-free zone, as well as prohibiting any New Zealand citizen or resident \`\`to manufacture, acquire, possess, or have any control over any nuclear explosive device.'' Similar provisions were made for biological weapons. After this Act was passed by the Labour government of David Lange, the United States government suspended its ANZUS obligations to New Zealand. Following consultations with Australia and after negotiations with New Zealand broke down, the United States reiterated that it was suspending its treaty obligations until United States Navy ships were re-admitted to New Zealand ports, citing that New Zealand was \`\`a friend, but not an ally''. The crisis made front-page headlines for weeks in many American newspapers, while many leading American senators were quoted as expressing a deep sense of betrayal. However, David Lange did not withdraw New Zealand from ANZUS, although his government's policy led to the US's decision to suspend its treaty obligations to New Zealand. The legislation was a milestone in New Zealand's development as a nation and seen as an important act of sovereignty, self-determination and cultural identity. Further, many were driven by a sense of responsibility to support peace and the rights of all humans, not just in New Zealand, but worldwide. Can we conclude that are there nuclear power plants in new zealand?","output":"Based on the New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act 1987, it can be concluded that there are no nuclear power plants in New Zealand. The Act prohibits the use of nuclear power for vessels, bans the dumping of radioactive waste, and restricts any activities related to the development, possession, or control of nuclear explosive devices. This legislation reflects New Zealand's strong stance against nuclear power and its commitment to a nuclear-free zone. The focus on alternative and renewable energy sources, such as wind, hydro, and geothermal power, has been prioritized in New Zealand. This commitment to sustainable and environmentally friendly energy sources further supports the conclusion that there are no nuclear power plants in the country. Additionally, New Zealand's government and public sentiment remain strongly opposed to nuclear power, reinforcing the likelihood that no nuclear power plants exist within the nation."},{"instruction":"The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer.

The decision to release the prisoners follows \\"numerous requests\\" from their family members and religious institutions, and is a humanitarian gesture, said Cuban President Raul Castro. Among those who might be freed are prisoners over the age of 60, along with those who are sick, female or young with no previous criminal record. With some exceptions, prisoners convicted of spying, terrorism, murder and drug trafficking will not be released. Those who will be freed have already served a \\"important\\" part of their sentences and exhibited good behavior, according to an official statement published on the state-run website Cubadebate. The jailed American, Gross, will not be among those pardoned, the Cuban Interests Section in Washington said. Gross was jailed in December 2009, when he was working as a subcontractor on a U.S. Agency for International Development project aimed at spreading democracy. Castro has accused him of importing satellite equipment to connect dissidents to the Internet, and this year Cuba's highest court upheld the 15-year sentence imposed on Gross for committing crimes against the security of the state. He has maintained his innocence and said he was trying to help connect the Jewish community to the Internet. Castro, speaking to the National Assembly, said that 86 prisoners from 25 countries would be among those released in coming days. He cited the upcoming visit of Pope Benedict XVI as one of the motivations behind the move, which he said showed the \\"generosity and strength of the revolution.\\" The pope has said he plans to visit Mexico and Cuba before Easter.

He won Paris- Context: Kelly returned in April to the 1988 Vuelta a Espana which started on the rugged mountainous island of Tenerife where his team struggled in the second stage, losing the influential rider Thomas Wegmuller to dysentery and losing further time in the time-trial around Las Palmas. However, on the Spanish mainland, Kelly concentrated on winning sprint time bonuses, battling with sprinter Jorge Dominguez, the BH teammate of leader, Laudelino Cubino. After regaining a minute in four days, the race reached the mountains where Kelly relied on help from Robert Millar of team Fagor-MBK to stay within two minutes of Cubino after the mountain trial to Alto Oviedo.

Gaye had planned the release of an album titled You're the Man, but it was later shelved for unknown reasons. The songs that were to be included on it, along with other unreleased recordings from Hitsville West and Golden World, were later featured on the 2001 re-release of Let's Get It On. The album's first recording, \\"Let's Get It On\\", was composed by Gaye with friend and former Motown label mate Ed Townsend. It was originally written by Gaye as a religious ode to life, but Motown singer-songwriter Kenneth Stover re-wrote it as a more political first draft. Upon hearing Gaye's preliminary mix of Stover's draft, Townsend protested and claimed that the song would be better suited with sexual and romantic overtones, particularly \\"about making sweet love.\\" Gaye and Townsend rewrote the song's lyrics together with the original arrangements and musical accompaniment of the demo intact. The lyrics were inspired by Janis Hunter, whom Gaye had become infatuated with after meeting each other through Ed Townsend during the initial sessions. Townsend has cited Hunter's presence during the album's recording as an inspiration for Gaye. Gaye's intimate relationship with Hunter subsequently became the basis for his 1976 album I Want You. While recording the title track, he was inspired to revive unfinished recordings from his 1970 sessions at the Hitsville U.S.A. Studio. Townsend assisted Gaye with producing the rest of the album, whose recording took place at several sessions throughout 1970 to 1973. They worked on four songs together, including the ballad \\"If I Should Die Tonight\\", while Gaye composed most of the other songs, including those from past sessions. \\"Just to Keep You Satisfied\\" was originally recorded by several Motown groups, including The Originals and The Monitors, as a song dedicated to long-standing love. With re-recording the song, he had re-written the arrangement and lyrics to address the demise of his volatile marriage to Anna Gordy Gaye, who happened to be the original song's co-writer. The background vocals for the album were sung by Gaye, with the exception of \\"Just to Keep You Satisfied\\", which were done by The Originals. Most of the instrumentation for the album was done by members of The Funk Brothers, including bassist James Jamerson, guitarists Robert White and Eddie Willis, and percussionist Eddie \\"Bongo\\" Brown. Gaye also contributed on piano during the sessions.

The sentence pair should look similar, and should be about two related but different objects; for example \\"trophy\\" and \\"suitcase\\". Additionally, the two sentences must be different in terms of trigger words (e.g., \\"small\\" and \\"big\\") which express contrasting properties about the two objects. The answer must not be associated with the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in twin sentences. Also, the answers should not be ambiguous. For each sentence, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use animals and proper nouns (e.g., New York, Macbook, Jeff Bezos, McDonald's, ...) as your objects. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences. E.g., a contrasting sentence can always be created using simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase diversity. Both twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences. Each of the twin sentences must contain only one blank. Make sure that ObjectX and Y have the same number e.g. when ObjectX is singular, ObjectY must be singular, too. The two objects (ObjectX & ObjectY) should be used ONCE in each sentence. Here is a list of contrastive words that may be used as trigger words.

In 2001, county judges heard 98 Protection From Abuse cases, finding the defendant guilty in 48 percent of those cases, either after a hearing or through a technical violation or plea. Of those found guilty, the majority were ordered to pay court costs, plus a 100 fine. No defendants were ordered to pay more than a 250 fine for violating the court order. In 27 percent of the cases, the charges were dismissed or the defendant was found not guilty. In the rest of the cases, charges were withdrawn or the matter is not yet resolved. Sarah T. Casey, executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis, finds it disturbing that in most cases, the fine for violating a PFA is little more than the fine someone would get for cruelty and abuse toward an animal. \\"In most of the counties surrounding Schuylkill County, the penalties given for indirect criminal contempt are much stiffer than those in Schuylkill County,\\" Casey said. \\"What kind of message are we sending those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuse orders? That it's OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County, because you'll only get a slap on the wrist?\\" Under state law, the minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is 100; the maximum fine is 1,000 and up to six months in jail. Like others who are familiar with how the county's legal system does and doesn't work for victims of domestic violence, Casey believes some changes are in order. Valerie West, a manager/attorney with Mid-Penn Legal Services, with offices in Pottsville and Reading, regularly handles domestic violence cases. She finds fault with the local requirement that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed. West said she feels a custody order should be allowed to stand for the full term of the PFA - up to 18 months - as it does in many other counties in the state. \\"It places an undue burden on the plaintiff, in terms of cost, finding legal representation and facing their abuser - not to mention a further burden on the system to provide those services,\\" West said. \\"It may be difficult for the parties to reach an agreement so soon after violence has occurred. Do you have any questions?","output":"It is concerning to see that Schuylkill County has a relatively lenient approach towards penalties for violating Protection From Abuse (PFA) orders. The disparity between fines for animal abuse and those for domestic violence against women highlights a need for a reevaluation of the county's legal system and its effectiveness in protecting victims of domestic abuse. Sarah T. Casey and Valerie West both point out areas where changes could be made to improve the system. Casey emphasizes the need for more severe penalties for violations of PFA orders, while West suggests that the local requirement for the establishment of a custody order within 30 days should be extended to align with other counties in the state. These improvements could potentially create a safer environment for victims and deter abusers from further violence. As an AI assistant, I am unable to make changes to the legal system or enforce laws. However, I can emphasize the importance of advocating for change in areas that need improvement and engaging in discussions to create a safer and more effective system for victims of domestic violence in Schuylkill County and beyond.

How do I translate a 220 word English article into Russian? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Select from: (1). no (2). yes","output":"(1). No These questions are not the same but are related to the process of translation between English and Russian. Let's address each question separately. 1. What is lost when translating Tolstoy literature from Russian to English? Translating any text, especially classic literature like that of Leo Tolstoy, from its original language into another, will inevitably lead to some loss of meaning, nuance, and cultural context. Here are some key elements often lost when translating Tolstoy's literature from Russian to English: a. Language nuances: Russian is a highly inflected language, allowing for complex and expressive sentence structures that can be difficult to replicate in English. This may result in the loss of subtle shades in meaning and emotive impact during translation. b. Cultural context: Some phrases and references in Tolstoy's work are uniquely Russian and may not have direct equivalents in English. A colloquial phrase or idiom may lose its impact in another language, leading to a diminished reading experience for the English audience. c. Wordplays and puns: Tolstoy often used clever wordplays, puns, and other rhetorical devices, which can be lost in translation, as they often rely on the specific sounds and meanings of words in Russian. d. Historical context: Readers of Tolstoy's literature in translation might miss out on historical context due to the limited explanatory notes and annotations that often accompany original Russian texts. Translations may include footnotes but may not cover all references and perspectives contained in the original work. 2. How do I translate a 220-word English article into Russian? There are several steps to effectively translate a 220-word English article into Russian: a. Familiarize yourself with the content and context: Read the article thoroughly and understand the main ideas, arguments, and points before starting the translation. b. Develop a glossary: Prepare a glossary of key terms, idioms, and phrases that are essential to the article for smooth and consistent translation. c. Use a reputable translation tool or dictionary: Consider using tools such as Reverso, Yandex.Translate, or professional language dictionaries to aid with the translation. d. Preserve cultural context: While translating, ensure that cultural references and idioms remain meaningful and relatable to a Russian audience. e. Seek feedback and proofread: After completing the translation, proofread and edit it for grammar, punctuation, and consistency, and ask for feedback from native Russian speakers or professional translators. 3. The multi-choice problem: Since both questions have distinct objectives and solutions, the appropriate answer choice is \\"No\\" – they are not the same questions."},{"instruction":"On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"Cloud sync is needed.\\" The answer to this question is:","output":"As an AI, I don't have personal opinions.

The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament. She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat.

Options: - state - democratic - kingdom - democracy - dictatorship Step-by-step reasoning process below:","output":"The term \\"republic\\" refers to a form of government where citizens have the power to elect representatives who make decisions on their behalf. In the case of the United States, it is a federal republic which consists of individual states with a common central government. Here's a step-by-step reasoning process for each option provided: 1. State - A republic like the USA is made up of states. Each state has its own government and constitution, while still being subject to the overarching laws and regulations of the federal government. In the case of the United States, there are currently 50 states. So, yes, a state is part of a republic like the USA. 2. Democratic - The term \\"democratic\\" has to do with democracy, which is a system of government in which power is vested in the people, who can either exercise their power directly or through elected representatives. A republic like the USA indeed has elements of democracy, as elections are held to choose representatives and officials at various levels of government. So, one could say that being democratic is a feature of the US republic, but it does not make up the republic itself. 3. Kingdom - A kingdom is a form of government that is ruled by a monarch, such as a king or queen. In a republic like the USA, there is no monarch, and the government is guided by a constitution that grants power to elected officials. Therefore, a kingdom is not part of a republic like the USA. 4. Democracy - As mentioned earlier, though the USA has democratic features, it is not a pure direct democracy. Instead, it is a federal republic with democratic elements, which means that the people elect representatives to make decisions on their behalf. While democracy plays an essential role in the functioning of the US government, it is not an all-encompassing descriptor of the entire system. 5. Dictatorship - A dictatorship is a form of government in which an individual or group possesses absolute power, often ruling through coercion and fear. The United States is not a dictatorship; it is a federal republic with democratic features, including checks and balances in the government to prevent one person or group from holding too much power. A dictatorship is not part of a republic like the USA. In conclusion, out of the provided options, \\"state\\" and \\"democratic\\" (to an extent) are the more accurate descriptors of the various components of a republic like the United States. \\"Kingdom,\\" \\"democracy,\\" and \\"dictatorship\\" may represent other forms of government, but they are not part of a republic like the USA."},{"instruction":"For this chain-of-thought reasoning and answer, what was the question?

Dana learned more about mammalian lungs, while Barry learned more about the lungs of birds. and a hint : The lungs of mammals are unique in having alveoli . These are tiny, sac-like structures. Each alveolus is surrounded by a network of very small blood vessels (see Figure below ). Because there are millions of alveoli in each lung, they greatly increase the surface area for gas exchange between the lungs and bloodstream. Human lungs, for example, contain about 300 million alveoli. They give the lungs a total surface area for gas exchange of up to 90 square meters (968 square feet).

Hint: Regions on the Earth's surface (or in its atmosphere) that are high above mean sea level are referred to as high altitude. High altitude is sometimes defined to begin at 2,400 meters (8,000 ft) above sea level.[5][6][7] At high altitude, atmospheric pressure is lower than that at sea level. This is due to two competing physical effects: gravity, which causes the air to be as close as possible to the ground; and the heat content of the air, which causes the molecules to bounce off each other and expand.[8] Answer:","output":"Steep village is situated farther from sea level.

E-cigarettes are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals. Known as \\"e-cigarettes,\\" the devices are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals, spiced with flavors such as chocolate, cola or bubble gum. While manufacturers tout e-cigarettes as a \\"healthy way\\" to smoke, federal health officials say the devices turn nicotine, which is highly addictive, and other chemicals into a vapor that is inhaled by the user. \\"The FDA is concerned about the safety of these products and how they are marketed to the public,\\" said Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg, commissioner of the FDA. CNN contacted Florida-based Smoking Everywhere, one of the largest manufacturers of e-cigarettes, after the FDA announcement, and a spokeswoman said the company had no comment. Because e-cigarettes have not been submitted to the FDA for evaluation or approval, the agency had no way of knowing the levels of nicotine or the amounts or kinds of other chemicals that the various brands of these products deliver to the user. That is why the FDA began to test them. The FDA's Division of Pharmaceutical Analysis analyzed the ingredients in a small sample of cartridges from two leading brands of e-cigarettes. In releasing its information, the FDA did not identify the two companies, but said in one sample, diethylene glycol -- a chemical used in antifreeze that is toxic to humans -- was detected. Other samples detected carcinogens that are dangerous to those who smoke them, the FDA said. The FDA has been examining and seizing shipments of non-U.S.-made e-cigarettes at the U.S. border since summer 2008. To date, 50 shipments have been stopped. The products examined thus far meet the definition of a combination drug-device product under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. \\"We know very little about these devices, said Dr. Jonathan Samet, director of the Institute for Global Health at the University of Southern California, \\"but to say they are healthy -- that's highly doubtful.\\" Do you have any questions?","output":"Alright little buddy, let me explain this to you in a simple way. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, is a group of people who make sure the things we eat, drink, and sometimes even the things we use to help us stop doing a bad habit, are safe for us. Electronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes, are like pretend cigarettes that some people use to help them stop smoking real cigarettes. They look like a real cigarette, but they don't have the real cigarette's smoke. Instead, they have a special type of liquid that turns into a mist when you use it. Now, the FDA found out that some of these e-cigarettes have bad stuff in them that can make us sick. One of these bad things is a chemical that is also found in a liquid called antifreeze, which we use to keep our car engines from getting too cold. This chemical is dangerous to humans. The FDA also found out that some e-cigarettes have other dangerous things in them, called carcinogens. These are things that, when we breathe them in, can make us sick in a very bad way, like how cigarettes do. The people who make the e-cigarettes say they are a healthy choice, but the FDA is worried about them, because they don't know enough about them yet. So, they are testing these e-cigarettes to figure out if they are safe for people to use. Right now, they want to make sure people know that these e-cigarettes may have some bad stuff in them, just like real cigarettes."},{"instruction":"Premise: yeah well this this one was definitely outdoor cat because i saw him all the time and i suspect somebody had just had him and moved off Hypothesis: I believe someone may have owned this cat before moving. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"Step 1: Identify the key elements of the premise and hypothesis. Premise: The cat is seen frequently outdoors, and it is suspected that someone previously owned the cat and moved away. Hypothesis: Someone may have owned this cat before moving. Step 2: Determine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise is providing the observation of the cat being outdoors and a suspicion about previous ownership and the owner's move. The hypothesis is a more general statement considering the possibility of the cat having a previous owner who moved. Step 3: Analyze if the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise does suggest that the cat might have been owned by someone who moved away. However, it does not prove it as a fact but only provides a suspicion. The hypothesis considers the possibility of previous ownership and the owner's move without certainty. Conclusion: The premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis, as it only provides suspicions and observations rather than definitive proof. However, the premise does support the hypothesis by suggesting a potential connection between the observed behavior of the cat and the idea that it may have had a previous owner who moved away."},{"instruction":"Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question.

You said in your letter to me that. you never wanted to see me or hear from me again, but now [the alleged. victim] says it's all right to write to you. 'Since that trip up to Norfolk, I have been in a state of abject self loathing. How we delude ourselves. 'I. fondly imagined that everything that had taken place had progressed. from a feeling of love and friendship - there was no rape, no physical. forcing, brutality or beating that took place. 'When. I came to Norfolk, [the alleged victim] told me that she had always. been terrified of me and went along with everything that I did out of. fear of me. 'I. said 'Why did you never just say no?'. And [the alleged victim] said. how could she say no to the great television star Rolf Harris. 'Until she told me that, I had no idea that she was scared of me. 'She laughs in a bitter way and says I must have known that she has always been scared of me. I honestly didn't know. '[The. alleged victim] keeps saying that this has all been going on since she. was 13. She's told you that and you were justly horrified, and she keeps. reiterating that to me, no matter what I said to the contrary. 'She. says admiring her and telling her she looked lovely in her bathing suit. was just the same as physically molesting her. I didn't know. Nothing. took place in a physical way until we had moved to Highlands. I think. about 1983 or 84 was the first time. 'I can pinpoint a date was 1986, because I remember I was in pantomime at Richmond. 'When. I see the misery I have caused [the alleged victim] I am sickened by. myself. You can't go back and change things that you have done in this. life - I wish to god I could. 'When. I came to Norfolk, spent that time with [the alleged victim] and. realised the enormity of what I had done to [the alleged victim], and. how I had affected her whole life, I begged her for forgiveness and she. said 'I forgive you'. Going home: Harris, who denies all of the charges, is pictured climbing into a vehicle following his day at court. Case: Harris, 84, faces a total of 12 counts of indecent assault on four alleged victims between 1968 and 1986. 'Whether she really meant it or not, I don't know. I hope she did, but I fear she can never forgive me. 'I. find it hard to like myself in any way, shape or form. And as I do. these Animal programmes, I see the unconditional love that dogs give to. their owners and I wish I could start to love myself again. 'If. there is any way that I could atone for what I have done I would. willingly do it. If there is a way I can start to help [the alleged. victim] to heal herself, I would willingly do it. 'With. your permission I'll phone you in a week to talk to you. If you hang. up, I will understand, but I would like to talk to you to apologise for. betraying your trust and for unwittingly so harming your darling [the. alleged victim]. 'I know that what I did was wrong but we are, all of us, fallible and oh how I deluded myself. 'Please forgive me, love Rolf. 'Please. forgive me for what must have been the most insensitive thing in your. eyes - sending the book for Christmas.

However, Diane showed no emotion whatsoever while her kids fought for their lives. When questioned by authorities, Diane alleged that a \\"bushy-haired stranger\\" had signaled her car off of the road, tried to steal it, and when he was unsuccessful, had shot all 3 of the children and her in the arm.

December 17, 1897) and Ann Eliza Birney (d. January 25, 1861), on February 16, 1852 in Allegheny, Pennsylvania. Russell was the second of five children, of whom two survived into adulthood. His mother died when he was 9 years old. The Russells lived for a time in Philadelphia before moving to Pittsburgh, where they became members of the Presbyterian Church. Context: In 1897 Russell's wife, Maria, left him after a disagreement over the management of Zion's Watch Tower magazine. According to Russell's successor Joseph Franklin Rutherford, she believed that, as his wife, she should have equal control over its administration and equal privilege in writing articles, preaching, and traveling abroad as his representative. In 1903 she filed for legal separation on the grounds of mental cruelty, referring to forced celibacy and frequent cold, indifferent treatment by him. The separation was granted in 1906, with Russell charged to pay alimony. During the trial Mrs. Russell's attorney alleged that in 1894 Mr. Russell had engaged in \\"improper intimacy\\" with Rose Ball, by then a 25-year-old woman. The Russells had cared for her as a foster daughter said to be an orphan. Mrs. Russell alleged that Ball had told her Mr. Russell claimed to be an amorous \\"jellyfish floating around\\" to different women until someone responded to his advances. Mr. Russell denied the accusations and said he had never used such language to describe himself. When the judge asked Mrs. Russell if she was accusing her husband of adultery, she replied, \\"No\\". The Washington Post and the Mission Friend of Chicago reprinted the \\"jellyfish\\" story while also accusing Russell of immoral conduct. Russell sued the papers for libel; the jury decided in his favor, awarding him one dollar. Following an appeal, Russell received a cash settlement of 15,000 (current value 409,000) plus court costs, and an agreement that the two papers publish his weekly syndicated sermons as well as a retraction defending his character. Rose Ball later married and lived in Australia. As Rose Ball Henninges, she died November 22, 1950 at the age of 81 in Melbourne, Australia. For several years she had written articles for The People's Paper and was associated with the Bible Students in Australia until her death. Question: How did the congregation react to the seperation? Answer:","output":"When Charles Taze Russell and his wife Maria separated, the congregation, also known as the Bible Students, had different reactions. Some people might have been sad and confused because they looked up to them as leaders, while others might have taken sides in the disagreement. However, the group continued to study the Bible and follow their beliefs even after the separation.

First, it is crucial to understand the key components of the statement \\"boat sails in rough water.\\" 1. Boat: A vessel designed for transportation on water, typically propelled by oars, sails, or an engine. 2. Sails: A piece of material extended on a mast to catch the wind and propel a boat forward. 3. Rough water: Characterized by large waves, strong currents, and potentially challenging weather conditions, often making navigation more complicated for sailors. Considering these definitions, the statement \\"boat sails in rough water\\" implies the following: 1. There is a boat that is using its sails as a means of propulsion. 2. The specific environment in which the boat is operating consists of rough water. This might include choppy waves, powerful currents, and potentially adverse weather conditions. 3. The boat's ability to navigate and move through the water is reliant on the proper functioning of its sails. Given these observations, the statement \\"a boat sails through the water\\" is a logical consequence of the original statement. This is because both statements share the essential element of a boat utilizing sails to move through the water. The primary difference between the two statements is the context provided by the mention of \\"rough water\\" in the original statement. This additional information implies that the boat is sailing through challenging water conditions, making navigation more complex and demanding for the sailors. However, this distinction does not negate the core concept present in both statements: that a boat sails through the water. In conclusion, it is logical to deduce that if a boat sails in rough water, it certainly sails through the water itself."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"I, Lieutenant Governor Byrd, am not impressed.\\" to Czech?","output":"In order to translate the given sentence from English to Czech, I will follow these steps: 1.

The causes of the French Revolution can be attributed to a variety of factors, including: 1. The Economic Crisis: The national debt in France escalated due to excessive spending, especially during the reigns of Louis XIV, XV, and XVI. Notably, France's involvement in the American Revolutionary War strained the treasury further. Additionally, the population experienced food scarcity and high prices as a result of poor harvests in the late 1780s. 2. Inequality and Social Division: The French society during the Old Regime was characterized by a hierarchical social structure, which divided the population into three distinct 'Estates.' The First Estate comprised of the clergy, the Second Estate represented the nobility, and the Third Estate consisted of the commoners (including bourgeoisie, peasants, and urban workers). The Third Estate, despite being the overwhelmingly largest and most diverse class, shared an unequal tax burden and minimal political influence relative to the other Estates. 3. Influence of Enlightenment and American Revolution: The Age of Enlightenment (with philosophers like Voltaire, Montesquieu, and Rousseau) promoted a shift in thought towards democratic ideals and rational governance, which eventually laid the foundation for revolutionary sentiment in France. The successful American Revolution further fueled these sentiments, raising hopes that similar changes could be brought about locally. The key events of the French Revolution include: 1. The Estates-General Meeting (1789): King Louis XVI called for a meeting of Estates-General to propose tax reforms after France's financial crisis. This prompted the Third Estate representatives to demand a constitutional monarchy and, eventually, a National Assembly was created. 2. The Fall of the Bastille (July 14, 1789): Parisian revolutionaries stormed the Bastille prison, symbolizing resistance against the monarchy and marking the beginning of the Revolution. 3. The Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen (August 1789): The National Assembly passed this historical document, outlining the basic principles of equality and liberty that informed the Revolution's progressive agenda. 4. Reign of Terror (1793 – 1794): Radical leaders such as Maximilien Robespierre and the Jacobin Club seized control of the French government, executing thousands of people accused of counter-revolutionary activities. King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette were also guillotined during this period. 5. The Rise of Napoleon Bonaparte (1799): A military coup orchestrated by Napoleon led to the establishment of the Consulate and later, in 1804, the First French Empire, marking the end of the French Revolution. The French Revolution's lasting effects on France and the European political landscape are multifold: 1. Socio-political Change: The Revolution dismantled the traditional monarchical and aristocratic systems, eventually replacing them with a republican form of government. It also paved the way for equal rights, representation, and the democratic process in the nation. 2. Spread of Revolutionary Ideas: The French Revolution inspired the spread of nationalism and democratic ideals across Europe, which later played a significant role in the series of revolutions and upheavals that characterized the 19th-century political landscape. 3. Napoleon's Conquests and the Congress of Vienna (1814-1815): The rise of Napoleon led to a series of wars involving several European nations. The eventual fall of Napoleon prompted the Congress of Vienna, which redrew Europe's political boundaries and established the beginnings of a balance of power among the major continental powers. Overall, the French Revolution marked a turning point in world history, influencing political ideologies and shaping the foundation of modern Europe."},{"instruction":"Given the question: The Golden Mickeys, is a musical, revue-style stage show presented in the style of an awards ceremony with characters from Disney films being nominated for awards including heroism, villainy, friendship, adventurousness, and romance, in the fall of 2004, the show was brought to Disney Magic, a cruise ship owned and operated by the Disney Cruise Line, a subsidiary of which organization?

A settlement offer may be made at any point during a civil lawsuit or administrative proceeding. The other side can even make a settlement offer after the trial has begun. Pick from: A). A settlement offer during trial might mean that the other side thinks it's going to lose and wants a more predictable way out of the situation. This is especially true if you're involved in a jury trial. B). Choose the opportune moment to tell the plaintiff about the offer and the financial or legal implications of receiving a settlement. This often assumes the settlement offer is valid or has a strong argument which proves to the other side that the purchase is worth pursuing. C). To understand the typical challenges that often result when you or someone else makes a settlement offer, pay attention to the timing of your settlement offer. You might want to cancel if you win because the other side wants to contest the settlement and they bring you 100 to support their offer. D). This process will vary by state, but generally you should pay attention to the timing of the settlement offers : All claims against you may be declined. If the settlement offer seems unreasonable, a settlement offer may be denied.","output":"Step 1: Evaluate the settlement offer Consider the pros and cons of each option (A, B, C, D) and how they relate to your specific situation. Evaluate the strength of the other side's argument, the potential risks and benefits of accepting the settlement offer, and the possible outcomes of a trial. This will help you make an informed decision. Step 2: Consult with legal counsel Before making any decisions, consult with your attorney or legal counsel. They will help you better understand the implications of each option and provide guidance on the best course of action based on their expertise and experience. Step 3: Assess the timing and circumstances As mentioned in options A and C, the timing of the settlement offer can play a significant role in how you should proceed. Pay attention to changes in the other side's behavior or strategy, as well as the stage of the legal process, as these factors may influence your decision. Step 4: Communicate with the plaintiff If you believe that the settlement offer is worth considering (option B), communicate your thoughts to the plaintiff. Discuss the financial and legal consequences of the settlement offer, taking into account their needs and objectives. Be prepared to negotiate and find common ground. Step 5: Respond to the settlement offer Once you have thoroughly analyzed the situation and consulted with legal counsel, decide whether to accept or reject the settlement offer. If you decide to accept the offer, ensure that the agreement is documented properly and that both parties understand their obligations under the settlement. Step 6: Be prepared for challenges Keep in mind that the other side may contest the settlement (as noted in option C). If this happens, be prepared to defend your decision and, if necessary, litigate the matter further. Step 7: Monitor the post-settlement process If you accept the settlement offer, be mindful of any obligations or requirements that arise from the agreement. Make sure to comply with the terms of the settlement and monitor the other party's compliance as well. If any issues or disputes arise, address them promptly and professionally. By following these steps, you will be able to make an informed decision about accepting a settlement offer and effectively manage the situation to minimize risks and maximize potential benefits."},{"instruction":"Summarize the following: Place a large pot onto a set of kitchen scales and set the display back to zero. Slowly scoop in or pour in your rendered animal fat until you have as close to 1 lb (450 g) as possible. Getting the measurements exactly right is crucial, as soap-making and glycerin making rely on a precise chemical reaction. Not having the right amount of fat can lead to caustic soap or glycerin that can be very harmful. If you want to alter the exact measurements for your own soap recipe and the type of fat you are using, look online for a soap making calculator. There are plenty that will allow you to enter the amount and types of fat you are using and give you precise instructions for the right ratios. In a separate jug or bowl, measure out 5 fluid ounces (150 ml) of room temperature water. Slowly add in 2 ounces (57 g) of lye, stirring constantly as you do so to incorporate it fully. Leave the lye and water mixture to react and cool down. The water and the lye will combine and create an exothermic reaction, meaning the mixture will heat up. You should always wear protective gloves and eyewear when working with lye, as it is a caustic substance that eats away at fat. If you get any lye on your skin, remove any clothing the lye may have touched and flush the skin with cold water for 15 minutes. Seek medical attention immediately. Lye may be available in the cleaning section of your local grocery store. It should be easily available online or at a specialty soap-making store. Use a candy or other food thermometer to check the temperature of your rendered animal fat. Place the pot over low heat to slowly bring the temperature up to 113 °F (45 °C) if it’s too cold, or leave it to cool down if the fat is too warm. Once it’s at the right temperature, remove it from any heat source. Keeping the temperatures exactly right will help the fat and the lye to combine properly, resulting in a smoother soap and clearer glycerin. With both the fat and the lye solution around 113 °F (45 °C), begin very slowly streaming the lye solution into the fat. Stir the solution in as you do, being careful not to splash the lye or get any on your skin. It may be easier to get someone to help you stir the fat while you pour in the lye. Work on a sturdy, flat surface so that you can continue stirring easily while the soap mixture thickens. Once the lye solution has been completely mixed into the fat, keep stirring in slow, regular motions. After around 15 minutes, the path of the spoon should remain visible in the soap mixture for a few seconds. This is known as tracing and is a sign that your soap mixture has thickened and is ready. Rather than stirring by hand, you could use an electric mixer or a stick blender to combine the lye and fat. Start at a low speed to avoid splashing the mixture around too much. Summary:","output":"For soap and glycerin making, measure 1 lb (450 g) of rendered animal fat in a large pot on a kitchen scale. Precise measurements are essential for the chemical reaction. Look for a soap making calculator online to adjust measurements based on your preferred recipe and fat type. Separately, mix 5 fluid ounces (150 ml) of room temperature water with 2 ounces (57 g) of lye, stirring constantly. Let the lye-water mixture cool down and wear protective gear when handling lye. Monitor the temperature of the animal fat, ensuring it's at 113 °F (45 °C). Slowly pour the lye solution into the fat while stirring. Once the lye is fully incorporated and the mixture thickens, it's ready for soap-making. Using an electric mixer or stick blender can make mixing easier."},{"instruction":"This question has options. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? Fasten the legs to the apron with fastening screws. Possible answers: a. Use a pair of 1⁄4 in lag screws for each leg. Attach the screws through the apron and into the leg. Use a ratchet to twist the screws into the table’s legs.Make sure the legs are level and at a right angle to the tabletop before screwing them in place.; b. Use a pair of 1⁄4 in lag screws for each leg. Attach the screws through the apron and into the leg. Use a ratchet to twist the screws into the table’s legs.Make sure the legs are level and at a angle to the tabletop before screwing them in place.;","output":"There are two possible answers provided for fastening the legs to the apron with fastening screws, and both are quite similar. Here, we will elaborate on these two options and explain the differences: Option A: 1. Gather the necessary materials, such as 1/4 inch lag screws, a ratchet, a level, and a speed square or carpenter's square. Ensure you have a stable work area and all the table components, including legs and apron. 2. Place the legs in their proper location on the underside of the table, aligning them with the apron so that they are flush and at a right angle (90 degrees) to the tabletop. This is crucial for stability and balance. 3. Using the level, double-check that the legs are level and at a right angle to the tabletop. Adjust the position of the legs as needed to ensure that they are square and level. 4. For each leg, attach two 1/4 inch lag screws through the apron and into the leg. It's best to pre-drill pilot holes for the screws to avoid splitting the wood. Make sure that the screws are long enough to provide secure support but not too long, as they could poke through the other side of the leg. 5. Once the pilot holes are drilled, use a ratchet to twist the lag screws into the table legs. Be sure to apply consistent pressure to the fastener as you tighten the screws, ensuring a strong connection between the legs and apron. Option B: The steps for option B are almost identical to those for option A. The key difference here is that in option B, you are advised to fasten the legs at an angle to the tabletop, rather than at a right angle (90 degrees). This is not a recommended approach, as it may cause the table to be unstable or wobbly. However, if you choose to proceed with option B, follow the same steps as in option A, making sure to adjust the leg's angle as you attach them to the apron to achieve the desired slant. Keep in mind that doing this will potentially compromise the stability and balance of the table, so it is not advised. In conclusion, option A is the recommended method for attaching the legs to the apron with fastening screws, as it provides better stability and balance for the table."},{"instruction":"Ask a question about Dissolution of the Soviet Union.","output":"What were the main factors that contributed to the dissolution of the Soviet Union? The dissolution of the Soviet Union, which occurred in December 1991, was a significant geopolitical event that marked the end of the Cold War and the transformation of Eastern Europe. Several factors contributed to the collapse of this superpower, which can be categorized into political, economic, social, and international factors. The main factors that played a crucial role in the Soviet Union's disintegration include: 1. Economic Factors: The Soviet Union faced numerous economic challenges, including stagnation, declining productivity, an inefficient planned economy, and massive military expenditure. The lack of significant economic reforms in the 1980s led to the decline in the Soviet Union's GDP and a shortage of consumer goods. This gradually diminished the country's global competitiveness and its ability to maintain a high standard of living for its citizens. Furthermore, the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 added to the economic and social strain on the Soviet Union. 2. Political Factors: Decades of political repression, lack of democratic institutions, and the centralization of power resulted in widespread corruption and bureaucracy. This prevented an effective response to the economic crisis and social unrest. The policy of Glasnost (openness) introduced by Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985 to increase transparency and freedom of speech exposed these issues to the public, causing a further loss of confidence and trust in the government. 3. Social Factors: The Soviet Union was a highly diverse country, with many different ethnic groups that had historically faced discrimination and repression. The Glasnost policy also facilitated the expression of ethnic and nationalist sentiments, leading to a surge of separatism and demands for autonomy in several Soviet republics. This diversity and the rise in nationalism resulted in increasing internal tensions and conflicts, which further weakened the Soviet Union's unity and stability. 4. Ideological Factors: By the late 1980s, the Soviet Union's communist ideology was facing a crisis as it failed to deliver the promised prosperity and social justice. Impacted by the increasing exposure to Western values and culture, many Soviet citizens grew disillusioned with the Communist system. The decline in the influence of the Communist Party further contributed to the disintegration of the Soviet Union. 5. Mikhail Gorbachev's Reforms: Gorbachev's policies of Glasnost and Perestroika (restructuring) were aimed at revitalizing the Soviet Union's political and economic systems. However, these reforms were often perceived as contradictory and poorly executed, leading to confusion and a worsening of the economic crisis. Additionally, Gorbachev's decision to allow multiparty elections further eroded the Communist Party's monopoly on power and contributed to the weakening of the Soviet state. 6. International Factors: The arms race and rivalry with the United States during the Cold War put immense pressure on the Soviet Union's economy. To keep up with the competitive military spending, the Soviet Union invested heavily in defense and military operations, which strained its already weak economy. The end of the Cold War, the relaxation of tensions, and the movement towards democracy in Eastern Europe further undermined the legitimacy of the Soviet Union's communist system. In conclusion, the dissolution of the Soviet Union can be attributed to a combination of political, economic, social, and international factors that weakened the state and led to its eventual collapse. The failure to address the mounting economic and social challenges, along with the ambitious but ultimately flawed reforms, significantly contributed to the end of the Soviet Union's reign as a global superpower."},{"instruction":"Translate to Finnish: I would remind you of the debate that we had on this subject earlier on.

The Second Amendment clearly reads: “the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.” Our founders certainly believed, as we do, that the right to have and use a gun is an individual right that should not be imposed upon by overly intrusive government regulation. Although she believes that gun owners must be responsible for the use and care of their guns, she does not want to see law-abiding gun owners penalized for the actions of criminals. It has become far too easy to place blame on guns, and their accessibility, rather than the criminals themselves. Currently, there are nineteen laws on the books regulating gun purchases and use but more legislation will not result in safer streets, offices or schoolyards. To that end, she is opposed to any measures that would impose further limitations on the right to bear arms. She stands behind our Constitution and the fundamental rights that the Second Amendment affords to all Americans. She will continue to vote to safeguard the liberties of gun owners and to stand up for your freedom to own and purchase firearms. Congresswoman Ellmers' work in the House related to this issue includes the following: A letter to President Obama led by Representative Dan Benishek (R-MI) cautioning him to not circumvent congress to implement gun control. H.Con.Res. 23 -Sponsored by Representative Mike Kelly (R-PA) a resolution opposing the UN Arms Trade Treaty.

Police think the theft happened on the night of Oct. 15. According to the report, they had been out target shooting and brought the gun back and leaned it against the gun safe, Pope said.  The garage door was left unsecured, according to the report. The case remains under investigation and likely will be treated as a burglary, he said. Ellmers husband, Brent Ellmers, was listed as the victim, Pope said. The family was unharmed but shaken, said Thomas Doheny, communications director for Ellmers. Doheny confirmed that several items were stolen from the congresswomans home but said in an email that he couldnt disclose further information yet. The weapon belonged to Ellmers college-aged son, he confirmed. Ellmers was in Washington, D.C., at the time of the theft. Gun safety is of the utmost importance in their household, which is exactly why shes so upset and doesn't understand how this happened, Doheny said. The police report did not indicate whether there was any ammunition in or near the gun or whether there was a lock on it. And unless the gun has been stolen by a minor, it appears unlikely that the reportedly unsecured status of the gun would open its owners to any charge under state or federal gun laws. Our investigator has probably looked into that, but weve not discussed that yet, Pope said. North Carolinas gun-storage laws apply only when a minor gains unlawful access to a gun and discharges it, according to Charlotte attorney Thomas Faulk. There are no federal laws requiring gun owners to lock or to prevent minors access to their weapons, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates for gun-control measures. A lot of people think there should be a particular statute on the subject, simply saying failure to secure a weapon is in itself a crime, regardless of whether anything bad happens, said Faulk, who wrote the book Firearms Law of North Carolina. Having a firearm is a right, but it comes with a responsibility, he said, speaking of the law in general. However, Mitch Hyatt, a manager of Hyatt Gun Shop in Charlotte, noted that there was room for interpretation. Maybe there was a gun lock (typically a steel cable) on it that locked the gun from use but didnt prevent it from being stolen, he said. If someone had it, they wouldnt be able to operate it without cutting the lock off. Ellmers is a political conservative aligned with the tea party. In the 2012 election, she was endorsed by the National Rifle Association and other pro-gun groups. The police report says there had been no other break-ins in the residential subdivision where Ellmers and her family live, according to The Associated Press. The serial number of the stolen rifle has been added to a national database used by law enforcement to track firearms. Dunn police have named no suspects, Pope said.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Oklahoma is the 20th-largest state in the United States, covering an area of 69,899 square miles (181,040 km2), with 68,595 square miles (177,660 km2) of land and 1,304 square miles (3,380 km2) of water. It lies partly in the Great Plains near the geographical center of the 48 contiguous states. It is bounded on the east by Arkansas and Missouri, on the north by Kansas, on the northwest by Colorado, on the far west by New Mexico, and on the south and near-west by Texas. Much of its border with Texas lies along the Southern Oklahoma Aulacogen, a failed continental rift. The geologic figure defines the placement of the Red River. The Oklahoma panhandle's Western edge is out of alignment with its Texas border. The Oklahoma/New Mexico border is 2.1 miles (3.4 km) to 2.2 miles (3.5 km) east of the Texas line. The border between Texas and New Mexico was set first as a result of a survey by Spain in 1819. It was then set along the 103rd meridian. In the 1890s, when Oklahoma was formally surveyed using more accurate surveying equipment and techniques, it was discovered the Texas line was not set along the 103rd meridian. Surveying techniques were not as accurate in 1819, and the actual 103rd meridian was approximately 2.2 miles (3.5 km) to the east. It was much easier to leave the mistake than for Texas to cede land to New Mexico to correct the surveying error. The placement of the Oklahoma/New Mexico border represents the true 103rd meridian. Cimarron County in Oklahoma's panhandle is the only county in the United States that touches four other states: New Mexico, Texas, Colorado, and Kansas.

However, instead of having Texas cede land to New Mexico to correct the error, the placement of the Oklahoma/New Mexico border was set to represent the true 103rd meridian.

Asda will offer offer its staff 'Nativity leave' this Christmas, giving parents extra time off to see their children perform in the school play. The scheme will give workers the option to take unpaid leave outside of their normal allowances so that they don't miss out on vital family moments this festive season. They will be allowed either to take the time off and forgo their pay, or swap shifts with other staff to make sure they have the crucial dates off. Little angels: Parents will be able to take unpaid leave to see their children perform at school. The move was introduced following a survey of 5,500 mothers who shop at the supermarket found the school Nativity play is one of the events they feel they cannot afford to miss. Hayley Tatum, Asda's executive people director, said: 'There's no doubt working mums have a lot on their plate at this time of year and we don't want our colleagues to miss out on the things that are really important to them this Christmas. 'Technology might help to take the pressure off busy working parents on a daily basis, but we know that it's just not the same watching your child's milestone moments back on a smartphone. '\\"Nativity Leave\\" gives parents the opportunity to take time off for the school Christmas play or simply for some much needed family time outside of normal holidays.' However, while the scheme was designed with parents desperate to see their child's star turn in mind, any staff members can take advantage of the scheme. They will also be allowed the time off for Christmas shopping or seeing family, as they do not have to provide a specific reason for the time off. From mums: Asda made the decision after feedback from its 5,500-strong 'Mumdex' panel. An Asda spokesman added that the store expects lots of its staff who are grandparents to capitalise on the offer to see their young family members as much as possible. The latest report from the Asda 'Mumdex' panel also revealed that mums across the country will do their best to enforce a traditional Christmas experience this year. More than a third of mums said they plan to ban gadgets such as smartphones and tablet computers from. The latest \\"Mumdex\\" research also revealed that traditional values are more important to mums this Christmas Day than technology with 35 per cent planning to totally ban technology from the Christmas dinner table this year.

His nimble footwork and innate understanding of the game made him an exceptional player. Whereas Derrick, although larger and physically stronger, relied mostly on his brute strength to bulldoze past defenders. While both had their strengths, teammates and coaches appreciated Kyle's finesse on the football field. Growing up in a small town, Kyle and Derrick were inseparable friends. They had been playing football together since they were young boys in the local park. Their love for the game brought them together, and even as they grew older, it remained a significant bond that kept their friendship alive. As they entered high school, their rivalry on the field intensified. Both players attracted the attention of college scouts from across the country. Kyle's electric pace and superb ball control made him an incredibly desirable prospect, while Derrick's sheer size and powerful shots were equally impressive. Their high school's football team, the Lightning Bolts, dominated the league and was close to making it to the state championship. Kyle and Derrick's distinct styles complemented each other, and they often combined to create moments of magic that left spectators speechless. Kyle would weave through defenders with ease, while Derrick would use his massive frame to shield the ball and break the opposition's defense. Their coach, Mr. Johnson, recognized the potential of these two athletes and made every effort to groom them into world-class footballers. He worked extensively on their individual skills and encouraged both players to learn from one another. One particular evening, after an intense practice session, Kyle and Derrick remained on the field to work on their weaknesses. Kyle was focused on improving his physical strength, while Derrick was trying to work on his agility. They set up a series of drills that forced them to rely on their weaker attributes. As the sun dipped below the horizon, the boys found themselves bonding even more as they pushed their limits. They began to appreciate the others' strengths and weaknesses truly. Kyle studied how Derrick exerted his power in every stride and every movement he made. He recognized the importance of harnessing this brute force and used it to his advantage in his next game. In a decisive moment, Kyle used his newly acquired strength to shield the ball from an opponent, allowing him to swiftly maneuver and score a spectacular goal. Derrick, on the other hand, learned the significance of agility and balance from watching Kyle. He practiced day after day to become lighter and quicker on his feet. It eventually paid off when he pulled off a brilliantly timed tackle that stopped an opponent's attack dead in its tracks. This newfound respect for each other's abilities only served to strengthen Kyle and Derrick's friendship. They continued to play for the Lightning Bolts, leading them to triumph in the state championship that year, which solidified their status as local legends. Scholarship offers poured in from all across the country for both Kyle and Derrick. They ultimately chose to attend the same prestigious university to continue their football careers and education. Over time, their impressive skills and genuine camaraderie on and off the field helped create a nationally recognized football powerhouse at their university. Kyle and Derrick's story embodies dedication, friendship, teamwork, and the relentless pursuit of excellence. They pushed each other to become better players, learned from each other's strengths and weaknesses, and ultimately forged an unbreakable bond that transcended the sport they loved. As they left their university days behind, both players went on to play professional football, carrying with them the invaluable lessons they learned from their life-long friendship. Their unique and powerful synergy continued to dazzle fans and opponents alike, as they proved that teamwork and mutual respect could lead to greatness."},{"instruction":"Question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Keep in mind that you can say no if you feel that someone is taking advantage of your kindness. If you are worried about a friend or family member’s well-being, then you might talk to someone who can help, such as a teacher or a counselor. This means neither overstepping in helping them nor allowing them to overstep in asking for help, assuming they do. This is especially important with a proud person, as helping them too much may make them feel like you pity them or that you feel sorry for them. Instead, when possible, ask how you can help, and don’t attempt to do more than is requested. For example, if the person has reassured you that he or she is okay, then you should not keep pressing the person to accept your help. You might simply say something like, “I am always here for you if you need my help. Just let me know.” As much as you want to help them, it is important to give them the space to make their own decisions.

Damage to infrastructure: If the earthquake is severe enough, it can damage the facilities and equipment used for separating recycling materials (more effect). 2. Disruptions to operations: An earthquake may cause temporary or longer-term disruptions to the operations of the recycling center due to damage to the facility or its equipment, or due to personnel being unable to reach the center (more effect). 3. Increased demand for resources: In the aftermath of an earthquake, there may be an increased demand for resources to help with disaster relief and rebuilding efforts. This could potentially reduce the amount of recyclable materials being separated and processed, as the focus shifts to providing essential resources and services (less effect). 4. Changes in public priorities: An earthquake could temporarily shift public priorities away from recycling and environmental concerns, as people focus on immediate needs and recovery efforts (less effect). 5.

In 1967, Columbia Pictures produced a movie adaptation of Ian Fleming's popular James Bond novel \\"Casino Royale\\". However, unlike the serious and action-packed tone of the subsequent James Bond films, this adaptation took on a comedic approach to the story. On December 21, 1967, this light-hearted interpretation was released in Danish cinemas to thrill and entertain local audiences. The unique approach to this James Bond story resulted in \\"Casino Royale\\" being a satirical parody; the film incorporated numerous comedic elements and actors. Directed by Ken Hughes, John Huston, Joseph McGrath, Robert Parrish, and Val Guest, the film starred an ensemble cast which included David Niven, Peter Sellers, Ursula Andress, and Orson Welles, all offering their own comedic twist to the famous spy genre. The plot of this quirky version of \\"Casino Royale\\" deviated significantly from Ian Fleming's original story. Instead of following the suave adventures of secret agent James Bond, this film featured an older, more retiring Bond played by David Niven. When he returns to Her Majesty's Secret Service to help solve a global crisis, he finds that the agency is overwhelmed with other individuals all going by the name of James Bond. This mischievous take on the Bond series creates confusion, chaos, and hilarity. In addition to the memorable performances and clever dialogue, \\"Casino Royale\\" featured a just as unforgettable soundtrack. Composed by the legendary Burt Bacharach and including the classic theme song \\"The Look of Love\\" performed by Dusty Springfield, this soundtrack added to the film's overall comedic atmosphere. Audiences in Denmark, who experienced \\"Casino Royale\\" in theaters on December 21, 1967, were treated to a unique and entertaining cinematic experience, far removed from the more familiar action-packed James Bond films. Today, the film remains a cult classic, credited for its distinctive take on a beloved franchise, and is viewed by fans as a notable deviation from the typical 007 formula."},{"instruction":"Ne. Je mi to líto. Which language is this?","output":"The given text, \\"Ne. Je mi to líto,\\" is in Czech, a West Slavic language spoken primarily in the Czech Republic. This particular sentence can be translated to English as \\"No. I am sorry.\\" The Czech language is closely related to other Slavic languages, such as Slovak, Polish, and Sorbian. It uses the Latin script with diacritics (such as the háček and the acute accent) to indicate specific sounds or features of the language. Czech is spoken by approximately 10 million people in the Czech Republic and is also spoken by Czech diaspora communities in various countries around the world. The history of the Czech language can be traced back to its Old Czech variant, which was spoken in the Great Moravian Empire during the 10th century. The language evolved throughout the centuries, influenced by neighboring tongues, historical events, and cultural shifts. The Czech language has a rich literary tradition, with notable works dating back to the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the Baroque, and subsequently throughout various periods of European history. Czech authors and poets, such as Franz Kafka, Milan Kundera, and Jaroslav Seifert, have made significant contributions to world literature. The Czech language has several dialects that can be divided into two primary types: Bohemian and Moravian. The Bohemian dialects are spoken in the western and central parts of the Czech Republic, while the Moravian dialects are spoken in the eastern and southern parts of the country. Additionally, the Silesian dialect, spoken in the northeastern region, represents a transitional dialect between Czech and Polish.

Our favorite was the Denny's about ten miles outside of downtown Savannah, and we had a regular waitress that was AWESOME. As a side note, I met her several years later and found out we were a major help putting her daughter through school. We had one kid in our group who was a perpetual problem, a wannabe at everything. He just tried too freaking hard to be the center of attention. Well, he joined us ONCE in a trip to Denny's. I mean we pulled up in six cars, all packed to the gills at 3a.m. and took up almost half of the restaurant.

Adapted from the 1981 Broadway musical of the same name by composer Henry Krieger and lyricist/librettist Tom Eyen, Dreamgirls is a film a clef, a work of fiction taking strong inspiration from the history of the Motown record label and one of its acts, The Supremes. The story follows the history and evolution of American R&B music during the 1960s and 1970s through the eyes of a Detroit, Michigan girl group known as the Dreams and their manipulative record executive. The film adaptation of Dreamgirls stars Jamie Foxx, Beyonce, Eddie Murphy, and Jennifer Hudson, and also features Danny Glover, Anika Noni Rose and Keith Robinson. Dreamgirls premiered on December 4, 2006 at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City, where it received a standing ovation. The film's Los Angeles premiere was held on December 11 at the Wilshire Theater in Beverly Hills. Similar to the releases of older Hollywood musicals such as The Sound of Music, My Fair Lady, and West Side Story, Dreamgirls debuted with three special ten-day roadshow engagements beginning on December 15, 2006 at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City, the Cinerama Dome in Los Angeles, and the AMC Metreon 15 in San Francisco. Tickets for the reserved seats were 25 each; the premium price included a forty-eight page full-color program and a limited-print lithograph. This release made Dreamgirls the first American feature film to have a roadshow release since Man of La Mancha in 1972. Dreamgirls earned a total of 851,664 from the roadshow engagements, playing to sold-out houses on the weekends. The film's national release, at regular prices, began on December 25. Outside of the U.S., Dreamgirls opened in Australia on January 18, and in the United Kingdom on February 2. Releases in other countries began on various dates between January and early March. Dreamgirls eventually grossed 103 million in North America, and almost 155 million worldwide. DreamWorks Home Entertainment released Dreamgirls to home video on May 1, 2007 in DVD, HD DVD, and Blu-ray formats. The DVD version was issued in two editions: a one-disc standard version and a two-disc \\"Showstopper Edition\\". The two-disc version also included a feature-length production documentary, production featurettes, screen tests, animatics, and other previsualization materials and artwork. Both DVD versions featured alternate and extended versions of the musical numbers from the film as extras, including the \\"Effie, Sing My Song\\" scene deleted during previews. Both the Blu-ray and HD DVD versions were issued in two-disc formats. Dreamgirls was the first DreamWorks film to be issued in a high definition home entertainment format.

Would Tanzania have thicker or thinner \\"A horizon\\" than Kenya? In the Kenya-Tanzania border Kenyan grassland gradually merges into Tanzanian forest. Though they had similar soil to start with millions of years ago, today they are two different habitats. At present, Kenya has one of the largest contiguous grassland in Africa. On the other hand, Tanzania boasts one of the largest forest cover in Africa. Hint: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Tanzania would have a thinner \\"A horizon\\" than Kenya. The paragraph explains that Kenyan grasslands and Tanzanian forests have different habitats due to their different vegetation types. Grasslands in Kenya tend to have a more substantial A horizon because of the organic matter contributed by the deep, fibrous root systems of the grass. Additionally, frequent fires in grasslands destroy aboveground material but stimulate even more significant contributions from roots. In contrast, forests in Tanzania have leaves falling on the forest floor as the primary source of soil organic matter. One of the critical differences between these two habitats is the acidity level. The greater acidity under forests, like those in Tanzania, inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that would usually mix the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands, such as those in Kenya, generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than soils under forests. In contrast, forests characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and a thin A horizon. Considering this information, we can conclude that Tanzania, with its larger forest cover, would have a thinner \\"A horizon\\" in its soil compared to Kenya, which has a larger contiguous grassland. This difference results from the way organic matter accumulates and distributes in these distinct habitats, with grasslands favoring a thicker A horizon and forests having more organic matter in the O horizon and a thinner A horizon."},{"instruction":"(CNN) -- Women seeking an abortion in Texas will have to view a picture of the embryo or fetus and hear a description of its development before having the procedure, under a law that takes effect September 1. The bill stirred some controversy in Texas, but it easily passed through the state House and Senate, both of which are controlled by Republicans. It was signed into law Thursday by Republican Gov. Rick Perry. The law says that at least 24 hours before an abortion is performed, women must undergo a sonogram, a procedure that uses ultrasound to create an image. The doctor, then, is required to give, \\"in a manner understandable to a layperson, a verbal explanation of the results of the sonogram images, including a medical description of the dimensions of the embryo or fetus, the presence of cardiac activity, and the presence of external members and internal organs,\\" the law states. There are some exceptions, including pregnancies that resulted from sexual assault, incest or other violations of law. Women seeking abortions also are exempt if the fetus has been found to have an irreversible medical condition that will cause a disability. \\"Governor Perry was pleased to sign this important legislation, which bolsters our efforts to protect life by ensuring Texans are fully informed when considering such an important decision,\\" said his deputy press secretary, Lucy Nashed. Critics say the new law is unnecessary. \\"What no one is focusing on is that this is a mandate to humiliate women who want an abortion,\\" said Yvonne Gutierrez, vice president for public affairs at the Planned Parenthood Trust of South Texas.

For example, the Earth's mean specific gravity (5.515) is far higher than the typical specific gravity of rocks at the surface (2.7–3.3), implying that the deeper material is denser. This is also implied by its low moment of inertia ( 0.33 M R2, compared to 0.4 M R2 for a sphere of constant density). However, some of the density increase is compression under the enormous pressures inside the Earth. The effect of pressure can be calculated using the Adams–Williamson equation. The conclusion is that pressure alone cannot account for the increase in density. Instead, we know that the Earth's core is composed of an alloy of iron and other minerals.Reconstructions of seismic waves in the deep interior of the Earth show that there are no S-waves in the outer core. This indicates that the outer core is liquid, because liquids cannot support shear. The outer core is liquid, and the motion of this highly conductive fluid generates the Earth's field. Earth's inner core, however, is solid because of the enormous pressure.Reconstruction of seismic reflections in the deep interior indicate some major discontinuities in seismic velocities that demarcate the major zones of the Earth: inner core, outer core, mantle, lithosphere and crust. The mantle itself is divided into the upper mantle, transition zone, lower mantle and D′′ layer. Between the crust and the mantle is the Mohorovičić discontinuity.The seismic model of the Earth does not by itself determine the composition of the layers. For a complete model of the Earth, mineral physics is needed to interpret seismic velocities in terms of composition. The mineral properties are temperature-dependent, so the geotherm must also be determined. This requires physical theory for thermal conduction and convection and the heat contribution of radioactive elements.... Now, I have a new situation: John is a geologist. He was trying to figure out how the Earth's inner core is made. To that end, he compared earth's physical characteristics to available items. First he took a sample of surface rock, which he labeled as item B. Then he took a sphere of constant density, which he labeled as item C. Finally, he labeled the Earth as item A. Answer this question please: Would item B have higher or lower specific gravity than item A? A:","output":"Item B, which is a sample of surface rock, would have a lower specific gravity than item A, which represents the Earth as a whole. The mean specific gravity of the Earth (item A) is 5.515, which is significantly higher than the typical specific gravity of rocks at the surface (item B) that ranges between 2.7 and 3.3. This difference in specific gravity implies that the deeper materials within the Earth are denser than the surface rocks.

With a focused agenda, the party is committed to addressing pressing issues such as healthcare, infrastructure, and climate change, while advocating for equitable economic growth and social justice. This is a crucial period, and to ensure impactful progress, Democrats must establish control in the Senate, work cohesively with the House of Representatives, and maintain open dialogues with Republicans and other political stakeholders. Democratic Agenda: To establish control in the Senate, the Democratic Party has formulated a comprehensive agenda that aims to address the nation's most pressing challenges. Key aspects of the Democratic agenda include: 1. Healthcare: Expanding access to affordable healthcare and strengthening the Affordable Care Act to ensure quality healthcare coverage for all Americans. 2. Infrastructure: Investing in modern infrastructure projects to accelerate economic growth, create new jobs, and improve public services, while prioritizing sustainability and the reduction of carbon emissions. 3. Climate Change: Implementing aggressive policies to combat climate change, such as transitioning towards renewable energy sources and fostering innovative industries that promote environmental sustainability. 4. Equitable Economic Growth: Empowering the middle class and working Americans through policies that enhance income stability, eliminate income inequality, and boost living standards. 5. Social Justice: Advancing social justice initiatives that protect the rights of every citizen, addressing systemic racism, and promoting equality in education and employment opportunities. Establishing Control in the Senate: To assert control in the Senate, Democrats face several strategic challenges that require astute political maneuvering. These challenges include: 1. Winning Key Races: In order to achieve a majority, Democrats must focus on winning key Senate races in battleground states. This entails identifying strong candidates, mobilizing grassroots support, and effective campaigning to sway undecided voters. 2. Navigating Filibusters: Since the filibuster empowers the minority party to obstruct legislation, Democrats must strategically navigate this tool with negotiation and compromise. Seeking bipartisan support for critical legislation will be essential to circumvent or limit filibusters from Republican senators. 3. Building Consensus: Democrats must foster a unified and cohesive message to rally not only the Senate but also the House of Representatives. This will involve developing a shared vision, open communication channels, and facilitating collaboration among party members. 4. Engaging with Republican Senators: While staunch opponents will persist, Democrats can still forge genuine partnerships with some Republican senators on issues that resonate across party lines. Engaging in constructive dialogue and promoting bipartisan cooperation will be key in this regard. Conclusion: As the Democratic Party strives to assert control of the Senate, it is essential to remain steadfast in addressing the nation's most pressing challenges. A combination of effective campaigning, strategizing, and consensus-building must work in tandem to overcome the obstacles ahead. Ultimately, a balance of determination and compromise will be instrumental in achieving progress and fulfilling the aspirations of millions of Americans who hope for a better future."},{"instruction":"On 11 October 1962, the first session of the Second Vatican Council was held in the Vatican.

During a passionate kiss, couples release oxytocin, a hormone that is associated with bonding and attachment. This deepens the emotional bond between partners, helping to create a strong foundation for a loving and enduring relationship. 3. Stress relief: Kissing can act as an effective stress reliever for couples. Physical touch and intimacy can release endorphins, the body's natural feel-good hormones, which can help to lower anxiety levels and instill a sense of calm and relaxation. As a result, kissing can be a fun way for couples to unwind and find solace from the challenges they face in their daily lives. 4. Adventure and spontaneity: Prolonged kissing and making out can add a thrilling sense of adventure and excitement to a relationship. Couples can explore new ways of expressing their feelings through passionate kisses and sensual touches, which can help to keep things exciting and interesting. Kissing can be a way to break the monotony of daily routines and infuse the relationship with spontaneity. 5. Physical health benefits: Kissing has been linked to several health benefits, including strengthening the immune system, lowering blood pressure, and reducing pain through the release of natural painkillers in the brain. Healthy couples may choose to engage in kissing as a fun and pleasurable way to maintain their overall well-being. In conclusion, humans would choose \\"kiss\\" as a way for couples to have fun due to the emotional intimacy, physical pleasure, and health benefits it offers. Kissing allows couples to feel connected and strengthen their bond, helping to create a loving, strong, and fulfilling relationship. The other options, such as cleaning house or playing around, might also offer some level of connection or fun, but they do not offer the same depth of emotional intensity and physiological benefits that kissing does."},{"instruction":"Q: Is this product review positive? Title: This juicer is efficient, fast and reasonably priced Review: I bought this juicer after reading the reviews of several units offered through Amazon. I used it regulaarly to rapidly juice various fruits and vegetables. I like the design and fast processing speed. It is very easy to take apart, clean and reassemble. Sadly, the unit failed to operate after 6 weeks. My husband checked the wall outlet and found it to be ok. He felt the motor failed. We contacted Breville and were told that they would honor the 1 year warranty and would send us a new unit after we return ours. We have sent ours back and are awaiting receipt of our new one.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"Curtains let more light into the room.\\" - Sentence B: \\"Curtains stop light from entering the room.\\"","output":"To determine which sentence is nonsensical, we need to analyze each sentence and their meaning in context. Sentence A: \\"Curtains let more light into the room.\\" This sentence implies that curtains allow an increased amount of light into the room. Curtains can be opened or drawn back to let natural light in. This is a possible scenario. Depending on the material of the curtain, they can let varying amounts of light in. Sheer curtains, for instance, allow some light to filter through while still providing a degree of privacy. Sentence B: \\"Curtains stop light from entering the room.\\" This sentence suggests that curtains block light from entering the room. Closing curtains can indeed block out or reduce the amount of light coming into a room, especially when they are made of opaque or blackout fabric, or when the curtain is lined with a light-blocking layer. Both sentences make sense in different contexts related to the functionality of curtains.

Set the plexiglass on top of 4 wooden planks. Make a plexiglass window for each side of the hamster cage. Install 2 door hinges to make a big door for the hamster cage. Place your doll house in a glass tank if you don't want to make a plexiglass door.\\"","output":"Title: Building a Custom Hamster Cage with a Plexiglass Door and Windows Introduction Creating a custom hamster cage is a rewarding project that provides a unique and comfortable habitat for your pet hamster. Incorporating plexiglass elements, such as doors and windows, not only adds an aesthetic touch to the cage but also makes it easier to access and observe your pet. In this article, we will explain the essential steps required to build a proper hamster cage with a wooden door frame, plexiglass door, and windows. Materials You'll Need: - Plexiglass sheet, at least 3mm thick - Wooden door frame - 4 wooden planks - 8 screws - Electric drill and drill bits - 2 door hinges - Dollhouse (optional) - Glass tank (optional) Step 1: Preparing the Plexiglass The first step to creating a custom hamster cage is preparing the plexiglass. Plexiglass is a durable and transparent material that can be easily manipulated to create a safe habitat for your pet. Start by measuring and cutting the plexiglass so that it conforms to the dimensions of your desired hamster cage. Step 2: Drilling Holes into the Plexiglass Next, place the wooden door frame on the plexiglass and mark the spots where they intersect. These marks will serve as a guide for drilling holes into the plexiglass. Ensure that you use the appropriate drill bit size and take care not to crack or damage the plexiglass during this process. Drilling holes into the plexiglass allows you to securely attach the door frame in the next step. Step 3: Attaching the Door Frame Using screws, attach the wooden door frame to the plexiglass by passing the screws through the drilled holes. This creates a sturdy structure for your hamster cage's entrance. Step 4: Assembling the Base Create the base of your hamster cage by attaching four wooden planks to the bottom of the plexiglass. These planks will provide support to the overall cage structure and keep it stable. Step 5: Creating Plexiglass Windows Following a similar process as described in steps 1 and 2, cut and drill holes into plexiglass pieces to create windows for each side of your hamster cage. Ensuring ample visibility will allow you to observe your hamster while limiting the risk of escaping or injury. Step 6: Installing Door Hinges To create a functional door, attach two door hinges to the wooden door frame and the plexiglass door. This will enable you to open and close the door easily, ensuring convenient access to your hamster and its habitat. Alternative: Using a Dollhouse and Glass Tank If you prefer not to build a plexiglass door for your custom hamster cage, you can opt for using a dollhouse placed inside a glass tank. This method provides a cozy space for your hamster while still offering the same visibility and protection. Simply find a glass tank of sufficient size and place the dollhouse inside. Conclusion Building a custom hamster cage with a plexiglass door and windows is an engaging DIY project that provides a safe and visually appealing habitat for your pet. With a few easy-to-follow steps and basic materials, you'll have a unique hamster cage that will set the stage for endless hours of play and observation."},{"instruction":"Question: \\"Which structures have the outdated construction?\\" Context: \\"While Harkness' original colleges were Georgian Revival or Collegiate Gothic in style, two colleges constructed in the 1960s, Morse and Ezra Stiles Colleges, have modernist designs. All twelve college quadrangles are organized around a courtyard, and each has a dining hall, courtyard, library, common room, and a range of student facilities. The twelve colleges are named for important alumni or significant places in university history. In 2017, the university expects to open two new colleges near Science Hill.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"Morse and Ezra Stiles Colleges. In the context provided, it is stated that while the original colleges of Harkness were designed in Georgian Revival or Collegiate Gothic styles, Morse and Ezra Stiles Colleges, which were constructed in the 1960s, feature modernist architectural designs. This indicates that these two colleges have designs that are comparatively more outdated than the other colleges within the university. The modernist architectural style, prevalent during the mid-20th century, aimed at breaking from traditional architectural norms and embraced new materials and technologies. In comparison to the Georgian Revival and Collegiate Gothic styles, which were known for their elaborate ornamentation, symmetry, and historicist influences, modernist structures were characterized by simplistic designs, unadorned exteriors, and an emphasis on form following function. Both Morse and Ezra Stiles Colleges were designed by architect Eero Saarinen, a notable figure in the modernist movement of his time. These two colleges are structured around the idea of student involvement and adaptability in small college life, which was an innovative and experimental concept during the 1960s. However, their modernist design may seem outdated in contrast to newer, contemporary architectural styles that have since developed and evolved. Despite their potentially outdated architectural styles, all twelve college quadrangles, including Morse and Ezra Stiles Colleges, are organized around a courtyard and are equipped with essential facilities such as dining halls, libraries, common rooms, and other student amenities. The colleges are named for important alumni or significant places in university history, and their designs, whether considered outdated or not, serve as a testament to the university's ongoing growth and development. Moreover, the context mentions the university's plans, in 2017, to open two new colleges near Science Hill. This suggests that even as the institution evolves and newer architectural styles emerge, the older structures continue to have historical and cultural relevance, making them landmarks in the university's landscape. In conclusion, the structures that have the outdated construction in the provided context are Morse and Ezra Stiles Colleges, with their modernist designs from the 1960s. Nevertheless, these buildings continue to serve as functional and significant components of the university's campus, providing students with the necessary facilities and resources to thrive during their academic pursuits."},{"instruction":"Addison and the other boys wanted to build 10 boat, Addison wanted to finish first.

I’m human, you know?” said William Hodge, 32, as he shivered in a thin long-sleeved shirt outside Bronx Supreme Court on Tuesday night. Hodge said he had been wearing a jacket, winter hat and scarf when he was arrested on Dec. 15 for an alleged assault. EXCLUSIVE: Mother-killing selfie maniac slashes Rikers guard But because the city does not allow inmates to wear their own clothes to most court appearances, Hodge was wearing a tan Department of Correction shirt when a judge ordered him released. Prosecutors had said they were not going forward with his felony case. A Daily News reporter observed several people released into the 30-degree night this past Tuesday, wearing just tan jail-issued shirts. Some had family waiting for them with jackets. Others, like Hodge, were left to fend for themselves in the cold. NYC jail guard union rips 30-day prisoner isolation limit Public defenders say they are scrambling to find coats for dozens of inmates who are released daily from jail at courthouses citywide. Releases can happen if defendants make bail, cop a plea or see their cases dismissed. “It is inhumane and dangerous to release people into the cold in New York City without appropriate clothing, especially when they have far to travel from the courthouse,” said Sarah Kerr, staff attorney at the Legal Aid Society’s Prisoners’ Rights Project. New legislation passed by the City Council and awaiting signature from Mayor de Blasio guarantees an inmate’s right to be provided a “weather-appropriate” outfit. The Department of Correction started dressing defendants in tan uniforms years ago in an effort to combat gang violence. Their current policy is to only allow people to wear their own clothes in front of a jury at trial or at a grand jury proceeding. A Department of Correction spokeswoman said, “We are working diligently to ensure that all inmates leaving DOC custody are appropriately attired for the cold temperatures.” She did not explain why coats had not been ordered before the onset of winter. Outside the Bronx Hall of Justice on E. 161st. St. on Tuesday, Hodge, unable to go back to Rikers Island to pick up his winter gear, instead walked back inside the courthouse where he had seen a judge hours earlier. A Legal Aid attorney, Monica Dula, spotted him wandering around a hallway and offered to get him a coat. “At least you have sleeves,” Dula said, rolling her eyes. The pair walked across the street to Legal Aid’s neighborhood office, where attorneys keep a stash of coats — many of which were donated by the lawyers themselves. Hodge found a jacket big enough to fit his 6-foot-4, 250-pound frame and went on his way. Back outside the courthouse, Steven Green, 40, was released in short-sleeved jail clothes after spending eight days in jail on a criminal mischief charge. He was freezing, but lucky. His wife was waiting for him with a jacket.","output":"Some people are let go from jail without a winter coat, even when it's very cold outside.

Is European higher education took place for hundreds of years in Christian cathedral schools or monastic schools (scholae monasticae), in which monks and nuns taught classes; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the later university at many places dates back to the 6th century. a good answer to this question?","output":"Yes, the provided answer offers a good, although brief, introduction to scholae monasticae. However, a more detailed and long answer would be: Scholae monasticae were Christian monastic schools that emerged in Europe during the early Middle Ages, specifically around the 6th century. They played a crucial role in the development of education, contributing to the preservation and transmission of knowledge in a period marked by turmoil and decline of classical civilizations. Scholae monasticae were typically found in monasteries and cathedrals, where monks and nuns taught a variety of subjects focusing on religious education, Latin, and liberal arts. The main purpose of these monastic schools was to educate the clergy, as well as to cultivate and preserve the religious, cultural, and intellectual traditions of Christianity. Monastic education was grounded in the Benedictine Rule, a set of guidelines established by St. Benedict in the 6th century that emphasized the importance of daily work, prayer, and reading. As a result, monks and nuns were expected to be literate, contributing to the development of a scholarly community within these monastic institutions. Scholae monasticae taught the seven liberal arts, which were divided into two categories: the trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) and the quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy). Moreover, they often studied texts from classical Greek and Roman authors, along with Christian literature such as the Bible and the Church Fathers' works. This synthesis of religious and secular learning allowed the monastic schools to become centers of intellectual life and knowledge preservation during the Early Middle Ages. Despite being primarily intended for the education of the clergy, many scholae monasticae also admitted laypeople, providing an opportunity for broader access to education. Throughout the years, these monastic schools evolved and expanded, eventually giving rise to more secular institutions like medieval universities. The emergence of universities as independent centers of learning marked a critical turning point in European higher education, gradually shifting focus from exclusively religious instruction to a more diverse range of disciplines. Nonetheless, scholae monasticae continued to exist alongside universities, contributing to the overall development and advancement of European education. In summary, scholae monasticae were Christian monastic schools that played an important role in the preservation and transmission of knowledge during the early Middle Ages. They offered education to the clergy and, in some cases, laypeople, teaching both secular and religious subjects. These forerunners of the later European universities helped shape the landscape of higher education and contributed to the intellectual and cultural development of Western society."},{"instruction":"Sentence 1: \`\` New York Newsday '' Romantico is visual poetry on the run ...

And , as any work of art does when it 's successful , Do these two sentences convey the same information?","output":"Yes, these two sentences essentially convey the same information - they talk about the subject \\"Romantico\\" from New York Newsday being a vivid example of \\"visual poetry on the run\\" i.e., dynamic, lively, vivid and impactful. The sentences also touch upon the success of any work of art, subtly implying that \\"Romantico\\" is a successful piece of work. Despite slight differences in language and contraction use, the meaning is retained in both sentences. Sentence 1 uses \\"it is successful,\\" while Sentence 2 uses the contracted form of \\"it is\\" to say \\"it's successful.\\" The purpose of using a contraction in Sentence 2, \\"it's,\\" is to make the sentence less formal and possibly more conversational or casual. Contractions generally shorten the sentence and make it easier to read or speak, thus promoting informality. On the other hand, using \\"it is\\" in Sentence 1 can add a slight touch of formality, seriousness, or professionalism to the sentence, as compared with Sentence 2. This can be especially true in written communication, where full forms are often used in more professional or formal contexts. Nonetheless, these slight differences in formality level between the two sentences do not alter the overall meaning or information being conveyed. Both sentences express that \\"Romantico\\" is visual poetry on the run, which is what happens when an art piece succeeds. Therefore, we can say that these two sentences do convey the same information, despite minor differences in their form of presentation."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: What is the full name of the person whose temporarily aroused girlfriend comes onto him?

A source in Division 30, which has endured a campaign of kidnappings by the Nusra Front, said they also oppose the American air strikes carried out in the last few days against the al-Qaida-linked fighters. The statements complicate the American strategy in Syria, which has suffered a string of setbacks and delays, deploying just over 50 fighters dedicated to fighting the terror group Islamic State in the year since its programme to train and equip rebels began. “With all the immense military power the US has at its disposal, the start to the mission is nothing short of an embarrassment and if it has any hope of succeeding, it needs to show results fast,” said Charles Lister, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Doha Center and an expert on Syrian insurgent groups. The Nusra Front launched a campaign of kidnappings and attacks against Division 30 shortly after the arrival of the first contingent of 50 to 60 US-trained fighters from Turkey, accusing the group of seeking to spread American influence. The Qaida affiliate, whose fighters have pledged allegiance to Ayman al-Zawahiri, kidnapped Division 30’s overall commander last week along with six others as they planned an offensive against Isis positions in northern Aleppo. Nusra then attacked Division 30’s headquarters, killing five fighters and wounding 18 others, as the US-backed rebel group appealed for peace. The American-led coalition that has been assembled to fight Isis bombed Nusra positions in Syria in apparent retaliation. The US had previously targeted a Nusra-affiliated faction known as the Khorasan Group, which the Americans say is planning attacks against the west from inside Syria. Nusra’s leader has denied the group exists. Nusra’s campaign against the US-backed rebel unit continued this week, with the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring network with wide contacts inside Syria, saying Nusra kidnapped five more members of Division 30. A source in the US-backed group said those captured were actually families of the fighters. It is unclear how many of the rebels actually trained by the US have been incapacitated in the campaign, with conflicting reports from activists and the rebel group itself, which says only one of its US-trained fighters has “disappeared”. In a new statement after the latest spate of kidnappings, Division 30 pledged never to fight Nusra and said it was focused on fighting Isis and the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. Related: Syria approaching de facto partition amid Assad military setbacks “Division 30 was formed by the honorable sons of Syria to free their nation from Assad’s gangs and Daesh [Isis],” the statement said. “Division 30 pledges before the Syrian people to commit to the principles under which it was formed and to not be dragged into any side battle with any faction, and that it has not fought and will not fight the Nusra Front or any other faction regardless of name or ideology.” A source in Division 30 told the Guardian the group still has members training with the US and that they opposed American airstrikes against Nusra. “We have nothing to do with the coalition strikes, that is the truth and we are opposed to strikes against the Nusra Front’s facilities to this day,” the source said. “Our goal is clear – Daesh followed by the regime.” The latest declarations raise questions about the ability of the US to influence the rebels it has trained on the ground, and the viability of such an effort within Syria’s complex web of insurgent politics and alliances, where Isis and Nusra have emerged as two of the most powerful groups fighting on the ground. “The group almost certainly does not believe some of the things it has said lately, including protesting at US strikes on Nusra, but you can hardly blame them for such attempts at rescuing their credibility on the ground,” said Lister. “It’s quite telling in fact that a majority of the mainstream opposition now views Division 30 and the train and equip mission with intense suspicion – not only for the lack of regime focus, but for the disastrous start the 54 fighters have had.”","output":"A group of Syrian rebels trained by the US have declared their refusal to fight against the Nusra Front, Al-Qaida's affiliate in Syria, after a series of kidnappings by the militant group.

Article: Everybody hates it, but everybody does it. A recent report said that 40%of Americans hate tipping. In America alone, tipping is a 16 billion-a-year industry. Consumers acting politely ought not to pay more than they have to for a given service. Tips should not exist. So why do they? The common opinion in the past was that tips both rewarded the efforts of good service and reduced uncomfortable feelings of inequality. And also, tipping makes for closer relations. It went without saying that the better the service, the bigger the tip. But according to a new research from Cornell University, tips no longer serve any useful function. The paper analyzes numbers they got from 2,547 groups dining at 20 different restaurants. The connection between larger tips and better service was very weak. Only a tiny part of the size of the tip had anything to do with the quality of service. Tipping is better explained, by culture than by the money people spend. In America, the custom came into being a long time ago. It is regarded as part of the accepted cost of a service. In New York restaurants, failing to tip at least l5% could well mean dissatisfaction from the customers. Hairdressers can expect to get l5%-20%, and the man who delivers your fast food 2. In Europe, tipping is less common. In many restaurants the amount of tip is decided by a standard service charge. In many Asian countries, tipping has never really caught on at all. Only a few have really taken to tipping. According to Michael Lynn, the Cornell papers' author, countries in which people are more social or outgoing tend to tip more. Tipping may reduce anxiety about being served by strangers. And Mr. Lynn says, \\"In America, where people are expressive and eager to mix up with others, tipping is about social approval. If you tip badly, people think less of you. Tipping well is a chance to show off.\\" Question: This passage is mainly about _ .

The programme also suggests Coe may have misled the UK parliament. The double British Olympic 1500m champion, 59, denies any wrongdoing. The text messages suggest Diack, son of the disgraced former IAAF president Lamine Diack, helped secure African delegate votes for Coe. The investigation also uncovers evidence Coe may have misled a parliamentary select committee over when he first became aware of the allegations of doping and corruption in athletics. Coe became IAAF president in the midst of a growing corruption scandal involving blackmail and state-sponsored doping in Russia. Within weeks of his election, his predecessor, Diack Sr, was arrested and a warrant issued for the arrest of his son, a marketing consultant for the IAAF. The corruption scandal had originally come to light in a German television documentary in December 2014. The documentary reported that Russian and IAAF officials, including Diack Jr, had conspired to cover up doping by the Russian marathon runner Lilya Shobukhova, as well as attempt to blackmail her. Media playback is not supported on this device Coe was not personally caught up in any of the doping or corruption allegations, but he had been a member of the IAAF council since 2003 and a vice-president since 2007. He was asked by MPs at a meeting of the Culture, Media and Sport select committee last year why he had not been more prominent in pressing the doping issue while he was a vice-president. He told them: \\"I was certainly not aware of the specific allegations that had been made around the corruption of anti-doping processes in Russia.\\" When he was asked if he was aware of allegations against Diack Jr, Coe replied: \\"Well, they were allegations that were aired in the ARD documentary.\\" But evidence seen by the BBC and the Daily Mail reveals that, four months before the German television documentary was broadcast, an email was sent to Coe containing a number of attachments detailing the corruption, extortion and bribery claims, as well as the suggestion Diack Jr could have been involved. The attachments included a detailed complaint from the agent of Shobukhova, alleging she had paid Russian and IAAF officials 450,000 euro (£356,000) to cover up her doping and allow her to run in the London 2012 Olympics. Damian Collins MP, who sits on the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said: \\"I think his (Lord Coe's) answer to the select committee was deliberately misleading to create the impression that he was totally unaware of any specific allegations of this kind. \\"These involved serious criminal matters. The right thing to do would be to put that information into the hands of the criminal authorities straight away.\\" He added: \\"If he won't be drawn on the past and what he knew and can't come up with a compelling argument for the way he conducted himself, then I don't see how he could continue as president of the IAAF because he would lack the public support to do so.\\" In a statement, Coe, who won 1500m gold at the 1980 and 1984 Olympics, said he was forwarded emails about the corruption allegations, which he then sent on to the IAAF ethics committee, leaving it to investigate. His director of communications, Jackie Brock-Doyle, added: \\"He did not feel it was necessary to read the attachments. \\"You may think this shows a lack of curiosity. He, and we, would argue that it shows a full duty of care, ensuring the right people in the right place were aware of allegations and were investigating them.\\" Diack Jr claims that he and Coe met during the IAAF presidential campaign, twice in Beijing and once in the Bahamas. This was almost a year after Coe was sent the email about allegations against Diack Jr and several months after it was revealed the Senegalese had been accused of corruption on a grand scale. The claims of Diack Jr, who has been banned for life by the IAAF, have to be treated with extreme caution, but there is evidence - in the form of emails and text messages between Diack Jr, Coe and Nick Davies, the IAAF's head of communications - that he did indeed help Coe during his presidential bid. At the time, Davies was helping Coe's election campaign. The following are some of text messages, seen by Panorama, which call into question how Coe ran his successful IAAF presidency election campaign. These messages are from 2015 - several months after the world knew Diack Jr had been accused of dishonesty on a grand scale. Coe also appeared keen to ensure Diack Jr made an important meeting. Diack Jr told the BBC that the \\"friend\\" mentioned in this message was Hamad Kalkaba Malboum, president of the Confederation of African Athletics, whose support was crucial. In the days before the election, Diack Jr appeared to provide information on the election tactics of Coe's rival, Sergey Bubka, the Ukrainian former Olympic pole vault champion. Diack Jr also seemed to provide intelligence on how IAAF delegates might vote in the presidential election, asking Davies to get a message to Coe to speak to Phil Knight of Nike for confirmation from the USA delegate Steve Miller. This next message refers to the 24 out of 30 nations Diack Jr claims he could talk to and get support for Coe. The Briton won the election by a margin of 23 votes, 115-92. The BBC showed these text messages to Jack Robertson, a former chief investigator for the World Anti-Doping Agency and the man who investigated the Shobukhova doping scandal. \\"It appears that Coe is taking advice from someone who is at the centre of this scandal to extort athletes,\\" said Robertson. \\"It's wrong on so many fronts. It's not just disappointing, it's disgusting.\\" In an interview with Panorama, Diack Jr said Lord Coe would not have become IAAF president without his help. \\"If he had not the blessing of Lamine Diack or my support, he would have never been elected as the IAAF president,\\" he said. \\"He knows that.\\" Coe refused the BBC's request for an interview to discuss his relationship with Diack Jr and said the suggestion he sought the Senegalese's support was wrong. The Briton's spokeswoman added: \\"As with any campaign, lots of people offer advice - wanted or not, some helpful, some not. You try to be civil but wary. \\"This was the case with Mr Diack. He sent messages of support whilst at the same time supporting other candidates and accusing Seb Coe of leading a British media campaign against both him and his father.\\" Diack Jr is currently living in Senegal and Interpol has issued a notice for his arrest over allegations of bribery and corruption, which he rejects. \\"I have never, never, never been involved in any payment or any extortion of Lilia Shobukhova,\\" he said. \\"All we did about this Russian affair was to protect our World Championships. There was no cover-up of any, any, any doping matters.\\" Last week, the IAAF's ethics board announced that Davies was one of three IAAF members being provisionally suspended over allegations they took money to delay naming Russian drugs cheats. Given he is now the subject of an IAAF investigation, Davies said it would be inappropriate for him to comment on the Panorama programme. But Robertson is happy to speak out and said: \\"I hate to use the word, but he [Coe] got in bed with the devil to win the election. \\"I don't mean to call Papa Diack the devil, but he was certainly in the middle of the investigation. \\"And if he [Coe] makes a decision such as that, how can we trust him with other decisions? My bottom line is clean athletes deserve better.\\" The Panorama programme airs on the eve of an IAAF meeting in Vienna to decide whether to allow Russian athletes to compete at the Rio Olympics. Summary:","output":"Text messages seen by BBC suggest that ex-IAAF consultant Papa Massata Diack, who is currently wanted by Interpol, secured votes for Lord Coe's August election win to become IAAF president. Lord Coe has denied any wrong doing, however, these claims have also led to suggestions that he may have misled the UK parliament. Additionally, investigation evidence has emerged which suggests that Lord Coe was aware of doping and corruption allegations well before he admitted, with an email sent to Coe detailing such allegations months before the story broke in a German television documentary.

Passage: The buildings of Nuffield College, one of the colleges of the University of Oxford, are to the west of the city centre of Oxford, England, and stand on the site of the basin of the Oxford Canal. Nuffield College was founded in 1937 after a donation to the University by the car manufacturer Lord Nuffield; he gave land for the college, as well as £900,000 (approximately £246 million in present-day terms) to build and endow it. The architect Austen Harrison, who had worked in Greece and Palestine, was appointed by the University to design the buildings. His initial design, heavily influenced by Mediterranean architecture, was rejected by Nuffield, who called it \\"un-English\\" and refused to allow his name to be associated with it. Harrison reworked the plans, aiming for \\"something on the lines of Cotswold domestic architecture\\", as Nuffield wanted. Construction of the second design began in 1949 and was finished in 1960. Progress was hampered by post-war building restrictions, and the effects of inflation on Nuffield's donation led to various cost-saving changes to the plans. In one change, the tower, which had been planned to be ornamental, was redesigned to hold the college's library. It was the first tower built in Oxford for 200 years and is about 150 feet (46 m) tall, including the flèche on top. The buildings are arranged around two quadrangles, with residential accommodation for students and fellows in one, and the hall, library and administrative offices in the other. The chapel has stained glass windows designed by John Piper. The architectural historian Sir Howard Colvin said that Harrison's first design was Oxford's \\"most notable architectural casualty of the 1930s\\"; it has also been described as a \\"missed opportunity\\" to show that Oxford did not live \\"only in the past\\". Reaction to the architecture of the college has been largely unfavourable. In the 1960s, it was described as \\"Oxford's biggest monument to barren reaction\\". The tower has been described as \\"ungainly\\", and marred by repetitive windows. The travel writer Jan Morris wrote that the college was \\"a hodge-podge from the start\\". However, the architectural historian Sir Nikolaus Pevsner, although unimpressed with most of the college, thought that the tower helped the Oxford skyline and predicted it would \\"one day be loved\\". The writer Simon Jenkins doubted Pevsner's prediction, and claimed that \\"vegetation\\" was the \\"best hope\\" for the tower – as well as the rest of the college.","output":"Task Explanation: 1.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation of using cold water from the tap could have an indirect effect on the process of making ice cubes. Since the water is already cold, it may reduce the amount of time required for the water to freeze in the ice cube tray. This could result in slightly faster ice cube production.

South gulf has shallow water and is wider, while North gulf is quite deep. Both gulfs are exposed to intense wave activity throughout the year. Which gulf experiences less erosion on the ocean bottom? Hint: When waves travel into areas of shallow water, they begin to be affected by the ocean bottom. The free orbital motion of the water is disrupted, and water particles in orbital motion no longer return to their original position. As the water becomes shallower, the swell becomes higher and steeper, ultimately assuming the familiar sharp-crested wave shape. After the wave breaks, it becomes a wave of translation and erosion of the ocean bottom intensifies. The answer to this question is:","output":"The North gulf experiences less erosion on the ocean bottom. To understand why the North gulf experiences less erosion, we need to understand the different factors contributing to erosion and how they are affected by the geographical features of the two gulfs. Wave erosion occurs when the energy from waves comes into contact with the ocean floor, causing the gradual breakdown and removal of sediments and rocks. The intensity of this erosion process depends on several factors such as the depth of the water, the size and shape of the waves, and the nature of the ocean bottom materials (e.g., sand, rocks, etc.). In the South gulf, the shallow waters and wider area create conditions conducive to wave erosion on the ocean floor. As hinted in the question, as the waves travel into shallower water, they begin to be affected by the ocean bottom. The free orbital motion of the water becomes disrupted, causing water particles in orbital motion to no longer return to their original positions. As the water gets shallower, the swell becomes higher and steeper, eventually assuming a sharp-crested wave shape. This process causes the waves to break and transform into waves of translation, resulting in increased wave interaction with the ocean floor and thus intensified erosion. On the other hand, the North gulf has deeper waters, which allows the waves to maintain their orbital motion without significant disruption from the ocean floor. The deeper water means that the waves can keep their energy without coming into contact with the bottom sediments and rocks. This results in significantly less erosion on the ocean floor when compared to the more shallow and wider South gulf. Moreover, the intense wave activity experienced by both gulfs would contribute to the difference in erosion experienced by each gulf. The shallow waters of the South gulf would cause more waves to break and interact with the ocean floor, compounding the effects of erosion. In contrast, the deeper waters of the North gulf would allow the waves to pass through without losing their energy, resulting in less wave action on the ocean floor. In conclusion, due to the deeper waters and the reduced direct interaction between waves and the ocean bottom, the North gulf experiences less erosion on the ocean bottom compared to the South gulf, which has shallow waters and is subject to intensified wave-induced erosion due to its geographical features."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"Step 1: Choose a language other than English - I will choose Spanish, as it's a widely spoken language.

He weighed in at almost thirteen pounds, came ready-fitted with a shock of fat black hair and a couple of razor teeth. Jimbob's folks loved him like most folks love their little ones, maybe more. They'd been trying so hard for a child, suffered more mid-term miscarriages than the ewes they shuttled off to market most Thursdays. They dressed him in a one-year babygro and took him home to their hill farm. They fought to get up nights and give him his milk. His teeth made breast-feeding impossible. They sat hours gazing down in his cot. They dressed him fine and took him to their church and gave their thanks. Showed him off like the proud parents they were. Others cooed and smiled. But they never asked to hold. They gave thanks the Blakeys were happy, and that the monkey-baby had not been born to them. Jimbob's folks never gave a second thought that their boy might be different. The first Spring he walked, he stomped the moors in his welly-boots helping herd the pregnant ewes down in-by. He copied his father, kicking and cuffing at the stragglers, when the flock was returned to the hills in May. As Jimbob grew, his hair became thicker, his arms longer. His head shrunk down on his shoulders. At check-ups, nurses fixed smiles and pronounced him healthy. Doctors said, 'he'll make you a strapping lad.' His mother smiled, her heart swelled. When he was three, she sent him to nursery. She wanted him to mix with other kids. To taste life off the hard hills. She said, 'it'll do him the world of good.' Jimbob hated leaving the farm. He clung to his mother. She drove away, blinking tears. On the third day, she took a phone call. 'It's Jimbob,' they said. 'He's scaring the other kids.'The truth hit Jimbob's mother like a hammer.

In June 1911 Holst and his Morley College students gave the first performance since the seventeenth century of Purcell's The Fairy-Queen. The full score had been lost soon after Purcell's death in 1695, and had only recently been found. Twenty-eight Morley students copied out the complete vocal and orchestral parts. There were 1,500 pages of music and it took the students almost eighteen months to copy them out in their spare time. A concert performance of the work was given at The Old Vic, preceded by an introductory talk by Vaughan Williams. The Times praised Holst and his forces for \\"a most interesting and artistic performance of this very important work\\".After this success, Holst was disappointed the following year by the lukewarm reception of his choral work The Cloud Messenger. He again went travelling, accepting an invitation from H. Balfour Gardiner to join him and the brothers Clifford and Arnold Bax in Spain. During this holiday Clifford Bax introduced Holst to astrology, an interest that later inspired his suite The Planets. Holst cast his friends' horoscopes for the rest of his life and referred to astrology as his \\"pet vice\\".In 1913, St Paul's Girls' School opened a new music wing, and Holst composed St Paul's Suite for the occasion. The new building contained a sound-proof room, handsomely equipped, where he could work undisturbed. Holst and his family moved to a house in Brook Green, very close to the school. For the previous six years they had lived in a pretty house overlooking the Thames at Barnes, but the river air, frequently foggy, affected his breathing. For use at weekends and during school holidays, Holst and his wife bought a cottage in Thaxted, Essex, surrounded by mediaeval buildings and ample rambling opportunities. In 1917 they moved to a house in the centre of the town, where they stayed until 1925. Answer:","output":"The person that was affected by the foggy weather is Holst. In the text, it is mentioned that Holst and his family moved to a house in Brook Green due to the river air from their previous residence in Barnes, which was frequently foggy, affecting his breathing."},{"instruction":"The Carlsberg Group brews what beer that was originally made by Nobertine monks in the Belgian town of Grimbergen?","output":"The Carlsberg Group brews Grimbergen beer, which was originally made by Norbertine monks in the Belgian town of Grimbergen.

In a tweet Jones said his six daughters took him aside for a \\"family intervention\\" after two recent interviews led to public discussion of for example whether his late pals comedian Richard Pryor and actor Marlon Brando slept together. Jones blamed age his giving up drinking three years ago and memory problems for his garrulous interviews in Vulture and GQ recently. Among other topics in the profanity-pocked Q&As he said he didn't care for Taylor Swift's music once dated Ivanka Trump and once thought the Beatles were bad musicians. \\"Even at 85 it's apparent that 'wordvomit' and bad-mouthing is inexcusable \\" he continued. He said his \\"bad-mouthing\\" contradicted messages he wanted to convey about racism inequality homophobia and poverty. He said he had already reached out to his friends to apologize privately. \\"But when you live a public life you have a responsibility to be an example & since I do live a public life I wanted to make a public apology \\" he wrote. \\"I am sorry to anyone to whom my words offended & I'm especially sorry to my friends who are still here with me & to those who aren't \\" he wrote.

Just South of Vancouver, in the quaint Historic fishing village of Steveston we hopped aboard our boat, and spent the day on the water cruising the coast looking for whales, other marine mammals and seabirds. The regular chug-chug-chug of the boat motor for a couple of hours lulled me into a meditate state as we sped our way over the State line from Vancouver, back down to the waters of Washington State. The shimmer of the water all dappled in the sunlight, the slow, measured tones of our guide and snuggling into my warm jacket against the sharp breeze off the coast was just enough to make me forget my worries, and zone out from all of my modern day dilemmas. Honestly, it needs to be prescribed on the NHS. Forget hauling yoga mats and sitting in sweaty concrete rooms with patterns trying to hide the utilitarian backdrop, just hop on a boat out from Vancouver. Not having much success closer to the British Columbia shores, our captain decided to head south past the Canadian/American border. Incredibly, the resident killer whales of the San Juan Islands are the most studied whales in the world; they, in turn, have observed humans for at least six thousand years. Stable family groups, called pods, represent several generations and include grandmothers (the pod leaders), adolescents, infants, and huge bulls. Each family member is recognized by its distinctive markings and can live as long as a human. Much of what is known about the orca whale’s highly-organized social life has been learned from the resident pods in the San Juan Islands of Washington. Question: What land mass are the killer whales nearest? Options: A. not enough information B. San Juan Islands C. Fishing village of Steveston D. Vancouver === The correct answer is","output":"B. San Juan Islands The land mass nearest the killer whales in this context is the San Juan Islands, located in the waters of Washington State.

And I was wondering Why did Cameron do this? Answer:","output":"Cameron greased the wheels to ensure the car would run smoothly for several reasons. Here are the step-by-step reasons and justifications: Step 1: Friction reduction By greasing the wheels, Cameron reduces the friction between the moving parts, allowing the wheels to rotate freely and more smoothly. This reduced friction leads to better performance and fuel efficiency. Step 2: Protection against wear and tear The grease acts as a protective layer between the metal components, thereby reducing wear and tear on the parts and extending their lifespan. This means lower maintenance costs and less frequent repairs for the car. Step 3: Heat dissipation Another important function of the grease is to dissipate heat generated by the friction of the moving parts. By keeping the temperature of the components in check, Cameron ensures that the car remains in optimal working condition and prevents potential damage due to overheating. Step 4: Improved ride quality Greasing the wheels also helps to absorb shock, dampening any vibrations or rattling that may occur when driving. This can contribute to a more comfortable, quieter ride for both the driver and passengers. In conclusion, Cameron greased the wheels to improve the car's efficiency, lower maintenance costs, and enhance the overall driving experience."},{"instruction":"Thenin1926,hissecondyearofstudy,hewasawardedascholarshiptoallowhimtostudyinGermanyandhesetoffforBerlintoworkwithSchur.

We can’t have one elected.” Limbaugh also said that Bill Clinton must be somewhere “laughing himself sick over this hit job from Politico...If this story were about Bill Clinton, the left would be circling the wagons.” Limbaugh said that Cain was targeted because of his conservative views and skin color. “Anything good that happens to any black or Hispanic in American politics can only happen via the Democrat Party. If it happens elsewhere, we’re going to destroy those people a la Clarence Thomas.” “It really is about blacks and Hispanics getting too uppity. That’s what this is,” he said. “You don’t achieve in American politics as a Republican.....you try it and we’re going to destroy you.” Thomas, who faced allegations of sexual harassment during his Senate confirmation hearing for the U.S. Supreme Court two decades ago, also used the same argument, saying that hearings amount to a “high tech lynching” of blacks who think for themselves. During her show, Laura Ingraham suggested occupying Politico’s Arlington offices, after a caller drew parallels between Cain and Thomas and said that “we need to stand up for this citizen candidate.” The occupy reference was to the Occupy Wall Street protests that have been rocking the political world lately. “You’re saying Occupy Politico in other words,” Ingraham said. “They’re occupying Wall Street, we need...OccupyPolitico.com....stop destroying a good man’s reputation....we have seen this movie before and we know how it ends.” Cain has repeatedly denied that anything inappropriate took place while he led the National Restaurant Association in the 1990s. He has also said he had no knowledge of any financial settlement, reportedly to be in the five-figure range, according to Politico. Cain calls harassment accusations a ‘witch hunt’ Cain addresses his racial appeal Cain sings at press club The Fix: Who gains if Cain loses? ||||| By Jeff Poor, The Daily Caller Politico dropped a bombshell story Sunday evening, charging that GOP presidential front-runner Herman Cain was accused of sexual harassment by two unnamed females in the late 1990s when he was CEO of the National Restaurant Association. During an appearance on Fox News Channel’s “Geraldo at Large” just an hour later, Ann Coulter likened the allegations to those Clarence Thomas faced in the early 1990s during his Supreme Court confirmation process. “Liberals are terrified of Herman Cain,” she said. “He is a strong, conservative black man … They are terrified of strong, conservative black men. “It’s outrageous the way liberals treat a black conservative,” she told Geraldo. “This is another high-tech lynching. … Nothing liberals fear more than a black conservative. Ask Allen West. Ask Michael Steele. Ask Clarence Thomas. And even what the allegations are here, I mean, just shows you how the civil-rights juggernaut has gone off the rails. The idea of civil rights laws to begin with ironically was to protect blacks from Democrats from the South who won’t protect them. Now it’s you know, white women from Scarsdale who say, ‘Oh, I don’t like that he called me honey.’” ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The news article discusses conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh's reaction to allegations that Herman Cain sexually harassed two former female employees while he was CEO of the National Restaurant Association in the 1990s.

Seymour soon attempts to ask Audrey out, but she turns him down because she has a date with her sadistic, mean-spirited dentist boyfriend Orin Scrivello (Steve Martin). Despite this, Audrey is interested in Seymour, as well as dreams of marrying him and escaping Skid Row. After Seymour closes up shop, Audrey II (Levi Stubbs) begins to talk to Seymour, demanding more blood than Seymour can give. The plant proposes Seymour murder someone in exchange for fame and fortune: Seymour initially refuses, but agrees upon witnessing Orin beating Audrey. After Orin was finished with his patient, Arthur Denton (Bill Murray), who requested \\"a long, slow, root canal\\", Seymour books an appointment with Orin and arms himself with a revolver: however, he cannot bring himself to use it.

Each mole has been planted by the rival organisation to gain an advantage in intelligence over the other side. The more the moles become involved in their undercover lives, the more issues they have to cope with. The prologue opens with the introduction of triad boss Hon Sam, who sends a number of young gangsters to the police academy as moles, among whom include a young Lau. Concurrently, a young Chen joins the police force but is seemingly expelled from the academy even though he manages to impress Superintendent Wong Chi-shing. In reality, Chen has become an undercover agent reporting only to Wong. Over the course of ten years, Chen experiences great stress from his undercover work while Lau quickly rises through the ranks in the police department. The film begins with a meeting between Chen and Lau in a hi-fi store without either of them knowing the other's identity. Wong and his team interrupt a deal between Hon Sam and a Thai cocaine dealer after receiving a tip-off from Chen using Morse code. However, Lau alerts Hon, giving him enough time to order his minions to dispose of the cocaine, eliminating solid evidence of the drug deal. After the incident, Wong and Hon are both aware that they each have a mole within their respective organisations, placing them in a race against time to root out the other mole. Later, Chen sees Hon conversing with Lau at a cinema but does not see Lau's face clearly; he ultimately fails to capture Lau. By this time, both Chen and Lau are struggling with their double identities â Chen starts losing faith in himself as a cop after being a gangster for ten years; Lau becomes more accustomed to the life of a police officer and he wants to erase his criminal background.

These campaigns expanded Han sovereignty into the Tarim Basin of Central Asia, divided the Xiongnu into two separate confederations, and helped establish the vast trade network known as the Silk Road, which reached as far as the Mediterranean world. The territories north of Han's borders were quickly overrun by the nomadic Xianbei confederation.

His trackers think that might be intentional, showing his face in a ploy to taunt them or play games. And he has left behind clues: Serbian cigarettes and soiled diapers, the kind snipers wear when preparing to settle in a spot for a long time. As they revealed new details Wednesday about accused trooper-killer Eric Frein, state police would not say that he was in their grasp. But in their most expansive comments in days, they signaled that the manhunt - aided by nearly 1,000 officers, agents, and others - was getting closer. The search area has narrowed to five square miles of woods not far from Frein's parents' home. \\"In some ways, I almost think that some of this is a game to him,\\" said Lt. Col. George Bivens, who has been leading the hunt. Investigators said they have found a trail of items they believe the 31-year-old \\"survivalist\\" may have abandoned between the police barracks in Blooming Grove, Pike County, where he allegedly shot two troopers Sept. 12, killing one, and the dense woods near his parents' home in Canadensis, Monroe County, 15 to 20 miles away. Bivens would not elaborate, but the diapers fit the profile of Frein that police have suggested: a man who spent months or even years plotting his retreat into the Poconos. \\"With the sniper training that he received, or self-taught, that is one of the techniques we know that he's read about, to try to stay in position for a longer period of time,\\" Bivens said. \\"He believes that is something he should do.\\" He said officials would run DNA tests on the diapers to verify that they were Frein's. The cigarette packages found in the woods were the Serbian brand Drina. Police have said Frein was aligned with a group described as Eastern European military \\"enthusiasts\\" and reenactors of Cold War-era warfare. The FBI, which has placed Frein on its 10 Most Wanted list, said he claimed to have fought with Serbians in Africa. Police receive daily reports of gunshots in the area, but officials cannot be sure they are coming from Frein. He has abandoned an AK-47-style rifle, they said, but likely still carries the .308-caliber rifle he allegedly used in the ambush that killed Cpl. Bryon Dickson and wounded Trooper Alex Douglass. Despite several sightings, officers have not fired at Frein, Bivens said. They would need to positively identify him, and he would have to refuse to surrender before police would use lethal force, Bivens said. He also said police have kicked bears out of their caves and enlisted locksmiths to break into cabins and houses during the search. He asked for the public's help identifying abandoned houses, bunkers, or cabins in the woods where Frein might be hiding. And he asked that people with trail cameras in the area check them for any sign of the suspected gunman. Flanked by two other officers and facing dozens of reporters at the Blooming Grove Township building, Bivens talked and took questions for nearly 30 minutes, longer than he has in days. Nearby, satellite trucks lined the country roads. Tips continue to flow in, including some from out of state, although Bivens said Frein has likely not left the woods of Monroe and Pike Counties. Though the primary search has narrowed, its perimeters are frequently shifting, and Bivens said he could not rule out the possibility that Frein could slip through. \\"It's time to surrender before this gets any worse for him. Before he gets hurt or worse, he needs to surrender,\\" he said. \\"We're not going away.

Bivens said nearly 1,000 officers are involved in the dragnet, which is concentrated near the Delaware State Forest in Pennsylvania. Both civilians and law enforcement officers believe they've spotted Frein, he added. Some people said the suspect, a self-trained survivalist, was wearing black. Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Police have also found empty packs of Serbian cigarettes and soiled diapers they believe belonged to the suspect, who likes to reenact Eastern European battles. \\"We continue to find evidence of Frein's presence,\\" Bivens said at a press conference today, adding that the items are being tested for DNA. \\"We're in the right area, it's only a matter of time before we apprehend him,\\" he added. Bivens said the diapers are a survivalist technique used \\"to be able to stay in position for a longer period of time.\\" There have also been reports of gunshots in the area, none fired by law enforcement, he said. \\"Lethal force is authorized upon positive identification if he is not actively surrendering,\\" Bivens said. Jake Danna Stevens/The Times-Tribune/AP Photo Police believe Frein has traveled about 15 to 20 miles on foot since ditching his Jeep in a swamp near the barracks. Their search is focused on a few square miles near the borders of Pike and Monroe counties in a heavily wooded area of Pennsylvania. \\"There are many caves, small caves,\\" Bivens said. \\"We have bears in many of those caves. That's certainly a factor in those searches. We've kicked out bears and other wildlife.\\" Troopers are looking for abandoned or seasonal homes or sheds and asking the public to contact police if they see a garage door ajar or broken windows. They've also executed search warrants on several vacant homes. Bivens said Frein's family, from Canadensis, Pennsylvania, has been cooperating with authorities and they have no reason to believe the suspect has any accomplices. They have interviewed the suspect's relatives and members of the war reenactment community he was part of. Colleagues have described Frein as \\"very serious\\" about war reenactment and obsessed with the military and guns.

His father, a retired Army major, later told police that two weapons were missing from his home, a .308 with a scope and an AK-47 assault rifle.

By focusing on specific regions of your legs, choosing the right exercises, and creating a workout environment that caters to your preferences, you can successfully tone your legs and achieve your fitness goals. This article provides tips to create the perfect workout routine for leg toning and exercising with consistency. 1. Identify your target areas Start by determining which part of your legs you'd like to focus on – this can be your calves, thighs, or maybe a combination of multiple areas. By targeting specific muscle groups, you can tailor your routine to achieve desired results faster. Remember, it's crucial to create a balanced workout to avoid muscle imbalances and overuse injuries. Including exercises that target multiple leg muscles can help you promote balance, mobility, and flexibility. 2. Choose toning exercises that work out your target areas Once you have identified your target areas, research and select exercises specifically designed to tone and strengthen them. Popular leg toning exercises include: - Squats: A fundamental leg exercise targeting quadriceps, glutes, and hamstrings. - Lunges: Increases leg strength and flexibility, targeting quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes. - Calf raises: Focuses mainly on the calf muscles, promoting strength and toning. - Leg press: A gym-based exercise targeting quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes. - Deadlifts: A compound exercise that works multiple muscles, including hamstrings, glutes, and lower back. - Glute bridges: Primarily target glutes and hamstrings while promoting core stability. 3. Make an awesome workout playlist Music is a powerful workout motivator, helping to set the mood and pace of your workout. It also helps you get in the zone and stay focused on your routine. Amp up your leg toning workout sessions by creating a playlist filled with songs that energize and pump you up. Choose tracks with upbeat tempos and the right tune that can help you maintain a steady rhythm during your workout. 4. Set aside time to work out at least five days a week Consistency is key in seeing results from any fitness routine. To make significant progress in toning your legs, aim to work out at least five days a week. This frequency ensures that you're maintaining muscular engagement while allowing ample time for rest and recovery. Develop a personalized schedule to plan your workouts throughout the week, and stick to that program to make sure you stay on track. Ensuring consistency will lead to gradual improvements and noticeable results. 5. Set and meet a walking goal for each day Walking is a low-impact, natural way to tone and maintain leg muscles. Set a daily walking goal, such as 10,000 steps a day, to ensure adequate cardiovascular activity and sufficient leg toning outside of your primary workout sessions. Use a pedometer or fitness tracker to monitor your progress throughout the day and make an effort to reach or exceed your walking goal consistently. 6. Incorporate outdoor activities Take advantage of outdoor activities to switch up your routine and make it more enjoyable. Engaging in activities like hiking, long bike rides, or running can also help you tone your legs while providing a refreshing change of pace from regular gym workouts. These activities offer the added benefit of exposing you to nature and fresh air, which can significantly boost your mood and overall well-being. 7. Prioritize stretching Finally, always make time to stretch before and after your workouts, focusing on leg muscles such as the quads, hamstrings, and calves. Stretching has many benefits, including reducing the risk of injury, increasing flexibility and range of motion, and helping to alleviate post-workout muscle soreness. Conclusion Creating a winning leg toning workout routine involves understanding your goal areas, implementing targeted exercises, incorporating additional walking and outdoor activities, and prioritizing consistency in your workouts. Don't forget to enjoy your workouts with a motivational playlist and prioritize proper stretching. By staying dedicated and following these helpful tips, you'll be well on your way to achieving toned, strong legs and improved physical fitness."},{"instruction":"Choose the sentence that goes against common sense.

Spaces between words are not just a typographical convention. They serve an essential role in written communication, especially in languages such as English, which are characterized as space-delimited. Spaces function as visual cues that help the reader identify individual words quickly. They provide necessary breaks, making it more comfortable to process the text and extract meaning from it. A sentence without spaces or other typographical markers to separate words would look like a continuous stream of characters, making it much more challenging to read and comprehend. The spaces also help to define the syntax or structure of a sentence, distinguishing various components such as subjects, predicates, verbs, and objects. Through these grammatical components, spaces contribute to the overall coherence and sense of the text, allowing the reader to understand the relationships between different parts of a sentence and how they combine to convey meaning. For instance, let's consider your sentence \\"Day 307 – The energy of enthusiasm…\\" If we remove spaces, it would translate to \\"Day307–Theenergyofenthusiasm…\\" Here, the reader would have to spend additional cognitive effort to identify where one word ends, and another begins, which disrupts the flow of reading and comprehension. In digital contexts, spaces allow for highlightable/selectable word sequences. This feature adds to functionality as it supports the ability to copy, search, replace, and manipulate words more easily. Therefore, while it's technically possible to remove spaces between words, it almost invariably reduces legibility, comprehension speed, and overall usability, which may not be desirable in most contexts."},{"instruction":"Based on the premise \\"She had caught sight of the picture he had laid against the wall the night before.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"The girl was fond of the picture that the man left.\\" is true?","output":"Well, little buddy, the sentence tells us that the girl saw the picture the man put against the wall.

His body rolled over , his face wedging in the roots of a drift stump . Rin struggled to turn him over again ; small pebbles stuck to the bared front of his body . One hand still clamped over the broad smear of blood . Question Why was the hand still clamped over the broad smear of blood ? Answer:","output":"The hand was still clamped over the broad smear of blood most likely due to a combination of factors: Step 1: Consider the physical state of the individual The person mentioned in the context seems to be in a state of distress or injury, as evident by the doubled-up and limp body, as well as the blood smear. This could mean that they are unconscious or experiencing significant pain. Step 2: Evaluate the situation From the context, it appears that the characters are in a challenging environment, with a drift stump, roots, and small pebbles. The struggle mentioned could be a result of the difficult circumstances surrounding them or directly related to the individual's condition. Step 3: Assess the hand's position Given the context, the hand clamped over the broad smear of blood was probably done in an attempt to apply pressure to a wound or injury. The pressure can help stop bleeding and might have been a natural response from the person or a directive from someone else nearby. Step 4: Analyze the potential reasons for maintaining pressure The hand remaining clamped over the blood smear is most likely an instinctive reaction to alleviate the pain or stop the bleeding. Despite the person's consciousness or struggles, the body often maintains pressure on a wound out of an instinctual, inherent defensive response. In conclusion, the hand was still clamped over the broad smear of blood mainly because the person was likely in significant pain or unconscious, and the body instinctively maintained pressure on the wound to stop bleeding or alleviate the pain in a challenging environment."},{"instruction":"Which entity is this text about? Rockefeller was the second of six children and eldest son born in Richford, New York to con artist William Avery \\"Bill\\" Rockefeller (November 13, 1810 - May 11, 1906) and Eliza Davison (September 12, 1813 - March 28, 1889). His siblings were Lucy (1838-1878), William Jr. (1841-1922), Mary (1843-1925) and twins Franklin (Frank) (1845-1917) and Frances (1845-1847). His father was of English and German descent while his mother was of Scots-Irish descent. Bill was first a lumberman and then a traveling salesman who identified himself as a \\"botanic physician\\" and sold elixirs. The strike, called in September 1913 by the United Mine Workers, over the issue of union representation, was against coal mine operators in Huerfano and Las Animas counties of southern Colorado, where the majority of CF&I's coal and coke production was located. The strike was fought vigorously by the coal mine operators association and its steering committee, which included Welborn, president of CF&I, a spokesman for the coal operators. Rockefeller's operative, Lamont Montgomery Bowers, remained in the background. Few miners actually belonged to the union or participated in the strike call, but the majority honored it. Strikebreakers (called \\"scabs\\") were threatened and sometimes attacked. Both sides purchased substantial arms and ammunition. Striking miners were forced to abandon their homes in company towns and lived in tent cities erected by the union, such as the tent city at Ludlow, a railway stop north of Trinidad. Under the protection of the National Guard, some miners returned to work and some strikebreakers, imported from the eastern coalfields, joined them as Guard troops protecting their movements. In February 1914, a substantial portion of the troops were withdrawn, but a large contingent remained at Ludlow. On April 20, 1914, a general fire-fight occurred between strikers and troops, which was antagonized by the troops and mine guards. The camp was burned, resulting in 15 women and children, who hid in tents at the camp, being burned to death. Costs to both mine operators and the union were high. This incident brought unwanted national attention to Colorado. Due to reduced demand for coal, resulting from an economic downturn, many of CF&I's coal mines never reopened and many men were thrown out of work. The union was forced to discontinue strike benefits in February 1915. There was destitution in the coal fields. With the help of funds from the Rockefeller Foundation, relief programs were organized by the Colorado Committee on Unemployment and Relief. A state agency created by Governor Carlson, offered work to unemployed miners building roads and doing other useful projects. The casualties suffered at Ludlow were successfully labeled a massacre and mobilized public opinion against the Rockefellers and the coal industry. The United States Commission on Industrial Relations conducted extensive hearings, singling out John D. Rockefeller Jr. and the Rockefellers' relationship with Bowers for special attention. Bowers was relieved of duty and Wellborn restored to control in 1915, then industrial relations improved. Rockefeller denied any responsibility and minimized the seriousness of the event. When testifying on the Ludlow Massacre, and asked what action he would have taken as Director, John D. Rockefeller stated, \\"I would have taken no action. I would have deplored the necessity which compelled the officers of the company to resort to such measures to supplement the State forces to maintain law and order.\\" Rockefeller admitted that he had made no attempt to bring the militiamen to justice.

Solve -12*x + 111 = 99 for x.","output":"To find the solution for the equation -12*x + 111 = 99 for x, follow these steps: Step 1: Isolate the term with the variable (x). First, we want to get rid of the constant term on the left side of the equation to isolate x. To do this, we'll subtract 111 from both sides of the equation. -12*x + 111 - 111 = 99 - 111 This simplifies to: -12*x = -12 Step 2: Solve for x. Now, we want to solve for x by eliminating the coefficient -12 in front of the x term. We can achieve this by dividing both sides of the equation by -12. (-12*x) / -12 = -12 / -12 This simplifies to: x = 1 So, the solution to the equation -12*x + 111 = 99 for x is x = 1."},{"instruction":"3 and when all the flocks were gathered there, they rolled the stone from the mouth of the well, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again on the mouth of the well in its place.

The club have sold all 7,500 tickets for the match and Flynn believes his players can conclude their miraculous recovery. \\"I've been calm this week. We were dead and buried when I took over,\\" he said. Newport are bidding to retain their Football League status after four seasons in League Two, having waited 25-years to return to League Two after the club went out of business in 1989. A period where they could not even find a home in Newport followed, leading to a spell playing in Gloucester, where County earned their 'Exiles' nickname. Flynn says completing an amazing recovery from relegation would be the perfect reward for Newport's loyal fanbase and insists he is not thinking about the alternative. Newport are two points ahead of rivals Hartlepool and will survive as long as Pools do not win against title-chasing Doncaster Rovers.

However, it's safe to say that the film could not have been more misnamed, as it is not just unbearably disappointing – it's an outright disaster. From the very start, the narrative proves to be scattered and nonsensical. The heavily promoted \\"intricate plot\\" is an utter nightmare to follow, leaving viewers grasping at straws in a desperate attempt to make sense of the convoluted storyline. As if that wasn't enough, countless subplots further obscure the narrative, with side characters constantly vying for the limelight. These subplots hold no significance to the main story arc and serve only to waste precious minutes of an already insufferable movie. Meanwhile, the script seems to have been penned by someone who is wholly unfamiliar with the concept of subtlety, or even coherence. Dialogue is peppered with cringe-worthy one-liners, and conversations between characters appear contrived and robotic. It's as if the screenwriters took every overused cliché and threadbare trope, attempting to cobble them together to create a script that falls utterly flat. As for the acting, it would be an insult to actors everywhere to apply that label to the performances in \\"Unbearable Disappointment.\\" With a cast full of big names who have delivered in the past, audiences expected effortless chemistry and nuanced portrayals. Instead, we were subjected to cardboard cutout characters and performances that would make a high school drama class snicker. Their expressions range from non-existent to exaggerated, and they deliver their lines with all the enthusiasm of a tired customer service representative. The film's attempt at romance is nothing short of embarrassing. With a palpable lack of chemistry between the leads, their interactions oscillate between nauseatingly cringy and altogether unbelievable. The film's director seems hell-bent on forcing the romance down viewers' throats, despite the glaring absence of genuine emotion or connection between the characters. The resulting scenes feel staged and artificial, with a disturbingly persistent undertone of bland predictability. In a world where breathtaking visuals are commonplace, it's shocking how \\"Unbearable Disappointment\\" manages to fail in this area as well. The CGI scenes are amateurish in execution, provoking incredulous laughter rather than the awe they were intended to inspire. It's almost as if the film's creators unintentionally set out to create a parody of contemporary action films, as the visual aspects resemble cheap computer game graphics more than they do a high-budget production. The crux of every film lies in its conclusion – the climax or resolution that leaves viewers satisfied or delightedly wanting more. \\"Unbearable Disappointment\\" delivers a messy finale that does neither. Full of gaping plot holes and unresolved subplots, the ending tumbles into a haphazard conclusion, leaving viewers unsatisfied and frustrated. This impossibly confusing and disjointed narrative ultimately puts the nail in the coffin of this already subpar film. In conclusion, \\"Unbearable Disappointment\\" is a disastrous cinematic experience that may leave you questioning the sanity of the filmmakers. With its unintelligible plot, catastrophic dialogue, underwhelming performances, and thoroughly unrealistic romance, it's a wonder this film ever made it to the big screen. Save your money and your precious time – this is one you won't want in your movie-watching history."},{"instruction":"Sheila split open and the air was filled with gumballs. Yellow gumballs.

After several months of hard work on himself with the group, Stan was ready to open a shop and sell the thousands of yellow gumballs. He did this because he believed in capitalism, he loved capitalism. He loved the dynamic surge and crash of Amazon's stock price, he loved the great concrete malls spreading across America like blood staining through a handkerchief, he loved how everything could be tracked and mirrored in numbers. When he closed the store each night he would count the gumballs sold, and he would determine his gross revenue, his operating expenses, his operating margin; he would adjust his balance sheet and learn his debt to equity ratio; and after this exercise each night, Stan felt he understood himself and was at peace, and he could go home to his apartment and drink tea and sleep, without shooting himself or thinking about Sheila. On the night before the IPO of gumballs.com, Sheila came to Stan in a dream. She was standing in a kiddie pool; Stan and his brothers and sisters were running around splashing and screaming; she had managed to insert herself into a Super-8 home movie of Stan's family, shot in the late 70's. She looked terribly sad. \\"Sheila, where are you?\\" Stan said. \\"Why did you leave me, why did you become gumballs?\\" \\"The Ant King has me,\\" Sheila said. \\"You must rescue me.\\" What did Stan sell in his new shop? - yellow gum - gumballs - not enough information - Yellow hankercheifs The answer to this question is:","output":"- yellow gumballs"},{"instruction":"It's not me facing life imprisonment, is it?

The previous justice minister, David Ford, tried and failed to change the law. When asked on Wednesday how she would deal with the issue, Ms Sugden said her approach would be \\"subtle\\". But subtle is not a word many would use to describe the debate on proposed changes to the law during the past year. The new minister was assured she has and will have the \\"full confidence\\" and \\"full support\\" of the first and deputy first ministers. That is something that Mr Ford never enjoyed. With the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in diametrically opposed on the proposed changes to abortion law, that declaration of support will be strongly tested. On another contentious issue - same sex marriage - Sugden has said she plans to talk to executive ministers behind closed doors in attempt to change the approach to the issue. Of course, prisons are also highly contentious. As the daughter of a former prison officer, Ms Sugden will be more aware than most of the complexities and dangers involved. Two prison officers, David Black and Adrian Ismay, were killed during Mr Ford's time as minister, and the threat remains high. She will also be aware that her family background means every decision she makes about prisons, and the staff who work in them, will be subjected to intense scrutiny. A major reform programme has been under way for a number of years and a huge amount of work remains to be done. It was only seven months ago that a team of inspectors described Northern Ireland's high security prison at Maghaberry near Lisburn as one of the most dangerous in Europe. A follow up report in February said the situation had stabilised and improved, but it was far from a clean bill of health. Getting the funding needed to implement comprehensive reform, and improve the fabric of the prison estate, will be a huge challenge. It will also be another test of the promised support of Arlene Foster and Martin McGuinness. Policing is another area of intense public and political scrutiny. The chief constable is operationally independent, but it is up to the justice minister to set high level policy objectives and, most importantly, to determine the PSNI's annual budget. George Hamilton has said several times since his appointment that budget cuts have had a huge impact on the ability of his officers to do their jobs. So the new minister probably will not have to wait long for a chunky business case to land on her desk setting out why the PSNI needs more resources. Ms Sugden faces a huge task. Mr Ford has said publicly that he could only do the job of justice minister with the assistance of a very able Special Advisor (SPAD), and the support of his fellow MLAs and the Alliance party apparatus at Stormont. His successor does not have a party to turn to for advice or support. It is herself alone. A summary of the above article is?","output":"This article talks about some important topics that a new government leader named Ms. Sugden needs to handle.

The race pits controversial Republican Roy Moore, who is battling sexual harassment allegations, against Democrat Doug Jones, a former prosecutor. The outcome of the race could have national implications for both political parties and for President Donald Trump. Moore has denied several allegations of sexual misconduct when he was in his 30s involving women who were teenagers at the time, including one who was 14. \\"I do not know them.

Is It contains no locks; seawater flows freely through the canal. a good answer to this question? Available choices: [i] yes. [ii] no.","output":"[ii] no. Although the statement \\"It contains no locks; seawater flows freely through the canal\\" is accurate, it does not provide a comprehensive answer to the question about how wide the Suez Canal is. To give a more detailed and long answer, we should discuss the width and dimensions of the Suez Canal, as well as some of the history and purposes associated with its construction. The Suez Canal is an artificial waterway that connects the Mediterranean Sea with the Red Sea, providing a shorter and more efficient route between Europe and Asia. Stretching to a length of approximately 120 miles (193 kilometers), the canal cuts through the Isthmus of Suez in Egypt thereby eliminating the need to sail around the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa. The canal officially opened on November 17, 1869. Regarding its width, the Suez Canal has varied dimensions, which have changed over time because of expansion projects aimed at accommodating more massive and modern vessels. In its initial construction, the canal had a width of 72 feet (22 meters) at its base, while the surface width was about 200 to 300 feet (60 to 90 meters). The depth of the canal was also about 26 feet (8 meters) at the time. However, multiple expansion projects over the years have broadened and deepened the canal. After the most recent expansion project completed in 2015, the Suez Canal now has a depth of 66 feet (20 meters) and a width of up to 673 feet (205 meters) in certain sections. One of the unique features of the Suez Canal is that it doesn't have any locks. Locks are essentially watertight chambers that act as water elevators for ships, allowing them to move from one elevation to another. Since the Suez Canal traverses a low-elevation region, the water level in the canal remains nearly constant, and seawater can flow freely between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. The Suez Canal plays a critical role in global shipping and trade, as it significantly reduces the distance and time taken for shipping goods between Europe and Asia, contributing to cost reductions and higher efficiency. It facilitates the flow of approximately 8% of global maritime shipping, making it one of the most important waterways in the world. In conclusion, the Suez Canal's width varies along its length, with sections up to 673 feet (205 meters) wide after recent expansion efforts. The absence of locks in the canal allows for seawater to flow freely, making it a unique and vital waterway for international trade and shipping."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

To that end, he experimented with a cylinder of gas in three stages, stage A, stage B, and stage C. In stage A he kept the gas in room temperature. In stage B he heated the gas up. And in stage C he cooled the gas down. In which stage the gas molecules would collide more forcefully with the interior surface of the cylinder, stage A or stage B?","output":"To determine in which stage the gas molecules would collide more forcefully with the interior surface of the cylinder, we need to consider the effect of temperature on the gas particles. Step 1: Understand the relationship between temperature and kinetic energy The kinetic energy of gas particles is directly proportional to temperature. When the temperature of a gas increases, the average kinetic energy of its particles also increases, causing them to move faster. Conversely, when the temperature decreases, the average kinetic energy of the particles decreases, and they move slower. Step 2: Compare the temperature in stage A and stage B In stage A, the gas is at room temperature. In stage B, the gas is heated up, meaning the temperature is higher than in stage A. Step 3: Compare the kinetic energy of gas particles in stage A and stage B Given the relationship established in step 1, the average kinetic energy of gas particles in stage B will be higher than in stage A, since the temperature is higher in stage B. Step 4: Determine the forcefulness of collisions with the interior surface of the cylinder in stage A and stage B As the gas particles in stage B have higher kinetic energy, they will move faster and collide more forcefully with the interior surface of the cylinder than in stage A.

The time it took the Earth to circle the sun was time enough to clear the wreckage, but not enough to fade the memory of what happened there. It was time enough to bury the bodies that could be found, but not enough to truly mourn the thousands who perished. It was time enough to plan memorials, but not enough to fill the gaping wound in lower Manhattan. For what is a year but a thin sliver of history, a beat of a hummingbird's wing? And yet, in the space of 12 months, the wounded city rose from its knees, angry America smote the Taliban and sent Osama Bin Laden into hiding. A new generation of firefighters and cops tried to fill the shoes of those who were lost, a new generation of orphans faced a future uncertain. New threats in powder form arrived in the mail, and the lexicon of our lives was filled with terrible new words like \\"Cipro\\" and \\"weaponize.\\" New Yorkers talked tough and carried on, but with far less swagger and far less joy.

Question: What was Connecticut famous for? Context: The city struck fortune in the late 18th century with the inventions and industrial activity of Eli Whitney, a Yale graduate who remained in New Haven to develop the cotton gin and establish a gun-manufacturing factory in the northern part of the city near the Hamden town line. That area is still known as Whitneyville, and the main road through both towns is known as Whitney Avenue. The factory is now the Eli Whitney Museum, which has a particular emphasis on activities for children and exhibits pertaining to the A. C. Gilbert Company. His factory, along with that of Simeon North, and the lively clock-making and brass hardware sectors, contributed to making early Connecticut a powerful manufacturing economy; so many arms manufacturers sprang up that the state became known as \\"The Arsenal of America\\". It was in Whitney's gun-manufacturing plant that Samuel Colt invented the automatic revolver in 1836. The Farmington Canal, created in the early 19th century, was a short-lived transporter of goods into the interior regions of Connecticut and Massachusetts, and ran from New Haven to Northampton, Massachusetts.

Options: - theater - pocket - supermarket - sidewalk - street reasoning:","output":"The bad man tossed his bubblegum out of his window and onto the \\"sidewalk\\" or \\"street\\". Reasoning: - Theater: This option implies the bad man was inside a theater. However, the question states that he tossed the bubblegum \\"out of his window,\\" which indicates he is inside a building or vehicle with windows, not a theater. - Pocket: This option doesn't make sense because people don't usually throw things out of their windows and into their pockets. - Supermarket: This option implies the bad man was inside a supermarket, which contradicts the fact that he threw the bubblegum out of a window. Supermarkets also usually have walls and glass windows, making it difficult to throw something onto them from the outside. - Sidewalk: This option is plausible because sidewalks are commonly found outside of buildings and alongside streets, making them a possible landing spot for discarded items like bubblegum. - Street: This option is also plausible as streets are commonly found outside of buildings, and it is common for people to discard items from windows onto the street. Both sidewalk and street are reasonable answers, as they are common locations for discarded items, especially when thrown from a window."},{"instruction":"Definition: In this task, you are given one English sentence.

Which patient would more likely risk cardiovascular disease, patient A or patient B? Greg is a doctor with the city hospital. Today, he is seeing two patients, patient A and patient B. Patient A maintains a high-fat diet, but patient B does not maintain a high fat diet. Greg is advising the patients how lifestyle change can improve their health. Hint: Although some lipids in the diet are essential, excess dietary lipids can be harmful. Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis. Answer:","output":"Based on the information given in the paragraph, patient A would more likely risk cardiovascular disease. This conclusion is drawn from the information that patient A maintains a high-fat diet. The passage explains that though some lipids are essential in a diet, having excessive dietary lipids, usually from a high-fat diet, can be detrimental to health outcomes. This is primarily due to the reason that high-fat diets may lead to unhealthy weight gain, increased lipid levels in the blood, the narrowing of arteries and thereby increasing the risk of diseases like atherosclerosis, a form of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, given that patient A follows a high-fat diet and Patient B does not, it is more likely that patient A is at higher risk for cardiovascular disease considering the factors stated above."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Would group B able to hear higher or lower frequency than group A? David wants to categorize animals according to the sound waves they can hear. Eventually, he was able to categorize them in three different groups, group A, group B, and group C. He placed the animals that can only hear ifrasound in group A. Then he placed the animals that are only able to hear the same frequency of sound waves as humans do in group B. The last group of animals were able to hear only ultrasound. He placed them in group C. Hint: The frequency of sound waves is measured in hertz (Hz), or the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a second. Human beings can normally hear sounds with a frequency between about 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. Sounds with frequencies below 20 hertz are called infrasound . Sounds with frequencies above 20,000 hertz are called ultrasound . Some other animals can hear sounds in the ultrasound range. For example, dogs can hear sounds with frequencies as high as 50,000 Hz. You may have seen special whistles that dogs but not people can hear. The whistles produce a sound with a frequency too high for the human ear to detect. Other animals can hear even higher-frequency sounds. Bats, for example, can hear sounds with frequencies higher than 100,000 Hz. The answer is:","output":"Group B would be able to hear lower frequency sound waves than Group A. This is because Group A animals can only hear infrasound (frequencies below 20 Hz), while Group B animals can hear the same frequency of sound waves as humans do, which is between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. Since infrasound has a lower frequency than the range that humans and Group B animals can hear, Group B would hear a higher frequency than infrasound but lower than the ultrasound that Group C animals can hear."},{"instruction":"Question: Build a movie plot around this: What did Rathbone give to Wu Chow?

Though I don't like to admit it, I get all excited and giddy days before! I'm not too picky when it comes to hotel accommodations. I've stayed at hotels ranging from Circus Circus to Polo Towers to The Wynn and almost every other hotel in between. But I have never experienced such terrible service as I did at Caesar Palace. I had booked 3 rooms for the weekend and was told the rooms will be ready by 4 pm for my friend to check in. By 4 o'clock only 1 of the rooms was ready. No biggie though, I didn't need the room immediately. At 6:45 pm my sister arrived and tried to check in for the other 2 rooms, front desk told her house keeping was cleaning the other rooms which will take about 10 minutes, the rooms will not be in the same tower with the first one because there are no rooms available and the rooms will not be next to each other. WTHECK?! Really Caesar Palace, is it that difficult to arrange for 3 rooms to be in the same tower at least?! Anyways, 10 minutes roll by still the rooms are not available, 30 minutes later still nothing, 1 hour later still nothing... 9:30 pm and still my other 2 rooms were not available. To make matters worse, I had 8 guests waiting- not able to grab dinner and not able to get ready for the night out! Finally I arrived at 10 pm and was furious because the rooms were \\"supposedly\\" still not available. After throwing a fit and almost on the verge of throwing the front desk man into the fountain, the rooms were magically available and incidentally next to one another. To make matters worse, they only offered the rooms to be complimentary for the night and an upgrade with kings beds not 2 twins. In conclusion, Caesar Palace can offer bad customer service so be aware if you decide to stay here. They overbook the rooms and do not prepared to accommodate their guests when they are over capacity. So aside from the whole rooms ordeals, I don't think I can stay at Caesars Palace in the future again because the rooms definitely need some upgrading, the selection of food/places to dine at are minimal, wow it's quite a trip from the parking lot to the hotel and Oh Yea, service can be a hit or miss. The only thing I really liked/looked forward to whiling staying at Caesars Palace was the pool and checking out. How would this review be described in terms of sentiment?

Add the coefficients together to combine them: -55*y + 42*y = (-55 + 42)*y = -13*y Now the equation looks like this: -13*y = -117 Step 2: Isolate y To isolate y on one side of the equation, you need to divide both sides by the coefficient of y, which is -13. (-13*y)/-13 = -117/-13 This will cancel out the -13 on the left side of the equation: y = 9 So, the solution to the equation -55*y + 42*y = -117 is y=9."},{"instruction":"Process: - People breathe and expel carbon dioxide - Engines produce carbon dioxide - Living things produce waste - Waste decomposes - Decomposition produces methane - Water evaporates - Water vapor joins the atmosphere - Carbon dioxide, water vapor and methane are greenhouse gases - Question: suppose the soil is unusually deep happens, how will it affect LESS greenhouse gases. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"B: less"},{"instruction":"Give some stream of consciousness and then the answer.

However, when requested to generate a brief sentence, I can certainly comply. Let me provide you an example of a brief sentence: \\"John enjoys reading on a rainy day.\\" This sentence is brief and succinct but also provides key information about John's preference for reading as a pastime, and his preference to do so particularly when it's raining. A sentence holds a lot of power. It can either convey an exact idea, notion or thought or it can be used to narrate a story, describe an object, or explain a complex phenomenon. The sentence shared above uses only seven words yet offers enough material for the reader to formulate a basic impression of John and envision him sitting comfortably with a book as raindrops patter overhead. Even though it's brief, this sentence can be expanded upon and elaborated. For instance, one might wonder what sort of books John prefers. Does he enjoy fiction or non-fiction? Perhaps he likes mystery novels or prefers historical accounts. Furthermore, the notion of his enjoyment of reading during rainy days may suggest that he cherishes solitude or finds comfort in the rhythm of falling rain. These inquiries can lead to a larger narrative, developing a more considerable characterization or even a storyline. That being said, not all brief sentences have to form part of a bigger narrative. They can also stand alone as single, isolated factual statements or opinions. For example, \\"Pizza is delicious.\\" This brief sentence expresses a general opinion shared by many people around the world and doesn't necessarily require further elaboration, although it could certainly be expanded upon with descriptions of flavors, textures, and personal preferences.

She began by printing out a list of minerals. “I discovered that any stone or rock of any kind is already a hedge fund,” said Fox. She concocted the name Titanite. (“Because Titanium is already a fund,” she explained.) In making “Equity,” which premiered this week at the Sundance Film Festival, Fox and producers Sarah Megan Thomas and Alysia Reiner did a lot of homework. The movie, starring Anna Gunn (“Breaking Bad”) as a finance executive guiding a controversial tech company to an IPO, was built on interviews with women at all levels of finance. They heard stories of high-powered executives hiding their pregnancies from colleagues, and found it refreshing to meet ambitious women who explained why they stayed in the grueling profession with, “I like money.” The research was rooted in a hope that the movie wouldn’t turn into “Wolf of Wall Street” excess but instead offer a look at the real experiences of finance professionals. As Reiner explained: “There are no drugs. There are no hookers. But there is drama.” Gunn, in her first feature role since breaking out as Skyler White on “Breaking Bad,” is taking on a rare role in Hollywood: the female Wall Street executive. “It’s a different perspective,” said Trevor Groth, Sundance’s director of programming. “It’s a different gaze.” The “Equity” idea came to Thomas after hearing the stories and meeting the colleagues of her husband, who works at Lehman Brothers and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Reiner, who admitted she doesn’t emotionally connect to most Wall Street movies, came on board after meeting with a management consultant who shared stories of women dropping out of the financial work force. The movie was purchased for distribution at the festival by Sony Pictures Classics, and the producers said they’re developing a television series based on the film. Wall Street’s quirks and practices were laced throughout the making of the film. The filmmakers brought on consultants who crunched the script’s numbers to make sure the valuations added up. Some potential investors weren’t cleared by their compliance department to partner on the film. And when the filmmakers tried to use audio of real Wall Street traders shouting on the exchange floor, no one currently working was allowed to participate. “It was really important to all of us that it feel authentic,” said Fox. “People tend to complain that Wall Street doesn’t resemble the real thing [in movies].” Now, the team says they view Wall Street differently than they did before making the movie. “Equity” concerns a social media company going public — which Reiner sees as an existential quandary. “We are valuing these companies like Facebook and Twitter at billions of dollars and yet there is no there there,” she said. “It’s not a commodity like gold or sugar or pork bellies.” For the latest entertainment news Follow @WSJSpeakeasy What was this article about?","output":"This article talks about a new movie called \\"Equity\\" which shows a view of Wall Street from a woman's perspective.

At one of these, during the triennial Norfolk and Norwich Festival in October 1924, he heard Frank Bridge's orchestral poem The Sea, conducted by the composer. It was the first substantial piece of modern music he had ever encountered, and he was, in his own phrase, \\"knocked sideways\\" by it. Audrey Alston was a friend of Bridge; when he returned to Norwich for the next festival in 1927 she brought her not quite 14-year-old pupil to meet him. Bridge was impressed with the boy, and after they had gone through some of Britten's compositions together he invited him to come to London to take lessons from him. Robert Britten, supported by Thomas Sewell, doubted the wisdom of pursuing a composing career; a compromise was agreed by which Britten would, as planned, go on to his public school the following year but would make regular day-trips to London to study composition with Bridge and piano with his colleague Harold Samuel.Bridge impressed on Britten the importance of scrupulous attention to the technical craft of composing and the maxim that \\"you should find yourself and be true to what you found.\\" The earliest substantial works Britten composed while studying with Bridge are the String Quartet in F, completed in April 1928, and the Quatre Chansons Françaises, a song-cycle for high voice and orchestra. Authorities differ on the extent of Bridge's influence on his pupil's technique. Humphrey Carpenter and Michael Oliver judge that Britten's abilities as an orchestrator were essentially self-taught; Donald Mitchell considers that Bridge had an important influence on the cycle.","output":"Question 1: Who introduced Britten to symphony concerts in Norwich?

Let's pick \\"climate change\\" as it's a highly relevant and widely discussed issue. Step 2: Create a context To create a context, I will provide some background information on climate change, specify the problem, and include some key factors influencing the phenomenon. Context: Climate change is a long-term alteration in global weather patterns, primarily caused by the increased level of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere. These gases trap heat radiated by the sun, resulting in the greenhouse effect, which leads to rising global temperatures and associated consequences such as changes in precipitation patterns, melting polar ice caps, and rising sea levels. Human activities, such as fossil fuel burning, deforestation, and industrial processes, are significant contributors to the increase in greenhouse gases. Step 3: Generate a hypothesis A hypothesis is a proposed explanation for a phenomenon or a prediction of outcomes based on the context. I will generate a hypothesis based on the climate change context. Hypothesis: If global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon capture technology, reforestation projects, and transitioning to renewable energy sources, are implemented and increased, then the rate of climate change, global temperature increases, and consequences will be slowed down, potentially mitigating some of its severe effects on ecosystems, human life, and the economy."},{"instruction":"Definition: In this task, you are given a sentence in the Bulgarian language and corresponding English translation of this sentence.

Article: The 30-mile road that runs through the mountains of Willie Valley makes most drivers' hands sweat. But Andersen, a 46-year-old father of four, wasn't expecting any trouble on the road last New Year's Eve, when he set off for a ski trip to the Bear Mountains with nine-year-old daughter Mia, four-old son Baylor, and nine-year-old neighbor Kenya. Andersen had driven through the Valley hundreds of times over the years. The weather was fine. But the higher they drove, the more slippery the road became.

When they land, he is welcomed by representatives of the East German government, and Sherman realizes that Armstrong has defected to the other side. Sherman, however, is extremely uncomfortable with this move, realizing if the apparent defection is in fact real, given the circumstances of the Cold War of the period, she would likely never see her home or family again. They are constantly accompanied by Professor Karl Manfred (Günter Strack), who took part in arranging Armstrong's defection to the East.Armstrong visits a contact, a 'farmer' (Mort Mills), where it is revealed that his defection is in fact a ruse to gain the confidence of the East German scientific establishment in order to learn just how much their chief scientist Gustav Lindt (Ludwig Donath) and by extension, the Soviet Union, knows about anti-missile systems. While Armstrong does not inform the U.S. government of his plan, he has made preparations to return to the West via an escape network, known as (Pi).However, Armstrong is followed to this farm by his official body man, Hermann Gromek (Wolfgang Kieling), an East German security officer assigned to him.

Many years before, El Mariachi and his wife Carolina confronted Marquez in a shootout and wounded the general; in retaliation, Marquez took the lives of Carolina and their daughter in an ambush. In addition to El Mariachi, Sands persuades former FBI agent Jorge Ramírez to come out of retirement and kill Barillo, who had murdered his partner Archuleta in the past. Furthermore, AFN operative Ajedrez is assigned by Sands to tail Barillo. While monitoring Barillo's activities, Ramírez meets Billy Chambers, an American fugitive who has been living under the protection of Barillo, but can no longer stomach the horrible tasks he's been forced to carry out for him. Ramírez convinces Chambers he will provide him protection in exchange for getting closer to Barillo by tagging Chambers' pet chihuahua with a hidden microphone, and Chambers agrees to complete the deal by surrendering to U.S. authorities once Barillo has been taken down. Sands' assistant, Cucuy, originally hired to keep an eye on El Mariachi, instead tranquilizes El Mariachi and turns him over to Barillo, also offering to reveal the details of Sands's plan.

In this case, Tim had always wanted a new bike and was hoping to receive it on his birthday. As Tim looked at the presents at his party, he felt disappointed and worried because none of them seemed big enough to contain a bike. It's natural for him to feel this way, as he had been eagerly looking forward to this gift. However, it also teaches us a valuable lesson about not letting expectations dictate our happiness and to be open to surprises. When opening presents, Tim continued to feel disheartened as he went through the first few gifts, which were not bikes. The third present, being the biggest among them, gave Tim a glimmer of hope. However, even after opening it and finding no bike inside, Tim endeavored not to let his disappointment show. This demonstrates Tim's ability to express gratitude and appreciation for the gifts he received, despite not getting what he initially hoped for. Just as Tim tried to manage his disappointment, his dad swooped in with a grand surprise — a hidden present that contained the bike Tim had been dreaming of. This gesture is a reminder that sometimes, there are surprises that unfold beyond our immediate view and we should maintain patience and trust in the people who care about us. Once gifted, Tim and his dad bonded over assembling the bike, an activity that further strengthened their bond and created happy memories for them to cherish. In conclusion, this story holds several valuable life lessons, such as keeping an open mind, being patient in the face of disappointment, and appreciating the love and support of family members."},{"instruction":"What is the solution to this math problem?

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the liver converts excess glucose less happens, how will it affect the liver having to work HARDER. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"If the liver converts excess glucose less efficiently, it will have to work harder in order to maintain normal blood glucose levels. This increased workload may lead to a number of direct and indirect effects on the liver and its processes. Direct effects: 1. The liver may become overworked and fatigued, potentially reducing its overall efficiency in performing other essential functions, such as filtering blood, producing bile, and regulating blood clotting. 2. The liver's inability to effectively convert excess glucose into glycogen for storage can lead to increased levels of glucose in the bloodstream (hyperglycemia). This can be particularly dangerous for individuals with diabetes. Indirect effects: 1. A stressed liver may cause the release of stress hormones, such as cortisol and adrenaline, which can result in complications with other bodily systems, including the circulatory, endocrine, and nervous systems. 2. The increased glucose levels in the bloodstream can lead to vascular damage, risking heart disease, kidney damage, nerve damage, and eye damage. 3. The liver's reduced ability to process other essential nutrients, such as fats and proteins, may affect the body's overall nutrient absorption and metabolism, leading to potential health problems.

Having been tried and found guilty of murder, Nero has now been hanged and his body taken for the ignominious process of public dissection. The year after the prints were issued, the Murder Act 1752 would ensure that the bodies of murderers could be delivered to the surgeons so they could be \\"dissected and anatomised\\". It was hoped this further punishment on the body and denial of burial would act as a deterrent. At the time Hogarth made the engravings, this right was not enshrined in law, but the surgeons still removed bodies when they could.A tattoo on his arm identifies Tom Nero, and the rope still around his neck shows his method of execution. The dissectors, their hearts hardened after years of working with cadavers, are shown to have as much feeling for the body as Nero had for his victims; his eye is put out just as his horse's was, and a dog feeds on his heart, taking a poetic revenge for the torture inflicted on one of its kind in the first plate. Nero's face appears contorted in agony and although this depiction is not realistic, Hogarth meant it to heighten the fear for the audience. Just as his murdered mistress's finger pointed to Nero's destiny in Cruelty in Perfection, in this print Nero's finger points to the boiled bones being prepared for display, indicating his ultimate fate. While the surgeons working on the body are observed by the mortar-boarded academics in the front row, the physicians, who can be identified by their wigs and canes, largely ignore the dissection and consult among themselves.

Freke had been involved in the high-profile attempt to secure the body of condemned rioter Bosavern Penlez for dissection in 1749.

The story revolves around the characters of Walter Hartright, a young art teacher, Marian Halcombe, a strong-willed and intelligent woman, and her beautiful half-sister, Laura Fairlie. The novel explores themes such as mistaken identity, madness, class disparity, and the legal rights of women during the Victorian era. Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical adaptation, with David Zippel providing the lyrics and Charlotte Jones writing the book, made its premiere in the West End at the Palace Theatre in London in September 2004. The musical follows the structure of Collins' novel, presenting the story through a combination of spoken dialogue, songs, and instrumental music. The story begins when Walter Hartright encounters a mysterious woman dressed entirely in white while on his way to Limmeridge House, where he is employed to teach drawing to Marian and Laura. Intrigued by the woman's distressed state and her uncanny resemblance to his new pupil, Laura, Walter delves into the tangled web of secrets surrounding the Fairlie family. As the plot unfolds, Walter, Marian, and Laura come face to face with betrayal, deceit, and a nefarious villain named Count Fosco, who covets the family's fortune. The musical production of \\"The Woman in White\\" uses a combination of live action, projected images, and elaborate sets and costumes to bring the world of the Victorians to life. The music includes a mix of operatic and contemporary Broadway styles, with songs that highlight the characters' emotions and advance the plot. Some memorable songs from the musical include \\"I Hope You'll Like It Here,\\" \\"Perspective,\\" \\"Trying Not to Notice,\\" \\"I Believe My Heart,\\" and \\"You Can Get Away with Anything.\\" These songs showcase Webber's signature melodic flair and ability to reflect the emotions and inner lives of his characters. Despite mixed reviews from critics, \\"The Woman in White\\" enjoyed a relatively successful run in the West End and had a brief run on Broadway from 2005 to 2006. However, it is not among Webber's most well-known or commercially successful musicals like \\"The Phantom of the Opera,\\" \\"Cats,\\" or \\"Jesus Christ Superstar.\\" In conclusion, \\"The Woman in White\\" is an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical based on Wilkie Collins' suspenseful Victorian mystery novel. While not as popular as some of Webber's other works, this musical brings to life the world of Victorian England and showcases themes of love, betrayal, and intrigue through its captivating plot and engaging music."},{"instruction":"Is the following statement true? \\"The Bay of Bengal occupies an area of 2,600,000 square kilometres.\\" Let's think first.

Henry decorated the chapel by adding glazed windows, and stalls for himself and his queen. It was rebuilt by Edward I at a cost of over £300 and again by Henry VIII in 1519; the current building dates from this period, although the chapel was refurbished in the 19th century. Immediately west of Wakefield Tower, the Bloody Tower was built at the same time as the inner ward's curtain wall, and as a water-gate provided access to the castle from the River Thames. It was a simple structure, protected by a portcullis and gate. The Bloody Tower acquired its name in the 16th century, as it was believed to be the site of the murder of the Princes in the Tower. Between 1339 and 1341, a gatehouse was built into the curtain wall between Bell and Salt Towers. During the Tudor period, a range of buildings for the storage of munitions was built along the inside of the north inner ward. The castle buildings were remodelled during the Stuart period, mostly under the auspices of the Office of Ordnance. In 1663 just over £4,000 was spent building a new storehouse (now known as the New Armouries) in the inner ward. Construction of the Grand Storehouse north of the White Tower began in 1688, on the same site as the dilapidated Tudor range of storehouses; it was destroyed by fire in 1841. The Waterloo Block, a former barracks in the castellated Gothic Revival style with Domestic Tudor details, was built on the site and remains to this day, housing the Crown Jewels on the ground floor., what would be the answer ?

A lot of butlers come from a place called Britain, and they wear fancy uniforms and follow special rules. Having a British butler is like showing off a shiny, expensive toy to other rich people. There's a special school where people can learn how to be a butler, and it costs 2,700 to go there. Some butlers can make a lot of money, like 60,000 or even more, just for helping people do things around their home. But being a butler means you have to be really good at helping others and not thinking about yourself too much. A long time ago, butlers used to stay with one rich person for a very long time. Nowadays, because more rich people want butlers, they sometimes change jobs and help different people. This can make the older butlers who have been doing this job for a long time a bit sad. Being a good butler means you have to really like helping people and think it's a beautiful thing to do."},{"instruction":"Determine the sentiment: I heard this film was much more stylistic than the films director Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch) had directed before, the problem is, it is possibly too stylistic.

Teams Now Operate Under a Concussion Management Protocol It happens dozens of times in every N.F.L. game. There is a fierce collision, or perhaps a running back is slammed to the ground. Most of the time, all the players rise to their feet uneventfully. Other times, as the pileup unravels, a player gets up slowly. His gait may be unsteady. For decades in the N.F.L., the operative term for the situation was that someone “got dinged.” It was a cute, almost harmless-sounding description of what was often a concussion or a worrying subconcussive blow to the head. But with the N.F.L. agreeing to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to settle a lawsuit brought by about 5,000 former players who said the league hid from them the dangers of repeated hits to the head, a backpedaling league has corrected its lingo and hastily amended its methodology. The N.F.L. now has a concussion management protocol, outlined in an inches-thick document that commands teams to institute a specific, detailed game-day and postconcussion course of action. Once, the treatment of players with head injuries varied from team to team and could be haphazard. Beginning last season, all players suspected of having a head injury — should they lose consciousness from a collision or experience symptoms like a headache, dizziness or disorientation — were required to go through the concussion protocol system. It features a broad cast: a head-injury spotter in the press box, athletic trainers on the bench, doctors and neuro-trauma specialists on the sideline and experts in neuro-cognitive testing in the locker room. The system is far from foolproof — players with serious symptoms remain in games. But as the N.F.L. grapples with a sobering threat to the welfare of its work force, not to mention a public-relations nightmare, the new concussion protocol is meant to establish a systemic, itemized policy on how potential brain injuries should be handled. Based on multiple interviews in the last three months with athletic trainers, players, doctors and head-injury specialists associated with the Giants, the following is a window into how the concussion protocol is designed to work on one team. “Before the season begins, I make it a point to tell the players that we’re never going to use the word ‘dinged’ again,” said Ronnie Barnes, the Giants’ senior vice president for medical services, who has been with the team since 1980. “It’s a traumatic brain injury. I say to the players, ‘Each time you get a concussion, you’ve injured your brain.’ ” Perhaps the most novel part of the new protocol is the advent of a head-injury spotter in an upper-level booth at every stadium. The spotter is a seasoned athletic trainer who is selected, trained and paid by the N.F.L. Also in the spotter’s booth are a video monitor and a video operator who can instantly replay a game sequence to scrutinize the mechanism of a potential head injury. The spotter watches both teams and can communicate directly with the athletic trainers and doctors on the field via telephones that ring on the benches and walkie-talkies that are wired to earpieces. Jim Gossett, the spotter for Giants games at MetLife Stadium and an athletic trainer at Columbia for more than 30 years, said he looked for players who appear out of sync. “It might be a player whose balance seems a little off, or he might be shaking his head after a hit,” Gossett said. “Sometimes it’s just someone adjusting his helmet over and over. “That’s when I call down and say to the people on the sideline: ‘You might want to check so-and-so.’ Or ‘No. 26 doesn’t look right.’ ” While the spotter is primarily looking for big hits that may lead to head or neck injuries, he also helps if a player sustains another kind of injury. As often as 15 to 20 times a game, the spotter tags videotapes of plays in which an injury has occurred or one is suspected. The videos are sent to the sideline, where they are viewed on a computer monitor behind the team’s bench. If alerted by the spotter, the team’s athletic trainers usually approach the players first. Barnes said that in a game on Nov. 23, he approached the team’s wide receivers coach to get a player removed from the field so he could be examined. (Confidentially laws prohibit Barnes from identifying a player unless the player consents to discuss his injury.) The spotter is not the only person watching for something that looks irregular on the field. In a typical game, about 10 Giants doctors and athletic trainers are on the sideline. Frequently, the symptoms are obvious, as when a player does not get up off the ground for a few seconds. In 2011, Giants long snapper Zak DeOssie was kneed in the head making a tackle on a punt, and he was prone and motionless on the turf for about six seconds before rising to his feet. When DeOssie reached the sideline, Barnes approached and said, “You’re out of the game.” Answered DeOssie: “On whose authority?” DeOssie began yelling and arguing. “I felt fine, like nothing had happened,” DeOssie said this month. “I was absolutely convinced I hadn’t been knocked out.” DeOssie did not return to play, and the next day he saw the tape of the play in question. “I went to Ronnie Barnes and thanked him,” DeOssie said. “Sometimes, as a player, you have to be protected from yourself.” DeOssie’s case involved a quick and, in Barnes’s view, obvious medical decision. Not everything is as cut and dried. No two concussions are alike. Under the new concussion protocol, a player suspected of having a head injury is interviewed and put through a battery of tests on the bench by a team doctor. Joining the examination is a neurologist or neurosurgeon hired by the league and not directly affiliated with the team. There are two of these league doctors, known as independent neuro-consultants, assigned to every game — one on each sideline. The initial questioning of the player is fairly standard: What quarter is it? Who scored last? Do you have a headache? Dizziness? Nausea? The doctors also put the player through exercises meant to test his balance and cognitive skills. Sometimes, the doctors simply have the player wait on the bench so he can be observed. “The athletic trainers, who are around these guys six or eight hours a day, can usually spot if someone is not acting normally,” said Dr. James Kinderknecht, the Giants’ sideline physician who most often conducts the initial evaluation. Dr. Philip Stieg, the neurosurgeon-in-chief at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, often works Giants games at MetLife Stadium as one of the N.F.L. neuro-consultants. He said that the sideline exam was not substantively different from one he would give patients in his office. “The major difference is that 80,000 people are in the background,” Stieg said. As the game progresses, a decision has to be made whether the player should re-enter the game or be taken to the quiet of the locker room, where he would receive a more thorough neuro-cognitive examination. The decision is known as the “Go or No Go” verdict. “Because if someone is taken back to the locker room, he’s probably not going to go back into the game,” Stieg said. Each doctor interviewed for this article said a consensus in the “Go or No Go” moment is usually reached easily and without disagreements. No one recalled discord. “Ninety percent of the time, it’s pretty obvious,” Kinderknecht said. “It’s not a whole lot different than talking to somebody who is intoxicated. You can tell.” But if it involved an elite player, the decision could make or break a team’s chances in the game. The final call, if there is a difference of opinion, falls to the team doctor, who is very likely an orthopedist or sports medicine specialist and not a neurologist. The doctors who work Giants game said that no team physician had overruled the recommendation of a league-assigned independent neuro-consultant in the two seasons since the concussion protocol was put in place. But the system established by the N.F.L may not, in every case, ensure the complete independence of the league-appointed neuro-consultant. Each of the principal Giants doctors, for example, is affiliated with the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, as are four of the five neuro-consultants who work Giants games. In that sense, the doctors are linked colleagues who may share bosses. Asked if the arrangement compromises the independent dynamic the process is trying to achieve, Stieg said: “I’ve never experienced any kind of pressure to get some player into a game. The N.F.L. told us, ‘We want you to be another set of eyes protecting the player.’ “I’m not paid enough, nor is there enough in this, that I would do something harmful to a patient that also negatively impacts my reputation, which I’ve built 30 years to acquire.” Dr. Nitin Sethi, a Columbia NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital neurologist who is another of the league-appointed doctors working Giants games, said he had not seen any threat to the integrity of the process. “We may be from some related institutions, but I haven’t seen any sort of obstruction,” he said. “They’ve given me a free hand.” The league-appointed Giants doctors work only home games; doctors based in other cities and affiliated with a variety of hospitals work the away games. For all the measures taken by the team and the league to sift out concussed players, those with concussions sometimes remain in games. They either purposely or unwittingly do not report their symptoms, and they successfully or involuntarily mask any physical reaction to the injury. Giants linebacker Jacquian Williams played the entire game in Seattle on Nov. 9, and a day later he reported having a headache. Tests confirmed a concussion, and Williams has not played since. He will be benched again this weekend. “It is disturbing when they show up after a game with concussion symptoms,” said Barnes, who was referring to cases he has seen over the years, not Williams’s situation. “They’ll say, ‘I took a hit and I didn’t think it was that bad, so I stayed in.’ “Since high school, some of these guys have had episodes where they’ve taken a hit and felt something but got through it. We have to change that way of thinking.” It is becoming more commonplace for players to self-report a head injury. The same day Williams played the entire game in Seattle, Giants running back Peyton Hillis approached a member of the medical staff to say that he wanted to be checked for a concussion. He was taken out of the game and a few days later was placed on injured reserve, ending his season. Players are also policing one another, tipping off the trainers that a teammate acted oddly in the huddle. Gossett said he had seen game officials alerting medical personnel as well. If a player is removed from the bench area because he is suspected of having a concussion, inside the locker room, a team doctor, an athletic trainer and the league-appointed neuro-consultant will give him a more thorough assessment. Since all the players take a series of neuro-cognitive tests, known as baseline testing, in the summer, the team can, in some cases, have the player take a version of those tests in the locker room and compare the scores. One tool is a software application designed for N.F.L. teams known as the X2 and used on portable touch-screen devices. The player is asked about his symptoms and taken through standardized neuro-cognitive questions — remembering and repeating up to six digits forward and back — and physical assessments not unlike tests that police officers give to drivers suspected of drunken driving. A player suspected of having a concussion, or clinically determined to have one, is not allowed to conduct news media interviews afterward and is instructed to avoid physical and mental activity. The player sees one of the league-appointed neurologists, usually two days after the game. When the player becomes symptom-free, he is required to follow a step-by-step recovery that begins with light physical exertion and gradually increases in intensity (as long as the activity does not cause concussion symptoms to return). The Giants do not clear the player for a full practice or a game until he visits with a neurologist a second time. Many players are back within a week. Some can miss months. “I tell every player I see about the short-term ramifications and things like chronic traumatic encephalopathy,” the neurologist Sethi said, referring to the progressive degenerative disease that has been found in the brains of multiple dead football players and athletes with a history of repetitive brain trauma. Sethi continued: “They listen. I’ve found that a lot of them know about C.T.E. and are worried about it.” In the 1980s, when Barnes suspected that a player had a concussion, he would lock the player’s helmet in a trunk to keep him from re-entering the game. Some other players rested on the bench for a quarter or a half and, if cleared by doctors, they would resume playing. “We don’t do that anymore, which is good,” Barnes said. Now in his 35th season in the N.F.L., Barnes sees that as progress, but two years into the league’s elaborate concussion management protocol, he admits that the process needs to evolve. “We really need more education for the players so they know to report their symptoms and not consider playing with them,” Barnes said. “Players are more aware, but I want all of them to come to us and say: ‘I have a headache. I saw stars on that hit.’ “I want the players to take it more seriously. That’s why I refer to it as a traumatic brain injury. I want to be sure they hear that.” A version of this article appears in print on November 30, 2014, on page SP1 of the New York edition with the headline: Concussions, by the New Book.

Its origin is attributed to English author Horace Walpole, with his 1764 novel \\"The Castle of Otranto\\", subtitled (in its second edition) \\"A Gothic Story.\\" The effect of Gothic fiction feeds on a pleasing sort of terror, an extension of Romantic literary pleasures that were relatively new at the time of Walpole's novel. It originated in England in the second half of the 18th century and had much success in the 19th, as witnessed by Mary Shelleys \\"Frankenstein\\" and the works of Edgar Allan Poe. Another well known novel in this genre, dating from the late Victorian era, is Bram Stokers \\"Dracula\\". The name \\"Gothic\\" refers to the (pseudo)-medieval buildings, emulating Gothic architecture, in which many of these stories take place. This extreme form of romanticism was very popular in England and Germany. The English Gothic novel also led to new novel types such as the German \\"Schauerroman\\" and the French \\"Georgia\\". - Karma to Burn, sometimes known as K2B, is a desert rock/stoner rock band from Morgantown, West Virginia comprising guitarist William Mecum, bassist Eric Clutter, and drummer Evan Devine. The band are noted for their uncompromising, mostly instrumental sound. - Gothic rock (also referred to as goth rock or simply goth) is a musical subgenre of post-punk and alternative rock that formed during the late 1970s. Gothic rock bands grew from the strong ties they had to the English punk rock and emerging post-punk scenes. Proto-gothic bands include Siouxsie and the Banshees, Joy Division, Bauhaus and the Cure. - Gothic metal (or goth metal) is a fusion genre combining the heaviness of heavy metal with the dark atmospheres of gothic rock. The music of gothic metal is diverse with bands known to adopt the gothic approach to different styles of heavy metal music. The genre originated during the early 1990s in Europe originally as an outgrowth of death-doom, a fusion of death metal and doom metal. Lyrics are generally dark and introspective with inspiration from gothic fiction as well as personal experiences. - Sirenian Shores is an EP by the Norwegian gothic metal band Sirenia . It includes a remix of \`\` Save Me from Myself '' ( from the second album An Elixir for Existence ) , an acoustic version of \`\` Meridian '' ( from the first album At Sixes and Sevens ) , and three new songs : \`\` Sirenian Shores '' , \`\` Obire Mortem '' and a cover of Leonard Cohen 's \`\` First We Take Manhattan '' . The EP was released on 11 October 2004 by Napalm Records . - Symphonic metal is a subgenre of metal music which combines the characteristics of this genre, such as heavy drums and guitars, with different elements of classical music including symphonic instruments, choirs and on occasion, a full symphony orchestra. Keyboards reminiscent of power metal also often find a dominant place in this subgenre. Symphonic metal bands often feature classically trained female vocalists, giving rise to the nickname opera metal or operatic metal, and it is not uncommon for them to feature a second vocalist performing growls, a more common characteristic of gothic metal. Perhaps the most typical and prominent examples of symphonic metal bands are Finnish band Nightwish, Dutch bands Within Temptation, Delain and Epica, and Swedish band Therion, all four of which place a large focus on elements prevalent in film scores on top of the more basic classical components utilized more widely in the genre. - An Elixir for Existence is the second studio album by the Norwegian gothic metal band \\"Sirenia\\", released in 2004. The album follows in the same vein as the previous \\"At Sixes and Sevens\\", but includes a new female vocalist, Henriette Bordvik. - Falkenbach is a viking metal group from Germany that is signed to \\"Prophecy Productions\\". The name means \\"\\"Falconbrook\\"\\" in German. The one permanent member is Vratyas Vakyas (real name Markus Tümmers). They are one of the very first Viking metal bands, starting in 1989, with their first release that same year. - Stoner rock or stoner metal is a musical subgenre which combines elements of heavy metal, psychedelic rock, acid rock, doom metal, and blues rock. The term desert rock is often used interchangeably with the term \\"stoner rock\\" to describe this genre; however, not all stoner rock bands would fall under the descriptor of \\"desert rock.\\" Stoner rock is typically slow-to-mid tempo and features a heavily distorted, groove laden bass-heavy sound, melodic vocals, and \\"retro\\" production. The genre emerged during the early-1990s and was pioneered foremost by the Californian bands Kyuss and Sleep. - Jennifer Jean Warnes (born March 3, 1947) is an American singer, songwriter, arranger and record producer. Famous for her compositions, interpretations and her extensive repertoire as a vocalist on movie soundtracks, she was also a close friend and collaborator of Canadian singer-songwriter and poet Leonard Cohen. - Abigor is an Austrian atmospheric black metal band formed in 1993. They are named after an upper demon of war in Christian demonology. - Brant Bjork (born March 19, 1973) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and producer from Palm Desert, California. He is perhaps best known as the drummer and founder of the influential Californian stoner rock band Kyuss. Bjork played in Vista Chino, along with former Kyuss vocalist John Garcia. Until October 2014 when Nick Oliveri announced that there was a falling out and that Bjork and Garcia would continue working on their solo projects. He is one of the more notable figures in the stoner rock and Palm Desert scenes. - Monster Magnet is an American stoner rock band. Hailing from Red Bank, New Jersey, the group was founded by Dave Wyndorf (vocals and guitar), John McBain (guitar) and Tim Cronin (vocals and drums). The band first went by the names \\"Dog of Mystery\\", \\"Airport 75\\", \\"Triple Bad Acid\\" and \\"King Fuzz\\" before finally settling on \\"Monster Magnet\\", taken from the name of a 1960s toy made by Wham-O, which Wyndorf liked when he was a child.<ref name=\\"http://www.monstermagnet.net/bio.htm\\"></ref> - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia. - Death-doom is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal. It combines the slow tempos and pessimistic or depressive mood of doom metal with the deep growling vocals and double kick drumming of death metal. The genre emerged in the mid-1980s and gained a certain amount of popularity during the 1990s, but had become less common by the turn of the 21st century. In turn, death/doom gave rise to the closely related genre of funeral doom as well as to the more melodic and romantic gothic metal. - \\"First We Take Manhattan\\" is a song written by Leonard Cohen. It was originally recorded by Jennifer Warnes on her 1986 Cohen tribute album \\"Famous Blue Raincoat\\", which consisted entirely of songs written or co-written by Cohen. - Leonard Norman Cohen (September 21, 1934 November 7, 2016) was a Canadian singer, songwriter, musician, poet, novelist, and painter. His work mostly explored religion, politics, isolation, sexuality, and personal relationships. Cohen was inducted into both the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame as well as the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He was a Companion of the Order of Canada, the nation's highest civilian honor. In 2011, Cohen received one of the Prince of Asturias Awards for literature and the ninth Glenn Gould Prize. - Hard rock is a loosely defined subgenre of rock music that began in the mid-1960s, with the garage, psychedelic and blues rock movements. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with pianos and keyboards. - Power metal is a subgenre of heavy metal combining characteristics of traditional metal with speed metal, often within symphonic context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a more uplifting sound, instead of the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in styles such as doom metal and death metal. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally \\"powerful\\" sound. The term was first used in the middle of the 1980s and refers to two different but related styles: the first pioneered and largely practiced in North America with a harder sound similar to speed metal, and a later more widespread and popular style based in Europe (especially Scandinavia, Germany, Greece and Italy), South America (especially Brazil and Argentina) and Japan, with a lighter, more melodic sound and frequent use of keyboards. - Napalm Records is an Austrian independent record label focused on heavy metal and hard rock. Originally, Napalm focused mainly on black metal bands such as Abigor and Summoning and folk metal bands such as Falkenbach and Vintersorg. Later on, the label expanded its roster by adding gothic metal, symphonic metal, power metal, doom metal, and metalcore bands, as well as stoner rock acts Monster Magnet, Karma to Burn, and Brant Bjork. Napalm has its own publishing house named Iron Avantgarde Publishing. - Folk metal is a fusion genre of heavy metal music and traditional folk music that developed in Europe during the 1990s. It is characterised by the widespread use of folk instruments and, to a lesser extent, traditional singing styles (for example, Dutch Heidevolk, Danish Sylvatica and Spanish Stone of Erech). It also sometimes features soft instrumentation influenced by folk rock. - Doom metal is an extreme style of heavy metal music that typically uses slower tempos, low-tuned guitars and a much \\"thicker\\" or \\"heavier\\" sound than other metal genres. Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal with songs such as \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"Children of the Grave\\", \\"Electric Funeral\\" and \\"Into the Void\\". During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands from England (Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General), the United States (Pentagram, Saint Vitus, Trouble) and Sweden (Candlemass, Count Raven) defined doom metal as a distinct genre. - Metalcore is a broad fusion genre of extreme metal and hardcore punk. The word is a blend of the names of the two genres. Among other genres blending metal and hardcore, such as crust punk and grindcore, metalcore is noted for its use of breakdowns, which are slow, intense passages that are conducive to moshing. Pioneering metalcore bandssuch as Integrity, Earth Crisis and Converge, all of which had formed by 1990are described as leaning more toward hardcore, with their style sometimes being called metallic hardcore, whereas later bandssuch as Killswitch Engage, All That Remains, As I Lay Dying, Bullet for My Valentine, and Parkway Drive are described as leaning more towards metal. Pantera (who influenced Trivium, Atreyu, Bleeding Through and Unearth) and Sepultura have been particularly influential to the development of metalcore in the 2000s, which saw many bands in the genre achieve considerable commercial success. - Vintersorg (\\"Winter Sorrow\\" in English) is a Swedish band from Skellefteå, formed in 1994 under the name Vargatron (Wolfthrone in English). Musically, Vintersorg has covered a wide number of heavy metal genres; while the band is mostly rooted in extreme metal styles, particularly black metal and Viking/folk metal, it has also expanded into progressive metal and avant-garde metal. Lyrically, the band deals with topics on fantasy, mythology, nature, the cosmos, and metaphysics. Vintersorg means \\"Winter Sorrow,\\" but the name was taken from The Legend of the Ice People series by Margit Sandemo, where the character Vintersorg is the son of a great pagan leader. - Black metal is an extreme subgenre and subculture of heavy metal music. Common traits include fast tempos, a shrieking vocal style, heavily distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, raw (lo-fi) recording, unconventional song structures, and an emphasis on atmosphere.

Director Martin Scott showcases his futile attempt at crafting a heart-wrenching drama, but the end result is a tedious, disorganized mess that leaves the audience groaning for the film to end. The plot, or rather, the lack of it, unfolds like a labyrinth of convoluted events that seem neither connected nor coherent. The narrative is undeniably confusing as viewers must trudge through a maze of irrational character motivations and insignificant subplots. Instead of being gripped by a fascinating tale, one is more likely to feel burdened by the incessant weight of disparate storylines. Moreover, the characters that inhabit this film are barely recognizable reflections of humanity. They are largely one-dimensional, with flimsy backstories barely providing the audience with any basis for empathy. Poor dialogue only further highlights these gaping flaws, and despite talented actors attempting to salvage this shipwreck, they inevitably succumb to the lackluster script and weak character development. Furthermore, the cinematography is remarkably bland, with repetitive shots that leave no lingering impact. The visuals are largely uninspired, squandering an opportunity to alleviate the film's monotonous pacing. Instead, these underwhelming visuals merely add to the audience's sense of ennui. To top it all off, the editing is utterly disjointed, with awkward transitions that disrupt any semblance of narrative flow. Scenes bleed into each other haphazardly, leaving viewers grappling to maintain any sense of connection to the story. Coupled with a somber, almost funereal score that consistently drags down the mood with no respite, it becomes clear that \\"Downfall of Dreams\\" missed several crucial marks. In conclusion, \\"Downfall of Dreams\\" is an unmitigated disaster that ultimately falls victim to a weak plot, hollow characters, and lackluster technical elements. Although intended as a poignant drama, the film delivers an experience that is a far cry from evocative or engaging. Sadly, the most redeeming aspect of the film may be the relief felt when the end credits finally roll."},{"instruction":"Definition: Convert a disfluent question to a proper question.

In a place called the United Kingdom, which is really far away from here, some people decided to dress up as \\"creepy clowns\\" and scare others just for fun.

As of 2010, the most efficient yellow phosphor is still the YAG phosphor, with less than 10% Stoke shift loss. Losses attributable to internal optical losses due to re-absorption in the LED chip and in the LED packaging itself account typically for another 10% to 30% of efficiency loss. Currently, in the area of phosphor LED development, much effort is being spent on optimizing these devices to higher light output and higher operation temperatures. For instance, the efficiency can be raised by adapting better package design or by using a more suitable type of phosphor. Conformal coating process is frequently used to address the issue of varying phosphor thickness.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

So, after you look at the cat's coat to see if it's long and silky like a Balinese cat, you should check a couple more things to make sure it's truly a Balinese kitty. 1. Look at the cat's body shape: Balinese cats have a slim, graceful body with long legs and a long tail. They're like ballerinas, moving smoothly and elegantly. 2. Check the cat's head shape: Balinese kitties have a wedge-shaped head, which means it looks a bit like a triangle, with big, pointy ears on top. 3. Look at the cat's eyes: Balinese cats have beautiful, almond-shaped blue eyes that look like pretty jewels. 4. Check out the cat's personality: Balinese cats are usually very friendly, smart, and talkative (meaning they like to meow to communicate with you). They love being with people and are very playful.

Reasoning: 1. A butterfly starts as an egg: This marks the beginning of the life cycle of a butterfly. 2. The egg hatches: The embryo develops within the egg and eventually hatches. 3. A larva emerges: The larva, also known as a caterpillar, emerges from the egg. 4. The larva eats and grows: The caterpillar feeds on leaves and other plant parts, gaining nutrients and growing larger. 5. The larva sheds its skin: As the caterpillar grows, it sheds its outer skin to accommodate its increasing size. 6. The larva enters a chrysalis: When the caterpillar is ready to transform, it enters a transitional phase called the pupal stage, during which it creates a protective casing called a chrysalis. 7. The pupa grows inside the chrysalis: The pupa, or the transitional stage between the larva and adult form, starts to grow within the chrysalis. The pupa undergoes cellular changes and physical restructuring. 8. The adult butterfly exits the chrysalis: Once the development is complete, the adult butterfly breaks out of the chrysalis and emerges. 9.

For weeks prior to the event I kept experiencing ‘visual disturbances.’ I felt when I was reading a newspaper or book a sense that my eyes were crossing. I’d feel aware right before it would occur and I would rush to look in a mirror only to discover my eyes were not crossing. I informed my OB who blamed it on the blood vessels in my eyes enlarging due to pregnancy. Ummm ok. You know more than me. Later I was told by a surgeon what I was experiencing was ‘textbook’ for the passing of blood clots through my occipital area of the brain! The feeling would eventually subside. I awoke one morning feeling ‘kind of fuzzy’ headed. Like I had slept too hard. I sat with my husband at the kitchen table for our morning coffee and newspaper and for no reason I could imagine I was unable to swallow my coffee and it dribbled out the left side of my mouth. My husband asked me what was going on and I apparently told him, I was ‘stroking’ out. He got up from the table assuming I was OK and went off to take his morning shower. While in the shower it occurred to him something might not be right. He came back to the table where I was struggling to lift myself from the chair. I put my hands on the table to lift my body and my left hand kept sliding off the edge. He finally got behind me and tried to lift me under my arms and I crumbled to the floor.

It does not provide information about specific features or aspects of the app that the reviewer dislikes or finds unhelpful. 3. Absence of context: The review does not mention the app's name or purpose. There is no way to assess the usefulness or quality of the app based solely on the description \\"faltu app.\\" 4. No alternative recommendations: A helpful negative review might provide alternative suggestions to help users choose better options in the marketplace.

The album was later mastered at Sterling Sound and Masterdisk. During the sessions, Morton had Johansen record his vocals several times and incorporated sound effects such as gongs, gunshots, and feminine choruses. In a report on the album's progress for Melody Maker, journalist Lenny Kaye wrote that they were taking more time than they had on their first record, \\"bringing in occasional strings and horns, following Shadow's advice not 'to settle'.\\" Morton and the band shared an affinity for each other, as he found the group's energy in the studio refreshing, while Johansen was fond of Morton and the \\"looser\\" feel he provided for their music. \\"That man is completely unpretentious\\", Johansen said of the producer. \\"He doesn't think he ever did a marvellous thing in his life.\\" The New York Dolls and Morton produced little original material together. To complete the album, they had to record cover songs and re-record some of the band's earlier demos; \\"Babylon\\", \\"Who Are the Mystery Girls?\\", \\"It's Too Late\\" and \\"Human Being\\" had been recorded by the band in March 1973 as demos for Mercury before the label signed them. They had also recorded demos of two songs written by guitarist Sylvain Sylvain, \\"Teenage News\\" and \\"Too Much Too Soon\\", before working with Morton, but neither was considered for the album. Sylvain said he confronted Morton about this decision, recalling he had been in a rush: \\"He was too quick with me and said that he'd been told only to listen to David Johansen and Johnny Thunders.

Plot title: Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem Movie plot: Space wizard hires interplanetary mercenaries to kidnap alien smurf rock stars. Said rock stars are held captive using brainwashing, cognitive implants, and cosmetic surgery; guarded by cyborgs. Super fan-boy jumps into his space guitar and follows mercenaries to Earth, and lives amongst the downtrodden as he waits for a chance to rescue them. Chance comes in a super concert funded by the space wizard, in which the fan-boy glides down in a jet glider and shoots cognitive implants off the alien smurf rock stars. All but the female are saved and the band runs off, (Space wizard holds up a super arm to block the shot of the fan-boy, and keeps the device from being William Tell'd off of her). As the band escapes they are pursued and shot at by the cyborgs. A stray lazer bullet is deflected by one of the aliens, and hits the fan-boy. Cyborgs can't drive and run into a semi, kersploding their car, and causing them to survive all Terminator style. The female is then whisked away and forced to dress pretty at various events. She is saved by the rock stars while the artists of the soundtrack are defeated in musical kombat. Being taken to their alien hideout, she is introduced to the fan-boy, and he shows off toys of their alien smurf rock star selves. Alien smurf rock stars are all WTF, and his psychotropic blood causes a hallucination, in which he and the female trip out and shows what a date would have been like (enter best song on the album). Fan-boy dies, and sadness ensues. They go out into the world, free from the space wizard, and bury the fan-boy under a tree. Fan-boy evolves into naked ghost fan-boy. Driving along she finds a clear card invitation to an address not far from where they are. The go inside and discover it's the space wizards house. Inside they find the story of the space wizard, and realize he's all super evil, and old. They are captured, and taken to the basement, where they find the machine he was going to use to gain control of the universe. Placing the female into the machine, as well as...

Tornadoes have occurred in every month of the year and a secondary smaller peak also occurs during autumn, especially October. The Oklahoma City metropolitan area is one of the most tornado-prone major cities in the world, with about 150 tornadoes striking within the city limits since 1890.

This statement highlights a significant difference between Daniel Bernoulli and earlier members of his famed mathematical family, particularly in comparison to his uncles Johann Bernoulli and Jacob Bernoulli, who were embroiled in bitter rivalries in the world of mathematics. The lack of jealousy exhibited by Daniel Bernoulli is evidenced by his collaborative work with his younger brother, Johann (II) Bernoulli – also an accomplished mathematician. Instead of competing against his sibling, Daniel sought to join forces, which ultimately contributed to the impressive legacy of the Bernoulli family. The prominent Bernoulli family was a major force in the development of mathematics and other scientific fields in the 18th century, consistently pushing the boundaries of human understanding. In spite of the rivalry and animosity between certain family members, their combined efforts yielded numerous contributions and accomplishments in the fields of calculus, probability theory, fluid dynamics, and other areas of applied mathematics. Unlike his uncles, who appeared to be driven by envy and internal competition, Daniel Bernoulli fostered a more positive and collaborative atmosphere within his family. By working together with his brother, Johann (II) Bernoulli, Daniel demonstrated a more constructive approach to the advancement of science and mathematics. This willingness to collaborate not only strengthened the bond between the siblings but was also valuable to the progression of their respective scientific careers. Moreover, this collaborative approach helped to maintain the Bernoulli family's unparalleled reputation in the scientific community. The alliance between Daniel and Johann (II) Bernoulli ensured that future generations of the family continued to thrive and contribute substantially to the world of mathematics, with a focus on cooperation rather than rivalry. In summary, Daniel Bernoulli's inclination to work collaboratively with his brother Johann (II) Bernoulli truly sets him apart from his uncles, Johann and Jacob Bernoulli, who were plagued by jealousy and rivalry amongst themselves. By putting family bonds and a shared passion for mathematics above personal ambitions, Daniel Bernoulli helped foster a spirit of cooperation within the family, which played a crucial role in the continuation of the Bernoulli legacy within the scientific community."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Does Enterprise have more or less fusion reactions in the shell around its core than Vader does? Two stars have just been discovered that are identical in terms of chemical composition. The scientist who discovered them was given the right to name them, and he chose the names Enterprise and Vader. As said before, these stars are very similar, but the main difference is that Vader is a red giant, and Enterprise is not. Scientists are very eager to study these two newly discovered stars and see if they can learn anything new from them. Hint: A red giant star is a star with a mass like the Sun that is in the last phase of its life, when Hydrogen fusion reactions in the core decrease due to the lack of fuel. With the gravitational collapse of the core, the fusion reactions now occur in a shell surrounding the core. The outer layer of the star expands enormously up to 1000 times the size of the Sun. When the Sun becomes a red giant, its volume will include the orbit of Mercury and Venus and maybe even Earth. The increased size increases the luminosity even though the outer layer cools to only 3000 K or so. The cooler outer layer causes it to be a red star. After a few more million years, the star evolves into a white dwarf-planetary nebula system. Answer:","output":"Enterprise has less fusion reactions in the shell around its core than Vader does. Step 1: Understand the information given about the two stars Enterprise and Vader are two stars with identical chemical compositions, but Vader is a red giant while Enterprise is not. Step 2: Recall the characteristics of a red giant A red giant is a star in the last phase of its life, with decreased hydrogen fusion reactions in the core due to lack of fuel. The fusion reactions now occur in a shell surrounding the core, and the outer layer of the star expands enormously. Step 3: Make a comparison between Enterprise and Vader Since Vader is a red giant and Enterprise is not, it can be inferred that Enterprise is in an earlier phase of its life, likely with hydrogen fusion reactions still occurring in its core. This means there are fewer fusion reactions happening in a shell surrounding its core compared to Vader, a red giant with fusion reactions occurring in a shell around its core. So, Enterprise has less fusion reactions in the shell around its core than Vader does."},{"instruction":"The accomplices, organisers or sponsors of this terrible crime must not be allowed to avoid responsibility.

Această frază se referă la importanța de a nu permite persoanelor implicate într-un delict grav să evite consecințele faptelor lor. Ca AI asistent, voi elabora în continuare pe tema acestei fraze. Din punct de vedere legal, justiția penală cuprinde diferite etape și elemente care contribuie la dezvăluirea și pedepsirea celor vinovați de infracțiuni. Când vine vorba de acte grave precum actele teroriste, crimele în masă sau alte fapte extrem de violente, este deosebit de important să se asigure că implicarea întregii rețele, inclusiv organizatorii, complicii și sponsorii acestor acte, este luată în considerare. Ancheta penală este primul pas esențial în abordarea acestui tip de cazuri. Prin investigații riguroase, organele de urmărire penală trebuie să colecteze toate probele care să le permită a identifica persoanele implicate în procesul criminal, precum și să stabilească relațiile dintre diversele elemente ale activității criminale. În acest sens, cooperarea internațională ar putea fi de asemenea crucială, dat fiind că infracțiunile grave pot avea dimensiuni transfrontaliere. După identificarea vinovaților, următoarea etapă presupune formularea acuzațiilor corespunzătoare. Procurorii au rolul de a prezenta în fața judecătorilor probele care să demonstreze vinovăția organizatorilor, complicilor și sponsorilor delictului. În plus, trebuie să dovedească fără echivoc că aceștia au avut intenția de a săvârși actul și de a socoti gravitatea faptei. Astfel, pot solicita sentințe corespunzătoare pentru fiecare dintre cei implicați. Există, de asemenea, prevederi legale prin care justiția se poate orienta spre recuperarea prejudiciilor cauzate de activitatea criminală și să indemneze victimele. Legea permite confiscarea bunurilor și a resurselor financiare ale inculpaților, atunci când acestea reprezintă produse sau consecințe ale faptelor comise. În concluzie, pentru a nu permite organizatorilor, complicilor și sponsorilor unui delict grav să evite responsabilitatea, este esențial ca mecanismele legale să funcționeze eficient și coerent, cu un accent deosebit pe investigarea rețelelor criminale și pe cooperarea internațională."},{"instruction":"Das Parlament wird lediglich befragt, außer was die Anwendungsverfahren betrifft.

The then-mayor and his agency heads put their emphasis on a speedy cleanup and return to normalcy. In that, they were remarkably successful, clearing the site in less than 10 months. Unfortunately, the price is now being paid by thousands of workers who have developed lung and other ailments. The evolution of this tragedy was described by Anthony DePalma in The Times and other analysts. In the immediate aftermath of the collapse of the twin towers, it was understandable that emergency workers would rush in in hopes of rescuing victims, and hang the precautions. But as rescue operations turned into a search for remains and then debris-removal, workers continued to ignore warnings from both city and federal officials that respirators should be worn at the site. There was some understandable delay rounding up enough of the recommended respirators. But there was no excuse for a lag in fitting the respirators to individual faces and training the workers to use them. The more fundamental problem was that many workers hate to wear respirators because they can be uncomfortable and inhibit talking. There was also a certain macho disdain, especially when authorities were putting out mixed messages about the safety of downtown air. By late October, only 29 percent of workers at ground zero were wearing the respirators, and even Mayor Giuliani visited without wearing one, setting a terrible example. This was a case where workers should have been protected against their own destructive instincts. Critics often blame the federal government — particularly the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency. But a federal district judge, in allowing a suit against the city and other defendants to go forward, noted that city agencies had explicitly assumed responsibility for developing and enforcing health and safety standards, including the use of respirators. The suit may shed more light on who, if anyone, can be held liable. But the clear lesson is that Mr. Giuliani’s administration failed in its duty to protect the workers at ground zero.

The Belgium international has in the past been reluctant to speculate on where his future may lie, but he is now prepared to admit that a move to England would be his preferred choice. \\"That is the championship where I think I can express myself the best,\\" Hazard told Sport Foot Magazine. \\"I think I can learn more there. It is difficult to explain why, it is just a feeling I get. \\"The level of the matches, the atmosphere in the stadiums - that is all well above anything I have experienced in France, and that attracts me.\\" Hazard also says that a much-touted switch to Arsenal would appeal to him. He added: \\"Of course. It is always more fun to play for a team that plays like they do. Arsenal also have a great coach and French players. \\"There are several clubs that interest me in England, and Arsenal are one of them.\\" While he would favour a move to the Premier League, Hazard admits it would be difficult to snub a switch to Spain were the Primera Liga's leading lights to come calling. \\"I have never said that I want to go to Real Madrid, other people have said that for me,\\" said the 21-year-old. \\"But I'm not against the idea. Who doesn't dream of playing for Real Madrid? Or Barcelona? \\"I haven't closed the door on anyone. All the major divisions appeal to me: Spain, Italy etc. \\"But I believe, for now, that England would be ideal for me. \\"I appreciate that moving to one of the two biggest clubs in Spain would be difficult for a player of my age.\\"","output":"Lille playmaker Eden Hazard sees himself playing in the English Premier League in the near future, with top clubs like Arsenal, Tottenham, Chelsea, Real Madrid, and Barcelona expected to bid for his services.

Albom lived in Buffalo, New York for a little while until his family settled in Oaklyn, New Jersey which is close to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He grew up in a small, middle-class neighborhood from which most people never left. Albom was once quoted as saying that his parents were very supportive, and always used to say, \\"Don't expect your life to finish here. Context: Albom's breakthrough book came about after a friend of his viewed Morrie Schwartz's interview with Ted Koppel on ABC News Nightline in 1995, in which Schwartz, a sociology professor, spoke about living and dying with a terminal disease, ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease). Albom, who had been close with Schwartz during his college years at Brandeis, felt guilty about not keeping in touch so he reconnected with his former professor, visiting him in suburban Boston and eventually coming every Tuesday for discussions about life and death. Albom, seeking a way to pay for Schwartz's medical bills, sought out a publisher for a book about their visits. Although rejected by numerous publishing houses, Doubleday accepted the idea shortly before Schwartz's death, and Albom was able to fulfill his wish to pay Schwartz's bills. The book, Tuesdays with Morrie, was published in 1997, a small volume that chronicled Albom's time spent with his professor. The initial printing was 20,000 copies. As word of mouth grew, the book sales slowly increased and landed the book a brief appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show, nudging the book onto the New York Times bestseller's list in October 1997. It steadily climbed, reaching the number-one position six months later. It remained on the New York Times bestseller list for 205 weeks. One of the top selling memoirs of all time, Tuesdays With Morrie has sold over 14 million copies and has been translated into 45 languages. Oprah Winfrey produced a television movie adaptation by the same name for ABC, starring Hank Azaria as Albom and Jack Lemmon as Morrie. It was the most-watched TV movie of 1999 and won four Emmy Awards. Albom and playwright Jeffrey Hatcher later co-authored a two-man theater play that opened Off Broadway in the fall of 2001, starring Alvin Epstein as Morrie and Jon Tenney as Albom. Tuesdays With Morrie is regularly taught in high schools and universities around the world, and is also taught in some primary schools in Asia, due to its very simple writing. Albom started a private foundation with some of the proceeds, The Tuesdays With Mitch Foundation, to fund various charitable efforts. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects about this article: 1. Mitch Albom's journey to reconnecting with his former professor, Morrie Schwartz, and how it led to the creation of the book \\"Tuesdays with Morrie.\\" 2. The initial struggle of finding a publisher for the book and how it eventually became a bestseller, selling over 14 million copies and being translated into 45 languages. 3. The transformation of the book into different forms of media, including a television movie produced by Oprah Winfrey and a theater play. 4. The inclusion of \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" in various educational curricula around the world, and the impact it has on students. 5. The establishment of The Tuesdays With Mitch Foundation to support charitable efforts using some of the proceeds from the book.

Options: - unemployment - earn money - sleeping - relaxation - do nothing Let's think carefully first. Step-by-step reasoning process:","output":"Step 1: Analyze each option - Unemployment: Generally, unemployment is not considered a positive experience, as one may face financial difficulties and lack of purpose. - Earn money: Work itself is usually associated with earning money, so this option is not relevant to the question. - Sleeping: Sleep is important for maintaining health and wellbeing, but it doesn't directly tie in with work making you appreciate something. - Relaxation: Time away from work can involve relaxation, allowing a person to recharge and enjoy personal time. - Do nothing: While \\"do nothing\\" could be perceived as a break from work, it is not as specific as the relaxation option. Step 2: Determine which options are most relevant Based on the analysis, the most relevant options are relaxation and do nothing. Step 3: Choose the most accurate option Since \\"relaxation\\" is a more specific and positive option, the most appropriate answer to the question \\"Work can be a grind, it makes you appreciate times of what?\\" would be relaxation."},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to French: The prepatent period of C. petrowi was 19–25 days in five experimentally infected black bears.","output":"La période avant l'apparition des signes de C. petrowi était de 19 à 25 jours chez cinq ours noirs infectés de manière expérimentale.

They have a beaker of boiling water, a beaker of ice water, and a beaker of water at room temperature. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: If the students move the thermometer from one beaker to another and the mercury levels rise, is the temperature higher or lower? Hint: A thermometer is a device used to measure temperature. It is placed in contact with an object and allowed to reach thermal equilibrium with the object (they will have the same temperature). The operation of a thermometer is based on some property, such as volume, that varies with temperature. The most common thermometers contain liquid mercury, or some other liquid, inside a sealed glass tube. The liquid expands and contracts faster than the glass tube. Therefore, when the temperature of the thermometer increases, the liquid volume expands faster than the glass volume, allowing the liquid to rise in the tube. The positions of the liquid in the tube can then be calibrated for accurate temperature readings. Other properties that change with temperature can also be used to make thermometers; liquid crystal colors and electrical conductivity change with temperature, and are also relatively common thermometers. The answer to this question is:","output":"The temperature is higher when the mercury levels rise. This is because the liquid inside the thermometer, in this case, mercury, expands when the temperature increases. This expansion of the liquid causes the mercury to rise in the glass tube, indicating a higher temperature."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

He was the last Prime Minister to head his full administration from the House of Lords. Lord Robert Cecil was first elected to the House of Commons in 1854 and served as Secretary of State for India in Lord Derby's Conservative government from 1866 until his resignation in 1867 over its introduction of Benjamin Disraeli's Reform Bill that extended the suffrage to working-class men. In 1868 upon the death of his father, Cecil was elevated to the House of Lords. He entered the House of Commons as a Conservative on 22 August 1853, as MP for Stamford in Lincolnshire. He retained this seat until entering the peerage and it was not contested during his time as its representative. In his election address he opposed secular education and \\"ultramontane\\" interference with the Church of England which was \\"at variance with the fundamental principles of our constitution\\". He would oppose \\"any such tampering with our representative system as shall disturb the reciprocal powers on which the stability of our constitution rests\\". In 1867, after his brother Eustace complained of being addressed by constituents in a hotel, Cecil responded: \\"A hotel infested by influential constituents is worse than one infested by bugs. It's a pity you can't carry around a powder insecticide to get rid of vermin of that kind\\". In December 1856 Cecil began publishing articles for the Saturday Review, to which he contributed anonymously for the next nine years. From 1861 to 1864 he published 422 articles in it; in total the weekly published 608 of his articles. The Quarterly Review was the foremost intellectual journal of the age and of the twenty-six issues published between spring 1860 and summer 1866, Cecil had anonymous articles in all but three of them. He also wrote lead articles for the Tory daily newspaper the Standard. In 1859 Cecil was a founding co-editor of Bentley's Quarterly Review, with John Douglas Cook and Rev. William Scott; but it closed after four issues. Salisbury criticised the foreign policy of Lord John Russell, claiming he was \\"always being willing to sacrifice anything for peace... colleagues, principles, pledges... a portentous mixture of bounce and baseness... dauntless to the weak, timid and cringing to the strong\\". The lessons to be learnt from Russell's foreign policy, Salisbury believed, were that he should not listen to the opposition or the press otherwise \\"we are to be governed... by a set of weathercocks, delicately poised, warranted to indicate with unnerving accuracy every variation in public feeling\\". Secondly: \\"No one dreams of conducting national affairs with the principles which are prescribed to individuals. The meek and poor-spirited among nations are not to be blessed, and the common sense of Christendom has always prescribed for national policy principles diametrically opposed to those that are laid down in the Sermon on the Mount\\". Thirdly: \\"The assemblies that meet in Westminster have no jurisdiction over the affairs of other nations. Neither they nor the Executive, except in plain defiance of international law, can interfere [in the internal affairs of other countries]... It is not a dignified position for a Great Power to occupy, to be pointed out as the busybody of Christendom\\". Finally, Britain should not threaten other countries unless prepared to back this up by force: \\"A willingness to fight is the point d'appui of diplomacy, just as much as a readiness to go to court is the starting point of a lawyer's letter. It is merely courting dishonour, and inviting humiliation for the men of peace to use the habitual language of the men of war\\". Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What did he like to write about?","output":"Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury, liked to write about different things. He would write about his political views and opinions, like his stance on secular education and the Church of England, as well as the systems of representative government. He also wrote reviews and articles for publications like the Saturday Review and the Quarterly Review, where he shared his thoughts on various topics involving political issues and foreign policy. He often expressed his critique of other politicians' approaches, like Lord John Russell's foreign policy. He also liked to discuss principles of national affairs and international law. Essentially, he was very interested in politics, government, and international relations, and he used his writing to express his views on these subjects."},{"instruction":"Man on fire, is definitely one of the best drama/crime thrillers I have ever seen. Despite having a slow beginning the story is so amazingly complex and sensitive that it sticks together rather well. This is Denzel Washington's perfect role, in which he plays a body guard, called Creasy that is tormented by his past and is an alcoholic but never gives up on his duty to save his latest protégée, Pita. Dakota Fanning plays Pita, the very smart, enthusiastic little girl that loves so many things, and acts in a very convincing manner, she has a great future ahead of her. As I said the story is somewhat complicated, in order to fully understand it, you must watch it a couple of times. This film is made in two parts, there's the first hour, where everyone is happy, nothing's wrong, everyone's just living their lives happily until the kidnapping of Pita occurs and where Creasy is almost killed. And then there's the second part, the rest of the film, where suddenly everything becomes complicated and somewhat gruesome and disturbing, when Creasy's recovered from his severe injury and starts chasing and killing the numerous criminals and \\"La Hermamdad\\" that were responsible for the planning and execution of the kidnapping of Pita. Denzel Washington shows us his most up to date acting talents alongside many other talented actors which have a great future ahead of them. It is a real shame that this film hasn't been acknowledged enough, Washington really deserved another Oscar for his performance, and so did Fanning and the director. And even maybe the visual effects which were of very high quality. If you like excellent, slightly deranged, suspenseful thrillers, this is the one to see.

Train: The word \\"train\\" is a significant part of the sentence, as it is the subject. The sentence revolves around a train, a mode of transportation, and without this word, the meaning and context of the sentence would be lost. This primary subject helps build the foundation for the rest of the sentence. 2. Track: The word \\"track\\" plays a crucial role by providing context and information about where the train is located. It establishes the environment within which this sentence takes place. Train tracks are vital components in railway systems that provide guidance and support to the locomotion of trains. Without the word \\"track\\", the reader will not be able to visualize the train's maneuvering capability and position in its ecosystem. 3. Pulling: The word \\"pulling\\" is essential because it explains the action the train is taking. This verb is significant in understanding what the train is doing, which is moving into a station. This description of movement also indicates the train is connected to or 'pulling' something, most likely referring to its attached cars or compartments. Without this action, the sentence loses one of its primary focus points, and the meaning is incomplete. 4. Station: The term \\"station\\" is the final destination or point of focus in the sentence. It is necessary to understand where the train is heading since it helps shape the overall meaning and purpose of the sentence. A train station is a location where trains stop to pick up and drop off passengers or goods, making it a critical part of the transportation process. Without this word, the reader would not know where the train is moving towards or the objective behind its motion. In conclusion, the words \\"train,\\" \\"track,\\" \\"pulling,\\" and \\"station\\" collectively serve as the basis of this sentence's significance. Each term plays a different role, and they are vital to understanding the context, action, and direction of the train. While there are other words in the sentence, these four crucial elements are indispensable when it comes to grasping the overall meaning."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence about a restaurant with all the following attributes: name = Cocum, eatType = coffee shop, food = Indian, priceRange = cheap, customer rating = 5 out of 5, familyFriendly = yes","output":"Step 1: Identify the key elements of the task to include in the sentence: - Name: Cocum - Eat type: Coffee shop - Food: Indian - Price range: Cheap - Customer rating: 5 out of 5 - Family-friendly: Yes Step 2: Start forming the sentence by introducing the name and eat type: - Cocum is a coffee shop Step 3: Incorporate the type of food the coffee shop serves: - Cocum is a coffee shop offering Indian cuisine Step 4: Mention the price range of the restaurant: - Cocum is a coffee shop offering Indian cuisine at affordable prices Step 5: Include the customer rating: - Cocum is a highly-rated coffee shop offering Indian cuisine at affordable prices Step 6: Specify that the restaurant is family-friendly: - Cocum is a highly-rated, family-friendly coffee shop offering Indian cuisine at affordable prices Final sentence: Cocum is a highly-rated, family-friendly coffee shop offering Indian cuisine at affordable prices."},{"instruction":"Sentence 1: There is no need.

Gaston's determination to marry Belle leads him to bribe Monsieur D'Arque, the warden of the town's insane asylum, to have Maurice locked up if Belle refuses his marriage proposal. This demonstrates Gaston's arrogance and his inability to accept Belle's disinterest in him, as he is willing to go to extreme lengths to force her into a marriage she does not desire."},{"instruction":"Objective: How do you break a window?

The cult responsible for this act of terrorism was a Japanese doomsday group called Aum Shinrikyo, led by Shoko Asahara. Sarin, also known as GB, is a synthetic organophosphorus compound with the chemical formula (CH3)2CHO(CH3)2P(O)F. It was first developed in 1938 in Germany as a pesticide and later recognized as a potent chemical warfare agent due to its quick-acting and lethal nature. The gas works by inhibiting the proper functioning of an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase in the nervous system, leading to a build-up of acetylcholine, which causes uncontrollable muscle contractions, resulting in convulsions, paralysis, respiratory failure, and eventually death. In the early morning of March 20, 1995, Aum Shinrikyo members released sarin gas in five coordinated attacks on three crowded Tokyo subway lines. The cult members boarded trains and punctured bags containing the gas with sharpened umbrella tips or newspapers wrapped in plastic. The sarin gas spread through the train cars and stations, causing widespread panic and confusion. The attack resulted in the deaths of 13 people, left more than 50 others severely wounded, and caused temporary vision problems or other after-effects in approximately 1,000 people. The incident remains one of the deadliest acts of terrorism in Japan's history and generated global shockwaves about the risks of unconventional terrorist tactics. Following the Tokyo subway attack, a massive manhunt by Japanese authorities led to the arrest of several key Aum Shinrikyo members, including its leader Shoko Asahara. In 2004, Asahara was found guilty of masterminding the sarin gas attack and other crimes, and he was sentenced to death. He was executed by hanging in 2018, along with six other cult members who played significant roles in the attack and other crimes. The Tokyo subway sarin attack was a tragic and shocking event, emphasizing the importance of international cooperation and vigilance in combating terrorism and the potential misuse of chemical agents for malicious purposes."},{"instruction":"Bookmarked this place after seeing their pambazo torta listed in an issue of LV Weekly, as one of the Top 10 Mexican Meals of the city. I don't remember the ranking, but the description was enough to motivate me to seek this place out. I ordered the torta, and added on a mushroom quesadilla, based on another review. The quesadilla was a surprise- as others have said, I was initially surprised to see what was essentially a fried, folded tortilla, but after it cooled a bit, I took a bite. That first bite did not wow me. But after the second I took a third, and after the third, I found a mushroom. Jackpot! That thing is damn delicious when you actually get something in your bite that isn't just cheese. Wish the mushrooms were more plentiful, or more evenly distributed, because once you get that perfect bite, there's no going back. But back to the torta that originally brought me in. To say I was underwhelmed is an understatement. Even digging in right after I received my order, the bread was soggy to the point that it was difficult to eat with my hands. The bread appeared to be soaked in the grease from the chorizo, and I got orange all over my fingertips, hands, and mouth, simply trying to take a bite. I know better than to expect something healthy when I eat Mexican food, but this was overkill. What was most disappointing was the flavor: there really wasn't any. I could tell I was eating potatoes, and in addition to the grease, I stumbled upon some crumbles that let me know my meal contained chorizo, but nothing had flavor. I added salt, I added salsa, but there was no perking up this dish. I don't know how this torta made anyone's list of great foods, or if I simply received something other than what they usually serve- but this is not something I'd care to eat again. Many reviews mention the fabulous mole, and if I'm hungry and hankering for Mexican in the area in the future, I'll consider giving it a try. But for now, I'm going to be a bit more cautious about the food articles in LV Weekly. What is the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review is mostly negative. The reviewer was initially excited to try the pambazo torta but was ultimately disappointed by the soggy bread, lack of flavor, and excess grease. The mushroom quesadilla had some positive aspects, but the overall experience of the meal was underwhelming. The reviewer might consider giving the place another chance if they happen to be in the area, but their expectations have been tempered by their experience."},{"instruction":"Question: Process: - The bird picks a tree - The bird collects twigs and other refuse - The bird makes a flat base with twigs - The bird makes sides with twigs and other things - The bird adds softer material to the inside - The nest is done.

If the area is not proper for nesting, the bird may have difficulty finding suitable trees or enough twigs and other materials. This can directly affect the bird's ability to construct the nest. Indirectly, it may cause the bird to search a wider area for nesting materials, potentially expending more energy and time in the process.

Lawrence promptly ignores Brighton's commands when he meets Faisal. His knowledge and outspokenness pique the Prince's interest.Brighton advises Faisal to retreat to Yenbo after a major defeat, but Lawrence proposes a daring surprise attack on Aqaba which, if successful, would provide a port from which the British could offload much-needed supplies. While strongly fortified against a naval assault, the town is lightly defended on the landward side. He convinces Faisal to provide fifty men, led by a sceptical Sherif Ali.

Human resource experts say cultural differences explain why Asian companies try harder to preserve jobs in difficult times, which will prevent unemployment and may help Asian economies survive at a time of slowing exports. The East Asian attitude may also make it easier for companies to recover quickly from the economic downturn since they will not need to rehire or train new staff, but build up a more loyal and devoted group. \\"In the Confucian mindset, the right thing to do is to share the burden, which is the sense of collective responsibility.

The basic process of making a roux is not complicated, but it does require some attention and skill to achieve the desired result. Here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how to make the perfect roux: 1. Choose the fat: The most common fat used in making a roux is unsalted butter; however, you can also use other types of fat, such as oil, bacon grease, or duck fat. Pay attention to the flavor profile of your dish when choosing the fat, as it will have a direct impact on the final taste of your dish. 2. Measure the ingredients: A roux typically consists of equal parts fat and flour. For most recipes, 1/4 cup (4 tablespoons) of fat and 1/4 cup of all-purpose flour should suffice. 3. Heat the fat: In a heavy-bottomed saucepan or skillet, heat the chosen fat over medium-low heat. Be cautious not to let the fat burn or smoke, as it will affect the flavor of your roux. 4. Add the flour: Once the fat has melted and heated, add the flour gradually, whisking continuously to ensure that the mixture is smooth and lump-free. Combining the two ingredients with a whisk or wooden spoon is essential, as it will allow the flour to be thoroughly incorporated into the fat. 5. Cook the roux: The cooking time depends on the type of roux you desire. There are three main types of roux - white, blonde, and brown. Each type will have varying cooking times and require close monitoring. a) White roux: Cook the mixture for about 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly. At this stage, the roux will not yet have changed color, but the flour's raw taste should have dissipated. White roux is typically used for béchamel sauce, white gravies, and cream-based soups. b) Blonde roux: Cook the mixture for approximately 5 minutes or until the roux attains a light golden color. This type of roux is used for sauces like velouté, cheese sauces, or light-colored soups. c) Brown roux: Cook the mixture for approximately 15-20 minutes or until the roux reaches a deep, nutty brown color. Ensure that the heat is low to reduce the risk of burning. Brown roux is perfect for darker sauces like espagnole or gumbos. 6. Cool the roux slightly: After achieving the desired color, remove the pan from the heat and allow the roux to cool for a couple of minutes. 7. Gradually incorporate the liquid: The type of liquid used in your dish will depend on the specific recipe. Examples include milk, broth, or stock. Slowly add the liquid to your roux while constantly whisking to ensure a smooth, homogeneous, and lump-free mixture. 8. Simmer and thicken the sauce: Return the saucepan to medium heat and cook the mixture until the desired thickness is achieved. Be patient during this process, as the sauce will continue to thicken as it simmers. 9. Season to taste: Adjust the taste of your sauce or soup with salt, pepper, or other seasonings as per your preference and the dish you are making. 10. Strain the sauce (optional): If necessary, strain your sauce through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any remaining lumps and achieve a smoother consistency. By following these steps, you will have created a perfect roux tailored to your specific dish. Practice makes perfect when it comes to making roux, so don't hesitate to experiment and refine your skills over time."},{"instruction":"Choose from: A). Solid bedrock B). rivers C). mines D).

The first mourners showed up an hour early, exchanging hugs on the church steps. A steady stream of the Badger family’s loved ones followed. And then came the entire Stamford, Conn., fire department, about 70 firefighters dressed crisply in dark suits and not saying a word. Nearly 1,000 people were packed into the St. Thomas Episcopal Church in midtown by the time Madonna Badger rose to give a eulogy no mother should ever have to give. Badger stepped up to the lectern and glanced at the three caskets arranged in front of her. Her lips were trembling. The overflow crowd was silent. Then, choking back sobs, the fashion ad exec told them about her three daughters, who were killed in a Christmas Day inferno at her Connecticut mansion, along with her mom and dad. “My little girls are not gone from us entirely because my little girls are in my heart. Right here,” Badger said, motioning toward her chest. “And this is where they live.” Badger, flanked by church workers, had to walk around her girls’ mahogany caskets on her way to the dais. They sat side-by-side, topped with white and pink flowers. The mourners, including designer Calvin Klein, actor Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Badger’s estranged husband, Matthew, dissolved in tears as she reminisced about her “little girl tribe.” Badger described each of them one by one, stopping several times to compose herself. More than once, a church worker had to come forward to give the shattered mother a fresh tissue. Nine-year-old Lily sang before she could speak and had a thousand-watt smile. “Lily was naturally shy, but when she let her smile glow, it glowed completely,” Badger said. Lily loved many things, Badger said, but nothing more than her 7-year-old twin sisters, Grace and Sarah. “They were her best friends,” she said. Sarah once passed out cookies at a nursing home. Afterward, she told her grandma, “Someone ought to tell the tooth fairy this is where she needs to bring the teeth because they really need her.” Sarah often stayed up late talking to her mom — a memory that caused Badger to break down for several seconds. “Sarah liked to lie with me at night and hold my hand and tell me how much she loved me,” Badger said. Grace loved math and crafts, always building objects out of Band-Aids, and was curious about everything. “For Christmas, Gracie wanted a telescope and microscope,” Badger said. “She wanted to see the seen and unseen.” ‘Why my children?’ Badger recalled a particularly painful conversation she had with Grace years ago. “Gracie asked a thousand times if she was going to die before me,” Badger said. “I said, ‘No. That’s never going to happen.’ “But it did, and I wonder why. Why my children? Why my parents?” The firefighters’ eyes were wet with tears. Many had responded to the massive blaze that engulfed Badger’s three-story Stamford, Conn., mansion about 4:50 a.m., but were unable to save her three girls and parents. The bodies of the girls and their grandparents, Lomer and Pauline Johnson, were found on the top two floors. Two of the children were found in separate parts of the home — one just a few feet away from her grandfather, the other near her grandmother. Badger and her boyfriend, Michael Borcina, barely escaped. Both suffered injuries while trying to find the children amid the flames and thick smoke. The inferno was ignited by a bag of embers from a Yule log that had been removed from the fireplace because the children were concerned Santa would be burned, authorities said. After the 90-minute service, Badger let out a piercing wail as she walked out of the church, trailing behind the coffins. “No mother should have to endure what she has endured,” said family friend Gillian Brandt, 55. “How she is finding the strength to go on . . . I just don’t know.” rschapiro@nydailynews.com ||||| Matthew and Madonna Badger watch as the caskets carrying the bodies of their three daughters arrive for funeral services on Jan. 5, 2012 (John Moore/Getty Images) By Sonja Sharp and Wil Cruz DNAinfo Staff MIDTOWN — Inconsolable mother Madonna Badger tearfully remembered her young daughters — who were killed along with her parents in a devastating Christmas Day fire at their Stamford, Conn. home — at their somber funeral Thursday as dancers, singers and little angels. Badger, who escaped the horrific blaze along with her friend Michael Borcina, joined the girls' father Matthew Badger, and hundreds of mourners to say goodbye to Lily, 10, and twins Grace and Sarah, who were 7, at the St. Thomas Church on 53rd Street and Fifth Avenue. \\"They were my little girl tribe,\\" said Badger as she choked back tears. \\"And I want you to hear about them from me. \\"My girls are in my heart, and that is where they live now, and they live in me. I want to remember my girls out loud.\\" The girls' father was so distraught that he could not speak. Instead, the priest, Rev. Dr. William Shillady read a heart-wrenching note to the rapt mourners, many of whom broke down during the service. \\"A day with Lily was like a day with a beautiful song,\\" the dad said in the note. \\"She was so vulnerable and beautiful. She always wanted a grown up around her at night — in the end, she was right.\\" The fatal fire, sparked by ashes from the fireplace that were left near the house, ripped through the 100-year-old building, trapping Badger's daughters and parents, Lormer and Pauline Johnson, inside. Lormer Johnson, a former Saks Fifth Avenue Santa Claus, was found near the body of one of the girls and was believed to have been trying to save her, according to reports. And in a tragic twist, investigators believe the ashes were removed so that the girls wouldn't worry about Santa coming down the chimney, the Associated Press said. They are also trying to determine if the house, which was under renovation, had working smoke detectors. As the family processed behind the girls' identical coffins draped in lillies and other flowers, mourners moved into the aisle to embrace the grieving parents. Several rows were packed with Stamford firefighters who fought desperately to free the trapped family but were pushed back by intense smoke and flames. Madonna Badger, who once lived in Manhattan and was an art director for Calvin Klein, remembered her first daughter Lily as a shrinking violet who loved to sing and dance. \\"Lily was the angel of my heart and my first baby,\\" Badger recalled. \\"She made up songs constantly.\\" She loved dolls and her stuffed animals, \\"but most of all she loved her sisters,\\" Badger said. The eldest girl had asked her mother about dying, Badger said. On a trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Lily, then 5-years-old, collapsed to the floor and begged her mom to tell her when she would die.

And she accepted that.\\" One of Lily's friends, Audrey, 9, grave the grieving mom a poem she wrote entitled \\"Hope,\\" which she read aloud at the service. Grace, a second grader, was the explorer of the three girls, who loved making crafts and excelled at math. \\"For Christmas she wanted a microscope and a telescope,\\" said her heartbroken mom. \\"Grace asked me a thousand times if she was going to die before me. I said, 'No, No, that's never going to happen,' but it happened.\\" Her inseparable twin Sarah was remembered as the social butterfly of the pair with a big heart — relishing the opportunity to pass out Christmas cookies at an old age home with her grandfather. Sarah was so popular, in fact, that her schoolmates competed for her attention. \\"The principal had to call a meeting of second grade girls so they could figure out how to take turns being close to Sarah,\\" Badger said. But mostly, she was mommy's little girl. \\"Sarah used to like to lie in my bed and tell me how much she loved me,\\" said a weeping Badger, who was consoled at the funeral by the girls' father Matthew Badger and Borcina. \\"Sarah was so lovable and vibrant,\\" her dad said in his note. \\"She saw the goodness in all of us.\\" Mourners — among whom were singer Lou Reed, actor Philip Seymour Hoffman and clothing mogul Calvin Klein — were touched by the Badgers' strength throughout the ordeal. \\"I can't imagine how they're even standing up,\\" said James Gilroy, a family friend. \\"I thought what she said was just beautiful.\\" As a parent himself, Gilroy said he could scarcely imagine losing a child, much less three. \\"I have a little girl 11 years-old.\\" Gilroy said. \\"It's the worst thing I've ever heard.\\" After the service ended, Madonna Badger wept loudly as she walked out of the church. \\"Grace was fearless,\\" she said. \\"Nothing will bring my parents back, or my children. In all this incomprehensible loss and chaos love is everything,\\" she said. \\"I used to say I could never ever live through losing my babies — but here I am.\\" Donations in memory of the children can be made to The Other 364 Foundation.

As early as 1808,the people of Provincetown requested a lighthouse on Race Point,but it took Congress eight years to react when they finally paid 8,000 on April 27,1816 to build a lighthouse --Race Point Light,which was located in the town of Provincetown,Massachusetts.It was first built of stone 25 feet high with no foundation and its light was 30 feet above the sea.It was equipped with one of the nation's earliest revolving lights. Actually,there were two other lighthouses on Cape Cod,but they were hit by a storm in October 1841.In the following year,Race Point Light was examined by I.W.P.Lewis,who realized the light's importance.He said,\\"The light should be useful to all ships leaving Boston.However,its _ power is so weak that people would hardly be able to differentiate it from the lights set on the ships which stay in the bay,or close by.It hasn't played its role as a lighthouse well.\\" The result was that old lighthouse was destroyed and a new iron lighthouse with a proper foundation was put up to take its place.The new lighthouse was 45 feet high.Although the original keeper's house was in good repair,it was destroyed too and a new one was built.Today the lighthouse has been automated and Race Point Light is still an active aid to navigation.

Buffalo Bill is so nicknamed because he skins the hides of his female victims, similar to how buffalo were skinned by hunters in the past. He is driven by his urge to become a woman and intends to create a \\"womansuit\\" from the skin of his victims. Buffalo Bill kidnaps overweight women so he can starve them before killing and then carefully removing their skin. Clarice Starling is an FBI trainee tasked with interviewing Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a highly intelligent but extremely dangerous incarcerated serial killer and cannibal, to gain insight into Buffalo Bill's twisted psychology and motivations. Throughout the story, Clarice forms an uneasy alliance with Dr. Lecter, using his knowledge and help to track down Buffalo Bill, while Dr. Lecter manipulates her into revealing her personal traumas. The film showcases the gripping dynamics between Clarice Starling, Hannibal Lecter, and Buffalo Bill, as they navigate their interdependent relationships and pursue their own agendas. The character of Buffalo Bill is considered to be an amalgamation of various real-life serial killers, including Ted Bundy, Gary Heidnik, and Ed Gein, among others. The grisly portrayal of the villain and the unique, intense insights into investigative procedures and offender profiling contribute to \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" becoming one of the most critically acclaimed psychological thriller movies of all time."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What has already been acquired by Trafford Council for £12 million?

The proportion of pupils leaving Stretford Grammar School with five or more GCSEs at grades A*–C in 2006, was 98.3%, compared to an average of 66.7% for all secondary schools in Trafford and a national UK average of 61.3%. The proportion of students from minority ethnic backgrounds, and for whom English is an additional language, is much higher than the average. Stretford Grammar was awarded specialist Science College status in September 2005. The school was assessed as \\"good\\" in its April 2015 Ofsted report.Stretford High School Community Languages College, like Stretford Grammar, has a much higher proportion than the national average of pupils with a first language other than English, many of them being either asylum seekers or refugees. In 2004 Stretford High School was made subject to special measures, as it was considered not to be providing an adequate education for its pupils. Substantial improvement has taken place since then; the school was assessed as \\"satisfactory\\" in its November 2005 Ofsted report and was removed from special measures. Further improvements saw Stretford High School gain an \\"outstanding\\" assessment from Ofsted, following its February 2008 inspection. GCSE results also placed the school in the top 1% of schools in the country for adding value to its students.Stretford also has the specialist Arts College, Lostock College.

Can you help me answer a few questions? If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\". Question: which year this movie takes place? Movie title: Teza Movie plot: Teza, which means morning dew in Amharic, tells a story of hope, loss, and reminiscence through the eyes of an idealistic, young intellectual, displaced from his homeland of Ethiopia for many years. The film reflects on the fall of Emperor Haile Selassie and on the effects of that regime change relative to Ethiopian history and society. Through a broader lens, the film Teza focuses on the ways in which political upheaval and social change have impacted cultures and nations across the larger African Diaspora.Told mainly through a series of flashbacks, Teza follows the personal narrative of Anberber, who, after leaving Ethiopia for Germany to become a doctor, is led to return to his home village by lingering spirits and haunting visions from his childhood. Using the power of memory as its primary device, Teza recounts the historical circumstances that have framed the context in which contemporary Ethiopia exists.The movie chronicles Anberber's internal struggle to stay true--both to himself and to his homeland--but above all, the film explores the possession of memory, a right that humanity mandates that each of us have--the right to own our pasts. Answer:","output":"Teza is a movie that takes place over multiple years, with the use of flashbacks to recount the personal and historical events that shaped the protagonist, Anberber's life. While specific years may not be mentioned explicitly in the film, we can still piece together a general timeline based on the historical events depicted. The film starts with the fall of Emperor Haile Selassie, which occurred in 1974, marking the end of the Ethiopian Empire and the beginning of the Marxist-Leninist Derg regime. This regime, characterized by political repression and economic instability, lasted until 1991. Teza then moves forward to depict Anberber's life as a young intellectual, moving to Germany to study medicine and later returning to his home village in Ethiopia. Given that the movie covers Anberber's journey from his childhood in Ethiopia, through his time in Germany, and finally his return to his home village, it can be assumed that the movie spans a period of several decades, from the 1970s to at least the late 1980s or early 1990s. In conclusion, Teza primarily takes place during the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s, as it tells the story of Anberber and the impact of the fall of Emperor Haile Selassie and the subsequent Derg regime on Ethiopia's history and society. By investing in this film, you will be supporting a project that explores themes of hope, loss, memory, and the struggle for self-identity during a complex political and socio-cultural landscape."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the name of the person who suffered from a series of health problems? , can you please find it? As Harvey's interests shifted to the Pyramid, Monte Ne's resort days effectively ended and the number of visitors slowly dwindled. Activities and events at Monte Ne continued, supported by locals who still visited in large numbers. Harvey sold the Hotel Monte Ne. The hotel went through several name changes and owners, becoming the White Hotel circa 1912, the Randola Inn in 1918, the Hotel Frances in 1925, and in 1930 the Sleepy Valley Hotel. Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were foreclosed and sold at public auction. From 1927 to 1932, Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row (often called the Club House Hotels at this point) were home to the Ozark Industrial College and School of Theology, a nonsectarian school run by Dan W. Evans. The hotels housed pupils—Missouri Row for boys, Oklahoma Row for girls—and Oklahoma Row also provided classroom and dining spaces. Evans and his family lived in the tower. The dance pavilion was enclosed and served as the school chapel. In May 1932, following a mortgage foreclosure against the school, school officials were evicted and the property was sold.After he announced the building of the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly. In 1926, blood poisoning in his foot put him in a coma that lasted several days resulting in surgery, and three months of recuperation. In 1929 he and Anna were finally divorced.

A:","output":"The last step of the process would involve the adult reaching the various milestones associated with the different stages of adulthood, including personal, professional, and emotional development, until they reach their elder years. During these stages of life, individuals may pursue various goals and experiences, such as attaining higher education, securing a stable career, developing and maintaining relationships, forming a family, and planning for retirement. Furthermore, they may also contribute to society, develop their identity, and nurture their passions, hobbies, and interests throughout their lives. As the adult continues to age, they transition into different phases of adulthood: early, middle, and late adulthood. Each stage comes with unique challenges, milestones, and experiences that shape the individual's growth and development. - Early adulthood (ages 20-39): This stage is known for establishing independence. Individuals might leave their parents' home, begin their careers, forge intimate relationships, and possibly start families. Early adulthood is also a time for personal development through hobbies, travel, and community involvement. - Middle adulthood (ages 40-64): As individuals enter middle adulthood, there may be more focus on personal fulfillment, work-life balance, and giving back to the community. Additionally, long-term relationships are maintained, and adjustments are made as children grow and families evolve. For some, this period may involve addressing crises, challenges, or changes related to careers and relationships. - Late adulthood (ages 65 and older): As individuals enter retirement, they might have more time for leisure, hobbies, and travel. This stage can involve adapting to a changing body, declining health, and social network shifts such as the loss of friends or a spouse. It's a time to reflect on one's life achievements, maintain connections with loved ones, and deal with the physical and psychological changes that come with aging. During each stage, individuals continue to forge their own unique path filled with new experiences, growth, and ongoing personal development. Ultimately, the last step of the process would be the adult navigating through their senior years and passing on their wisdom, knowledge, and life experiences to subsequent generations, thus completing the lifecycle before the end of their natural lifespan."},{"instruction":"Wonders and blunders Wonder: Westminster underground stationBlunder: Portcullis House We have chosen two buildings by the same architect, built at the same time - indeed, one sits above the other.

Michael Hopkins and Partners have created a wonderful tube station for the use and enjoyment of us all, but Portcullis House, the expensive new office building for our pampered MPs, is an unsatisfactory confusion of historical references and modern technology. Planned around a private inner courtyard and crowned with a series of overweight \\"chimneys\\" (actually heat exchangers), it is a classic example of the compromises forced on architects when working alongside our grand monuments. Paradoxically, it is underground where imagination has been allowed to soar. Some of the best late-20th-century architecture in Britain has resulted from Roland Paoletti's commissions for the Jubilee line extension, particularly Hopkins's Westminster and Foster's Canary Wharf. Indeed Hopkins has salvaged his reputation by doing underneath Westminster what he failed to achieve above - creating perfect harmony between function and aesthetics.

He wondered about the families who lived in each one. Like that two-story brick on the corner. What secrets were they hiding? Was the husband abusive? Did a teenager use drugs? Was the family nearly bankrupt? How could anyone know? It was better not to know. The mind can only handle so many problems at one time. He wondered where Troy and Cynthia Blockerman lived. Greg had appeared at the courthouse that morning as part of a jury pool, only to be released. He and the rest of his group would have to return the next morning. He hoped they would not need him. The church would pay his regular part-time salary while he was serving on a jury, but any private lessons he missed would be money lost. Greg's red 1965 Pontiac Bonneville convertible always turned heads as he drove through the small town. He had purchased it two months earlier from a career Navy man down in Longview who had babied the thing for years. It spent most of its life in the man's garage, coming out only when he was on leave. Most trips were to the car wash or the Pontiac dealer for scheduled maintenance. Greg gladly paid 4,000 for it. The sailor called him the very next day and tried to buy it back.

Open my laptop on the plane and notice a Galaxy Note 7 wifi hotspot https://t.co/y1csn9gOsZ pic.twitter.com/9Z5IJULuPs — Lucas Wojciechowski (@lucaswoj) December 20, 2016 About an hour into the flight the intercom clicked on and one of the cabin crew asked that if anyone had a Note 7, they should they identify themselves. After 15 minutes and no answer, the cabin crew threatened to turn on the lights – it was 11pm by this stage – and search all passengers until they found the device. Another 15 minutes and no phone, so now the captain came on the intercom and threatened to divert the flight to an airport in Wyoming if the owner of the banned Sammy handset didn’t confess. He pointed out that as this was a nighttime flight then landing and searching everyone would be a massive pain in the backside for everyone. \\"I don't know if you've ever been diverted at 3am,\\" Wojciechowski recounts the captain saying. \\"Let me tell you, it is terrible. There is nothing open in the terminal. Nothing.\\" Thankfully, this seemed to do the trick and shortly afterwards the captain reassured passengers that the device had been found. It wasn't one of the flammable phones, but instead another model belonging to a moron who thought it would be a good wheeze to rename their mobile hotspot and pretend to be carrying a banned handset. \\"The US Department of Transportation has banned the transport of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 on board all US aircraft, and Virgin America actively informs guests that they should not bring these devices onboard,\\" a Virgin spokesman told The Reg. \\"As such, when our InFlight Teammates see potential evidence of this device on board, they take it seriously.

Someone recently boarded a Virgin America flight with the bright idea of leaving on a Wi-Fi hotspot named “Galaxy Note 7_1097” Since that device is banned from all planes in any capacity, the pilot rightly decided to divert the plane in an effort to focus on passenger safety. The fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 isn’t a device you want on any flight. According to BBC, the plane’s crew came across the loudspeaker and asked the owner of the phone to page the flight attendants using the in-seat call button. Nobody called the flight attendants and the phone appeared to still be broadcasting a Wi-Fi hotspot. The pilot came on the speaker next. “This isn’t a joke,” the pilot said, according to BBC. “We’re going to turn on the lights (it’s 11pm) and search everyone’s bag until we find it.” That didn’t do enough convincing. The passengers all remained mum. “This is the captain speaking. Apparently the plane is going to have to get diverted and searched if nobody fesses up soon.” That’s when someone finally admitted to owning the device. He or she wasn’t carrying a Galaxy Note 7 but, rather, had simply named his or her phone’s hotspot to suggest it was indeed that device. My guess is it was some sort of prank, perhaps meant for use in another location and accidentally forgotten about until it was spotted on the flight. BBC said this ultimately led to the delays and even a flight cancellation. Yikes. Update: Virgin America provided us with this statement, disputing claims made to BBC that any flights were delayed or canceled: “The U.S. Department of Transportation has banned the transport of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 onboard all U.S. aircraft, and Virgin America actively informs guests that they should not bring these devices onboard. As such, when our InFlight Teammates see potential evidence of this device onboard, they take it seriously.

We arrived at 8:00pm on a Monday and were surprised to find out there was a 30 minute wait. Around 30 min later we were sat at the bar and the food was more than worth the wait. We started out with four dishes; Baba Ghanoush dip, anchovy bruschetta, lamb cheek profiteroles, and curried lamb skewers. The Baba ghanoush with pita chips was smoky and spicy, probably the best I've ever had. The marinated Spanish white anchovies on Bruschetta were refreshing, lite, and full of flavor, everything on the bruschetta was super fresh. The profiteroles for me were by FAR the highlight of the meal and one of the top 5 dishes I've ever eaten in my life. The kitchen was on point because everything on this plate was perfection. It was the first time I've had savory profiteroles which I thought was very creative, they were stuffed with tender lamb cheek, mushroom jam, and a foie gras mousse. The three ingredients just kind of melted together and although the portion was small, they were so rich that it really ended up being the perfect amount. I would normally have a heart attack after paying 18 for 3 golf ball sized \\"sandwiches\\" but these were so good that we will probably order them every time we go back! The last dish of our first go around was the curried lamb skewers with mango chutney. The lamb was cooked and seasoned well, but there wasn't anything necessarily special about the lamb itself. But, the mango chutney was perfection, and we probably could've eaten a few bowls of that on its own. The pairing of the curry with the sweetness of the mango worked perfectly and definitely elevated the flavor of the lamb. Our second go around we ordered the Rocky Mountain Oysters, Sakana Roll, and Korean BBQ wings. The choice of the Rocky Mountain Oysters was really just out of curiosity. I always see Food Network hosts eating them when they're in Colorado and I was curious to taste them. They were perfectly cooked and incredibly tender, but I just did not care for the taste. They were good and my husband ended up eating the whole plate, but there is nothing in this world I hate more than liver, and although very mild, they did have a slight liver taste. The Sakana roll was pretty good and I really liked the combination of sauces that they served it with. Finally we had the Korean BBQ wings which were cooked perfectly. They were tender, very moist, and very flavorful. The only disappointment of the night was dessert. I was eyeing the goat cheese ice cream since I first opened up the menu and when we ordered it the waitress told us they no longer make that flavor and we must have received an old menu. That was kind of a buzzkill, but we moved on and ordered the Vietnamese coffee ice cream. This is definitely not a cheap restaurant, but up until dessert, everything we ordered was more than worth the price. The ice cream scoop was 4 and it was about a 3oz scoop barely larger than a golf ball. I guess we're kind of picky because we make ice cream at home a lot, but our 1st shot at Vietnamese coffee ice cream was better than that. It was not a huge deal, just kind of anticlimactic after such delicious savory dishes. My husband also ordered an Old Fashioned and said it was delicious. Lastly, the DJ was fantastic and one of the highlights of the night. We were seated right in front of him which was entertaining, and he was playing old school records all night which was the perfect type of music to accompany our food! All in all it was one of the best meals we've ever had and cannot wait to go back. My husband thinks we can try the whole menu in 3 more visits, which I think is a bit ambitious, but I'm sure we will get there eventually! Choose: was this review given positively or negatively?

How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","output":"To analyze the linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"My binoculars were given to that girl by him,\\" I will examine its grammar, syntax, and word choice. Step 1: Check the grammar The sentence uses the passive voice. In this construction, the object (binoculars) becomes the subject. The subject appears to be \\"My binoculars,\\" which is a possessive noun phrase. Possessive pronouns like \\"my\\" indicate ownership or possession. Step 2: Examine the syntax The sentence follows the structure for passive voice: Subject + verb + to + indirect object + by + agent. The verb phrase \\"were given\\" is in the past simple passive tense – \\"were\\" being a past auxiliary verb, and \\"given\\" the past participle of \\"give.\\" The indirect object \\"that girl\\" receives the direct object (binoculars). The agent \\"him\\" is the person who performed the action. Step 3: Verify word choice and clarity The words used in the sentence are clear and straightforward. However, the pronoun \\"him\\" is less specific than a proper noun or a more detailed description, but it's acceptable if the context is already established. Step 4: Review the overall structure The sentence has a clear subject (my binoculars), verb phrase (were given), indirect object (that girl), and agent (him). The sentence reads smoothly and communicates information to the reader effectively. Conclusion: The linguistic integrity of the sentence is sound, as it follows proper grammar, syntax, and word choice. The passive voice construction is appropriate for situations where the emphasis is on the action or when the agent of the action is unknown or secondary in importance."},{"instruction":"Q: Read the given query and classify it as a 'Good' or 'Bad' query depending on how well the query is formed, 'Bad' being the expected output for a not so well formed query and 'Good' being the expected output for a well formed query.

Which island contributed more to global warming? Long island was full of people and they used all their natural resources and burned fossil fuels while Snail island protected the environment and had fewer people living there. Hint: Pollutants also affect the atmosphere through their contribution to global warming. Global warming is an increase in the Earth’s temperature. It is thought to be caused mostly by the increase of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. Greenhouse gases can be released by factories that burn fossil fuels. Over the past 20 years, burning fossil fuels has produced about three-quarters of the carbon dioxide from human activity. The rest of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is there because of deforestation, or cutting down trees ( Figure below ). Trees absorb carbon dioxide during cellular respiration, so when trees are cut down, they cannot remove carbon dioxide from the air.

Claire assigns her assistant, Zara, as the boys' guide but they soon evade her. Elsewhere on the island, U.S. Navy veteran and ethologist Owen Grady has been training and researching four Velociraptors. Based on the raptors' ability to follow commands, Vic Hoskins, the head of InGen Security, believes the animals can be weaponized, an idea Owen and his assistant Barry strongly oppose. Prior to its opening, Claire and park owner Simon Masrani inspect the park's newest attraction, Indominus rex, a genetically-engineered dinosaur created by geneticist Dr. Henry Wu. Masrani tasks Owen with evaluating the enclosure. Owen warns Claire the Indominus lacks social skills, making it more dangerous and unpredictable.

Today he is focusing on the elements that all belong to the alkali metals group. He is especially focused on learning about lithium, which is at the top of the group, and cesium, which is at the bottom of the alkali metals group. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In which element is the shielding effect larger? A:","output":"The shielding effect in cesium is larger compared to lithium. The shielding effect is a phenomenon that describes the decrease in attraction between an electron and the nucleus in any atom with more than one electron shell. This happens because outer electrons are repelled by electrons in inner shells, reducing the net force of attraction from the nucleus. This repulsion by inner shell electrons is referred to as the shielding effect. In the context of the periodic table, as you move down each group, more energy levels (shells) are added. This implies that atoms get larger moving down a group, and the outermost electrons are less attracted to the nucleus due to the repulsion by inner shell electrons. Alkali metals, including lithium and cesium, belong to the first group of the periodic table. Let's take a closer look at lithium and cesium. Lithium is the third element on the periodic table, it has three protons and three electrons, two of which fill the first energy level (or are in the 1s orbital), while the third is in the second energy level (or in the 2s orbital). So, lithium has relatively few energy levels and, therefore, a relatively small shielding effect. On the other hand, cesium is much further down the periodic table. It's the 55th element, with 55 electrons spread across a total of 6 energy levels. Although only one of these electrons is in the outermost level (or in the 6s orbital), there are still many energy levels and electrons between this outermost electron and the nucleus. This leads to a strong shielding effect as the inner electrons repel the outermost one, reducing the effective nuclear charge it experiences. Therefore, cesium experiences a larger shielding effect than lithium because it has more energy levels filled with electrons that can shield the outermost electron from the positive charge of the nucleus. This is a general rule for the periodic table: the shielding effect increases as you move down a group in the periodic table, making the outer electrons less tightly held by the nucleus, resulting in bigger atomic radii, lower ionization energies, and more reactivity. This explains why cesium is more reactive than lithium, despite both being in the alkali metals group."},{"instruction":"Q:A species of animal called a markalong was discovered that can reproduce either sexually or asexually. Two markalongs were just born from different families in a zoo. The first markalong, animal A, has only one parent. The second markalong, animal B, has two parents. Although they used different forms of sexual reproduction, both animals are healthy and doing well at the zoo. Which markalong was produced asexually? Hint: The advantage of asexual reproduction is that it can be very quick and does not require the meeting of a male and female organism. The disadvantage of asexual reproduction is that organisms do not receive a mix of traits from both parents. An organism that is born through asexual reproduction only has the DNA from the one parent. In fact, the offspring is genetically an exact copy of the parent. This can cause problems for the individual. For example, if the parent has a gene that causes a particular disease, the offspring will also have the gene that causes that disease. Organisms produced sexually may or may not inherit the disease gene because they receive a mix of their parents' genes. A:","output":"Based on the provided information, we can determine that Markalong A was produced asexually. Firstly, let's take a look at the reproduction process of both markalongs. It is given that Markalong A has only one parent, while Markalong B has two parents. This is a crucial difference between the two animals in terms of reproduction methods. Asexual reproduction involves a single individual reproducing on its own, with no combination of genetic material, resulting in offspring that are genetically identical copies, or clones, of the parent. In contrast, sexual reproduction involves the combination of genetic material from two parents, generating offspring with a mix of traits from both parents. Now let's examine the hint, which further clarifies the distinction between asexual and sexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction is advantageous due to its speed and the fact that it does not necessitate male and female organisms meeting. This allows for rapid and energy-efficient reproduction. However, this form of reproduction has its drawbacks, the most significant of which is the lack of genetic diversity among offspring. As offspring are genetically identical to their single parent, any detrimental genetic characteristics or susceptibility to diseases will be passed down directly. Taking these facts into account, we can infer that Markalong A must be the offspring produced asexually. This is because it has only one parent and therefore does not benefit from the genetic diversity that would result from sexual reproduction. Conversely, Markalong B was produced sexually, as it has two parents and its genetic makeup is a mix of traits from both parents, potentially offering better resilience to diseases and adaptation to its environment."},{"instruction":"Read this fact: \\"damming a river can cause a lake to form\\" Now answer this question: \\"A beaver is building a home in a river, and that eventually blocks up the river, giving the beaver a nice home.

In 2003, MTV named her \\"The Greatest Music Video Star Ever\\" and said that \\"Madonna's innovation, creativity and contribution to the music video art form is what won her the award.\\"\\"? Answer:","output":"Question: In the passage, how does Madonna challenge traditional gender roles and blend elements of the sacred and profane in her music videos, specifically in \\"Like a Prayer\\"? What impact did this have on her public image and career, including her recognition by MTV in 2003? Answer: In the passage, it is mentioned that Madonna's music videos, notably \\"Like a Prayer,\\" allowed her to challenge traditional gender roles by subtly reversing the common portrayal of men as the dominant sex. This was achieved through her use of provocative symbolism and imagery that pushed boundaries and questioned the status quo. In \\"Like a Prayer,\\" the blending of sacred and profane elements can be observed through the inclusion of scenes featuring an African-American church choir, Madonna being attracted to a statue of a black saint, and her singing in front of burning crosses. This unique mix of religious and secular themes generated controversy, particularly among religious institutions like the Vatican. As a result, it led to the withdrawal of a Pepsi commercial featuring Madonna. Despite this controversy, the passage highlights that Madonna's bold approach to her music videos allowed her to make significant contributions to the music video art form. In 2003, MTV recognized her impact and creativity by naming her \\"The Greatest Music Video Star Ever.\\" The award highlighted how Madonna's innovation, creativity, and ability to challenge societal norms ultimately earned her a lasting place in music history."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person whose baby was in fact aborted?, using the article: The musical opened on Broadway on May 28, 1953 at the Majestic Theatre. Large advance sales guaranteed a considerable run; by the start of November, it had paid back its advance, and closed after 358 performances, paying a small profit to RCA. Thomas Hischak, in his The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia, suggests that business fell off after the advance sales were exhausted \\"because audiences had come to expect more from a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical\\". According to Frederick W. Nolan in his book about the duo's works, \\"despite a 500,000 advance sale, despite a ten-month run (which, for anyone except Rodgers and Hammerstein, would have represented a major success), and despite an eventual profit in excess of 100,000, Me and Juliet has to be classed as a failure\\".The backstage drama portrayed in the musical was matched by actual difficulties among the cast. McCracken, who played Betty, was the wife of choreographer Bob Fosse and became pregnant during the run. Bill Hayes later wrote that she lost her baby through miscarriage about the same time she lost her husband to Gwen Verdon. The baby was in fact aborted, because the pregnancy would have endangered McCracken's health as a result of her diabetes. Hayes noted that in the fifteen months he played Larry, he did not recall ever having a conversation with Isabel Bigley, who was supposedly his love interest and wife: \\"I doubt that the audience ever believed we were deeply in love.\\" The show received no Tony Award nominations. During the run, Hammerstein followed his usual practice of visiting the theatre now and again to ensure that the performers were not taking liberties with his book. Upon his return, Hammerstein's secretary asked him how the show was going. The lyricist thought for a second, then said \\"I hate that show.\\" According to Bill Hayes in his autobiography Like Sands Through the Hourglass published in 2005 he states We played nearly five hundred performances, however, all to full houses.

Article: Everyone tries to get to school on time. But when bad weather gives you trouble, can you still make it before the bell rings? In northern China during spring, big sandstorms often make trouble for students and everyone else. When the sky is dark with sand, buses and cars all move much more slowly. Sometimes, people can't even see for 20 metres. Sandstorms usually happen in spring. This year, sandstorms started in late March. They have happened in more than 10 provinces in northern China this year. More than 70 million people have had problems in those places because of the sandstorms. People in southern China don't have to worry about this kind of bad weather. Most of the sand comes from Gansu and Inner Mongolia . In northern China, lots of places have few trees and don't get much rain. People there have been cutting down too many trees. When there aren't many trees, the ground can't keep enough water. Over the years, the ground dries up and turns to sand. When spring comes and the ice melts , the ground becomes looser . Strong winds take the loose sand into the sky. Sandstorms are bad for people's health. If people breathe too much sand, they could cough or have asthma . Sandstorms also give farmers lots of problems. Sometimes their sheep get lost in the storms and never get back home. The winds also tear down farmers' houses. What can you do to stop sandstorms? Here's an idea: Ask you parents to help you plant some trees this spring. If you see people cutting down too many trees, tell them about the dangers of sandstorms, and ask your government to stop them from cutting.

Options: - hospital - ghetto - emergency kit - controlling bleeding - ambulance Step-by-step reasoning process below:","output":"A tourniquet is typically used in situations where there is a need to control severe bleeding from an injury, usually a limb. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of where tourniquets might be used among the options provided: 1. Hospital: Tourniquets can sometimes be used in hospitals during surgical procedures or to control bleeding from a severe trauma before the patient is stabilized. A hospital setting is an appropriate place to use a tourniquet because there are trained medical professionals who can monitor and manage its use. 2. Ghetto: A tourniquet is unlikely to be specifically used in a \\"ghetto\\" setting – this term could refer to any impoverished urban area, and there is no inherent reason why a tourniquet would be needed there more than any other location. 3. Emergency kit: It is common to include a tourniquet in an emergency kit, which can be carried by first responders, military personnel, or civilians who are prepared to provide first aid in case of an accident or disaster. An emergency kit often contains essential items to manage various medical emergencies, including controlling bleeding of a limb. 4. Controlling bleeding: This is the primary application of a tourniquet. It is commonly used to control heavy bleeding from a limb in an emergency or traumatic situation. A tourniquet may be used as a temporary measure to prevent further blood loss and buy time for the injured person to receive professional medical care. 5. Ambulance: Ambulances, being equipped with essential medical supplies and staffed by trained emergency medical technicians, will often have tourniquets on board. In cases where an injured person is experiencing severe bleeding from a limb, a tourniquet may be applied by ambulance personnel to control blood loss during transport to a medical facility. In summary, a tourniquet is most typically used for controlling bleeding from a limb in emergency situations.

But then, not many people are Paul Callahan. As a 21-year-old Harvard University student, Paul's life was full of possibility. An undergraduate studying business at one of the best universities in the world, there was a lot to look forward to for the young man from Massachusetts. Then a freak accident changed everything. Paul slipped on a wet floor, breaking his neck and rendering him paralyzed from the chest down. He retained the use of his arms, but not his hands. Callahan spent the next five years traveling to rehabilitation centers across the United States in search of a way to walk again. When a doctor finally suggested it was time to concentrate on living instead of walking, Paul did exactly that. Almost 30 years later, the 55-year-old father of two is now set to represent the United States in sailing at the Paralympics. \\"It's an evolutionary process where you transition from one life to the other,\\" Paul told CNN. \\"I never gave up moving forward. You can define that as walking or being a contributing member of society. At 26 I chose the later.\\" Golden hopes. Next week Paul and his two team mates -- both amputees -- will take to a 24-foot boat for the three-person sailing event at the Paralympics. Skipper Paul drives the boat by wearing rollerblading gloves on his hands, attached to bicycle pedals. The pedals are in turn linked to a pulley system that steers the vessel. This will be Paul's second Paralympics, after his debut at Sydney in 2000. The U.S. team failed to win a medal, but as Paul admits he was still fresh to the sport. With a fifth place in the Disabled Sailing World Championships in Weymouth last year, this time gold is on the cards, he insists. Watch: Sailing for social change. It would be an incredible achievement in a life already marked by success. Paul returned to Harvard in 1983, becoming the first quadriplegic to graduate from the university. He then went on to work at Goldman Sachs as an asset manager for 15 years. \\"Everyone is quite capable of doing much more than they think they can,\\" Paul said. \\"Once they realize that fact, then the world becomes their oyster.\\" Sail to Prevail. It was a chance sailing trip in 1995 that sparked Paul's love for the sport -- and a new venture that would help thousands of disabled children. \\"I got on a sailboat and looked back at my empty wheelchair on the dock,\\" Paul said. \\"It was the first time in 15 years I was able to do something on my own. It was an incredible moment.\\" So inspiring was the experience, Callahan left his Wall Street job and took over Sail to Prevail -- a non-profit organization that teaches disabled children to sail. Watch: Sailing solo around the world. From starting with eight children a year, the charity, based in Newport, Rhode Island, now helps around 1,000 youngsters annually. Their disabilities vary from spinal cord injuries to autism, and Paul says when he races for gold next month, it'll be for them. \\"When we get on the starting line against 14 other countries, I want to win a gold medal just as much as they do -- but I've got an additional motivation,\\" he said. \\"The better my team does, the more powerful impact it will have for Sail to Prevail.\\" The gift. It is perhaps a testament to Paul's mental strength that he views his disability as a special opportunity in life. \\"I've been given an extraordinary gift where I can affect people's lives in ways other people can't. So I see it as a responsibility,\\" he said. There have been some dark moments Paul admits. But with his wife, Alisa, 9-year-old twin sons and the Paralympics on the horizon, what's the point in dwelling on that instant he slipped on a wet floor? \\"I've been very fortunate,\\" he said, adding: \\"You've only got a limited amount of time in life. So you may as well choose to put that towards positive effort, rather than squandering it on the negative.\\" Highlights:","output":"- Paul Callahan, a quadriplegic, is representing the United States in sailing at the Paralympics. - In his early 20s, while studying at Harvard University, Paul suffered a freak accident that left him paralyzed from the chest down. - Despite his disability, he became the first quadriplegic to graduate from Harvard and went on to work at Goldman Sachs for 15 years. - After falling in love with sailing in 1995, Paul took over a non-profit organization called Sail to Prevail, which teaches disabled children to sail. - From helping only eight children a year, Sail to Prevail now assists around 1,000 youngsters annually with varying disabilities, including spinal cord injuries and autism. - Paul's motivation for winning a gold medal at the Paralympics is inspired by his work with Sail to Prevail and the impact it will have on the charity. - Embracing his disability as a gift, Paul focuses on the positive aspects of his life, emphasizing the importance of making the most out of the time we have."},{"instruction":"I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

The grand inquisitor is none other then her estranged brother, Prince Vajda, who renounces his ties to his sister. As the executioner ties her down to the stake, Asa defiantly swears retribution by returning from the dead one day. The executioner positions a spike-lined metal mask over her face. On her brother's command, a swift hammer blow drives the mask into her skull, killing her instantly. She is then interred in the family crypt in a coffin equipped with a window, thought which the sign of the cross is visible. With the cross forever visible to her lifeless body, it is said that the witch will never return to life.200 years later, Doctors Kruvejan (Andrea Checchi) and Gorovek (John Richardson) are riding in a carriage from St. Petersburg to Moscow on their way to a medical conference. A wheel on the carriage slips out of its socket.

Given these facts, what can harm animals among the following options: - pesticides - bacteria - hay - cigarettes - amoebae - grain - manure - mines A:","output":"Several factors on the list can potentially harm animals, either directly or indirectly. It is essential to understand that, while some items may not be universally detrimental to all animals, they can have negative effects on particular species or ecosystems. Here are some examples: 1. Pesticides: Pesticides are chemicals used to control pests and can have harmful effects on animals. They can be ingested by animals through the food chain as they accumulate in their bodies, causing acute or chronic poisoning. Pesticides can also harm non-targeted species, such as beneficial insects, birds, fish, and mammals. 2. Bacteria: Some bacteria can be harmful to animals, either as pathogens, causing infections, or by producing toxic substances. For example, Anthrax is a bacteria that can cause severe and fatal infections in many wild and domestic animals. Additionally, some harmful bacteria can contaminate food or water, leading to illness in animals. 3. Cigarettes: Cigarette butts discarded in the environment can be very harmful to animals. They contain toxic chemicals that leach into soil and water when they break down. Birds, fish, and other animals can mistake cigarette butts for food, which can lead to poisoning, choking, or other health complications. 4. Mines: Mining can cause habitat loss and fragmentation, pollution, and pose physical threats to wildlife. Open-pit mines, for example, can poison the water sources around them, and displace many animal species. Additionally, abandoned mines can lead to the creation of dangerous sinkholes or acid mine drainage, causing severe water pollution and posing danger to both aquatic and terrestrial animals. While the remaining options on the list (hay, amoebae, grain, manure) do not typically pose direct threats to animals, it is worth noting that under certain circumstances, they might have indirect negative effects: - Hay and grain: Unsustainably grown or harvested hay and grains can contribute to habitat loss and fragmentation, impacting plant and animal species reliant on those habitats. - Amoebae: Some amoebae can be harmful to animals if they act as parasites or vectors for disease. - Manure: While manure can be a beneficial source of nutrients, excessive or improperly managed manure can lead to water pollution due to runoff containing harmful amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and pathogens, affecting both water-dwelling animals and those that depend on the water sources. In summary, pesticides, bacteria, cigarettes, and mines can all have detrimental effects on animals, both directly and indirectly. It is crucial to manage these substances and practices carefully to minimize the various impacts on animals and ecosystems as a whole."},{"instruction":"Generate a short summary this sentence: a riot broke out at a bank thursday after thieves blew a hole in the vault and dropped children inside to bring out fistfuls of cash .","output":"On Thursday, a bank witnessed a chaotic scene as thieves created a breach in the vault by blowing a hole, followed by enlisting children to enter the vault and retrieve cash, ultimately triggering a riot."},{"instruction":"But I think actually reading the sheets and doing the activities Bill told us to do is helping !

Question: What areas of the brain communicate to the primary motor cortex? Context: The brain contains several motor areas that project directly to the spinal cord. At the lowest level are motor areas in the medulla and pons, which control stereotyped movements such as walking, breathing, or swallowing. At a higher level are areas in the midbrain, such as the red nucleus, which is responsible for coordinating movements of the arms and legs. At a higher level yet is the primary motor cortex, a strip of tissue located at the posterior edge of the frontal lobe. The primary motor cortex sends projections to the subcortical motor areas, but also sends a massive projection directly to the spinal cord, through the pyramidal tract.

The movie had garnered some hype and boasted an intriguing premise, but the eventual outcome was a disappointing and disjointed mess. Here's my step-by-step breakdown of The Lost Potential's shortcomings and why it fell short for me. 1. Plot and direction: One of the key components of a movie is a coherent, engaging plot. Unfortunately, The Lost Potential's storyline was a haphazard array of subplots and undeveloped characters that led to a confusing and frustrating experience. The director's attempt to intertwine these multiple storylines was more chaotic than harmonious, leaving the audience bewildered and detached from the narrative. 2. Character development: Any memorable movie usually has rich, interesting characters that the audience can relate to and empathize with. The Lost Potential, however, presented an ensemble cast of one-dimensional, caricature-like figures who lacked depth and development. It was difficult to invest emotionally in any of the characters or their outcomes, which ultimately led to a lackluster viewing experience. 3. Pacing: A well-paced movie can make even a modest story feel engaging and satisfying. Unfortunately, The Lost Potential failed to find the balance between building up the narrative and keeping the audience's attention. The movie dragged at times, with scenes that seemed to have no purpose or relevance, while at other times, it rushed through important plot points, leaving the audience struggling to catch up. 4. Cinematography and editing: Visuals are an essential aspect of cinema, and in this regard, The Lost Potential felt lackluster as well. The cinematography was uninspired and seemed to lack creative vision. The editing was subpar, with numerous continuity errors and awkward scene transitions that disrupted the flow of the story. 5. Acting and dialogue: While the actors had potential, their performances were marred by the weak and cliched dialogue provided in the script. The characters spoke in stilted, unnatural exchanges that made it difficult for the actors to deliver convincing performances. This further exacerbated the disconnection the audience felt toward the characters and story. In conclusion, The Lost Potential was a disappointing piece of work, not due to a lack of ideas, but rather due to inadequate execution in almost every aspect. Poor direction, an unengaging plot, lack of character development, and technical flaws resulted in a viewing experience that left me disenchanted and unsatisfied. Here's to hoping the filmmakers learn from these mistakes and create a more polished and captivating story in their next cinematic venture."},{"instruction":"Berühmt wurde er durch sein virtuoses Spiel bei Eigenkompositionen und Blues-Klassikern gleichermaßen, die er zunächst zu einem Halb-Schluss führte, um sie dann mit einer Solo-Einlage zu beenden.

We are both stressed about money and work ( lack of both ) at the moment . A is not by nature a worrier , but she 's worrying now . Question What may be the reason for their worrying ? Answer:","output":"There could be several reasons for the individuals, particularly A, worrying in this context. Here, I will provide a detailed analysis of various factors that could be contributing to their anxiety and stress. 1. Financial stress: As mentioned, both A and B are experiencing issues related to money and work. Financial stability plays a crucial role in maintaining one's mental well-being, as it provides a sense of security and comfort. A lack of financial stability could create anxiety, as it can make it challenging to meet daily living expenses, repay debts, or save for future needs. 2. Job insecurity: The mention of the lack of work suggests that they might be going through precarious employment situations, such as unemployment, underemployment, or unstable job tenures. Job insecurity can be emotionally distressing, as paid work contributes not only to one's livelihood but also to one's identity and self-esteem. The fear of losing a job or difficulty finding one can be a major source of anxiety, often affecting one's mental well-being. 3. Relationship strain: Money and work-related stress may be causing tension and strain in their relationship. It's common for couples to experience strain under financial difficulties or unemployment, as these situations can lead to feelings of inadequacy, frustration, and insecurity. This tension can disturb the communication and emotional connection in the relationship, leading to further worry. 4. Personal predisposition to anxiety: While it's mentioned that A is not a worrier by nature, it's possible that prolonged stress has activated latent anxiety tendencies within her. Moreover, the current situation might have reached a tipping point, wherein even a resilient individual like A cannot help but worry about the present challenges they're facing. 5. Social pressure: Societal norms often dictate the expectation to be financially secure and professionally successful. In situations where individuals are unable to meet these expectations, they may feel additional pressure, which can manifest as stress and worry. They could be concerned about what others might think of their current financial and employment situation. 6. Uncertainty about the future: The future can be inherently uncertain, especially in times of financial and job-related stress. A and B may be worrying about how long their situation will last and whether they will be able to overcome these challenges. This fear of the unknown and fear of failure can exacerbate stress and anxiety. In summary, the reasons for the individuals' worrying in this context could be multifaceted, involving factors such as financial stress, job insecurity, relationship strain, personal predispositions to anxiety, social pressure, and uncertainty about the future. These challenges may have created a perfect storm of stress, making it increasingly difficult for A and B to maintain a sense of calm and well-being. Support, open communication, and seeking professional help when needed can be effective in coping with such issues and reducing their worry."},{"instruction":"Justin Bieber Leads List Of Celebrity 100 Newcomers If you thought it was impossible for a 17-year-old to debut on our list of the most powerful people in entertainment at No. 3, just behind Oprah Winfrey, Justin Bieber proves you can never say never.

In the context of this statement, focusing on cooperation among countries in the field of judiciary refers to establishing strong ties and networks of support between the legal and judicial systems of different countries in a specific region. This cooperation aims to address common legal and judicial challenges and promote understanding between the legal entities, ultimately leading to the exchange of knowledge and expertise. There are several benefits that can be achieved through cooperation in the field of judiciary among countries in the region. To begin with, it facilitates the sharing of best practices in legal procedures and allows countries to learn from the experiences of others. This not only leads to the better functioning of the individual judicial systems but also enhances uniformity in laws and regulations across the region, which in turn can foster greater regional stability. Additionally, such cooperation can help in tackling cross-border criminal activities more effectively. Through collaborative efforts, countries can expand their resources and intelligence to address issues such as terrorism, human trafficking, drug smuggling, and other organized crimes more efficiently. This contributes to maintaining the security and well-being of citizens across the entire region. Moreover, judicial cooperation can significantly contribute to the development of mutual trust and understanding between countries in the region. As legal entities and professionals engage with one another and work together on shared legal issues and policies, they build strong relationships that can bridge gaps and foster a spirit of unity and collaboration. In terms of economic impact, a well-coordinated judiciary across the region can encourage foreign investment by creating an environment of trust and transparency. When investors are confident in the legal and regulatory framework, they are more likely to engage in business activities in the region, thus contributing to economic growth and development. Furthermore, cooperation on a judicial level can promote the protection of human rights and the rule of law. By sharing knowledge and resources, countries can enhance their capacity to address human rights issues and uphold the fundamental values enshrined in international treaties and conventions. In conclusion, cooperation in the field of judiciary not only strengthens each individual country but also serves as a catalyst for a stable, prosperous, and united regional community. By working together, countries can address common challenges more effectively, foster trust and understanding, and ultimately enjoy the benefits of a more harmonious and secure region."},{"instruction":"This task is to translate a news commentary given in Italian language into Zhuang language.

Kyle bought hamsters for the children, which annoyed Leslie because","output":"Leslie always thought that having pets was a huge responsibility and would take up much of their time, effort and attention. Plus, she had a mild allergy to hamster fur, which would make things more complicated for her. Nevertheless, Kyle loved pets and thought that introducing them into their kids' lives would have a positive impact on their responsibility, emotional interactions, and companionship. When Kyle first brought the hamsters home, Leslie tried to hide her irritation, but it was clear that she was unhappy about the situation. Eventually, after some gentle prodding from Kyle, she shared her concerns about how the hamsters would be a burden on the household. The children, enthusiastic about their new pets, promised to take good care of them and give their mom enough space to avoid any allergy issues. The children chose to name the hamsters Pippin and Cocoa. Pippin was a feisty, energetic little hamster, full of enthusiasm and spunk. Cocoa, on the other hand, was calmer, gentle and very cuddly. For a while, things went smoothly, as the kids kept their promise to look after Pippin and Cocoa and Leslie managed to avoid any of her allergies flaring up. However, as time went on, the novelty of having hamsters started to wear off for the young kids. They began to spend less time cleaning the cage, feeding the pets, and playing with them. The responsibility of taking care of the hamsters started to shift back to Leslie, who would regularly chide the children for not living up to their promises, while secretly struggling with the fact that the fur was causing her more discomfort than she was willing to admit. Seeing that Leslie was having a hard time coping with the situation, Kyle stepped in and took over. He started to spend more time with the hamsters, understanding their unique personalities, and ensured they were well taken care of. He also spent more hours taking care of chores around the house, which gave Leslie some much-needed relief from the children and some time to enjoy her hobbies and to catch up on her favorite TV shows. Despite her initial frustrations, Leslie began to see the value of having pets in their children's lives as she watched how Kyle interacted with the hamsters, teaching the kids skills of empathy and compassion alongside responsibility. They even began to bond as a family over Pippin and Cocoa, with the children showing renewed interest in taking care of the hamsters, as they saw their parents make an effort. Soon enough, Leslie began to appreciate the antics of Pippin and Cocoa. While still not necessarily an avid fan of hamsters, she found herself cracking a smile as Pippin stuffed his cheeks full of food or raced around his wheel with abandon, and could even tolerate holding Cocoa for short periods of time, thanks to her gentle and cuddly personality. A small part of her started to feel relieved that Kyle had brought the hamsters into their lives. Realizing the positive impact the hamsters had on their family, Leslie confided in Kyle one evening when the children were asleep. She admitted that despite her initial annoyance and the difficulties they had faced, the new members of their household had made their family bond even stronger and taught them all valuable lessons. Together, Kyle and Leslie, along with the children, continued to grow and learn from their experiences with Pippin and Cocoa. They didn't just become better pet owners, but also a closer family, united by their shared responsibilities and understanding of the importance of compassion, empathy, and patience in life."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Given the background: Infrared (IR) light is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength between 0.7 and 300 micrometers, which corresponds to a frequency range between 430 and 1 THz respectively.

This statement indicates that the subject, presumably a crime drama television show or film, hasn't surpassed or even met the expectations of the evaluator. It's a negative review because it suggests that the content isn't engaging or unique enough to stand out from similar productions in its genre. Firstly, the phrase \\"standard crime drama fare\\" implies a lack of originality. It suggests that the show or movie falls into the usual or generic category of crime dramas. This is often construed negatively as it hints at a lack of innovation or creative approach to the subject matter. Secondly, the term \\"instantly forgettable\\" builds on the criticism by suggesting that the story or characters aren't compelling or memorable, which is a key element for any successful storytelling. It implies that the impact of the show or movie is so weak that it doesn't linger in the viewer's mind soon after watching. Lastly, the term \\"thoroughly dull\\" is undoubtedly negative. Labeling a show or film as \\"dull\\" bodes poorly as it implies that the plot, characters, or even the overall execution is boring or lacking excitement or intrigue. As a rule of thumb, no creator aims for their work to be perceived as dull. Overall, the phrase indicates dissatisfaction and disappointment, indicating a negative sentiment towards the crime drama being discussed. It criticizes not just certain aspects of the work, but seems to dismiss its overall value and appeal."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Given the background: Animals and some bacteria and fungi carry out lactic acid fermentation.

Changes in matter are affected by temperature. For example, what if you place a cake in the oven and you leave it in too long? What do you think will happen? Thats right, it will probably burn. The same thing will happen if the oven setting is too high and you apply too much heat. In either case, heat has affected the rate of change in matter. Its probably obvious that when the temperature is increased a chemical change, like cooking, will occur faster. What about a physical change? Are physical changes affected by temperature? Most of us have seen steam rising off a wet road after a summer rainstorm. This happens because the road surface is very warm. The warm road and warm air temperature causes the water to evaporate quickly. The liquid water is turning into water vapor, but it is still water. The evaporation of water is a physical change. So yes, temperature affects the rate that physical change occurs. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What causes things to burn?\\" is \\"Wet road\\"?","output":"No, the correct answer to the question \\"What causes things to burn?\\" is not \\"Wet road.\\" The paragraph focuses on explaining how temperature affects changes in matter, both in chemical changes, like burning (also known as combustion) and physical changes such as evaporation. The wet road example was provided to illustrate how physical changes, such as the evaporation of water from a wet road, are also affected by temperature. What causes things to burn? The main reason behind it is the process of combustion, which is a chemical reaction between a material (usually called fuel) and an oxidizer (usually oxygen), resulting in the production of heat and light. The reaction is initiated by heating the fuel to a point where it begins to emit flammable vapors. When these vapors mix with the oxidizer and are exposed to an ignition source, the combustion process takes place, generating heat, light, and smoke. This transfer of heat to the fuel further enhances combustion, leading to the substance being burned. To summarize, burning or combustion is a chemical change that is primarily caused by the interaction between fuel, an oxidizer (usually oxygen), and a heat source, which then results in heat, light, smoke, and other products. Temperature plays a crucial role in the combustion process by helping to initiate the reaction and influence the rate at which the change occurs."},{"instruction":"Q: Carlsbad Caverns National Park is a United States National Park in the Guadalupe Mountains of southeastern New Mexico.

Title: Wild Geese Movie plot: Allen Faulkner (Richard Burton), a British mercenary and former army colonel, arrives in London to meet the rich and ruthless merchant banker Sir Edward Matheson (Stewart Granger). The latter proposes a risky operation to rescue Julius Limbani (Winston Ntshona), the imprisoned leader of a Southern African nation who is due to be executed by General Ndofa, the man who deposed him. Limbani is currently being held in a remote prison in Zembala, guarded by a unit of Ndofa's personal troops known as the \\"Simbas\\". Faulkner accepts the assignment and begins recruiting 49 other mercenaries for the job, including officers he had worked with on previous operations: Rafer Janders (Richard Harris), a skilled military tactician who's made a living as an art dealer, and Shawn Fynn (Roger Moore), an ex-pilot who had been working as a currency smuggler for the London mafia. Shawn also brings in penniless South African Pieter Coetzee (Hardy KrÃ¼ger), a former soldier in the South African Defence Force who wishes to return to his homeland and buy a farm. Hired soldiers include sergeants Tosh Donaldson (Ian Yule), Jock McTaggart (Ronald Fraser), Jesse Blake (John Kani), Derek Frice (Joe Cole), and a homosexual medic named Arthur Witty (Kenneth Griffith).

Article: Everybody hates it, but everybody does it. A recent report said that 40%of Americans hate tipping. In America alone, tipping is a 16 billion-a-year industry. Consumers acting politely ought not to pay more than they have to for a given service. Tips should not exist. So why do they? The common opinion in the past was that tips both rewarded the efforts of good service and reduced uncomfortable feelings of inequality. And also, tipping makes for closer relations. It went without saying that the better the service, the bigger the tip. But according to a new research from Cornell University, tips no longer serve any useful function. The paper analyzes numbers they got from 2,547 groups dining at 20 different restaurants. The connection between larger tips and better service was very weak. Only a tiny part of the size of the tip had anything to do with the quality of service. Tipping is better explained, by culture than by the money people spend. In America, the custom came into being a long time ago. It is regarded as part of the accepted cost of a service. In New York restaurants, failing to tip at least l5% could well mean dissatisfaction from the customers. Hairdressers can expect to get l5%-20%, and the man who delivers your fast food 2. In Europe, tipping is less common. In many restaurants the amount of tip is decided by a standard service charge. In many Asian countries, tipping has never really caught on at all. Only a few have really taken to tipping. According to Michael Lynn, the Cornell papers' author, countries in which people are more social or outgoing tend to tip more. Tipping may reduce anxiety about being served by strangers. And Mr. Lynn says, \\"In America, where people are expressive and eager to mix up with others, tipping is about social approval. If you tip badly, people think less of you. Tipping well is a chance to show off.\\" Question: Among the following situations, in your opinion, who is likely to tip most?

In 1986, Gilmour began recruiting musicians for what would become Pink Floyd's first album without Waters, A Momentary Lapse of Reason. There were legal obstacles to Wright's re-admittance to the band, but after a meeting in Hampstead, Pink Floyd invited Wright to participate in the coming sessions. Gilmour later stated that Wright's presence \\"would make us stronger legally and musically\\", and Pink Floyd employed him as a musician with weekly earnings of 11,000. Recording sessions began on Gilmour's houseboat, the Astoria, moored along the River Thames. Gilmour worked with several songwriters, including Eric Stewart and Roger McGough, eventually choosing Anthony Moore to write the album's lyrics. Gilmour would later admit that the project was difficult without Waters' creative direction. Mason, concerned that he was too out-of-practice to perform on the album, made use of session musicians to complete many of the drum parts. He instead busied himself with the album's sound effects.A Momentary Lapse of Reason was released in September 1987. Storm Thorgerson, whose creative input was absent from The Wall and The Final Cut, designed the album cover. To drive home that Waters had left the band, they included a group photograph on the inside cover, the first since Meddle. The album went straight to number three in the UK and the US. Waters commented: \\"I think it's facile, but a quite clever forgery ... The songs are poor in general ...

Most recently, Newt Gingrich sent a jolt through the discussion with his description of Palestinians as \\"an invented\\" people. His rivals, without disagreeing, accused Gingrich of speaking irresponsibly and potentially hurting Israel. Most people in the U.S. and around the world interpret the campaign pledges of love and support for Israel as an effort to win the Jewish vote. But the Jewish vote has little to do with it. The Republican candidates' passionate vows to support Israel have two objectives. First, they aim to capture the pro-Israel vote in a country where the vast majority of people side strongly with Israel and in a party where the most reliable primary voters, conservative Republicans and evangelical Christians, express intense feelings on the subject. Second, they seek to make President Barack Obama look weak on foreign policy with an issue people care about and where the GOP thinks it might score some points. There are many things you can say about how Obama handled the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The one thing you cannot say is that it succeeded. His early missteps managed to make Israelis and Palestinians feel betrayed by Washington. The very public pressure Obama exerted on Israel, has, according to some polls hurt his standing among Jews and among Israelis. But the president's change in tone later helped him with both groups. Most Israelis now say they view him favorably. Among American Jews, Obama's approval may have sunk significantly to the low 50s, but that is still considerably higher than the approval he enjoys nationwide. Despite the views of serious analysts and the calculations of conspiracy theorists, Jewish voters are hardly the point. The numbers confirm that a Republican fight for the Jewish vote would mostly amount to wasted energy. The number of Jewish-American voters barely registers when compared with the size of the pro-Israel vote. Barely 2% of American voters are Jewish compared with more than 60% who consider themselves pro-Israel. Worse for Republicans, a large and consistent majority of Jews vote Democratic. Obama won the Jewish vote by an incredible 78% in the last election. Most American Jews have voted for Democratic presidents for decades. Even if half of them voted for a Republican this year, the prize during the primary is hardly worth the effort. The pro-Israel vote is another matter. Americans support Israel so strongly that for every Jew in the U.S., there are at least 30 non-Jews who say they side with the Jewish state. Support for Israel is at near-record highs, making a pro-Israel position a winning formula for Republicans and Democrats. It's not just Republicans candidates who proclaim their commitment to Israel. Despite his strained relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Obama frequently asserts support. He expressed that sentiment in June at a Democratic National Committee event, saying that \\"Israel's security will always be at the top tier of considerations ... because it's the right thing to do, because Israel is our closest ally and friend ... it shares our values and it shares our principles.\\" Those are words pro-Israel voters, Jewish or not, want to hear. If Republican candidates were trying to help Israel rather than chasing votes, they might stop using it as a political issue. The most damaging change they can bring to the Jewish state's security is to turn support for Israel into a partisan matter. Until now, it is one of the few issues on which bitterly divided Republicans and Democrats usually agree. In fact, Gingrich's recent comments about Palestinians would not make him a lot of friends among Israelis. His incendiary remark -- that Palestine was never a state and Palestinians identified themselves as Arabs until recently -- does nothing to advance the cause of peace. However long Palestinians have seen themselves as a \\"people,\\" they now share a common history and view themselves as one. The obvious response to Gingrich's rhetorical Molotov cocktail is, so what? Gingrich seemed to imply Palestinians do not deserve a state. But the best conceivable way to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is creating two states. That's why a majority of Israelis support the two-state solution. But for now, Republican candidates are worried about rounding up primary votes. One way to do that is by appealing to those with the most intense feelings and the greatest anxiety about Israel's security. More than 60% of conservative Republicans and evangelical Christians, according to a recent poll by the Pew Research Center, consider it \\"a very important goal\\" to protect Israel. For evangelicals, in particular, the issue could decide their voting choice. That's why Michelle Bachmann, for example, has spoken in almost mystical terms, saying \\"as a nation we have been blessed because of our relationship with Israel.\\" Mitt Romney says his first trip as president will be to Israel. All candidates -- except Ron Paul, who wants to cut all foreign aid -- make support for Israel a cornerstone of their foreign policy. Once the Republicans choose their candidate and the race becomes a two-person contest, both sides will try to show they are the most committed to maintaining the strongest of ties and the greatest commitment to Israel's security. It will be a quest for the backing of Jewish voters, but more importantly, an effort to entice the much larger pool of Americans who consider themselves supporters of Israel.","output":"As Republican presidential candidates head into key tests for their party's nomination, the topic of Israel and its conflict with Palestinians has increasingly come up in speeches and debates.

In other words, the bald man showed patience and waited for an event (the villager's recovery) to occur before proceeding with his course of action. Now, let's consider the hypothesis, \\"The bald man waited for the villager's recovery.\\" The hypothesis also implies that the bald man's actions were on hold while he patiently waited for the villager to recover from their illness, injury, or whatever difficulty they were facing. It is clear from the comparison of the premise and the hypothesis that both statements describe a similar situation where the bald man's actions are contingent upon the recovery of the villager. Therefore, we can deduce that the given premise entails the hypothesis. In the context of logical reasoning, entailment means the truth of one statement (the premise) guarantees the truth of another statement (the hypothesis). Since the premise depicts a situation in which the bald man waited for the villager to recover before moving on, it can be reliably inferred that the hypothesis—\\"The bald man waited for the villager's recovery\\"—is indeed true when the premise is true. The entailment between the premise and the hypothesis suggests that there is a relationship of necessity between the two: if the premise holds, the validity of the hypothesis follows as a direct result. In this case, the fact that the bald man waited until the villager recovered directly implies that the bald man waited for the villager's recovery. The two claims may employ different phrasing, but the underlying semantics are consistent and compatible. Consequently, we can confidently assert that the initial premise entails the later hypothesis."},{"instruction":"Premise: The road to and from Hana goes through the heart of tropical forests and the real Hawaii .

Stream of Consciousness Reasoning: When considering human survival, our bodies and minds have basic needs that must be fulfilled to ensure proper functioning. Sleeping is one of these necessities, as it allows the body and mind to rest, regenerate, and recover from daily activities. Removing sleep from one's life may initially seem like an advantage due to the increase in productive hours, but science has shown that sleep has numerous benefits for cognitive ability, physical health, and emotional well-being. We can start by examining the different stages of sleep, including rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, which is crucial for memory consolidation, learning, and problem-solving. The lack of REM sleep could significantly hinder one's intellectual capacity. Additionally, other stages of sleep, such as deep sleep, contribute to bodily repair processes, including tissue growth, muscle repair, and maintaining hormonal balance. With these vital sleep functions in mind, a body that never sleeps would struggle to maintain itself physically and mentally. Furthermore, sleep deprivation, even for short periods, has been proven to have negative effects on mood, attention, reaction time, and overall health. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to problems like heart disease, obesity, and diabetes. If even brief stints of sleeplessness have such consequences, it is highly unlikely that a person could endure a lifetime without sleep and avoid severe complications or even death. Taking into account the numerous essential functions of sleep and the detrimental effects of sleep deprivation, it becomes apparent that human survival without sleep is not viable. Therefore, the answer is no – a person cannot survive without ever sleeping."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence in Spanish.","output":"\\"La fascinante cultura española, con su rica historia, deliciosa gastronomía y coloridas tradiciones, atrae a personas de todo el mundo para explorar sus pintorescas ciudades y encantadores paisajes.\\" Translation: The fascinating Spanish culture, with its rich history, delicious gastronomy, and colorful traditions, attracts people from all around the world to explore its picturesque cities and enchanting landscapes."},{"instruction":"By Daily Mail Reporter UPDATED: 12:19 EST, 13 December 2011 Less than two weeks after the U.S. let a top secret spy drone slip through its fingers in Iran, Washington appears to have lost another.

The drone that crashed was called an MQ-9 Reaper. It's a special flying robot that helps by watching over places where there are bad guys, like members of a group called Al Qaeda. Thankfully, this drone was not carrying any weapons, and when it crashed, no one got hurt. People were trying to find out if more drones like this one were used somewhere else, but that information wasn't known at the time."},{"instruction":"Review: delivers the same old bad trip Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","output":"This movie review sentence is negative.

's easier to change the sheets","output":"The phrase \\"It's easier to change the sheets\\" can be considered both positive and negative, depending on the context in which it is used. In general, it does not convey a strong emotional charge by itself, making it a relatively neutral statement. However, the interpretation depends on the specific situation, the tone of the speaker, and the listener's perspective. A. Negative interpretation: If the phrase is used in a situation where someone is complaining about a problem or a difficult task, it could be interpreted as a negative statement. For example, imagine a scenario where a person is struggling to clean a stain on their bed. If someone else says, \\"It's easier to change the sheets,\\" this could imply that the person should give up on trying to clean the stain and instead replace the sheets – a suggestion that recognizes the frustrating nature of the problem. In another context, the phrase could be used to express annoyance or dissatisfaction. If a parent says, \\"It's easier to change the sheets,\\" after discovering that their child has repeatedly spilled food on their bed, it could convey frustration or disappointment in the child's behavior. B. Positive interpretation: On the other hand, the phrase can also be seen as positive when viewed as a practical solution or helpful advice. For example, imagine a person stressing over trying to iron the creases out of their bedsheets. In this case, someone saying, \\"It's easier to change the sheets,\\" could offer a less time-consuming alternative that alleviates stress. Furthermore, this statement can be interpreted as a reminder to keep things in perspective and not get caught up in insignificant details. The phrase may encourage someone to focus on more important aspects of their life and not dwell on minor issues. In conclusion, the phrase \\"It's easier to change the sheets\\" can be categorized as positive, negative, or neutral depending on the context, tone, and perspective of the individuals involved in the conversation. By recognizing the various interpretations, one can better understand and respond to the intent behind the statement in a given situation."},{"instruction":"Problem: Solve -262*x - 12*x - 331 = 57*x for x.

When we combine them, we get: -274x - 331 = 57x Step 2: Move all terms with x to one side of the equation and the constant term to the other side. To do this, we'll add 274x to both sides of the equation: -274x + 274x - 331 = 57x + 274x This simplifies to: -331 = 331x Step 3: Solve for x.

Though chili may be a popular dish at a festival, it is unlikely to be the only food being cooked. 3. People who cook in a festival may be offering different dishes based on their specialties, cultural backgrounds, or food preferences of the attendees. 4. The statement does not specify a \\"Chili Cook-off\\" or a chili-specific festival, so it can be assumed that this is a general question about any type of festival.

It was designed in 1959 by Michael Taiwo Akinkunmi, a Nigerian student, as part of a competition held for the creation of a national flag in anticipation of Nigeria's independence, which took place on October 1st, 1960. Since then, the Nigerian flag has served as a prominent symbol of the country's identity both domestically and internationally. The flag consists of three vertical bands of equal width. The color scheme is as follows: the left and right bands are green, while the middle one is white. Each of these colors bears a specific representation and significance. 1. Green: The green color is emblematic of the nation's rich and fertile land. Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa, has vast agricultural resources, which play a critical role in its economy. The green represents various aspects related to agriculture - including soil fertility, sustainable farming practices, the growth of crops, and the overall prosperity that the land provides. Furthermore, it is a symbol of the collective aspirations of the Nigerian people for an environmentally conscious future in which the natural resources are cherished, conserved, and used sustainably. 2. White: The white band in the center of the Nigerian flag stands for peace, unity, and stability. Despite being a nation of diverse ethnicities, languages, religions, and cultures, the white signifies the Nigerian people's desire to live together harmoniously in mutual respect for their differences, fostering a spirit of tolerance and inclusiveness. Additionally, the white band also highlights the importance of maintaining national peace and security – recognizing that without peace, there can be no sustainable progress or development. In summary, the Nigerian flag offers a profound representation of the country's values, aspirations, and identity as a whole. Its green and white colors not only signify the agricultural wealth and peaceful harmony of Nigeria but also showcase its people's resilience and commitment to progress. The Nigerian flag, as a result, serves as a visual reminder of the challenges the country has overcome and the potential it has for future growth and unity."},{"instruction":"Choose your answer: Is \\"It has been suggested that Boston is the new \\"TitleTown, USA\\", as the city's professional sports teams have won nine championships since 2001:\\" a good answer to the question \\"When did Boston withdraw its bid for hosting the Olympic games?\\" Available options: 1). yes 2). no","output":"2). no This is not a good answer to the question \\"When did Boston withdraw its bid for hosting the Olympic games?\\" because it talks about how many championships the city's professional sports teams have won since 2001.

The question I'm going to create pertains to world history, specifically the Second World War. \\"Who was the President of the United States during World War II?\\" The factual answer to this question is Franklin D. Roosevelt initially, and later Harry S. Truman. Franklin D. Roosevelt was the U.S.'s 32nd President, and he served from March 1933 to April 1945. He was a crucial figure in world events during the mid-20th century, leading the U.S. during a time of worldwide economic depression and total war. FDR, as he is commonly known, directed the federal government during most of the Great Depression, implementing his New Deal domestic agenda in response to the worst economic crisis in U.S. history. As a dominant leader of his party, he built the New Deal Coalition, which redefined American liberalism for the middle third of the 20th century. His third and fourth terms were dominated by the Second World War, which broke out in September 1939. He died just as the war was in its final stages, in April 1945. Following the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Vice President Harry S. Truman took over the reigns. Truman served as President of the United States from April 12, 1945, to January 20, 1953. Roosevelt's sudden death threw Truman into the role of president during the final months of World War II. Truman's noteworthy actions during his presidency include the issuing of the Truman Doctrine and Marshall Plan, the beginnings of the Cold War, the creation of NATO, and his handling of the Korean War. Truman is most notorious for his decision to use nuclear weapons against Japan in August 1945. After the war, he worked on rebuilding postwar Europe, working to contain the spread of communism, aided by the policy of containment, including the establishment of the Truman Doctrine and creation of NATO. Thus, the factual answer to the question, \\"Who was the President of the United States during World War II?\\" is Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I am testing my students' logic. What is the answer they should choose between \\"mirror\\" and \\"tire\\"?

The second question is inquiring about the use of a male-to-2-female audio splitter to connect a headphone and a microphone. While both questions involve the use of audio equipment and splitting devices, the purposes, objectives, and specific details of each scenario are different. In the first question, the goal is to achieve separate vocal recordings for two different inputs (the lapel microphones) on an iPhone, while the second question is specifically asking about the possibility of attaching a headphone and a microphone simultaneously using a single splitter. In regards to the first question, to record separate vocal tracks using two lapel microphones plugged into an iPhone with a splitter, you will possibly need a special app or hardware.

From the moment the film begins to its rapturous conclusion, it is evident that a labor of love and dedication has gone into its creation. Set in the picturesque French countryside, The Sunlit Symphony tells the story of a young, ambitious violinist named Eloise and her journey towards achieving her dreams in the world of classical music. Along the way, she encounters obstacles, including a fierce rival, a complex romance, and adversity emanating from within her dysfunctional family, each of which threatens the realization of her dreams. One of the most striking aspects of the film is its cinematography. The lush, panoramic landscapes are truly breathtaking and add an incredible depth to the film's visual storytelling. The director, Claire Leclair, makes excellent use of natural lighting to accentuate the dichotomy between the bright, hopeful moments in Eloise's journey and the shadows that seem to loom around every corner. This visual approach creates a sense of immersion in the film that is both enchanting and spellbinding. The performances of the entire ensemble are nothing short of outstanding, including lead actress, Amélie Bouchard, who portrays Eloise with a deft blend of vulnerability and ferocity. Her portrayal perfectly encapsulates the essence of a young woman teetering on the edge of both success and failure. Bouchard's interactions with her on-screen rival, played by the equally talented Gabriel Rousseau, elevate the story to new heights and leave the audience at the edge of their seats. The Sunlit Symphony also boasts an exceptional score, blending elements of classical music with more contemporary sounds which augment the film's themes of love, passion, and resilience. At its emotional core, the original composition, from which the film takes its name, stands out as an auditory masterpiece, delivering a blend of heart-wrenching melodies and stirring crescendos that mirror Eloise's journey. One cannot discuss The Sunlit Symphony without praising the film's tight, well-crafted screenplay, penned by screenwriter Lucie Moreau. The dialogues are sharp, witty, and often gut-wrenching, with just enough levity to prevent the film from ever feeling weighed down. Moreau's ability to weave a rich tapestry of interconnected subplots ensures that the film remains engaging throughout its runtime. Perhaps the only notable shortcoming of the film is its occasional reliance on genre cliches. While these moments can be forgiven, they can detract from the overall impact of the film and its bold, innovative storytelling. In conclusion, The Sunlit Symphony is a sweeping ode to the power of dreams, resilience, and the beauty of art. The film is an absolute must-watch for fans of both classical music and emotionally charged drama. While it may not entirely revolutionize the genre, The Sunlit Symphony offers a transcendent experience that cleverly blurs the boundaries between music, visuals, and storytelling."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"Je mange une pomme.

He is widely regarded by players, pundits and managers as one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time, and, by some, as the greatest ever. Buffon was the runner-up for the Ballon d'Or in 2006, and was elected to be part of the FIFPro World XI, an honour which he also achieved two more times. He is the first goalkeeper ever to win the Golden Foot Award, which pertains to both personality and playing ability. Buffon has represented Italy at all youth levels, from the under-16 side to the under-23 side, as well as the Olympic side in 1996. With the Italy under-16 side, he reached the final of the 1993 UEFA European Under-16 Championship, saving two penalties and even scoring one himself in the quarter-final shootout victory over Spain, and subsequently saving three penalties - but also missing one himself - in the semi-final shootout victory over Czechoslovakia. With the Italy U-17 side he took part at the 1993 FIFA U-17 World Championship in Japan. In 1995, he reached the final of the UEFA European Under-19 Championship with the Italian U-19 side.

Buffon was awarded his first cap for Italy's senior team under Cesare Maldini on 29 October 1997, at the age of 19 years and 9 months, as an injury replacement for Gianluca Pagliuca during the first leg of the 1998 World Cup qualification play-off against Russia, in Moscow; with this cap, Buffon became the youngest goalkeeper to feature for Italy post-World War II. This record was beaten by Gianluigi Donnarumma on 1 September 2016. Buffon came on in the 31st minute and made notable saves under snowy conditions in a 1-1 away draw, including an important stop from a Dmitri Alenichev shot, only being beaten by a Fabio Cannavaro own goal. The result helped Italy to qualify for the upcoming World Cup 2-1 on aggregate. He was a member of the squad for the 1998 World Cup finals, initially as the third choice goalkeeper; after an injury to starting goalkeeper Angelo Peruzzi, however, Buffon was promoted to second-choice goalkeeper behind Pagliuca, with Francesco Toldo being called up as third-choice, but Buffon did not play a single game in the tournament. Italy were eliminated in the quarter-finals on penalties to hosts and eventual 1998 World Cup champions France. Buffon became the first choice goalkeeper during the Euro 2000 qualifying campaign and was due to start in goal during the finals under manager and former Italy goalkeeping legend Dino Zoff, but he broke his hand while attempting to stop John Carew's goal in a 1-0 defeat against Norway in a warm up game just a few days before Italy's opening match of the tournament against Turkey. His starting place was taken by backup goalkeeper Francesco Toldo, and Christian Abbiati was called up as a replacement third keeper, with Francesco Antonioli being promoted to second goalkeeper. Italy reached the final of the tournament, losing once again to France.

The palpable tension in the air had been building for weeks, fueled by the fierce competition and the heated exchanges between the players on social media. As the crowds began to gather around the stadium, the excitement reached fever pitch. Pre-game, the rival players were engaged in psychological warfare, taunting each other with mock cheers, sarcastic handshakes, and exaggerated warm-up routines. It was clear that both teams were not only determined to win the game but also to get into the heads of their opponents. The coaches, although trying to remain composed and focused, couldn't help but catch the contagious competitive spirit and join in. As the game began, the energy in the stadium exploded into an exhilarating cacophony of roaring cheers, rhythmic chants, and thunderous stomping. The gameplay itself was nothing short of spectacular, with each team displaying exceptional skill and unwavering determination to come out on top. Plays were executed with unmatched precision, goals were scored with astonishing grace, and the defenders on both sides seemed to push themselves beyond the limits of human capability. But as the game went on, it became increasingly apparent that the drama unfolding on the field was merely a prelude to the much larger spectacle that awaited the audience that night. When the final whistle blew, controversy erupted over a contentious referee decision that had given the winning goal and, ultimately, the victory to one of the teams. Members of both teams launched into heated arguments, with players accusing each other of cheating and unsportsmanlike conduct. The situation escalated quickly, and soon enough, the rivalry had transcended beyond the boundaries of the game, sparking a series of public spats, impromptu press conferences, and even threats of legal action. As the night wore on and the fans spilled into the surrounding streets, the drama continued to unfold. Local bars and restaurants that had capitalized on the game, offering promotional menus and drink specials, quickly became packed, not just with jubilant supporters celebrating their team's victory, but with angry fans seeking solace in a strong drink and a shoulder to cry on. Social media came alive as people around the world chimed in, voicing their opinions about the controversial ending to the game and taking sides in the rapidly escalating feud. In the days that followed, the repercussions of that fateful night reverberated throughout the sports world as pundits, journalists, and even former players weighed in on the scandal. Accusations of bribery, fraud, and misconduct were leveled at the referees and the players themselves, casting a dark cloud over the game that had once been a source of joy, excitement, and camaraderie. One thing was clear - the drama that night, ignited by the fierce rivalry between the two teams, had culminated in a series of events that would be remembered and debated for years to come. Ultimately, the game happened early compared to the drama that night since the astonishing display of skill and athleticism on the field was soon overshadowed by the whirlwind of controversy, aggression, and even heartbreak that was ignited by that controversial referee's decision. It served as a testament to the power of sports to stir the deepest of emotions, unite communities, and reveal both the beauty and the darkness that lies within the human spirit."},{"instruction":"Which entity is this text about? Povenmire was born in San Diego, California on September 18, 1963, and grew up in the city of Mobile, Alabama. A child prodigy, he began drawing at age two; by the time he was ten, his work was displayed in local art shows. His first efforts in animation included a series of flip books that he produced in his school text books. As a child, Povenmire considered animator Chuck Jones his hero; in a 2009 interview, he stated that \\"every drawing he [Jones] did was beautiful to look at and had so much energy in it\\". In 1993, Povenmire and Marsh conceived the series Phineas and Ferb, based on their similar experiences of childhood summers spent outdoors. Povenmire spent 14-16 years pitching Phineas and Ferb to several networks. Most rejected it as unfeasible for the complexity of its plots, but Povenmire persevered, later observing \\"It was really the show we wanted to see: if this was on the air, I'd watch it, and I don't always feel that about every show I work on.\\" Even the Walt Disney Company initially rejected Povenmire's pitch, but asked to keep the proposal packet: \\"Usually that means they throw it in the trash later,\\" Povenmire recalled. Eventually Disney called Povenmire back with an acceptance, on the condition that he would produce an 11-minute pilot. He called Marsh, who was living in England, to ask him if he would like to work on the pilot; Marsh accepted immediately and moved back to the United States. Instead of a conventional script, the pair pitched the pilot by recording reels of its storyboard, which Povenmire then mixed and dubbed to produce action and vocals. The network approved the show for a 26-episode season. Povenmire left Family Guy to create the series. Povenmire and Marsh wanted to incorporate into Phineas and Ferb the kind of humor they had developed in their work on Rocko's Modern Life. They included action sequences and, with Disney's encouragement, featured musical numbers in every episode subsequent to \\"Flop Starz\\". Povenmire described the songs as his and Marsh's \\"jab at immortality\\", but the pair have earned two Emmy nominations for Phineas and Ferb songs to-date. A third Emmy nomination, for the episode \\"The Monster of Phineas-n-Ferbenstein\\" (2008), pitted the show against SpongeBob SquarePants, although neither nominee received the award due to a technicality. In 2010, Povenmire was nominated amongst several other Phineas and Ferb crew members for the Daytime Emmy Award for both \\"Outstanding Writing in Animation\\" and \\"Outstanding Original Song - Children's and Animation\\" for their work on the show, winning for \\"Outstanding Writing in Animation\\". The distinctive style of the animation legend Tex Avery influenced the show's artistic look. Like Avery, Povermire employed geometric shapes to build both the characters and the background. The style developed almost accidentally, with Povenmire's first sketch of title character, Phineas Flynn, which he produced while eating dinner with his family in a restaurant in South Pasadena, California. He doodled a triangle-shaped child on the butcher paper covering the table. He was so taken with sketch he tore it out, kept it, and used it as the prototype for Phineas and as the stylistic blueprint for the entire show.","output":"This text is about Dan Povenmire, an animator and creator of the animated television series Phineas and Ferb, along with Jeff \\"Swampy\\" Marsh.

He had his greatest commercial success and popularity from the late 1980s, until the early 1990s. Remembered for his rapid rise to fame, Hammer is known for hit records (such as \\"U Can't Touch This\\" and \\"2 Legit 2 Quit\\"), flashy dance movements, choreography and eponymous Hammer pants. A multi-award winner, M.C. Hammer is considered a \\"forefather/pioneer\\" and innovator of pop rap (incorporating elements of freestyle music), and is the first hip hop artist to achieve diamond status for an album. Before Hammer's successful music career (with his mainstream popularity lasting approximately between 1988 and 1998) and his \\"rags-to-riches-to-rags-and-back saga\\", Burrell formed a Christian rap music group with CCM's Jon Gibson (or \\"J.G.\\") called Holy Ghost Boys. Some songs produced were called \\"Word\\" and \\"B-Boy Chill\\". \\"The Wall\\", featuring Burrell (it was originally within the lyrics of this song he first identified himself as K.B. and then eventually M.C. Hammer once it was produced), was later released on Gibson's album Change of Heart (1988). This was Contemporary Christian music's first rap hit ever. Burrell also produced \\"Son of the King\\" at that time, releasing it on his debut album. \\"Son of the King\\" showed up on Hammer's debut album Feel My Power (1987), as well as the re-released version Let's Get It Started (1988). With exception to later remixes of early releases, Hammer produced and recorded many rap songs that were never made public, yet are now available on the Internet. Via his record labels such as Bust It Records, Oaktown Records and FullBlast, Hammer has introduced, signed and produced new talent including Oaktown's 3.5.7, Ho Frat Hoo!, the vocal quintet Special Generation, Analise, James Greer, One Cause One Effect, B Angie B, The Stooge Playaz, DASIT (as seen on ego trip's The (White) Rapper Show), Teabag, Common Unity, Geeman and Pleasure Ellis; both collaborating with him and producing music of their own during his career.

Advocates argue that electric vehicles provide numerous environmental and economic benefits, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, decreased dependence on foreign oil, and increased use of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. Meanwhile, critics point out that electric vehicles still have drawbacks, such as limited driving range compared to conventional gasoline-powered vehicles, reliance on a limited charging infrastructure, and concerns about the environmental impact of battery production and disposal. These factors have contributed to an ongoing debate over the viability of electric vehicles as a long-term, sustainable transportation solution. Hypothesis: Given the context, one hypothesis could be that a significant increase in the adoption of electric vehicles, coupled with developments in renewable energy sources, clean and sustainable battery technologies, and improvements to charging infrastructure, could lead to a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and aid in mitigating the impacts of climate change. To support this hypothesis, it is essential to examine the potential benefits and limitations of electric vehicles and to analyze whether these limitations can be overcome through technological advancements, policy measures, and the adoption of green energy initiatives. To test this hypothesis, the following data would be needed: 1. Statistical comparisons of the greenhouse gas emissions associated with electric vehicles versus gasoline-powered vehicles, accounting for the full lifecycle of each vehicle type, including production and disposal. 2. Analysis of current and projected renewable energy infrastructure development, focusing on the capacity to support the growing electric vehicle market. 3. Examination of advancements in battery technology that address concerns of environmental impact, battery life, and charging speed, as well as recycling and disposal initiatives to address the end-of-life issues of EV batteries. 4. Investigating the growth and distribution of electric vehicle charging infrastructure in various geographical areas, as well as policy measures that incentivize the development of widespread charging networks. 5. Evaluating consumer adoption rates, cost variables, and government policies that encourage the adoption of electric vehicles over gasoline-powered vehicles. By conducting thorough research, gathering data from various sources, and analyzing the combined effects of electric vehicle adoption, renewable energy potential, and improvements in EV technology, the hypothesis can either be supported or disproven. This evaluation will provide valuable insights into the feasibility of electric vehicles as a sustainable transportation solution for mitigating climate change and reducing society's dependence on fossil fuels."},{"instruction":"Vivien Leigh (born Vivian Mary Hartley, and also known as Lady Olivier after 1947; 5 November 1913 - 8 July 1967) was an English stage and film actress. She won two Academy Awards for Best Actress, for her iconic performances as Scarlett O'Hara in Gone with the Wind (1939) and Blanche DuBois in the film version of A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), a role she had also played on stage in London's West End in 1949. She also won a Tony Award for her work in the Broadway musical version of Tovarich (1963). After completing her drama school education, Leigh appeared in small roles in four films in 1935 and progressed to the role of heroine in Fire Over England (1937). Leigh was born Vivian Mary Hartley on 5 November 1913 in British India on the campus of St. Paul's School, Darjeeling. She was the only child of Ernest Richard Hartley, a British broker, and his wife, Gertrude Mary Frances (nee Yackjee; she also used her mother's maiden name of Robinson). Her father was born in Scotland in 1882, while her mother, a devout Roman Catholic, was born in Darjeeling in 1888 and was of Irish descent. Gertrude's parents, who lived in India, were Michael John Yackjee (born 1840), a man of independent means, and Mary Teresa Robinson (born 1856), who was born to an Irish family killed during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and grew up in an orphanage, where she met Yackjee; they married in 1872 and had five children, of whom Gertrude was the youngest. Ernest and Gertrude Hartley were married in 1912 in Kensington, London. In 1917, Ernest Hartley was transferred to Bangalore as an officer in the Indian Cavalry, while Gertrude and Vivian stayed in Ootacamund. At the age of three, young Vivian made her first stage appearance for her mother's amateur theatre group, reciting \\"Little Bo Peep\\". Gertrude Hartley tried to instill an appreciation of literature in her daughter and introduced her to the works of Hans Christian Andersen, Lewis Carroll and Rudyard Kipling, as well as stories of Greek mythology and Indian folklore. At the age of six, Vivian was sent by her mother from Loreto Convent, Darjeeling, to the Convent of the Sacred Heart (now Woldingham School) then situated in Roehampton, southwest London. One of her friends there was future actress Maureen O'Sullivan, two years her senior, to whom Vivian expressed her desire to become \\"a great actress\\". She was removed from the school by her father, and travelling with her parents for four years, she attended schools in Europe, notably in Dinard, Biarritz, San Remo and Paris, becoming fluent in both French and Italian. The family returned to Britain in 1931. She attended A Connecticut Yankee, one of O'Sullivan's films playing in London's West End, and told her parents of her ambitions to become an actress. Shortly after, her father enrolled Vivian at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London. Vivian met Herbert Leigh Holman, known as Leigh Holman, a barrister 13 years her senior, in 1931. Despite his disapproval of \\"theatrical people\\", they married on 20 December 1932 and she terminated her studies at RADA, her attendance and interest in acting having already waned after meeting Holman.

The key factors contributing to Tampa Bay's superior performance include a robust offense, a sturdy defense, and a strategic approach by the coaching staff. 1. Robust offense: One of Tampa Bay's strongest assets is their remarkable offensive line, which includes skilled quarterbacks, powerful running backs, and agile wide receivers to create several scoring opportunities. Their cohesive teamwork, communication, and execution are factors that enabled them to outscore their opponents. 2. Sturdy defense: Tampa Bay exhibited an impenetrable defense, making it difficult for their opponents to gain ground and score points. The team's defensive tackles, linebackers, and pass-rushers worked together seamlessly, forcing turnovers and taking full advantage of any offensive mistakes made by the opposing team. 3. Strategic approach: Tampa Bay's coaching staff played a significant role in their superior performance. The coaching staff’s ability to read their opponents, and to adjust the game plan accordingly, showcased the strategic prowess that made it difficult for their rivals to catch up. Implications of the Halftime Lead Leading at halftime brings several advantages to a team, such as: 1. Boost in team morale: A dominant performance during the first half helps increase the team's confidence, allowing them to maintain a positive mindset going into the second half. 2. Pressure on opponents: A substantial lead puts immense pressure on the opposing team to attempt risky plays and make quick decisions that may lead to errors, which can then be exploited by the leading team. 3.

The Bonanno Family's power reached its peak in the mid-20th century, but a series of internal conflicts in the late 20th century weakened their influence. 2. The Colombo Family: Established by Joseph Profaci, the Colombo Family focused on criminal activities such as racketeering, gambling, and labor racketeering. With a history of almost constant internal feuds, the Colombo Family is notorious for the two bloody Colombo Wars, which spanned between the 1960s and 1990s. 3. The Gambino Family: Considered one of the most powerful of the Five Families, the Gambino Family was originally led by founder Carlo Gambino. The family's criminal activities encompassed a wide range of endeavors, including prostitution, extortion, and robbery. At its pinnacle in the 20th century, the Gambino family controlled major ports and airports in New York and was heavily involved in construction, garment, and waste-management industries. 4. The Genovese Family: Often referred to as the \\"Ivy League\\" of organized crime, the Genovese Family was founded by Charles \\"Lucky\\" Luciano. Engaging in illegal activities such as loan sharking, extortion, and labor racketeering, the Genovese Family demonstrated a capacity for planning and organizing large-scale criminal enterprises. The family's influence stretched from New York City to other parts of the United States and even into foreign countries. 5. The Lucchese Family: Established by Gaetano \\"Tommy\\" Reina, the Lucchese Family was involved in a variety of criminal ventures, including narcotics, prostitution, and illegal gambling. Although less powerful than the Gambino or Genovese families, the Lucchese Family was nevertheless a significant force in the New York Mafia scene during the 20th century. Each of the Five Families was governed by a boss, underboss, and consigliere, who led a structured hierarchy of capos and soldiers. The families operated within a code of conduct known as omertà, which mandated absolute loyalty and secrecy from its members. They collaborated and sometimes shared territories, resources, and power, but they also competed and engaged in conflicts with each other. Throughout the 20th century, the Five Families demonstrated their influence in various realms of society, from politics and labor unions to legitimate businesses and the entertainment industry. However, increased scrutiny and successful legal actions in the late 20th century, spearheaded by the FBI and federal prosecutors, weakened the families' influence. By the 21st century, the Five Families' control over the Mafia in New York City had significantly diminished, but their legacy remains as a reminder of an important era in the city's history."},{"instruction":"Q:What's the full name of the man who suggested the Chili Peppers record in Houdini's former mansion? Answer the above question based on the context below: Now settled into Warner Bros. Records, the Chili Peppers began looking for a suitable producer. One in particular, Rick Rubin, stood out, as he was more broadminded than people the band had worked with in the past, even though Rubin had turned down the chance to produce their 1987 album The Uplift Mofo Party Plan due to the drug problems of Kiedis and guitarist Hillel Slovak (who would die of a heroin overdose a year later). Unlike the Peppers' previous producers, Rubin was someone the band felt confident in to ask for guidance and input during times of difficulty. He would often help arrange drum beats, guitar melodies and lyrics.The band sought to record the album in an unconventional setting, believing it would enhance their creative output. Rubin suggested the mansion magician Harry Houdini once lived in, to which they agreed. A crew was hired to set up a recording studio and other equipment required for production in the house in Los Angeles. The Peppers decided they would remain inside the mansion for the duration of recording, though according to Kiedis, Smith was convinced the location was haunted, and refused to stay. He would, instead, come each day by motorcycle. Smith himself disputes this account, and instead claims the real reason he did not stay at The Mansion was because he wanted to be with his wife. Frusciante, however, disagreed with Smith, and said \\"There are definitely ghosts in the house,\\" and Frusciante felt they were \\"very friendly. We [the band] have nothing but warm vibes and happiness everywhere we go in this house.\\"Frusciante, Kiedis, and Flea each had their own rooms in the house. When not recording with the band, Frusciante would spend his time painting, listening to music, reading and recording songs he'd written. Due to the seclusion, Kiedis ended up recording all his vocals in his room, as it was large enough to accommodate the recording equipment. For more than 30 days, the Chili Peppers worked inside the house; Kiedis felt it was an accommodating and resourceful environment...

Most rods have stops at the end to prevent the curtains from falling off. Screw off one stop so you can slide on the curtains and secure them to the rod. Some curtains are attached to the rod by curtain rings while others are threaded directly through the rod. Consult the instruction manual your curtains came with if you're unsure. After you've attached the curtains, screw the stop back onto the end of your rod. Hang your curtain rod back onto the brackets to assess how your curtains look. If your measurements were correct and the brackets installed at a level angle, your curtains should enhance the look of your window. If your curtains are too heavy for the brackets, you may need heavy-duty brackets or a rod with added support. Cut your fabric slightly longer than your desired length, then pin your fabric up with needles. Use a sewing machine to hem the curtain in a straight, even line. Make your hem 1 inch (2.5 cm) longer than you expect you'll need to avoid shortening your curtains too much. If the curtain rods are uneven, your curtains may appear crooked or uneven. Measure your curtain rod with a level again and re-adjust the brackets as needed until the rods are straight. Summary:","output":"To hang curtains, first make sure your brackets can hold the rod. Remove the rod and take off one end stop. Slide the curtains onto the rod using rings or threading them directly. Check the instructions if you're not sure how. Put the stop back on and hang the rod on the brackets. If your curtains are too heavy, try stronger brackets or a better rod. If you need to fix the length, cut the fabric a little longer than you want, pin it, and sew a straight hem. Make sure the rod is straight and fix the brackets if needed."},{"instruction":"1.
