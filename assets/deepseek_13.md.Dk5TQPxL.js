Given a passage and a query based on the passage, generate an unambiguous, concise and simple answer to the query from information in the passage. Note that the answer may not be present in exact form. Do not allow your baby to crawl, walk around, or go to bed with the bottle. Doing so turns the bottle into a comfort item, may hinder two-handed development, and can lead to dental cavities. Offer the cup first, then the bottle. And it ends when the child no longer breastfeeds or takes a bottle. This process may last several weeks, a few months, or more than a year. Your baby may begin eating solid foods at about 6 months of age. At this point, you may want to offer cup-feeding to supplement breast- or bottle-feedings. How long does engorgement last? Fortunately, engorgement passes pretty quickly for most women. You can expect it to ease up in 24 to 48 hours if you're nursing well or pumping at least every two to three hours. If not treated, engorgement can take up to ten days to start to go away. Once the engorgement passes, your breasts will be softer, although still full of milk. If you're not nursing, it will probably get worse before it gets better. Here are some things you can do to reduce your chances of becoming engorged: 1 Breastfeed within two hours after birth if possible. (Your labor and delivery team should be able to help you with this.) 2 Nurse frequently – between eight and 12 times a day after the first 24 hours. The pain and discomfort from breast engorgement improve as your breasts stop making milk. You will likely feel better in 1 to 5 days. Home treatment, such as applying cold packs to the breasts, may relieve some of your symptoms. Don't worry -- the kind of fullness you feel in the beginning doesn't last, and your body is still making plenty of milk even if it doesn't feel that way. 7 Means of Relief It should only last for the first week or so, but engorgement can be painful for some women. Weaning is a gradual process. It starts when you begin giving solid food to your baby and ends when the child no longer breast - feeds or takes a bottle. This process may last a few months or more than a year.A rough outline of this process is as follows: Your baby begins eating solid foods at 4 to 6 months of age. Here are some things you can do to reduce your chances of becoming engorged: 1 Breastfeed within two hours after birth if possible. 2 Nurse frequently – between eight and 12 times a day after the first 24 hours. 3 Let your baby finish nursing on one breast before switching to other. Here's how you can make breastfeeding more comfortable and ease engorgement: 1 Just before nursing, place a warm compress on your breasts for a few minutes to get the milk flowing. 2 Nurse frequently, with no more than two to three hours between feedings. 3 While your baby is nursing, gently massage the breast he's on. Engorged breasts take place, because of the pressure of expanding cells, due to the new breast milk contained inside of them. Engorgement happens when the milk producing cells, are uncomfortably full. Engorgement is sometimes apparent in the areola and/or the breast; in one breast or in both breasts. (you may have just one engorged, sore swollen breast) Dealing with engorgement on top of having a new baby to care for, day and night, may be discouraging to a mother. The good news is, there are ways to treat breast engorgement. How Long does Engorgement Last? Nursing engorgement is temporary and usually only lasts three days, or until the mother's body has adapted to the needs of her baby. Breastfeeding and engorgement can also happen as a result of missed feeds or incorrect latching, which results in milk being left behind in the breast. Query: how long does engorgement last Output:","output":"Engorgement usually lasts 24 to 48 hours if nursing well or pumping every two to three hours. If not treated, it can take up to ten days to start to go away."},{"instruction":"Sentence: \\"We painted the chairs all red.\\" Pick from options: would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?

Which car would emit less unburned hydrocarbons, car A or car B? John is an automotive enthusiast. He was visiting the auto show in his city. Two cars caught his attention, car A and car B. Car A was newer and it had catalytic converter. On the contrary, car B was older and didn't have catalytic converter. But he found the design of older car more attractive. Hint: Catalytic converters in cars increase the rates of several important reactions. Unburned hydrocarbons can more easily be converted to carbon dioxide and water in the presence of a catalyst. Additionally, carbon monoxide (a harmful gas produced by incomplete combustion of fuel) is further oxidized to carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide compounds (which contribute to smog and acid rain) are transformed back into nitrogen and oxygen gases. By passing car exhaust over these catalysts before their release into the air, the emissions from a combustion engine are made into much less harmful substances, resulting in a much cleaner atmosphere.","output":"Based on the given information, car A would emit less unburned hydrocarbons compared to car B. The reason behind this is the presence of a catalytic converter in car A, which leads to a significant reduction in harmful emissions. Catalytic converters play a crucial role in minimizing the levels of unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrous oxide compounds in a car's exhaust. These harmful emissions are a result of the incomplete combustion of fuel in the engine. The catalysts present within the catalytic converter increase the rate of chemical reactions, helping to break down these harmful substances into less harmful ones before they are released into the atmosphere. In car A, the catalytic converter allows unburned hydrocarbons to be more easily converted into carbon dioxide and water. Additionally, it aids in further oxidation of carbon monoxide (another harmful gas) to carbon dioxide and helps transform nitrous oxide compounds back into nitrogen and oxygen gases. As a result, car A releases significantly less harmful substances into the atmosphere, contributing to cleaner air. On the other hand, car B is older and does not have a catalytic converter. Therefore, it is unable to break down the harmful emissions as effectively as car A. Car B would emit higher levels of unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrous oxide compounds, which have negative environmental consequences, such as air pollution, smog, and acid rain. In conclusion, car A, with its newer design and the presence of a catalytic converter, is the better choice in terms of reduced emissions and environmental impact. While car B may have a more attractive design, its lack of a catalytic converter leads to higher emissions of unburned hydrocarbons and other harmful gases."},{"instruction":"Why are most mechanical engineers single? Why do engineers stay single? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? pick from the following. *no. *yes.","output":"Yes, these two questions are paraphrases of each other, as both inquire about the reasons why engineers, specifically mechanical engineers, tend to remain single or unmarried. Here is a detailed answer for the topic. To ascertain why mechanical engineers, and engineers in general, are perceived as predominantly single, we need to investigate multiple influences, including professional demands, personality traits, stereotypes, and social skills. It is essential to remember that each individual is unique, and viewing all engineers as single is an oversimplification that does not take into account the personal experiences and circumstances of each person. 1. Workload and time commitments: Mechanical engineering and engineering fields, in general, require significant time and energy dedication. Engineers often work long hours on complex projects or intricate problem-solving tasks, which may affect their ability to maintain and nurture romantic relationships. The demanding nature of their profession may make it challenging to balance work and personal life. 2. Stereotypes: Engineers have long been associated with stereotypes of being introverted, awkward, or possessing poor social skills. These preconceived notions may impact people's perceptions of engineers as potential romantic partners and may cause potential mates to shy away from pursuing a relationship. It is important to recognize that stereotypes do not reflect reality, and each person has their unique combination of traits and talents. 3. Personality traits: Many engineers are logical, analytical thinkers who focus on details and precision. These personality traits may make it difficult for them to communicate openly about their thoughts and feelings, and they may struggle with expressing emotions. Communication is a critical factor in maintaining a healthy relationship, and challenges in this area could contribute to engineers staying single. 4. Social skills: Engineers typically spend a considerable amount of their education and professional life concentrating on technical skills. As a result, they may not have had as much opportunity to develop their social skills as individuals in other careers. This lack of experience in social situations may lead to difficulties in forming deep, emotional connections, resulting in remaining single or struggling to cultivate lasting relationships. 5. Lifestyle preferences: Some engineers may simply prefer to stay single out of personal choice or prioritize other aspects of their lives, such as career advancement or personal development. Furthermore, others may intentionally focus on their professional goals before seeking a romantic partner, potentially delaying the formation of a long-term relationship. In conclusion, several factors may contribute to the perception that many engineers remain single. However, it is crucial to recognize and respect the diverse experiences and personal choices of each individual, as these factors may not apply to everyone."},{"instruction":"Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

While entertaining a girl in his dorm room, he finds that when he reads from his adolescent journals, he travels back in time, and he is able to \\"redo\\" parts of his past, thereby causing the blackouts he experienced as a child. There are consequences to his choices, however, that then propagate back to his present life: his alternate futures vary from college student, to prisoner, to amputee. His efforts are driven by the desire to undo the most unpleasant events of his childhood which coincide with his mysterious blackouts, including saving his childhood sweetheart Kayleigh (Amy Smart) from being molested by her father (Eric Stoltz) and tormented by her sadistic brother (William Lee Scott).The actions he takes, and those he enables others to take during his blackouts, change the timeline in the new future where he awakes. As he continues to do this he realizes that even though his intentions are good his actions have unforeseen consequences. Moreover, the assimilation of dozens of years' worth of new memories from the alternate timelines causes him brain damage and severe nosebleeds.

Inquire about potentially free or discounted products for incontinence. Chances are the nurses on campus have encountered students with similar issues, so don’t feel embarrassed about any questions or issues you may have. If you’d like to avoid having to use a public restroom every day, you may want to request a room with a private bathroom. There is no guarantee that the school will be able to honor your request; however, it’s worth asking about. You’ll need to involve your doctor from home in the process. School guidelines for submitting such a request vary, so check with them once you’ve been admitted to see what their policy is. Don’t wait until you arrive on campus to make the request. It may be that you feel most comfortable having a space of your own. Again, policies will vary by school, but some require that requests be made yearly for such accommodations. You will also need documentation from your family doctor when submitting the request. Single rooms tend to fill up fast, so make the request early!

The answer is:","output":"The missing first step of the following process is: 1. Heating a source of water to its boiling point to transform it into steam. In order to better understand the whole process of electricity generation through steam, here is a detailed breakdown of the steps involved: 1. Heating water to generate steam: The first step is to heat a source of water, usually in a boiler or steam generator, to transform it into steam. This process requires heat energy, which can be sourced from various methods such as burning fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, or oil), nuclear fission, biomass combustion, geothermal heat, or concentrated solar power. 2. Steam is produced under pressure: As the water is heated, it turns into steam and starts to build up pressure inside the boiler or steam generator. The pressure is critical for efficient energy transfer and to prevent the steam from turning back into water droplets. The steam’s temperature and pressure will depend on the design and requirements of the power plant. 3. Steam flows into a turbine: Once the steam has reached the desired pressure and temperature, it is channeled through pipes into a steam turbine. The turbine consists of an array of blades connected to a central shaft. When the high-pressure steam encounters the turbine blades, it pushes them and causes the shaft to rotate. 4. The turbine spins: As the steam moves through the turbine's stages, its pressure decreases, causing the blades to spin around the central shaft. The steam turbine can have multiple sections or stages, with each stage efficiently utilizing the steam's kinetic energy and pressure to keep the shaft spinning at a steady pace. 5. Creating electricity: The spinning turbine shaft is connected to an electrical generator. As the shaft rotates, it spins the magnets within the generator, creating a magnetic field that induces an electric current to flow in the surrounding coils. This generated electric current, alternating current (AC), is then transformed into the appropriate voltage levels by transformers before being transmitted to the electrical grid for distribution to homes and businesses. Each stage of this process is critical for efficient and reliable electricity generation from steam, as a missing step or inefficiency can significantly impact the overall effectiveness of the power plant. The first step, heating water to generate steam, is the essential missing element in the original question, providing the foundation upon which the entire energy conversion process is built."},{"instruction":"Background: Once is a 2007 Irish romantic musical drama film written and directed by John Carney. The film stars Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova as two struggling musicians in Dublin, Ireland. Hansard and Irglova had previously performed music as the Swell Season, and composed and performed the film's original songs. Once spent years in development with the Irish Film Board and was made for a budget of EUR112,000. Context: Once was met with extremely positive reviews from critics. Upon its March 2007 release in Ireland, RTE's Caroline Hennessy gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and termed it \\"an unexpected treasure\\". About the acting, this Irish reviewer commented, \\"Once has wonderfully natural performances from the two leads. Although musicians first and actors second, they acquit themselves well in both areas. Irglova, a largely unknown quantity alongside the well-known and either loved or loathed Hansard, is luminous.\\" Michael Dwyer of The Irish Times gave the film the same rating, calling it \\"irresistibly appealing\\" and noting that \\"Carney makes the point - without ever labouring it - that his protagonists are living in a changing city where the economic boom has passed them by. His keen eye for authentic locations is ... evident\\". In May, on Ebert & Roeper, both Richard Roeper and guest critic Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave enthusiastic reviews. Phillips called it, \\"the most charming thing I've seen all year\\", \\"the Brief Encounter for the 21st century\\", his favorite music film since 1984's Stop Making Sense and said, \\"It may well be the best music film of our generation\\". Roeper referred to the film's recording studio scene as \\"more inspirational and uplifting than almost any number of Dreamgirls or Chicago or any of those multi-zillion dollar musical showstopping films. In its own way, it will blow you away.\\" Once won very high marks from U.S. critics; it is rated 97% \\"fresh\\" by the film review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes and scored a grade of 88 (\\"universal acclaim\\") according to Metacritic. In late 2007, Amy Simmons of Time Out London wrote, \\"Carney's highly charged, urban mise-en-scene with its blinking street lamps, vacant shops and dishevelled bed-sits provides ample poetic backdrop for the film's lengthy tracking shots, epitomised in a sequence where the Girl walks to the corner shop in pyjamas and slippers while listening to one of the Guy's songs on her personal stereo. With outstanding performances from Hansard and new-comer Irglova, Carney has created a sublime, visual album of unassuming and self-assured eloquence.\\" The Telegraph's Sukhdev Sandhu said, \\"Not since Before Sunset has a romantic film managed to be as touching, funny or as hard to forget as Once. Like Before Sunset, it never outstays its welcome, climaxing on a note of rare charm and unexpectedness.\\" The film appeared on many North American critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2007: In 2008, the film placed third on Entertainment Weekly's \\"25 Best Romantic Movies of the Past 25 Years\\".

At night, she works in the FBI's cybercrime division with Griffin Dowd (Colin Hanks), fighting identity theft and similar crimes. One night, an anonymous tip leads them to a website called KillWithMe.com. The site features a streaming video of a cat being tortured and killed. The website cannot be shut down, as the creator knew that someone would try and built into it a fail-safe; every time the server is closed, a mirror server immediately replaces it. After the cat's death, KillWithMe.com's webmaster graduates to human victims and makes their deaths correlate directly with the number of hits the site receives. At a press conference, the public is urged to avoid the website, but as Jennifer feared this only increases the site's popularity. The videos are recorded in the killer's basement and his victims include a helicopter pilot (bled to death by injections of anticoagulant), a newscaster (burnt to death by heat lamps while cemented into the floor), and Griffin Dowd (killed by slowly increasing the concentration of sulfuric acid solution in which he is submerged up to his neck). At first it seems the victims were randomly chosen, but this is revealed to be untrue: the first two victims were chosen because they were part of filming or presenting the suicide of a junior college teacher. The teacher's unstable techno prodigy son, Owen Reilly (Joseph Cross), broke down and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. When released, he decided to take revenge and prove a point; that the public's interest in the suffering of others is insatiable, as well as to wreak vengeance on those he felt had exploited his father's death.

Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

Paragraph : For a given medium, sound waves travel more slowly at lower temperatures. Question: When it is very warm what happens to the speed of items speed up or slow down? A:","output":"When it is very warm, the speed of sound waves in a given medium tends to increase. This occurs due to the relationship between temperature and the properties of the medium through which sound waves travel. In the paragraph, it states that \\"for a given medium, sound waves travel more slowly at lower temperatures.\\" This implies that as the temperature decreases, the speed of sound waves also decreases in that medium. Consequently, when the temperature increases or becomes very warm, the speed of sound waves would be expected to increase. To provide more context, let's consider how temperature affects the properties of a medium, such as air. Air is a mixture of gas molecules that constantly move and collide with each other. When the air temperature increases, the gas molecules gain kinetic energy, causing them to move faster. This increased movement leads to more frequent and forceful collisions between the molecules, which in turn increase the speed at which sound waves can travel through the air. The same concept can be applied to other mediums, such as water or solid materials, for which the speed of sound waves is also influenced by temperature. As the temperature of the medium increases, the atoms or molecules within that medium experience increased movement and transmit sound waves more efficiently. So, to answer the question, when it is very warm, the speed of sound waves in a given medium generally increases, or \\"speeds up,\\" when compared to the same medium under lower temperature conditions."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: A piece of text from one of these 5 languages - French, English, Dutch, Somali, Tagalog is given.

Peabody chief executive Stephen Howlett will retire, with Family Mosaic's Brendan Sarsfield taking the helm. Lord Kerslake, Peabody's chairman who will remain in-post, said the combined group will be able to achieve more \\"together than we could achieve alone\\". Housing associations are non-profit organisations providing social housing, with any surplus money used for maintenance of properties. The sector is undergoing a transformation after the government launched a voluntary right-to-buy scheme for housing association tenants. The first sales under the policy took place in September. The scheme builds on a policy introduced by the Tories in the 1980s, which allowed council house tenants to buy their homes. This proved hugely popular, but has been blamed for contributing to the lack of affordable housing. Ministers have promised that each house sold under the new system will be replaced on a one-for-one basis, although there are still question marks over how the policy will be refunded and properties replaced. The government has also imposed annual rental cuts of 1% a year on housing association tenants. A larger, merged group should have better access to financing and resources to build more homes. Peabody is involved in big regeneration plans for Thamesmead in east London. Last week Affinity Sutton and Circle Housing Group merged to become the largest housing association in the UK, and one of the largest housebuilders. It aims to build 50,000 new homes in the next 10 years. Sir Robin Young, chairman of Clarion Housing, said that by \\"combining forces\\" it was rising to the government's challenge that housing associations \\"deliver more for less\\". Also on Wednesday, the L&Q and East Thames associations announced the completion of their merger and details of a Â£2.6bn financing package to fund the building of new homes. More mergers between the UK's 1,500 housing associations look likely. Due to be completed in July 2017, the latest deal will bring together London-based Family Mosaic's portfolio of 26,000 homes across London, Essex and the South East with Peabody's 29,000 homes in London. The new Peabody will have 111,000 residents. This article was about:","output":"This article is about two groups, Peabody and Family Mosaic, joining together to make a new group called Peabody.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Friday Night Lights Context: Bissinger followed the team for the entire 1988 season, which culminated in a loss in the State semi-finals against Carter High School from Dallas, who eventually went on to win the championship game but would have their title stripped for playing an ineligible player. However, the book also deals with or alludes to a number of secondary political and social issues existing in Odessa, all of which share ties to the Permian Panthers football team. These include socioeconomic disparity; racism; segregation (and desegregation); and poverty.The coach, Gary Gaines, is constantly on the hot seat. After a loss, he comes back to see \\"For Sale\\" signs on his lawn. Tied into the successes and failure of the coach and the team in general are the conflicts the players struggle with on and off the gridiron. The coach overuses his star player, running back James \\"Boobie\\" Miles, who gets seriously injured (Miles tore his ACL, missed the playoffs, and had a limp for the rest of his life). When this happens, sports radios are flooded with calls for his resignation. Miles' once-arrogant attitude vanishes as he sees his once promising chance of playing big-time college football disappear and starts to question his future after he notices his not-so promising academic standing. Quarterback Mike Winchell struggles with being able to play consistently, and his inability to make decisions for himself. Fullback Don Billingsley has a rocky relationship with his father, who won a state championship at Permian and carries on a feud with his son for not performing on the level he'd like to see, despite the fact that Don doesn't do anything to light his father's temper. Third-string running back Chris Comer, who takes the spot of Miles after his injury, attempts to get rid of his fear of being hit and getting injured, especially when the player who last occupied his spot suffered a season ending injury. His obsession with fame and recognition also comes at a high price that he is at first not ready to pay. Safety Brian Chavez is harassed... Answer:","output":"Coach Gaines' job depends on the performance of the Permian Panthers football team. As the head coach, he is constantly under pressure to win games and maintain the team's success. If the team loses or if key players get injured, there is immense pressure from the community and sports radio calls for his resignation. His job security is closely tied to the successes and failures of the team, both on and off the field."},{"instruction":"Please add punctuation to this: This allows the intelligence of Windows to decide the correct software application to open your CLS file Punctuation version:","output":"This allows the intelligence of Windows to decide the correct software application to open your CLS file.

The first step was to incorporate all the keywords effectively into the context. To make the sentence flow smoothly, some prepositions, adjectives, and conjunctions were used. Each keyword was used in such a way that it forms a coherent thought with the rest. 2. The word 'Browns' was understood as a proper noun, hence placed in the sentence as a subject. 3. 'Cambridge' was used as a location descriptor for the subject, hinting at the geographical location of Browns. 4. The sentence was made descriptive by infusing it with adjectives. For example, the phrase \\"flavorful French food\\" is more descriptive and detailed than just saying 'food'. 5. 'French food' is used to indicate the type of cuisine served at Browns. 6. The keyword 'price range less than £20' is framed into a part stating that the restaurant's \\"most opulent dishes\\" cost less than £20, signifying affordability. 7. 'Customer rating average' is presented as a remark about the restaurant, demonstrating its achievements. 8. Last but not least, to link and end phrases in the sentence coherely, punctuation marks like comma were used properly.

Three major consequences that arise from this climactic process are: 1. Sea Level Rise: As the polar ice caps melt, a huge volume of water is added to the earth's oceans, leading to an overall rise in global sea levels. This higher oceanic water level has the potential to inundate low-lying coastal areas, resulting in the displacement of communities, loss of habitable land and infrastructure, and the destruction of crucial ecosystems such as mangroves and wetlands which act as natural barriers against hurricanes and typhoons. 2. Changes in Ocean Circulation and Climate Patterns: The melting polar ice caps can significantly alter the distribution of heat on the planet, as they drastically change the salinity and temperature of the ocean. These changes can affect global ocean circulation patterns, including the Gulf Stream, which in turn can disrupt natural climate patterns. As a result, certain regions might experience intensified weather events such as hurricanes, storms, droughts, and floods, making it difficult for people and wildlife to adapt to the new climatic conditions. 3. Decline in Global Biodiversity: Changing climate conditions and the loss of natural habitats due to the melting polar ice caps are detrimental to the earth's biodiversity. Various species, particularly those adapted to live in polar and cold environments, may struggle to survive under changing conditions. This decline in global biodiversity may lead to a severe imbalance in ecosystems, loss of natural resources, and a reduction in nature's ability to provide essential services such as pollination, carbon sequestration, and water purification. To mitigate the negative impacts of this process, it is crucial for societies worldwide to take immediate action in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning toward the use of more sustainable and clean energy sources, protecting and restoring ecosystems, and fostering international cooperation and policy implementation efforts to adapt to and address the threats posed by climate change and melting polar ice caps."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're given a four sentences of story written in natural language.

It is classified in order Metzgeriales and is a member of the family Pelliaceae within that order. Unlike \\"Pellia\\", the other genus in the family, \\"Noteroclada\\" has a leafy appearance. - Jungermanniales is the largest order of liverworts. They are distinctive among the liverworts for having thin leaf-like flaps on either side of the stem. Most other liverworts are thalloid, with no leaves. - Metzgeriales is an order of liverworts. The group is sometimes called the simple thalloid liverworts: \\"thalloid\\" because the members lack structures resembling stems or leaves, and \\"simple\\" because their tissues are thin and relatively undifferentiated. All species in the order have a small gametophyte stage and a smaller, relatively short-lived, spore-bearing stage. Although these plants are almost entirely restricted to regions with high humidity or readily available moisture, the group as a whole is widely distributed, and occurs on every continent except Antarctica. - Pellia is a small but widespread genus of liverworts in the cool and temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is classified in order Metzgeriales and is a member of the family Pelliaceae within that order. - A leaf is an organ of a vascular plant and is the principal lateral appendage of the stem.

There are three universities in the City of Manchester. The University of Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan University and Royal Northern College of Music. The University of Manchester is the largest full-time non-collegiate university in the United Kingdom and was created in 2004 by the merger of Victoria University of Manchester founded in 1904 and UMIST, founded in 1956, though the university's logo appears to claim it was established in 1824. It includes the Manchester Business School, which offered the first MBA course in the UK in 1965. Manchester Metropolitan University was formed as Manchester Polytechnic on the merger of three colleges in 1970. It gained university status in 1992, and in the same year absorbed Crewe and Alsager College of Higher Education in South Cheshire. The University of Law, the largest provider of vocation legal training in Europe, has a campus in the city.The three Universities are grouped around Oxford Road on the southern side of the city centre, which forms Europe's largest urban higher education precinct. Together they have a combined population of 76,025 students in higher education as of 2015, although almost 6,000 of them were based at Manchester Metropolitan University's campuses at Crewe and Alsager in Cheshire.One of Manchester's most notable secondary schools is the Manchester Grammar School. Established in 1515, as a free grammar school next to what is now the Cathedral, it moved in 1931 to Old Hall Lane in Fallowfield, south Manchester, to accommodate the growing student body. In the post-war period, it was a direct grant grammar school (i.e. partially state funded), but it reverted to independent status in 1976 after abolition of the direct-grant system.

Stream-of-consciousness explanation: The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World are a collection of remarkable structures built by the humans of ancient civilizations. These architectural marvels were mostly documented by ancient historians like Herodotus and Callimachus of Cyrene. Let's briefly elaborate on each of the Seven Wonders and their current status: 1. The Great Pyramid of Giza: Built around 2580–2560 BC, this pyramid is the oldest and only existing wonder from the list. It served as the tomb of the Egyptian Pharaoh Khufu and is located in present-day Giza, Egypt. 2. Hanging Gardens of Babylon: These legendary gardens were built by King Nebuchadnezzar II around 600 BC in the city of Babylon, which is modern-day Iraq. The gardens no longer exist and their exact location is still a topic of debate among historians. 3. Temple of Artemis at Ephesus: This temple, dedicated to the goddess Artemis, was constructed in the ancient Greek city of Ephesus (present-day Turkey) around 550 BC. The temple was destroyed and rebuilt multiple times before it was eventually abandoned, and its remains no longer exist. 4. Statue of Zeus at Olympia: Created by the ancient Greek sculptor Phidias around 435 BC, this magnificent statue of the god Zeus was housed in Olympia, Greece. The statue was eventually destroyed by a fire in the 5th or 6th century AD. 5. Mausoleum at Halicarnassus: This tomb was built for Mausolus, a Persian satrap, by his wife Artemisia II around 353-350 BC, in Halicarnassus, which is now modern-day Turkey. The tomb was eventually destroyed by a series of earthquakes. 6. Colossus of Rhodes: This giant bronze statue, depicting the sun-god Helios, was built around 280 BC on the Greek island of Rhodes. Unfortunately, it only stood for about 54 years before it was toppled by an earthquake in 226 BC. 7. Lighthouse of Alexandria: Also known as the Pharos of Alexandria, this lighthouse was constructed around 280 BC on the island of Pharos, near the city of Alexandria in Egypt. The lighthouse was severely damaged by earthquakes, and its ruins were eventually cleared away. In conclusion, out of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, only the Great Pyramid of Giza still exists today, while the other six wonders no longer exist due to various factors such as natural disasters, human interference, and the passage of time."},{"instruction":"Sentence 1: The amount of the payment reflects the difference between (a) the benefits that the OASDHI trust funds would have paid to railroad workers and their families if railroad employment had been covered by OASDHI and (b) the payroll taxes that the OASDHI trust funds would have received if railroad employment had been covered by OASDHI.

Cancel out the common factors.\\"","output":"Title: Simplifying Fractions: The Prime Factorization Method Introduction Fractions are a fundamental tool for understanding ratios, proportions, and the properties of rational numbers. Simplifying a fraction to its lowest form allows for easier calculations and forms a more visually appealing representation. In this article, we'll explore a popular method for simplifying fractions: the prime factorization method. Prime factorization involves finding the prime factors of the numerator and the denominator, writing the prime factorization of each number, and canceling out the common factors. Understanding this technique is essential for anyone working with fractions, whether in a mathematics course, a scientific discipline, or any other context that involves rational numbers. Breaking It Down: Prime Factors and Prime Factorization Prime factors are the foundation of the prime factorization method. A prime number is a natural number greater than one that cannot be broken down into smaller factors (i.e., divisible only by one and itself). Examples of prime numbers include 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on. Prime factorization is the process of breaking a composite number down into the product of its smallest possible prime factors. For example, the prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 × 3 × 5, as 60 = (2 × 2) × 3 × 5. The Process: Step-by-Step Guide to Simplifying Fractions Using Prime Factorization Step 1: Find the Prime Factors of the Numerator and Denominator The first step in simplifying a fraction is to find the prime factors of both the numerator and the denominator. Finding the prime factors of a number involves dividing the number by prime numbers, starting with the smallest and making your way up. For example, if you need to find the prime factors of 36, you'd start by dividing by 2, 3, 5, and so on. When the result is no longer divisible by a given prime number, move on to the next prime number. Repeat the process until the result is a prime number. In our example: 36 ÷ 2 = 18 (1st factor: 2) 18 ÷ 2 = 9 (2nd factor: 2) 9 ÷ 3 = 3 (3rd factor: 3 and last factor: 3) So, the prime factors of 36 are 2, 2, 3, and 3. Step 2: Write the Prime Factorization of Each Number Next, write down the prime factors found in the previous step in their exponent form. For example, considering our previous example where we found the prime factors of 36. We write: 36 = 2^2 × 3^2 Constructing the fraction's prime factorization can help in visualizing the common factors that will be canceled out. Step 3: Cancel Out the Common Factors Once you have the prime factorization of both the numerator and the denominator, it's time to cancel out the common factors. To do this, simply divide both the numerator and the denominator by the common prime factors. For example, consider the fraction: 36/48 From Step 1: Prime factors of 36: 2, 2, 3, and 3 Prime factors of 48: 2, 2, 2, and 2 × 3 From Step 2: Prime factorization of 36: 2^2 × 3^2 Prime factorization of 48: 2^4 × 3 Cancel out the common factors: (2^2 × 3^2) / (2^4 × 3) Cancelling out two powers of 2 and one power of 3 from both the numerator and denominator, we get: 2^0 × 3^1 / 2^2 × 3^0, which simplifies to 3/4. So the simplified fraction is 3/4. Final Thoughts: The Importance of Simplifying Fractions Simplifying fractions is crucial for many reasons. It not only streamlines calculations and promotes a better understanding of proportions and ratios but also helps build a solid foundation for more advanced mathematical concepts. By mastering the prime factorization technique, you'll be able to tackle fractions with confidence and ease, enabling you to operate effectively in any context where rational numbers must be manipulated and understood."},{"instruction":"A pipe can fill a cistern in 18 minutes whereas the cistern when fill can be emptied by a leak in 36 minutes. When both pipes are opened, find when the cistern will be full? Options: (A) 17 (B) 36 (C) 70 (D) 13 (E) 12 Stream of consciousness first, then make a decision:","output":"In order to solve this problem, we will work with the rates at which the pipe fills the cistern and the leak empties it. Then, we will find the combined rate and use it to determine the time it takes for the cistern to be full when both the pipe and the leak are open. 1. Determine the fill rate of the pipe and the empty rate of the leak. - The pipe fills the cistern in 18 minutes. Therefore, the fill rate of the pipe is 1/18 of the cistern per minute. - The leak empties the cistern in 36 minutes. Therefore, the empty rate of the leak is 1/36 of the cistern per minute. 2. Calculate the combined rate of filling and emptying. - Subtract the empty rate of the leak from the fill rate of the pipe to get the combined rate. - Combined_rate = (1/18) - (1/36) - To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 36 in this case. - (1/18) = 2/36 - Combined_rate = (2/36) - (1/36) = 1/36 3. Find the time it takes to fill the cistern with this combined rate. - The combined rate is 1/36, which means it takes 1/36th of the cistern per minute to fill up or empty out, depending on the positive or negative value. Since the value is positive, it shows that the cistern is being filled up eventually. - To find the time it takes to fill up the cistern with this combined rate, we can invert the fraction (since rate * time = work done, and the work done is equal to 1 as it represents a full cistern). - Time = 36/1 = 36 minutes Hence, the cistern will be full in 36 minutes when both the pipe and the leak are open.

These small strawbale buildings are within the financial grasp of so many more people yearning to live well on this planet, instead of trying to fill 3000 square feet of inflated ego and empty dreams. Go for it! Answer: Answer:","output":"The tone of this product review is largely positive. Despite initially setting up a critical stance against 'McMansions' and the owners' vanity, the review quickly shifts and presents a counter-argument, praising the book for its promotion of comfortable, modest living. In their commentary, the reviewer provides the core essence of the book, which according to them, advocates for the construction of eco-friendly structures just big enough for an individual's comfort, rather than succumbing to societal pressures of owning larger, more ostentatious houses. This is seen by the reviewer as a virtue, emphasizing an ethical approach to living and housing. Additionally, the reviewer highlights the affordability of the small strawbale buildings promoted in the book, another positive attribute as it aligns with the book's message of sustainability and modesty. Suggesting these constructions are 'within the financial grasp of so many more people' means more individuals can actualize the dream of homeownership, without the need for extravagant and unnecessarily large spaces. The review concludes with a positive and rallying cry of \\"Go for it!\\", once again reinforcing the reviewer's positive evaluation of the book and making it apparent that they endorse and recommend the book's concept and message. Therefore, while the review begins pessimistically criticizing societal standards of living and housing, the bulk of the review focuses on the book's merits, which the reviewer wholeheartedly supports and endorses, thus resulting in a largely positive tone."},{"instruction":"Al Overton (May 20, 1912 – August 1, 1985) was an American sound engineer.

For some reason today hes very curious about the things that he sees. He looks around as hes driving and the street lights catch his attention. He realizes that he's never seen someone changing the bulbs in a street light. He also wonders if its a film on the light that makes them have that color or something inside. But I can use this background: A vapor light produces visible light by electroluminescence. The bulb contains a small amount of solid sodium or mercury as well as a mixture of neon and argon gases. When an electric current passes through the gases, it causes the solid sodium or mercury to change to a gas and emit visible light. Sodium vapor lights, like these streetlights, produce yellowish light. Mercury vapor lights produce bluish light. Vapor lights are very bright and energy efficient. The bulbs are also long lasting. What is an answer for this question: Given a vapor light and a regular light bulb, which one is more energy efficient, the vapor light or the regular light bulb? The answer to this question is:","output":"The vapor light is more energy efficient than the regular light bulb. To understand the energy efficiency difference between vapor lights and regular light bulbs, it's important to compare their respective technologies, energy consumption, and light output. Vapor lights, such as sodium vapor or mercury vapor lights, work through a process of electroluminescence, wherein an electric current is passed through a mixture of gases to produce visible light. This technology allows for the creation of bright, long-lasting illumination with lower energy consumption. Sodium vapor lights, commonly used in streetlights, produce a yellowish light, while mercury vapor lights produce a bluish light. Both types of vapor lights are more energy efficient than incandescent light bulbs, which rely on heating a tungsten filament to produce light. Incandescent bulbs produce a significant amount of heat in addition to light, which results in wasted energy. In terms of energy efficiency, compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) and light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs are also worth mentioning. CFLs work by passing an electric current through a gas to create ultraviolet (UV) light, which then interacts with a phosphor coating inside the bulb to produce visible light. LEDs generate light through the movement of electrons within a semiconductor material. Both CFLs and LEDs are considered more energy efficient than incandescent bulbs and have longer lifespans. However, vapor lights still outperform CFLs and LEDs when it comes to brightness, making them ideal for outdoor applications that require high-intensity illumination, such as streetlights. In conclusion, vapor lights are more energy-efficient than regular light bulbs, particularly incandescent bulbs, due to their method of producing light through electroluminescence rather than heat generation. This makes them a better choice for situations where bright, long-lasting illumination is required, with the added benefit of reduced energy consumption."},{"instruction":"Instructions: This task is about translating a given English language sentence to Yoruba language.

Be on the lookout for increased bodily aches and pains as a trigger for depression. It is essential to pay close attention to these subtle signs, as they might indicate that an older person is struggling with their mental health. Furthermore, these physical symptoms might also limit their ability to participate in social activities, which could exacerbate feelings of isolation and loneliness, both of which are potential factors contributing to depression. Additionally, it's crucial to observe changes in behavior and daily routines, such as loss of interest in hobbies and a decrease in social interactions. Seniors who are struggling with depression might also show increased irritability and a lack of motivation, making it difficult for them to engage in self-care and maintain a healthy lifestyle. In some cases, older adults might even exhibit cognitive symptoms, such as difficulty concentrating, memory problems, and slower thought processes. Depression in elderly individuals is a complex issue, and recognizing the signs can be challenging due to the unique ways it presents itself. However, by staying vigilant and prioritizing open communication with older loved ones, you can help address mental health issues early and provide the necessary support to help them navigate through this challenging time.

If two white socks cost 45 cents, how much would you pay for 15 brown socks? Let's think first. Chain of thought:","output":"1. Determine the cost of a single brown sock. 2. Calculate the cost of purchasing 15 brown socks. Step 1: Determine the cost of a single brown sock. We know that two white socks cost 25 cents more than a single brown sock, and the cost of two white socks is 45 cents. So, we can set up the equation: Cost of a single brown sock + 25 cents = cost of two white socks Let B represent the cost of a single brown sock, then: B + 25 cents = 45 cents Now, we can solve for B (the cost of a single brown sock): B = 45 cents - 25 cents B = 20 cents Step 2: Calculate the cost of purchasing 15 brown socks. Now that we know the cost of a single brown sock, we can calculate the total cost of purchasing 15 brown socks: Total cost = cost of a single brown sock × number of brown socks Total cost = 20 cents × 15 Total cost = 300 cents Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert the total cost into dollars: Total cost = 300 cents ÷ 100 Total cost = 3 Therefore, you would pay 3 for 15 brown socks."},{"instruction":"Question: Where does Barry's mother come to live with him ?

The widow, disdaining offers of marriage, devotes herself to her only son. As a despondent young man, Barry becomes infatuated with his older cousin, Nora Brady. Though she charms him during a card game, she later shows interest in a well-off British Army captain, John Quin, much to Barry's dismay. Nora and her family plan to leverage their finances through marriage, while Barry holds Quin in contempt and escalates the situation until a fateful duel beside a river. In the aftermath, Barry is urged to flee from incoming police and head through the countryside towards Dublin, but along the way he is robbed of purse, pistol, and horse by Captain Feeney, an infamous highwayman. Dejected, Barry carries on to the next town, where he hears a promotional spiel to join the British Army, offering the chance at fame and glory (and a lifelong pension) in return for good service. Barry enlists. Some time after joining the regiment, Barry encounters Captain Grogan, a warm-hearted family friend. Grogan informs him that Barry did not in fact kill Quin, his dueling pistol having only been loaded with tow. The duel was staged by Nora's family to be rid of Barry so that their finances would be secured through a lucrative marriage.

Determine if the provided SQL statement properly addresses the given question. Output 1 if the SQL statement is correct and 0 otherwise. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

Georges was the seventh tropical storm, fourth hurricane, and second major hurricane of the 1998 Atlantic hurricane season. It became the second most destructive storm of the season after Hurricane Mitch, the costliest Atlantic hurricane since Hurricane Andrew in 1992, and the deadliest since Hurricane Gordon in 1994. Georges killed 604 people, mainly on the island of Hispaniola, and caused extensive damage resulting at just under 10 billion (1998 US dollars, USD) in damages mostly in St. Kitts and Nevis, Puerto Rico and Hispaniola. - The Gulf of Mexico is an ocean basin largely surrounded by the North American continent. It is bounded on the northeast, north and northwest by the Gulf Coast of the United States, on the southwest and south by Mexico, and on the southeast by Cuba. The U.S. states of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas border the Gulf on the north, which are often referred to as the \\"Third Coast\\" in comparison with the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific coasts, or sometimes the \\"south coast\\", in juxtaposition to the Great Lakes region being the \\"north coast.\\" One of the gulf's seven main areas is the Gulf of Mexico basin. - Nevis is a small island in the Caribbean Sea that forms part of the inner arc of the Leeward Islands chain of the West Indies.

A mall Santa had a heart attack at work and was rushed to the Emergency Room in full cardiac arrest. Let me explain that a person playing Santa is generally a certain age (white beard) and body type (round) that is predisposed to cardiac disease. We did everything we could but ultimately our efforts were futile. The mall Santa rode his sleigh into the great beyond. A mother, there to visit another patient, was insistent that her 7–8 year old son be allowed back to visit his grandmother. We had a strict 12 year old age limit visitation policy. I was called to speak with her. ”Why do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?” She insisted. “The Emergency Room is no place for a child ma’am. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,” I explained. “Like what?” She argued. “Well, there are people in pain moaning,” I answered. “And drunks cursing at the staff. It’s a tough place.” “He’s fine,” she insisted. “I think I know how to parent. I don’t need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.” I caved in and allowed her back. As we passed the room with the dead Santa, a tech exited and opened the curtain. Her child looked in and saw Santa’s lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room. The child lost it! “Mom, Santa Claus is Dead!” He cried. “I’m not going to get anything for Christmas.” “Why would someone open the curtain?” The mother demanded. “I warned you,” I said. “That’s why we have a 12 years and above visitation policy.” She was not happy. Come to find out the child had his picture made with that very Santa a few days prior. Very ironic. Why was the boy upset?

The outlaws have stolen the father's grey horse with a double SS brand. Max sets out to avenge their deaths and uses this clue to trail the men. During his travels in the desert, Max uncovers an old and rusty gun. When he comes upon Jonas Cord, Sr, a traveling gunsmith, he tries to rob him. Cord, recognizing that Max's revolver is not loaded and is useless, convinces Max that his plan has failed. Max tells Cord of his vengeful journey. Cord takes pity on him, takes him in, feeds him and teaches him how to shoot. Max hunts the killers, who have separated. He tracks down Jesse Coe to Abilene, Texas. With the help of dancehall girl Neesa, a woman from the same tribe as his mother, he confronts him in a salon. Coe escapes and a knife fight ensues in a nearby corral.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer is:","output":"Indirectly impacting a step of the process. It is important to understand that air contamination, while detrimental to the environment and human health, does not have a direct effect on the process of plate tectonics and earthquake occurrence. However, it can have indirect impacts on certain factors that may influence the strength or frequency of earthquakes. Air contamination refers to the presence of harmful substances in the atmosphere such as pollutants, particles, and toxic gases emitted from various human activities, natural sources, or a combination of both. This pollution can lead to climate change, which in turn, affects various environmental factors contributing to earthquakes. One example of an indirect impact of air contamination on earthquakes is through climate change. As the Earth's temperature rises due to increasing greenhouse gas emissions, ice sheets and glaciers melt, leading to an increase in sea levels. This additional water weight on the Earth's crust can contribute to changes in tectonic plate movement and stress. While this may not directly cause earthquakes, it can increase the likelihood of earthquakes or influence their intensity. Another indirect impact of air contamination on earthquakes is related to the extraction of fossil fuels, which contributes to emissions and pollution. The process of drilling for oil or natural gas, as well as fracking, can cause the displacement of large volumes of water and fluids underground. This displacement can alter the stress and pressure on the Earth's crust, potentially leading to increased instances of induced seismicity or human-induced earthquakes. While air contamination does not directly affect the process of plate tectonics and earthquake occurrence, its indirect influences on various environmental factors can play a role in the strength or frequency of earthquakes. It is essential to acknowledge that many factors contribute to earthquakes, and understanding the connections between environmental changes and seismic activity can help to better predict and manage the risks associated with these natural disasters."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and answer the question by choosing from the options.

Think carefully first, then make a decision:","output":"To determine whether Eddie Hall could hypothetically deadlift the world's largest cheeseburger, let's consider a few factors: 1. Eddie Hall's deadlifting record: Eddie Hall is a professional strongman who set a world record by deadlifting 500 kg (1,102 lbs) in 2016. This is the maximum weight he has ever lifted. 2. The weight of the world's largest cheeseburger: The current world record for the largest cheeseburger was set by the Black Bear Casino Resort in Carlton, Minnesota, USA in 2012. The cheeseburger weighed 2,014 pounds (914 kg). Now, to make a decision: By comparing the weights, we can see that the world's largest cheeseburger (914 kg) weighs significantly more than Eddie Hall's deadlifting record (500 kg). As Eddie's maximum deadlifting capacity is 500 kg, and the cheeseburger weighs 914 kg, it appears that Eddie Hall would not be able to deadlift the world's largest cheeseburger, even hypothetically."},{"instruction":"When Abraham Lincoln was just a boy, he had to help his father to look after their farm.

Their ability to survive in different environments is an example of","output":"osmoregulation. Step 1: Identifying the phenomenon where an organism can survive in different water environments In this case, the user has described a unique ability of certain fish species to survive in salt water but lay eggs in freshwater. These fish are experiencing significant changes in their water environment, and therefore, there must be a biological mechanism that allows them to survive and regulate the different water conditions. Step 2: Explaining osmoregulation Osmoregulation is the process by which an organism maintains the balance of water and electrolytes in its body. This is essential for the survival of organisms in diverse environments, especially when they experience significant changes in their surroundings, such as the fish described by the user. Step 3: Connecting osmoregulation to the given example Fish that live in both salt water and freshwater environments have developed specialized adaptations that allow them to regulate their internal water and salt levels. In saltwater, they need to excrete the excess salt and retain water, while in freshwater, they must manage their water intake and electrolyte balance. The ability of these fish to osmoregulate enables them to survive and reproduce in different environments. Step 4: Concluding the answer Hence, the ability of certain fish species to survive in different environments, such as those living most of their lives in saltwater and laying their eggs in freshwater, is an example of osmoregulation."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Given this review: \\"Has quitworking.

Here is a detailed breakdown of this step: 1. Formation of urine: After the filtration and reabsorption processes in the kidneys, the remaining waste products and excess fluid form urine. The primary components of urine include urea, creatinine, uric acid, electrolytes, and excess water. 2. Storage and transportation of urine: The urine then flows from the kidneys through two narrow muscular tubes called ureters. Each kidney is connected to one ureter, which transports the urine from the renal pelvis of the kidney down to the urinary bladder. These muscular tubes use peristalsis (a series of wave-like muscular contractions) to facilitate the movement of urine. 3. Urinary bladder: The urinary bladder is a hollow, muscular organ that stores urine temporarily until it is expelled from the body. As urine accumulates in the bladder, its walls stretch to accommodate the increasing volume, while specialized nerve endings called stretch receptors in the bladder wall detect the expansion. When the volume of urine reaches a certain point, the stretch receptors transmit the information to the central nervous system, which in turn generates the urge to urinate. 4. Micturition (urination): When the individual is ready to empty the urinary bladder, the brain sends signals to the relevant muscles in the bladder and pelvic region. The detrusor muscle, which surrounds the bladder, contracts to expel the urine, while the internal and external urethral sphincters relax to allow the urine to flow out of the bladder and through the urethra. Simultaneously, the pelvic floor muscles also relax to facilitate the passage of urine. 5. Urethra: The urethra is a narrow tube that connects the urinary bladder to the exterior of the body. It serves as the exit pathway for urine and, in males, also transports semen during ejaculation. Depending on the individual's sex, the length of the urethra differs - being longer in males (approximately 17-20 cm) than in females (approximately 4 cm). 6. Expulsion of urine from the body: Finally, the urine is expelled from the body through the external urethral opening, effectively removing waste products and excess fluid from the system. To summarize, the final step of the process involves the formation of urine in the kidneys, the storage and transportation of urine through the urinary system, and the eventual excretion of the waste products and excess fluid from the body through the process of micturition."},{"instruction":"Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? a fresh view","output":"Based on the given short review, it appears to have a positive opinion of the movie. The phrase \\"a fresh view\\" suggests that the reviewer believes the movie offers a new and unique perspective, which is usually considered a good thing. However, it is important to note that this is a very brief review, and as such, there might be limitations in accurately gauging the reviewer's full opinion. It would be helpful to have additional context or more detailed information about the movie being discussed, as well as a more comprehensive evaluation of the film, including factors such as storytelling, acting, direction, visual effects, and other specific elements that contribute to the overall experience. In general, people tend to appreciate movies that stand out from the crowd and provide new, fresh perspectives on their chosen subject matter or themes. This is because it is quite common for movies and other forms of media to rehash cliché ideas and rely on tried-and-true formulaic elements. A fresh or unique viewpoint can make a movie more engaging, thought-provoking, and enjoyable, so it is likely that the reviewer sees this as a major positive aspect. However, it's also important to recognize that a fresh view, while potentially a positive attribute, may not necessarily guarantee that a movie is universally loved or even considered a critical success. There are many factors that can contribute to how well a movie is received, and the novelty of its approach is only one of them. Other elements, such as the quality of the writing and performances, the effectiveness of the storytelling, and the emotional impact of the narrative, also play crucial roles in determining how a movie is perceived by audiences and critics alike. In summation, although the given review is brief, it seems to express a positive opinion about the movie due to its fresh viewpoint. However, without further context and additional details, it is impossible to paint a complete picture of the reviewer's true feelings and impressions of the film. A more comprehensive review would be necessary to fully understand how this person truly perceives the movie, as well as how the movie stands in terms of critical and audience reception."},{"instruction":"Given the sentence \\"A female student does research on her apple laptop.\\" can we conclude that \\"A lady preparing for her thesis.\\"?

On June 21, 2005, the day of the release of his album TheFutureEmbrace, Corgan took out full-page advertisements in the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times to announce that he planned to reunite the band. \\"For a year now\\", Corgan wrote, \\"I have walked around with a secret, a secret I chose to keep. But now I want you to be among the first to know that I have made plans to renew and revive the Smashing Pumpkins. I want my band back, and my songs, and my dreams\\". Corgan and Chamberlin were verified as participants in the reunion, but there was question as to whether other former members of the band would participate.In April 2007 Iha and Auf der Maur separately confirmed that they were not taking part in the reunion. Chamberlin would later state that Iha and Wretzky \\"didn't want to be a part of\\" the reunion. The Smashing Pumpkins performed live for the first time since 2000 on May 22, 2007, in Paris, France. There, the band unveiled new touring members: guitarist Jeff Schroeder, bassist Ginger Reyes, and keyboardist Lisa Harriton. That same month, \\"Tarantula\\" was released as the first single from the band's forthcoming album. On July 7, the band performed at the Live Earth concert in New Jersey.The band's new album, Zeitgeist, was released that same month on Reprise Records, entering the Billboard charts at number two and selling 145,000 copies in its first week. Zeitgeist received mixed reviews, with much of the criticism targeted at the absence of half of the original lineup. The album divided the Pumpkins' fanbase. Corgan would later admit, \\"I know a lot of our fans are puzzled by Zeitgeist. I think they wanted this massive, grandiose work, but you don't just roll out of bed after seven years without a functioning band and go back to doing that\\". Corgan and Chamberlin continued to record as a duo, releasing the four-song EP American Gothic in January 2008 and the singles \\"Superchrist\\" and \\"G.L.O.W.\\" later that year.

When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students. Question: How long would the author wait before they had the children do a second self portrait? === The answer to the above question is Choices: (1). five years later; (2). almost a full school year; (3). when they graduate high school; (4). not enough information; Answer:","output":"(2). almost a full school year;"},{"instruction":"I am testing my students' logic.

Logic test: Freight trains are heavier than bullet trains so they are (A) slower to accelerate (B) faster to accelerate","output":"Your students should choose the answer \\"Freight Train\\" and option (A) slower to accelerate. The logic behind this is that freight trains are designed to carry heavy loads, whereas bullet trains are built for speed. Due to their heavier weight, freight trains require more force to overcome inertia and need more time to reach a given speed, resulting in slower acceleration. On the other hand, bullet trains, being lighter and more aerodynamic, can accelerate more quickly."},{"instruction":"I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: when was fdr elected as president Suggested answer: With the bouncy popular song \\" Happy Days Are Here Again \\" as his campaign theme, FDR defeated incumbent Republican Herbert Hoover in November 1932 , at the depth of the Great Depression .

She watches the snowflakes falling, decorating the world outside in a breathtaking white blanket. As she gazes out her window, she notices a man across the street, busy demonstrating the proper way to shovel snow to a group of fascinated neighbors. With a swift and measured motion, the man shows everyone gathered how to lift the snow from the ground without straining their backs by bending their knees and using their legs to support the weight of the snow-filled shovel. He explains the importance of wearing proper footwear to avoid slipping and demonstrates how to keep one's balance by placing their feet shoulder-width apart and maintaining a firm grip on the shovel's handle. The woman, who had been contemplating going outside to clear her own driveway, becomes engrossed in the practical wisdom being shared by the man. She's impressed by his efficient and ergonomic techniques and makes careful mental notes to replicate them later when she embarks on her own snow-clearing mission. The assembly of neighbors nods in appreciation, asking the man further questions concerning the best types of shovels to use, varying salting methods, and techniques for avoiding ice buildup. Meanwhile, a second man approaches the group with a rust proof windshield washer in his hands. He is eager to demonstrate its snow removal mechanism to the captivated audience. He showcases its adjustability and robust construction, effortlessly removing the accumulated snow and ice from a nearby car's windshield. The group immediately sees the value in this tool and inquires about where they can get one for themselves. The second man happily provides some purchasing details and tips on proper usage. A short distance away, a third man smiles warmly from his porch as he plays a few percussion rhythms on his drums. The rhythmic beats fill the cold air with a sense of joy and community, turning an otherwise mundane task of shoveling snow into a lively neighborhood affair. Though each person faces their own unique challenges in dealing with the heavy snowfall that day, they all come together to share knowledge, stories, and moments made warmer by the camaraderie they find in each other. The woman, who had initially looked upon the snow with a heavy heart, now feels her spirits lifted by the shared sense of determination and neighborly support, knowing that, together, they will all brave the storm."},{"instruction":"Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

Initially an indie rock band, the band rose to prominence in the early-mid 2000s as part of the post-Britpop movement. The band were founded at the University of Dundee in 1993 by Lightbody, Michael Morrison, and Mark McClelland as Shrug. After briefly using the name Polarbear and released the EP Starfighter Pilot (1997) and losing Morrison as a member, the band became Snow Patrol in 1997 and added Quinn to its line-up. Context: In 2002, the band started to be managed and published by Jazz Summers of Big Life. Guitarist Nathan Connolly, previously a member of the band File Under Easy Listening had been working in an HMV store room in Belfast at the time. Connolly and the band had a mutual friend, who introduced them to him. Connolly moved to Glasgow to join the band in the spring of 2002. During Lightbody and McClelland's years at the University of Dundee, they had been noticed by Richard Smernicki, a senior student. Through Richard, brother Paul too had come to know the band. Richard graduated in 1996, two years before Lightbody and McClelland, to become Polydor's Scottish A&R representative. Paul became Polydor's Press and Artist Development Manager and Fiction's label manager. Later, Jim Chancellor, an A&R executive for Fiction, and fellow talent scout Alex Close approached the band in Glasgow to listen to their demos, and judged them on \\"the quality of the songs\\", according to Lightbody. Chancellor introduced them to producer Jacknife Lee, who despite having been a guitarist in 90s punk rock band Compulsion had no rock production experience at that point, being known at the time for his work with Basement Jaxx and Eminem. Final Straw was released on 4 August 2003, under Black Lion, a subsidiary of Polydor Records. Its music was along the same lines as the band's first two albums, and no attempt was made to change the sound to something more radio-friendly. The album, along with \\"Run\\" (which debuted at No. 5 in the UK Singles Chart), gave the band their first taste of mainstream success. The record peaked at No. 3 in the UK Albums Chart. They followed the success of \\"Run\\" up with three more singles from the album: \\"Chocolate\\", as well as a re-release of \\"Spitting Games\\", both reaching the top 30, and \\"How to Be Dead\\" reaching number 39. The release of Final Straw in the United States in 2004 saw the album sell more than 250,000 copies and become the 26th most popular album in the UK of that year. In mid-2005, during their tour to support Final Straw, the band toured with U2 as an opening act on U2's Vertigo Tour in Europe. The band then returned to the United States to continue touring in support of Final Straw. That summer also saw Snow Patrol playing a short set in London at the worldwide benefit concert Live 8. After finishing their opening act duties and extensive 2-year tour of Final Straw in late July, the band took a few weeks off and began writing and recording songs for a new album. Snow Patrol's new version of John Lennon's \\"Isolation\\" was released on 10 December 2005 as part of the Amnesty International campaign, Make Some Noise. The song was later issued on the 2007 John Lennon tribute album, Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur. Question: What are some of the songs on the album?. Whats the answer?","output":"Some of the songs on Snow Patrol's album \\"Final Straw\\" are \\"Run,\\" \\"Chocolate,\\" \\"Spitting Games,\\" and \\"How to Be Dead.\\" These songs helped the band gain mainstream success, with \\"Run\\" reaching No. 5 in the UK Singles Chart."},{"instruction":"Q:Process: - Plants and animals long ago died - They are buried under layers of soil - Pressure builds over time - The remains liquefy - The carbon atoms rearrange to become a new substance. Question: suppose more carbon atoms rearrange happens, how will it affect MORE oil. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"To answer this question, let's analyze the process step by step and focus on the role of carbon atoms rearranging in this process: 1. Plants and animals long ago died - This marks the beginning of the process, where the raw material for oil (i.e., dead organisms) is provided. 2. They are buried under layers of soil - This ensures that the dead organisms are shielded from external factors that could interfere with the formation process, such as decomposition by bacteria. 3. Pressure builds over time - As more and more soil layers accumulate over the dead organisms, the pressure increases, helping the conditions necessary for oil formation. 4. The remains liquefy - The increasing pressure and temperature cause the dead organisms to break down and liquefy, which is an important step in oil formation. 5. The carbon atoms rearrange to become a new substance - As the organic remains continue to break down, carbon atoms rearrange themselves to form a new substance: crude oil. Now, let's consider the effect of MORE carbon atoms rearranging: If more carbon atoms rearrange into the new substance, it would mean that a greater proportion of the liquefied organic remains is being converted into crude oil. This increased conversion would result in a higher yield of oil, as more of the original organic material has been successfully transformed. Hence, the effect of more carbon atoms rearranging would be: A: more oil."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: This workout is great...

Kurt Russell is a futuristic super soldier raised since birth to kill but then made obsolete after being bettered by a bunch of really super soldiers at a dangly hoop ruck that looks a bit like a Gladiators contest without the crash mats. Abandoned on a junk planet, he's befriended by a community of naff space hippies that teach him about gardening, family life and, um, breasts. Kurt doesn't talk much. Finally the really super soldiers turn up and kill the hippies by shooting them in the back while they're running away. Kurt gets angry and kills everyone. A planet gets totalled. The end.

The increased bombing is the latest evidence the 17-year-old war in Afghanistan is significantly intensifying since U.S. President Donald Trump announced his new military strategy for the country in August. Coalition planes dropped 1,186 weapons on Afghanistan during the first three months of 2018, according to figures released by U.S. Air Forces Central Command. The previous record (1,083) was set during the height of the war in 2011. The U.S. has not released 2001 to 2003 airstrike data. Those figures do not include activity by the Afghan Air Force (AAF), which has stepped up its aerial bombardment since gaining the ability to conduct airstrikes two years ago. The AAF carries out between 4 to 12 airstrikes every day, according to the Afghan Ministry of Defense. If recent trends are any indication, 2018 is likely to get even more violent. Fighting traditionally picks up during the warmer months, and the coalition has expanded its bombing campaign against the Islamic State group, as well as narcotic labs and other Taliban revenue sources. But there is little indication the expanded airstrikes are helping end the conflict, says Thomas Johnson, an Afghanistan specialist who teaches national security affairs at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. \\"It's basically a tactic of desperation,\\" said Johnson, author of Taliban Narratives: The Use of Power and Stories in the Afghanistan Conflict. \\"There's never been an insurgency in history that's been defeated purely through air power.\\" Even high-level U.S. military officials concede the conflict remains a stalemate.

For the g+5 building, what is the minimum steel section used as bracings in staad? Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"For a G+5 building, determining the minimum steel section used as bracings depends on various factors, such as the building's design specifications, local building codes, load conditions, seismic requirements, and material properties. STAAD is a structural analysis and design software that can be utilized to help engineers decide the best steel sections. Now, let us address the two questions separately: 1. For the G+5 building, what is the minimum steel section used as bracings? The minimum steel section for bracings in a G+5 building can be determined by evaluating the building's structural system, such as the type of bracing (concentric or eccentric bracing), the building's configuration, and the building's code requirements. Some commonly used steel sections for bracings in steel buildings are angles, channels, or hollow square/rectangular tubes. The size of the steel section would vary based on the factors mentioned earlier. In general, engineers would identify the appropriate steel section by following these steps: a. Define the lateral force resisting system for the building. b. Determine the loads on the bracings according to the building code and load combinations. c. Establish the load path for the load transfer from the floors to bracings and verify the adequacy of connections. d. Select a starting steel section based on similar projects, consulting engineers' experience, or using simplified design tables found in codes and books. e. Analyze the structure and check the steel section for its capacity to handle the loads as demanded by the building. f. Iterate the section selection process and perform checks until a suitable section is identified that meets safety, serviceability, and economy criteria. 2. For the G+5 building, what is the minimum steel section used as bracings in STAAD? STAAD is a structural analysis and design software used to perform the calculations mentioned above more efficiently and accurately. When designing the bracings for a G+5 building in STAAD, the software helps you define the geometry of the structure, apply loads and boundary conditions, and conduct an analysis. To determine the minimum steel section in STAAD, follow these steps: a. Model the G+5 building structure accurately, including the bracing members, in STAAD. b. Define the material properties and member sections, including preliminary steel sections for bracings. c. Apply appropriate loads, such as dead, live, wind, and seismic loads, as per the local building code requirements. d. Perform the structural analysis and examine the results for member forces, displacements, and stresses. e. Evaluate the adequacy of the preliminary steel section for bracings by performing code-based checks on capacities. f. If the steel section is not adequate, optimize the steel section by using an iterative process while maintaining all the other parameters constant. g. Finalize the steel section once it fulfills all the design and safety requirements. To answer the question, \\"Would you say that these questions are the same?\\" - Yes, these two questions have the same objective, which is determining the minimum steel section for bracings in a G+5 building. However, the second question explicitly mentions using STAAD software for analysis and design, while the first question does not specify any software usage. The fundamental procedure remains the same, and the second question essentially extends to include the use of STAAD to assist in the design process."},{"instruction":"Fun & Games is the third album by the American pop/rock band The Connells, released in 1989.

Bamar culture has been influenced by the cultures of neighbouring countries. This is manifested in its language, cuisine, music, dance and theatre. The arts, particularly literature, have historically been influenced by the local form of Theravada Buddhism. Considered the national epic of Myanmar, the Yama Zatdaw, an adaptation of India's Ramayana, has been influenced greatly by Thai, Mon, and Indian versions of the play. Buddhism is practised along with nat worship, which involves elaborate rituals to propitiate one from a pantheon of 37 nats.\\" Answer: A:","output":"The aspect of Bamar culture that has been most affected by Buddhist influence is undoubtedly its religious practices and beliefs, which in turn have had significant impacts on various other aspects of the culture, such as arts, literature, customs, and architecture. The majority of the Bamar people practice Theravada Buddhism, which is deeply ingrained in their daily lives and cultural expression. This primary belief system shapes the customs and local traditions of the Bamar people. One particularly significant way that Buddhism has influenced Bamar culture is through the blending of Buddhist beliefs with indigenous animistic nat worship. This unique combination has resulted in a complex system of rituals and rites used to propitiate one from a pantheon of 37 nats, which are spirits or minor deities associated with natural elements or human activities. These rituals often include elements of Buddhist teachings and symbolism, showcasing the deep entwinement of Buddhism with traditional Bamar beliefs. Buddhist influence in Bamar culture is also prominent in the realm of literature and the arts. The Yama Zatdaw, considered to be the national epic of Myanmar, is an excellent example of this. As an adaptation of India's Ramayana, it is not only influenced by Buddhist teachings but also by the cultures of neighboring countries like Thailand and India, whose renditions of the Ramayana have left their mark on the Bamar adaptation. Moreover, numerous works of literature, poetry, and folktales in Myanmar explore Buddhist themes, moral values, and stories from the Jataka tales, which recount the previous lives of the Buddha. In terms of architecture, the most iconic and visible manifestation of Buddhist influence on Bamar culture can be seen in the numerous pagodas and monasteries that dominate the landscape of Myanmar. The elaborate architecture of these religious structures, adorned with intricate carvings, sculptures, and murals, reflects not only the importance of Buddhism in the lives of the Bamar people but also the extent to which religious devotion and artistic expression are intertwined. The Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon and the Ananda Temple in Bagan are prime examples of the beautiful craftsmanship and dedication seen in Buddhist inspired architecture throughout Myanmar. Buddhism has also left its mark on Bamar dance, music, and theatre, which often incorporate stories and themes from Buddhist teachings and literature. The traditional Bamar dance, for example, incorporates elements such as the stylized movement of hands, body posture, and facial expressions that show deep connections to Buddhist teachings and symbolism. In conclusion, the aspect of the Bamar culture most significantly affected by Buddhist influence is its religious practices and beliefs. However, the impact of Buddhism on Bamar culture extends far beyond its religious elements and has deeply enriched various facets of the culture such as arts, literature, customs, and architecture, making it an integral part of the Bamar people's identity and heritage."},{"instruction":"Teacher:In this task, you are given two strings A, B.

The rally was organized by various groups, including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), according to the Washington Post. MSNBC host Ed Schultz addressed the massive crowd, highlighting the importance of the current political climate, saying, \\"This is a defining moment in America.\\" He urged those in attendance to consider their American identity as well as the urgency of this political juncture, iterating, \\"Are you American? This is no time to back down.\\" Drawing inspiration from Glenn Beck's DC rally held last month, Schultz championed the idea of reclaiming the country, but instead of blaming the government, he laid responsibility at the feet of Republicans and large corporations, as reported by the Associated Press. The \\"One Nation Working Together\\" rally comes as a direct response to the tea party movement that has been gaining momentum in recent months. The progressive movement seeks to revive enthusiasm and solidarity among Democrats and left-leaning voters before the crucial midterm elections. By demonstrating a united front, the rally organizers and participants hope to send a strong message about their commitment to an inclusive, progressive, and just society. In the wake of politically polarizing rallies and events in the past few months, the \\"One Nation Working Together\\" rally has showcased the resolve of progressives to stand their ground and promote their vision for the future of the United States.

Where might he go to do so? Here are possible answers to this question: - hen house - painting - virginia - california - lion's den I believe the correct choice is \\"virginia\\", here's why:","output":"To determine the correct choice, let's evaluate each option step-by-step: 1. Hen house: This is an unlikely location for George to hunt foxes, as hen houses are typically for keeping chickens safe from predators, not for hunting them. This option can be eliminated. 2. Painting: This choice doesn't make any sense as a location for hunting foxes, since a painting is a visual art form and not a geographical location. This option can be eliminated. 3. Virginia: Virginia is a state in the United States with a long history of fox hunting, including established hunting clubs and suitable natural habitats for foxes. This choice is plausible and fits the context well. 4. California: While California has varied landscapes and wildlife, it isn't specifically known for fox hunting in the same way that Virginia is. Moreover, the other options don't provide any strong reason to choose California. This option is less likely than Virginia, but we can't fully eliminate it yet. 5. Lion's den: This option seems out of context, as lion's dens are habitats for lions, not foxes. Moreover, hunting foxes in a lion's den would be quite dangerous. This option can be eliminated. Based on this evaluation, the most likely choice for where George might go to hunt foxes is indeed \\"Virginia\\".

From one point of origin, many adaptations evolve causing the species to radiate into several new ones. Island archipelagos like the Hawaiian Islands provide an ideal context for adaptive radiation events because water surrounds each island, which leads to geographical isolation for many organisms (Figure 11.16). The Hawaiian honeycreeper illustrates one example of adaptive radiation. From a single species, called the founder species, numerous species have evolved, including the eight shown in Figure 11.16.

Let's start by breaking down the process. Process: 1. Sunlight strikes the chlorophyll molecules in the plant. 2. Sunlight is trapped. 3. Plant also takes in water and carbon dioxide from the environment. 4. The plant forms glucose. 5. The plant releases oxygen into the atmosphere. Question: What is the effect of there being more trees blocking the sun on the plant taking in more water? Now, let's analyze the question. The two events mentioned are: Event 1: More trees blocking the sun. Event 2: The plant takes in more water. To identify the relationship between these two events, let's see how they connect within the given process: Event 1 (more trees blocking the sun) would result in less sunlight striking the chlorophyll molecules in the plant (Step 1). This means that if the sunlight is blocked, the photosynthesis process might be negatively impacted. However, the process does not indicate any direct relationship between the amount of sunlight and the amount of water intake by the plant (Step 3). Therefore, we can't establish a causal relationship between Event 1 and Event 2 based on this process. So, the answer to the question is: \\"none\\" because there is no causal relationship between the two events mentioned in the question, according to the given process."},{"instruction":"You need to create a question containing a blank (_), based on the given context word.

The question and answer pair are described below.","output":"Question: Were the United States heavily engaged in Vietnam by the end of the 1960s? Answer: Yes, the United States was heavily engaged in Vietnam by the end of the 1960s. Rationale: 1. The initial involvement of the United States in Vietnam started in the 1950s, primarily in an advisory and financial support capacity to the South Vietnamese government. This fact establishes a background context for increasing involvement over time. 2. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy increased American support to South Vietnam, sending military advisors and support personnel. This escalation shows a gradual intensification of American involvement in the conflict. 3. In August 1964, the Gulf of Tonkin incident occurred, where the United States reported that two US Navy ships were attacked by North Vietnamese naval vessels. This led to the adoption of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution by the US Congress, which authorized President Lyndon B. Johnson to escalate the conflict further. 4. Starting in 1965, the United States began deploying a substantial number of combat troops to Vietnam, which escalated the conflict considerably and increased their military engagement in the region. By this time, it is clear that the United States was becoming heavily engaged in the Vietnam War. 5. Throughout the late 1960s, American involvement in Vietnam continued to grow. The Tet Offensive, a widespread and coordinated attack by the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces in 1968, led to even further escalation of American military force in the region. 6. By the end of 1969, the United States had over 540,000 troops deployed in Vietnam. The massive presence of American military personnel in the region demonstrates the heavy engagement of the United States in the Vietnam War during this time. Considering the events and escalations mentioned above, we can conclude that the United States was heavily engaged in Vietnam by the end of the 1960s."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Given the background: Some species of ants farm aphids, protecting them on the plants where they are feeding, and consuming the honeydew the aphids release from the terminations of their alimentary canals.

This conclusion is based on the given information that two teams of researchers studied different diseases: team Alpha focused on people with cholesterol issues, while team Beta concentrated on people with Parkinson's disease. Cholesterol, along with other materials like fatty substances, calcium, and cellular waste, can accumulate on the interior walls of arteries, leading to a condition known as atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is the hardening and narrowing of the arteries, which can restrict blood flow and potentially lead to serious health issues, such as heart attack or stroke. Considering team Alpha's focus on people with cholesterol, their research would involve studying the accumulation of cholesterol and other materials on the arterial walls, as this is a significant aspect of the condition. On the other hand, team Beta's research on Parkinson's disease pertains to a completely different set of medical issues, relating primarily to the nervous system and motor control functions. Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement and can cause tremors, stiffness, and difficulty with balance, coordination, and walking. While it is possible that some individuals with Parkinson's disease might also have cholesterol-related issues, team Beta's primary focus would be on studying the neurological aspects of the disease, rather than the cholesterol and its impact on arterial walls. In conclusion, team Alpha studied more people with cholesterol and other materials deposited on the interior of the arterial wall because their primary research focus was on cholesterol and its effects on the body, while team Beta focused on the study of Parkinson's disease and its related neurological impacts."},{"instruction":"Konsorsiyum, 900 bin dolar ücret ve yüzde 1,2 komisyon karşılığında özelleştirme için çeşitli alternatifler öne sürecek.

After the funeral of a seven-year-old boy, Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) asks the village elders for permission to pass through the woods to get medical supplies from neighboring towns; however, his request is denied. Later, his mother Alice (Sigourney Weaver) admonishes him for wanting to visit the neighboring towns, which the villagers describe as wicked. The Elders also appear to have secrets of their own and keep physical mementos hidden in black boxes, the contents of which are reminders of the evil and tragedy they left behind when they left the towns. After Lucius makes a short venture into the woods, the creatures leave warnings in the form of splashes of red paint on all the villagers' doors. Meanwhile, Ivy Elizabeth Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard)âthe blind daughter of the chief Elder, Edward Walker (William Hurt)âinforms Lucius that she has strong feelings for him, and he returns her affections.

Noah is locked in a room until a decision is made about his fate. Edward goes against the wishes of the other Elders, agreeing to let Ivy pass through the forest and seek medicine for Lucius. Before she leaves, Edward explains that the creatures inhabiting the woods are actually members of their own community wearing costumes and have continued the legend of monsters in an effort to frighten and detract others from attempting to leave Covington.

The answer is:","output":"Amerigo Vespucci, an Italian explorer, cartographer, and navigator, is best known for his explorations of the New World during the turn of the 15th and 16th centuries. Although he was not the first European to reach the Americas, Vespucci's journeys and contributions to cartography led to their widespread recognition as a separate entity from Asia, ultimately changing the way the world was perceived and portrayed on maps. The American continents were eventually named after him, in recognition of his significant impact on European understanding of the New World. Amerigo Vespucci was born on March 9, 1454, in Florence, Italy. Vespucci embarked on his first voyage in 1497, although there is some debate among historians regarding the details and accuracy of this date. Over the next few years, Vespucci would participate in several more voyages to the Americas, all of which contributed in various ways to the European understanding of this new land. Probably the most famous of Vespucci's expeditions was his second voyage, which took place between 1499 and 1500. During this voyage, he explored the northern coast of South America including present-day Guyana, Venezuela, and Brazil. He sailed along the coastlines, mapping the terrain and gathering information about the indigenous peoples, the local flora and fauna, as well as resources and trade possibilities. It was during this expedition that Vespucci first proposed the idea that what he was exploring was, in fact, a completely new continent and not a part of Asia as initially believed by Christopher Columbus and others. Vespucci's third voyage in 1501 took him further along the eastern coast of South America, this time in the service of Portugal. He explored and mapped the region from the eastern tip of present-day Brazil down to the south, as far as modern-day Argentina. During this voyage, Vespucci also delved into the study of constellations, which led him to correctly deduce that the Earth was round and that it had a circumference very similar to the calculations made by ancient Greek scholars like Eratosthenes. Throughout his explorations, Amerigo Vespucci made his most significant contributions to the geographical understanding of the New World in two key ways. First, thanks to his meticulous record-keeping, observations, and maps, he expanded the knowledge of South America and demonstrated the vast differences between it and Asia. These revelations, combined with his assertion that the Americas were indeed separate land masses, had a tremendous impact on the way cartographers and scholars viewed and represented the world. Second, Amerigo Vespucci's voyages paved the way for future explorers and colonizers from Europe. His accounts of the rich natural resources, unique cultures, and the immense size of the New World sparked both interest and competition among European powers. As a result, the subsequent centuries saw significant growth in exploration and colonization, ultimately leading to profound social, political, and economic changes across the globe. In conclusion, Amerigo Vespucci explored the eastern coast of South America, playing a vital role in the discovery and mapping of the New World. His observations, analysis, and detailed descriptions of the geography, ecosystems, and indigenous populations helped alter the European understanding of the world and directly led to the landmasses being named America in his honor. Vespucci's critical discoveries and contributions to cartography shaped the course of history, influencing future explorations and significantly changing the perception of the world as it was known during that era."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

He was the only child of Italian immigrants Antonino Martino \\"Marty\\" Sinatra and Natalina \\"Dolly\\" Garaventa. Sinatra weighed 13.5 pounds (6.1 kg) at birth and had to be delivered with the aid of forceps, which caused severe scarring to his left cheek, neck, and ear, and perforated his ear drum, damage that remained for life. Due to his injuries at birth, his baptism at St. Francis Church in Hoboken was delayed until April 2, 1916. Sinatra attempted to pursue an acting career in Hollywood in the early 1940s. While films appealed to him, being exceptionally self-confident, he was rarely enthusiastic towards his own acting, once remarking that \\"pictures stink\\". Sinatra made his film debut in 1941, performing in an uncredited sequence in Las Vegas Nights, singing \\"I'll Never Smile Again\\" with Tommy Dorsey's The Pied Pipers. In 1943 he had a cameo role along with Duke Ellington and Count Basie in Charles Barton's Reveille with Beverly, making a brief appearance singing \\"Night and Day\\". The following year he was given his leading roles in Higher and Higher and Step Lively for RKO Pictures. In 1945, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cast Sinatra opposite Gene Kelly and Kathryn Grayson in the Technicolor musical Anchors Aweigh, in which he played a sailor on leave in Hollywood for four days. A major success, it garnered several Academy Award wins and nominations, and the song \\"I Fall in Love Too Easily\\", sung by Sinatra in the film, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. In 1946, Sinatra briefly appeared at the end of Richard Whorf's commercially successful Till the Clouds Roll By, a Technicolor musical biopic of Jerome Kern, in which he sang \\"Ol' Man River. In 1949, Sinatra co-starred with Gene Kelly in the Technicolor musical Take Me Out to the Ball Game, a film set in 1908, in which Sinatra and Kelly play baseball players who are part-time vaudevillians. He teamed up with Kelly for a third time in On the Town, playing a sailor on leave in New York City. Today the film is rated very highly by critics, and in 2006 it ranked No. 19 on the American Film Institute's list of best musicals. Both Double Dynamite (1951), an RKO Irving Cummings comedy produced by Howard Hughes, and Joseph Pevney's Meet Danny Wilson (1952) failed to make an impression.

Committed to painting only what he could see, he rejected academic convention and the Romanticism of the previous generation of visual artists. His independence set an example that was important to later artists, such as the Impressionists and the Cubists. Courbet occupies an important place in 19th-century French painting as an innovator and as an artist willing to make bold social statements through his work. In 1855, Courbet submitted fourteen paintings for exhibition at the Exposition Universelle. Three were rejected for lack of space, including A Burial at Ornans and his other monumental canvas The Artist's Studio. Refusing to be denied, Courbet took matters into his own hands. He displayed forty of his paintings, including The Artist's Studio, in his own gallery called The Pavilion of Realism (Pavillon du Realisme) which was a temporary structure that he erected next door to the official Salon-like Exposition Universelle. The work is an allegory of Courbet's life as a painter, seen as an heroic venture, in which he is flanked by friends and admirers on the right, and challenges and opposition to the left. Friends on the right include the art critics Champfleury, and Charles Baudelaire, and art collector Alfred Bruyas. On the left are figures (priest, prostitute, grave digger, merchant and others) who represent what Courbet described in a letter to Champfleury as \\"the other world of trivial life, the people, misery, poverty, wealth, the exploited and the exploiters, the people who live off death.\\" In the foreground of the left-hand side is a man with dogs, who was not mentioned in Courbet's letter to Champfleury. X-rays show he was painted in later, but his role in the painting is important: he is an allegory of the then current French Emperor, Napoleon III, identified by his famous hunting dogs and iconic twirled moustache. By placing him on the left, Courbet publicly shows his disdain for the emperor and depicts him as a criminal, suggesting that his \\"ownership\\" of France is an illegal one. Although artists like Eugene Delacroix were ardent champions of his effort, the public went to the show mostly out of curiosity and to deride him. Attendance and sales were disappointing, but Courbet's status as a hero to the French avant-garde became assured. He was admired by the American James McNeill Whistler, and he became an inspiration to the younger generation of French artists including Edouard Manet and the Impressionist painters. The Artist's Studio was recognized as a masterpiece by Delacroix, Baudelaire, and Champfleury, if not by the public. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: What was The Artists studio?","output":"The Artist's Studio was \\"an allegory of Courbet's life as a painter, seen as an heroic venture, in which he is flanked by friends and admirers on the right, and challenges and opposition to the left.\\""},{"instruction":"additionally to the above figures for turnover of resorcinol in denmark it is mentioned that there is an import and export of resorcinol that is strongly bound in a matrix in tires and wood products. Make this proper case.","output":"In addition to the previously mentioned figures for the turnover of Resorcinol in Denmark, it is important to note that there is a significant import and export of Resorcinol that is strongly bound in a matrix within tires and wood products. To understand the context and implications of these figures, we need to take into consideration several factors related to the Resorcinol industry, the import and export trends, and the importance of Resorcinol in the Danish market. Therefore, we must delve deeper into the details and analyze the various aspects that could be affecting the turnover and market demand for Resorcinol in Denmark, particularly in the tire and wood products industry. First, it is crucial to recognize the role of Resorcinol in the manufacturing process of tires and wood products. Resorcinol is a chemical compound that is commonly used as a bonding agent when producing these goods. In the tire industry, Resorcinol is essential in the creation of high-quality, durable tires due to its capacity to bond rubber and other materials, providing a strong, cohesive end product. Similarly, in the wood products sector, Resorcinol serves as a reliable adhesive that ensures the durability and longevity of various wooden items. Now that we have established the importance of Resorcinol in these industries, we must examine the import and export trends of Resorcinol in Denmark. Due to the strong demand for tires and wood products not only in Denmark but also in neighboring countries, the import and export of these goods remain in constant fluctuation. This fluctuation, in turn, directly impacts the import and export of Resorcinol bound in a matrix within these products. As demand continues to grow, it creates a stronger need for the import of high-quality Resorcinol, which is then incorporated into the production of tires and wood products in Denmark. Additionally, it is crucial to consider the environmental and sustainability factors that could be influencing the turnover of Resorcinol in Denmark. As Denmark and the European Union (EU) continue to focus on enhancing sustainability and reducing the harmful environmental effects of various industries, there is an increased emphasis on the use of eco-friendly materials and recycling processes. As a result, there may be a renewed push toward developing alternative bonding agents to replace or supplement Resorcinol, possibly impacting the turnover of Resorcinol within the Danish market. Moreover, factors such as global economic trends, tariff regulations, and trade agreements may also play a significant role in determining the turnover of Resorcinol in Denmark. As these factors shift and evolve, they inevitably impact the overall import and export values of Resorcinol and its derivatives. In conclusion, while it is evident that there is a strong relationship between the import and export of Resorcinol and its use in the tire and wood products industries, it is essential to consider a multitude of factors that could be impacting the turnover of Resorcinol in Denmark. These factors may include the importance of Resorcinol in manufacturing processes, import and export trends, environmental and sustainability initiatives, and other global economic influences. By taking these considerations into account, we can better understand the intricate dynamics of the Resorcinol market in Denmark and its significance within the tire and wood products industry."},{"instruction":"Translate to Finnish: I am also grateful to Parliament for its support for our efforts to discover the best way of achieving energy efficiency and reducing CO2 emissions through intelligent technologies and for guiding us on the possible measures that could be taken.","output":"Minä olen myös kiitollinen parlamentille sen tuesta pyrkimyksillemme löytää paras tapa saavuttaa energiatehokkuutta ja vähentää CO2-päästöjä älykkäiden teknologioiden kautta sekä ohjauksesta mahdollisten toimenpiteiden suhteen, joita voitaisiin toteuttaa.

In 1476 the Crossen district became part of the Margraviate of Brandenburg, when the widow of the Piast ruler, Barbara von Brandenburg, daughter of Elector Albert Achilles, inherited Crossen. In 1526 Silesia was acquired by Austria's Habsburg Monarchy after the death of King Louis II of Bohemia.

The founding fathers inserted this clause into the constitution in an attempt to stabilize the currency and promote economic stability. The clause aims to prevent states from issuing their own paper currency, which could potentially become worthless. To ensure a robust and stable economy, it was deemed essential that the states would only accept gold and silver in payment of debts as these have intrinsic value. This measure was intended to protect against bad economic practices, motivate borrowing and lending, and ensure that the value of money remained stable. Hence, the exact reading of the clause from the constitution reflects a policy decision more than a phrase that was \\"heard\\" as a result of depreciating paper money. In conclusion, the question might be better answered by identifying a phrase commonly used by individuals of the period in reaction to or discussion about the depreciation of paper currency. The statement provided can be considered more of a political and legal reaction encoded into the Constitution in response to the economic instability generated by the rapid loss of value in paper money."},{"instruction":"Roberto Javier Mora García (c. 1962 – 16 March 2004) was a Mexican journalist and editorial director of \\"El Mañana\\", a newspaper based in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, Mexico.

The enterprising Matthew Dick managed to persuade the legendary Times cryptic crossword setters to include a proposal in their clues, and the subsequent betrothal has been splashed across the papers today, perhaps because the dead tree posse are relieved to feel cool and current for a short minute. Increasingly, proposal stories are cropping up online. Videos of extravagant dance troupes and would-be grooms shuffling manfully along go viral, while a photo of a couple getting engaged in front of a pair of newlyweds invited criticism worldwide. One man even staged a fake reality show in order to propose to his tearful partner. If your partner proposes in private, does your relationship really mean anything? Does your beloved really cherish you enough to put a ring on it? If there’s no camera crew ready to film your surprise and awe (and aww), how will people know that your proposal story is up there with the best of them? While it’s always nice to know that people want to declare their love so publicly (especially in the UK, where most of us would fake a seizure if a flash mob surrounded us), there does seem to be a certain level of narcissism in the public proposal. Mostly, the person being proposed to has barely a supporting role in these video clips, while all the focus is on the instigator. This is most clearly illustrated by the groom who filmed himself every day for a year holding up a sign saying “Will you marry me?”. Leaving aside the fury I’d feel that someone wasted a year doing something so ridiculous, what is really telling is that the bride was barely given a look in throughout the whole performance. Bodes well for the next 65 years. Only about five other people in the world are interested in your relationship. Nobody else cares Although a crossword is a unique way to pop the question, I’d argue that the growing pressure to come up with a creative and fresh way of proposing takes something away from the moment when you actually do it. Sure, marriage is an antiquated and patriarchal system (I’m not bitter at all), and loads of them end in divorce, but for those who want to go down that road, is being accosted on a red carpet by a man on a horse (and I am not just throwing out ideas here) really the way you want to begin the journey? For the most part, only about five other people in the world are interested in your relationship. Both sets of parents (because they don’t want you to keep living in their house), and possibly an ex who keeps a close eye on you just in case they get lonely. Nobody else really cares. It’s not enough that your mates have to shell out for a themed wedding weekend and coo approvingly at the honeymoon photos, now they must learn complicated choreography so that you can dance through a bingo hall to present a ring to your partner as they are simultaneously enveloped by puppies (I made that one up, feel free to use it). If you want to propose, consider doing it without a camera. You don’t need to come up with a wacky idea and you don’t even need to invite friends, strangers or hired performers to witness the happy event. Instead, it can be a happy and intimate moment, a story just for the two of you. Sure, it might not be Disneyland perfect, but look on the bright side – if your partner says no, at least it won’t be on YouTube for the rest of your life. ||||| Published on Jan 18, 2015 Link to the wedding video! - https://youtu.be/qxZQzPVQLP4 Devotion and dedication!

Doctors believe he suffered what’s known as a commotio cordis — cardiac arrest caused by a blunt impact to the chest. Agredano, a sophomore at San Benito High School, was in the middle of an intense soccer game at Watsonville High School when he was hit with the ball in his chest. “It didn’t feel right,” he recalled. “After the ball hit my chest, I passed the ball, took two steps and lost my balance. My vision went, and I started spinning,” he said. “I kneeled down and put my hands on the ground, and the next thing I remember, I was being put into an ambulance.” His parents were at the game. His mother, Gina Agredano, said she was chatting with another parent when she heard her husband, Jose Sr., say, “There’s something wrong with Jose.” Both parents ran onto the field toward their son, who was on the ground and unresponsive. Gina, who is a physician, immediately began assessing her son. She hadn’t seen the play and assumed it was a head injury. She instructed Jose Sr. to hold his son’s head, and they directed bystanders to call 9-1-1. Jose was still breathing, but he was unresponsive during the roughly 10 minutes that his mother continued to assess him, she was looking for eye response and breathing patterns. When his breath became labored, she knew her son needed oxygen. She sent her husband to meet the paramedics and asked the sports trainer to get the automated external defibrillator (AED), a portable device that checks a person’s heart rhythm and can send an electric shock to the heart to try to restore a normal rhythm. AEDs are used to treat sudden cardiac arrest. “Right as first responders arrived and my husband left to get them over to us quickly, that’s when Jose stopped breathing and his lips began turning blue,” said Gina. “Up until that moment, I had this emotional connection to the situation as his mother. But at that moment, fight-or-flight kicked in, and I knew I had to begin CPR to save his life.” She recalls giving chest compressions for about 3 minutes. The trainer returned with the AED right as the first responders arrived on the scene. Gina quickly told them the situation and said their eyes widened and they jumped into action, cutting off Jose’s jersey and placing the AED pads on his chest. The pad read an irregular heart rhythm and the medics began to shock his heart. “It was surreal,” said Dr. Agredano. “I’ve seen a lot of things in my career, and I saw a lot of trauma in my residency, but when it’s your child, it’s a whole different thing. I just kept telling myself, ‘we’re not going to die today.’” After the shocks, Jose came back. He was groggy, but he knew his name, what day it was and where he was. The whole ordeal lasted about 20 minutes, but it felt “like a year” to his parents. Jose was taken to the emergency room at Watsonville Community Hospital, where he was stabilized and examined by a Packard Children’s pediatrician, Dr. Peter Rowinsky, who arranged for Jose to be transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit (CVICU) at Packard Children’s Hospital. Through a partnership between the two hospitals, Packard Children’s physicians can serve as hospitalists in Watsonville. “Many victims of commotio cordis do not survive,” said Kathleen Ryan, MD a cardiac intensivist who admitted Jose to the CVICU. Victims are predominantly men under the age of 20, which is when the chest wall finishes developing. “Commotio cordis causes victims to go into ventricular fibrillation. CPR is not enough because the heart is quivering about 400 to 1,200 times a minute. You need to deliver an electrical shock that defibrillates the quivering heart and shocks it into a normal rhythm again, and statistically this shock needs to happen quickly, within a few minutes. In Jose’s case, the quick action his mother [took by performing CPR and ordering] the AED to be brought over made all the difference in the world.” All of Jose’s follow-up tests are normal, and doctors do not anticipate there will be any long-term damage. Lynda Knight, MSN, RN, Director of the Stanford Children’s Health REVIVE Initiative for Resuscitation Excellence, says this is a reminder of the power of resuscitation education. “Evidence shows that if a bystander performs immediate CPR, the outcome will be better. Paramedics take, on average, 4 to 8 minutes to arrive, and each minute that someone goes without chest compressions, his or her chance of survival goes down by 10 percent.” The REVIVE Initiative has trained thousands in the community in bystander CPR and provides their CPR training program to hospital parents upon discharge. As for the Agredanos, the event was life-changing for all of them. “I’ll never take anything for granted again,” said Jose Jr. “The last thing I saw before lost consciousness was my parents’ faces. I know how lucky I am.” “We’ve been at hundreds of games and have seen hundreds of hits to the head and chest. Never did we think this was possible,” said Jose Sr. “My wife was the hero. She was calm and efficient. I am so thankful she was there.” For the sports community, Gina Agredano says it’s a reminder of how critical it is to immediately assess an injured player. “Every second matters, and knowing what to do can make the difference between life and death.” “If this happens to someone next to me on the field, now I know what to do,” said Jose Jr. “But I want all my friends to know, too.” “My being a doctor, my training, that wasn’t what saved him,” said Dr. Agredano. “Knowing the signs that call for administering CPR, which is accessible to anyone, is what saved his life.” ||||| Boy suffers heart attack after being hit by soccer ball News Boy suffers heart attack after being hit by soccer ball 16-year-old Jose Agredano admits he is a lucky young man after being hit in the chest by a ball during a soccer game. - 16-year-old Jose Agredano admits he is a lucky young man after being hit in the chest by a ball during a soccer game. Jose is a midfielder at Hollister High School, and when the ball hit him during a game in Watsonville last week, his mother knew something wasn't right. Jose said, \\"It felt like I got the wind knocked out of me. I thought I could walk it off, but after a few steps, I couldn't see anything anymore\\". Jose's mother Gina is a doctor and it was Gina that concluded that her son was having a heart attack. She began giving him chest compressions, and when paramedics arrived she told them to bring a defibrillator- which ultimately saved Jose's life. Doctors say the prognosis is good- just one more small test and Jose will get a 100% clean bull of health. ||||| PALO ALTO — When Jose Agredano Jr. walked onto the soccer field in Watsonville to play his final junior varsity game of the season last week, the last thing he expected was a heart attack. But after an errant ball struck the 16-year-old on the left side of the chest, he suffered an impact-induced cardiac arrest that could have cost him his life if not for his mother’s quick thinking and focus during the incident. Dr. Gina Agredano performed three minutes of CPR after her son stopped breathing — a technique that helped save his life before an on-site automated AED, an external defibrillator, shocked Jose’s heart and revived the boy. “He just stopped breathing, and that was when it was game on,” said Gina. “I said to myself we were not going to die today.” On Feb. 16, Gina and her husband, Jose Sr., watched San Benito High School’s junior varsity team finish out its undefeated season at Watsonville High. During a lull in the game, Gina heard her husband say, “Something is wrong with Jose.” The couple ran from the top of the bleachers to the far side of the field where Jose had collapsed. Gina assessed the situation for 10 minutes as her son’s breathing became labored and finally stopped. “That’s when I swapped my mom hat for my doctor hat,” she said. After the CPR and subsequent shock from the AED, Jose came back. The ordeal lasted 20 minutes, but Gina said it felt like forever. Like our Facebook page for more conversation and news coverage from the Bay Area and beyond. Jose, speaking at Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital Stanford on Friday, said that after the ball hit him he began walking, took two steps and collapsed. “The blood started going to my head, everything got blurry and I knew something wasn’t right,” he recalled. Just before he blacked out, Jose said that he was thinking about his parents, and “how they were going to be affected by what’s going to happen.” The sophomore, who plays midfield, said the experience has made him realize life is precious and that “it can’t be taken for granted.” Dr. Kara Motonaga, who helped treat Jose at the hospital, said Jose was very lucky and that his mother undoubtedly saved her son’s life by performing CPR immediately after he stopped breathing. “Had it not been for the CPR and defibrillator, Jose would’ve died,” she said. Motonaga explained that Jose suffered what’s known as commotio cordis—the type of cardiac arrest that happens when a projectile object hits the left side of chest between heartbeats. “An impact at the right time in the electrical cardiac cycle can create an abnormal heart rhythm that could be life threatening,” she said. Returning the heart to a normal rhythm requires an electrical shock from a defibrillator within a few minutes. Motonaga said that the survival rate for this type of cardiac arrest is roughly 50 percent, and that it’s “probably one of the five leading causes of sudden death in athletes.” She noted the importance of educating people how to recognize a cardiac event, and teaching them to initiate CPR as soon as possible. “Every minute counts. Every minute you don’t get CPR is a minute your brain and the rest of your body is deprived of oxygen,” the doctor said. At the hospital Friday, Jose underwent several treadmill stress tests on his way to full recovery — and another shot at soccer. Gina hugged him, and buried her face in her son’s chest. “It feels wonderful that he’s here,” she sighed. The Agredano family, who live in Hollister, hosted a “life party” for their son earlier in the week, and invited his entire soccer team — the boys all signed Jose’s jersey from that fateful day. Jose said he wants to teach his teammates how to perform CPR. Lynda Knight, director of the Stanford Children’s Health Revive Initiative for Resuscitation Excellence, gave Jose and his 11-year-old sister Lauren two CPR kits from the American Heart Association and challenged them to train as many of their friends as they could. The Revive Initiative has trained thousands in the community in CPR. Knight also stressed how fortunate it was that an AED was on site to shock Jose’s heart. She hopes that “some day fire extinguishers and AEDs will be side by side in every building.” Jose himself just wants to get back out on the field. When he came to in the ambulance, he said, “I was really happy to be alive, but kind of upset because I wanted to keep playing.” Though his mother would prefer he didn’t. “We just want to wrap him up and not let him go outside, but that’s unrealistic,” she said. “But he loves soccer.” Jose wants to play soccer in college and it looks like he’ll be able to. His follow-up tests are normal and the doctors don’t anticipate long-term damage. “His prognosis is extremely good,” said Dr. Motonaga. “He should have a long and healthy life.” ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"A 16-year-old boy named Jose was playing soccer when a ball hit him in his chest.

A blocked-up door next to the fireplace was thought to have been a priest hole, but is more likely to have been the entrance to the first floor of the house from an external staircase before the wing was restructured, probably in the late 16th century or the early 17th century.North of the Chapel Room is the Paradise Room, whose name derives from the bed hangings which include embroidered images of Adam and Eve and their fall from paradise, as well as the use in Tudor times of the name \\"paradise\\" for a favourite room, often a bedchamber. This room has panelled walls, and a fireplace with a cupboard on the right hand side. On the other side there is a small recess, which was described in an 1882 newspaper as \\"a dark passage which is said to lead to some region unknown\\". It is possible that this was a priest's hide, adjacent to the Chapel and Chapel Room. Less romantically, it may, alternatively, have been a garderobe or privy. This room became associated with sightings of ghosts in the 19th century, and legends of a secret passage that led from the room outside or to the Chapel arose, though no such passages exist. The largest room on the first floor is the Withdrawing Room, situated above the Great Hall.

They contain about 65% rRNA and 35% protein, held together by numerous noncovalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, in an overall structure consisting of two globular particles of unequal size. Molecules of tRNA, which bring amino acids (one at a time) to the ribosomes for the construction of proteins, differ from one another in the kinds of amino acid each is specifically designed to carry. A set of three nucleotides, known as a codon, on the mRNA determines which kind of tRNA will add its amino acid to the growing chain. (For more information on sequences, see Section 19.4 \\"Protein Synthesis and the Genetic Code\\". ) Each of the 20 amino acids found in proteins has at least one corresponding kind of tRNA, and most amino acids have more than one. The two-dimensional structure of a tRNA molecule has three distinctive loops, reminiscent of a cloverleaf (Figure 19.11 \\"Transfer RNA\\"). On one loop is a sequence of three nucleotides that varies for each kind of tRNA. This triplet, called the anticodon, is complementary to and pairs with the codon on the mRNA. At the opposite end of the molecule is the acceptor stem, where the amino acid is attached. Figure 19.11 Transfer RNA Saylor URL: http://www. saylor. org/books.

This milestone was achieved under the influence of the Progressive Movement, which sought to increase direct democracy in the United States and grant more power to the people. The initiative and referendum process was first introduced in Oregon by William Simon U'Ren, a lawyer and key figure of the Progressive Movement who was inspired by citizens' involvement in lawmaking in Switzerland. With the support of the Direct Legislation League, U'Ren aimed to provide Oregonians with the ability to directly initiate and vote on proposed laws, as well as to refer important decisions to the voters themselves. The initiative process allowed citizens to propose new laws or amendments to current ones by collecting signatures from a certain percentage of the electorate. Once sufficient signatures were gathered, the proposal would be placed on the ballot for voters to decide its fate. This process helped to bypass the legislature and enabled Oregonians to impact their state's policies directly. The referendum process, on the other hand, enabled voters to decide whether or not laws passed by the legislature should take effect. This again placed the power of decision-making in the hands of the electorate and allowed for a more democratic system. The adoption of these laws in Oregon in 1902 marked a significant turning point in the American political landscape, as it paved the way for other states to follow suit. It has since become a widely-used tool by citizens to address and solve issues that are important to them, giving voters more influence over the political system at the state and local levels. By providing citizens with the ability to counterbalance the power of elected officials, Oregon's initiative and referendum laws have served as a critical element of democracy in the United States."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

It is eponymous for the first four British monarchs of the House of HanoverGeorge I, George II, George III, and George IVwho reigned in continuous succession from August 1714 to June 1830. The style was revived in the late 19th century in the United States as Colonial Revival architecture and in the early 20th century in Great Britain as Neo-Georgian architecture; in both it is also called Georgian Revival architecture. In America the term \\"Georgian\\" is generally used to describe all building from the period, regardless of style; in Britain it is generally restricted to buildings that are \\"architectural in intention\\", and have stylistic characteristics that are typical of the period, though that covers a wide range. Characteristics. The style of Georgian buildings is very variable, but marked by a taste for symmetry and proportion based on the classical architecture of Greece and Rome, as revived in Renaissance architecture. Ornament is also normally in the classical tradition, but typically rather restrained, and sometimes almost completely absent on the exterior. The period brought the vocabulary of classical architecture to smaller and more modest buildings than had been the case before, replacing English vernacular architecture (or becoming the new vernacular style) for almost all new middle-class homes and public buildings by the end of the period. - Middlesex (abbreviation: Middx) was a county in southeast England that is now mostly part of Greater London, with small sections in neighbouring counties. It was established in the Anglo-Saxon system from the territory of the Middle Saxons, and existed as an official unit until 1965. The historic county included land stretching north of the River Thames from east to west of the City of London with the rivers Colne and Lea and a ridge of hills as the other boundaries. The largely low-lying county, dominated by clay in its north and alluvium on gravel in its south, was the second smallest by area in 1831. - Calligraphy is a visual art related to writing. It is the design and execution of lettering with a broad tip instrument, brush, among other writing instruments. A contemporary calligraphic practice can be defined as, \\"the art of giving form to signs in an expressive, harmonious, and skillful manner\\". - The London Borough of Harrow is a London borough of north-west London, England. It borders Hertfordshire to the north and other London boroughs: Hillingdon to the west, Ealing to the south, Brent to the south-east and Barnet to the east. The local authority is Harrow London Borough Council. - Vellum (derived from the Latin word \\"vitulinum\\" meaning \\"made from calf\\", leading to Old French \\"vélin\\", \\"calfskin\\") often refers to a parchment made from calf skin, as opposed to that from other animals. It is prepared for writing or printing on, to produce single pages, scrolls, codices or books. The term is sometimes used with a more general meaning referring to finer-quality parchments made from a variety of animal skins. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - A charity school, sometimes called a blue coat school, was significant in the history of education in England. It was erected and maintained in various parishes by the voluntary contributions of the inhabitants for teaching poor children to read, write, and other necessary parts of education. It was usually maintained by religious organizations, which provided clothing and education to students freely or at little charge. In most charity schools, children were likewise put out to trades, services, etc., on the same charitable foundation. Some schools were more ambitious than this and sent a few pupils on to university, as depicted in the illustration. - The Public Schools Act 1868 was enacted by the British Parliament to reform and regulate seven of the leading English boys' schools of the time, most of which had grown out of ancient charity schools for the education of a certain number of poor scholars, but were then, as they do today, also educating many sons of the English upper and upper-middle classes on a fee-paying basis. - Letters patent (always in the plural) are a type of legal instrument in the form of a published written order issued by a monarch, president, or other head of state, generally granting an office, right, monopoly, title, or status to a person or corporation. Letters patent can be used for the creation of corporations or government offices, or for the granting of city status or a coat of arms. Letters patent are issued for the appointment of representatives of the Crown, such as governors and governors-general of Commonwealth realms, as well as appointing a Royal Commission. In the United Kingdom they are also issued for the creation of peers of the realm. A particular form of letters patent has evolved into the modern patent (referred to as a utility patent or design patent in United States patent law) granting exclusive rights in an invention (or a design in the case of a design patent). In this case it is essential that the written grant should be in the form of a public document so other inventors can consult it to avoid infringement and also to understand how to \\"practice\\" the invention, i.e., put it into practical use. - Harrow is a large suburban town in the London Borough of Harrow, northwest London, England. It is centred northwest of Charing Cross. Harrow-on-the-Hill includes the conservation area with a high proportion of listed buildings with a residential and institutional array of Georgian architecture and a few 17th century examples. Harrow gives its initial letters to a wider postcode area. The administrative offices of the borough are in the town which currently is made up of the Greenhill, Headstone South and West Harrow electoral wards; these had a population of 33,928 in the 2011 census.

They were, and are still, used to establish significant organisations such as cities (with municipal charters) or universities and learned societies. Charters should be distinguished from warrants and letters of appointment, as they have perpetual effect. Typically, a Royal Charter is produced as a high-quality work of calligraphy on vellum. The British monarchy has issued over 980 royal charters. Of these about 750 remain in existence. The earliest was to the town of Tain in 1066, making it the oldest Royal Burgh in Scotland, followed by the University of Cambridge in 1231. Charters continue to be issued by the British Crown, a recent example being that awarded to the Chartered Institute for the Management of Sport and Physical Activity, on 7 April 2011. - A city charter or town charter (generically, municipal charter) is a legal document (\\"charter\\") establishing a municipality such as a city or town.

The victims have bags over their heads, and silver bars strapped to their backs. This comes at a price: The severe sanctions on time travel mean that crime bosses eventually need to end a looper's contract, and also eliminate any traces of their working relationship, so they send his older version back to be killed by his younger self, referred to as \\"closing the loop\\", which each looper must do himself.

It can be either a whole musical piece or part of a larger musical arrangement. In terms of performance, the major categories are live dance music and recorded dance music. While there exist attestations of the combination of dance and music in ancient times (for example Ancient Greek vases sometimes show dancers accompanied by musicians), the earliest Western dance music that we can still reproduce with a degree of certainty are the surviving medieval dances.

In the classical music era, the minuet was frequently used as a third movement, although in this context it would not accompany any dancing. The waltz also arose later in the classical era. Both remained part of the romantic music period, which also saw the rise of various other nationalistic dance forms like the barcarolle, mazurka, ecossaise, ballade and polonaise. - Natalie Horler (born 23 September 1981) is a German singer and television presenter.

In both sentences, the person referred to has graduated from two different educational institutions: Washburn Law School and Kansas Newman College. Let's break down both sentences to understand their structure and meaning: 1. He graduated in 1976 from Washburn Law School and in 1979 from Kansas Newman College. In this sentence, the person being referred to completed his graduation from Washburn Law School in 1976. Afterward, he graduated from Kansas Newman College in 1979. Therefore, this sentence implies that he pursued his legal studies first and then moved on to another course or degree at Kansas Newman College. However, it is important to note that the nature of the degree earned at Kansas Newman College is not mentioned here. 2. He graduated in 1976 from Kansas Newman College and in 1979 from the Washburn Law School. In the second sentence, the order of graduation is flipped. The person first graduated from Kansas Newman College in 197-6, followed by Washburn Law School in 1979. This suggests that he may have pursued a different course or degree at Kansas Newman College before deciding to study law at Washburn Law School. Again, it is worth noting that the nature of the degree earned at Kansas Newman College is not explicitly mentioned. Summing up, both sentences describe the same individual graduating from two institutions, Washburn Law School and Kansas Newman College, in different years (1976 and 1979). However, the order in which the graduations took place is switched between the two sentences.

Step 2: Analyzing the review, I note phrases such as \\"I was so excited to eat here\\" and \\"given all the positive reviews\\", which suggest a positive sentiment initially.

The dominant figure of Canadian Confederation, he had a political career which spanned almost half a century. He drank heavily, and in 1873 was voted out during the Pacific Scandal, in which his party took bribes from businessmen seeking the contract to build the Pacific Railway. Macdonald's greatest achievements were building and guiding a successful national government for the new Dominion, using patronage to forge a strong Conservative Party, promoting the protective tariff of the National Policy, and building the transcontinental Canadian Pacific Railway. Economic growth was slow during his years in office, as Canada verged on stagnation; many residents migrated to the fast-growing United States. He fought to block provincial efforts to take power back from Ottawa. His most controversial move was to approve the execution of Métis leader Louis Riel for treason in 1885; it alienated many Francophones. - Charles Joseph \\"Joe\\" Clark, (born June 5, 1939) is a Canadian statesman, businessman, writer, and politician who served as the 16th Prime Minister of Canada, from June 4, 1979, to March 3, 1980. - Joseph Philippe Pierre Yves Elliott Trudeau (; October 18, 1919 September 28, 2000), better known as Pierre Trudeau or Pierre Elliott Trudeau, was a Canadian politician who served as the 15th Prime Minister of Canada from 19681979 and 19801984. He is the 3rd longest-serving Prime Minister in Canadian history (behind William Lyon Mackenzie King and John A. Macdonald), having served for 15 years, 164 days. - The Conservative Party of Canada, colloquially known as the Tories, is a political party in Canada. It is positioned on the right of the Canadian political spectrum. The party's leader from 2004 to 2015 was Stephen Harper, who served as Prime Minister from 2006 to 2015. - The Liberal Party of Canada, colloquially known as the Grits, is the oldest federal political party in Canada. The party espouses the principles of liberalism, and generally sits at the centre of the Canadian political spectrum. The Liberal Party is traditionally positioned to the left of the Conservative Party of Canada and to the right of the New Democratic Party (NDP). - The Canadian federal election of 1979 was held on May 22 , 1979 to elect members of the Canadian House of Commons of the 31st Parliament of Canada . It resulted in the defeat of the Liberal Party of Canada after 11 years in power under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau . Joe Clark led the Progressive Conservative Party to power , but with only a minority of seats in the House of Commons . The Liberals , however , did beat the Progressive Conservatives in the overall popular vote by more than 400,000 votes . - William Lyon Mackenzie King (December 17, 1874 July 22, 1950) was the dominant Canadian political leader from the 1920s through the 1940s. He served as the tenth Prime Minister of Canada from 1921 to 1926, 1926 to 1930, and 1935 to 1948. He is best known for his leadership of Canada throughout the Second World War (19391945) when he mobilized Canadian money, supplies and volunteers to support Britain while boosting the economy and maintaining home front morale. A Liberal with 21 years and 154 days in office, he was the longest-serving prime minister in Canadian history. Trained in law and social work, he was keenly interested in the human condition (as a boy, his motto was \\"Help those that cannot help themselves\\"), and played a major role in laying the foundations of the Canadian welfare state. - The New Democratic Party (NDP NPD) is a social-democratic political party in Canada. The leader of the federal wing of the NDP is Thomas Mulcair, who was elected in the 2012 leadership election, led the party through the 2015 federal election and then lost a party leadership review on April 10, 2016.

From the moment I arrived until my reluctant departure, I was greeted with a level of hospitality and warmth that truly took my breath away. The entire experience was nothing short of exquisite. Upon arrival, I was immediately struck by the breathtaking beauty of the resort's location. Nestled between lush rolling hills and a pristine sandy beach, the resort perfectly blended elements of nature, luxury, and relaxation. The impeccably landscaped grounds were dotted with a delightful array of fragrant flowers and tall palm trees, providing ample opportunities for both leisurely strolls and picture-perfect moments. Check-in was a breeze. The genuinely friendly and helpful staff welcomed me with refreshing drinks and cold towels, instantly setting the tone for an unforgettable stay. My room, a sleek and tastefully designed oceanfront suite, boasted a spacious balcony that offered unobstructed views of the sparkling blue sea. The suite was beautifully appointed, with every creature comfort one could desire, including a sumptuous king-sized bed, a large soaking tub, and a well-stocked minibar offering a selection of locally sourced snacks and beverages. The resort's dining options were nothing short of exceptional. Each day began with an abundant breakfast buffet that featured an array of fresh fruits, pastries, and an omelette station manned by a skilled and friendly chef. For lunch and dinner, I thoroughly enjoyed the resort's two on-site restaurants. One was an elegant fine dining establishment specializing in creative, locally inspired dishes, while the other was a more laid-back grill just steps from the beach, offering the most succulent seafood and perfectly grilled meats. Each meal was truly a culinary delight that tantalized my taste buds and left me eagerly anticipating the next. One of the many highlights of my stay at Paradise Resort was the remarkably diverse selection of activities available to guests. While I was mainly interested in relaxing by the beautifully maintained pool or sunbathing on the private stretch of beach, I also had the opportunity to participate in morning yoga classes, explore nearby nature trails, and embark on a dolphin-watching boat excursion. Additionally, the resort provided complimentary equipment for snorkeling and kayaking adventures. With its exceptional service, superb dining experiences, luxurious accommodations, and unparalleled location, my stay at the Paradise Resort proved to be one of the best vacations I have experienced. It truly lives up to its name, providing guests with a serene oasis that perfectly balances luxury and natural beauty.

'The idea came to me in a square where I saw the leaves tremble when there was not a breath of air,' said Jérôme Michaud-Larivière, the founder of the Parisian start-up which will market the Wind Tree in 2015. He added the energy 'had to come from somewhere and be translatable into watts'. It uses tiny blades housed in the 'leaves' that turn in the wind - regardless of its direction - and has the added advantage of being completely silent. Scroll down for video. Green energy: A French start-up has developed a 'Wind Tree' that generates power from air currents. Innovative: It uses tiny blades housed in the 'leaves' that turn in the wind - regardless of its direction. After three years of research, the team of engineers developed a 26ft prototype, which is now installed in the Pleumeur-Bodou commune in Brittany in northwestern France. He hopes they can eventually be used in people's own homes and in urban centres. The tree, which will sell for £23,500, can reportedly generate electricity on twice the number of days as a conventional wind turbine because it can generate power on winds of just 4.5mph. Mr Michaud-Lariviere said the tree - which has not yet been tested by an independent laboratory - is profitable after winds of 7.8mph on average over one year. 'The idea came to me in a square where I saw the leaves tremble when there was not a breath of air,' said Jérôme Michaud-Larivière, the founder of the Parisian start-up which will market the Wind Tree in 2015. He hopes the tree can be used to exploit small 'deposits' of air currents flowing into town along the buildings and streets to feed, for example, LED street lamps, or a charging station for electrical cars. He admits there are more consistent winds 160ft in the air but they require 'monstrous machines', far from where energy is consumed, he added. He hopes the tree can be combined with other means of power generation such as photovoltaic, and geothermal, combined with energy-efficient buildings. In the future Mr Michaud-Larivière hopes to develop a 'perfect tree that has leaves with natural fibres, roots that could generate geothermal energy and 'bark' covered with photosensitive cells. However, Robert Bellini an engineering expert at the Environment and Energy Management Agency (ADEME), says the potential of small wind turbines in the city remains 'quite low'.","output":"A French engineering team has developed an innovative artificial tree called the \\"Wind Tree\\" that generates electricity using wind power. This green energy solution was created by Jérôme Michaud-Larivière, the founder of a Parisian start-up, who observed leaves trembling in the wind and was inspired to harness the energy produced by these subtle movements. The Wind Tree uses tiny blades housed in its \\"leaves,\\" which turn in the wind from any direction and can generate electricity silently. After three years of research, a 26-foot prototype of the Wind Tree has been installed in the Pleumeur-Bodou commune in Brittany, northwestern France, and Michaud-Larivière hopes to eventually bring the Wind Tree to residential homes and urban centers. Priced at £23,500 per unit, the Wind Tree can generate electricity on twice the number of days compared to a conventional wind turbine due to its ability to create power from winds as low as 4.5mph. Michaud-Larivière claims the tree is profitable after experiencing 7.8mph winds on average over a one-year period. The Wind Tree is designed to exploit small \\"deposits\\" of air currents in towns and cities. These wind \\"deposits\\" could be used to power LED street lamps or charging stations for electric cars. Although there may be more consistent winds at higher elevations, Michaud-Larivière aims to provide a compact, versatile solution instead of relying on large-scale wind turbines. The Wind Tree could be combined with other means of power generation, such as photovoltaic and geothermal, and used in conjunction with energy-efficient buildings to increase green energy production. In the future, Michaud-Larivière hopes to develop a \\"perfect tree\\" that features natural fibers in its leaves, roots that generate geothermal energy, and a \\"bark\\" covered with photosensitive cells.

He conducted them for nearly half a century, introducing hundreds of new works to British audiences. After his death, the concerts were officially renamed in his honour as the \\"Henry Wood Promenade Concerts\\", although they continued to be generally referred to as \\"the Proms\\". Born in modest circumstances to parents who encouraged his musical talent, Wood started his career as an organist. During his studies at the Royal Academy of Music, he came under the influence of the voice teacher Manuel Garcia and became his accompanist. After similar work for Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera companies on the works of Arthur Sullivan and others, Wood became the conductor of a small operatic touring company. He was soon engaged by the larger Carl Rosa Opera Company. One notable event in his operatic career was conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin in 1892. From the mid-1890s until his death, Wood focused on concert conducting. He was engaged by the impresario Robert Newman to conduct a series of promenade concerts at the Queen's Hall, offering a mixture of classical and popular music at low prices. The series was successful, and Wood conducted annual promenade series until his death in 1944. By the 1920s, Wood had steered the repertoire entirely to classical music. When the Queen's Hall was destroyed by bombing in 1941, the Proms moved to the Royal Albert Hall. Wood declined the chief conductorships of the New York Philharmonic and Boston Symphony Orchestras, believing it his duty to serve music in the United Kingdom. In addition to the Proms, he conducted concerts and festivals throughout the country and also trained the student orchestra at the Royal Academy of Music. He had an enormous influence on the musical life of Britain over his long career: he and Newman greatly improved access to classical music, and Wood... contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who started his career as an organist?, what is it ?

If we do not care who wins, then why do we compete? Fun, experience, the chance to meet new people --- these are the reasons we try to outdo each other. People will compete over anything. Every Christmas, my neighbors and I have a little Christmas light competition. It is heaven for the electric company, but I think we give Will Rogers Airport a scare. It is bright enough to land a plane in our front yards. I admit that last year my neighbors won, but only because they bought every strand of lights Wal-Mart had before I could get there. Personal competitions are great, but we get a little carried away. I cannot stand to see coaches shout at kids playing sports. Who cares if someone messes up and the other team advances? I'm tired of people competing just to win. It happens not only in sports, but in music competitions, too. People auditioning for chair placement in certain bands can get really unfriendly. This year I did not audition for a certain band, but I went to auditions anyway. This was the first time I actually had the opportunity to comprehend the whole picture. Other times I've been the person who was nervous and anxious. This time, I sat back and observed everyone else. I came to the realization that the people who aren't so good are terrified of the good people, and the good people are scared stiff that the bad people have taken lessons and can now show them up. Unless a person is on the outside looking in, I don't think anyone realizes _ . Maybe competing is human nature, but we shouldn't let it influence our judgment. Being disrespectful to opponents , letting competition become our life, and becoming so involved that we close ourselves off from friends and family is not the meaning of competition.

In conclusion, the integration of wearable technology into the education system has the potential to revolutionize learning by providing personalized, engaging, and accessible experiences for students. It is likely that as these devices become more widely adopted and new technologies emerge, their impact on education will continue to grow, making this a particularly compelling hypothesis."},{"instruction":"Choose how you want this story to end. By Associated Press PUBLISHED: 23:55 EST, 19 December 2012 | UPDATED: 02:07 EST, 20 December 2012 The New York Public Library is moving forward with a 300million renovation of its landmark Fifth Avenue building that will more than double its public space and fireproof the majestic main reading room, the library president said on Wednesday. But the plans he presented at a news conference have drawn withering criticism from some respected architecture experts, including Ada Louise Huxtable, who says the grand Beaux Art edifice is embarking on 'its own destruction.' Library President Tony Marx has a different vision for the building completed in 1911. The library was also a film location for Breakfast at OPTIONS: - Ada Louise Huxtable - Associated Press - Beaux Art - Bryant Park - Fifth Avenue - New York Public Library - Tiffany's - Tony Marx","output":"In the bustling city of New York, the iconic New York Public Library stood as a symbol of culture and knowledge for over a century. The grand Beaux Art edifice, a landmark on Fifth Avenue, was known not only as a sanctuary of learning but also as a popular film location, featured in classics like Breakfast at Tiffany's. However, the 21st century brought with it the need for change. The Library President, Tony Marx, aware of the historical importance, sought to breathe new life into the old building. He envisioned a 300 million renovation that would more than double the library's public space and fireproof the majestic main reading room. However, this grand plan was met with opposition. Ada Louise Huxtable, a respected architecture expert, was one of those who criticized the renovation plans, stating that the library was embarking on \\"its own destruction.\\" The dispute between the preservation of historical values and the need for modern amenities began to divide the city's public opinions. The two visions for the library's future seemed irreconcilable, and the decision-makers faced a difficult choice. The library board weighed the arguments carefully, acknowledging the importance of preserving the building's architectural heritage while addressing the growing needs of the community. The decision, though unpopular with some, was ultimately to proceed with a compromise. Balancing the concerns of Ada Louise Huxtable and those like her, the renovation plans were amended to preserve the architectural character and essence of the grand Beaux Art façade. The interior was renovated to accommodate the growing needs of the population, providing state-of-the-art facilities that honored the building's past while embracing the future. The library reopened to the public, boasting an impressive blend of history and modernity that attracted new generations of library-goers. The main reading room, with its fireproofed, soaring ceilings, welcomed researchers and thinkers, while modern study spaces, multimedia resources, and technological upgrades abounded, equipping the library to serve its community well into the future. Outside, the building's exterior retained its classic Beaux Art elegance, a symbol of the library's rich history. The renovations were so well-balanced that even Ada Louise Huxtable, the most outspoken critic, softened her stance toward the changes that had occurred. The New York Public Library, having weathered turbulent times, emerged as a shining example of adaptation and resilience - both in preserving the architectural needs of the past and serving the diverse, ever-changing needs of the modern city. The renovation masterfully fused the old with the new, forging a brilliant testimony to New York's ability to blend history with progress. Stretching from Fifth Avenue to Bryant Park, the library stands as proof that controversial decisions and careful listening can lead to outcomes that serve as beacons of hope and compromise in a rapidly changing world. And inside those hallowed walls, the love for knowledge, culture, and artistry continued to flourish, in both physical and digital forms, reflecting the indefatigable spirit of the city that never sleeps."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

The premise can be broken down into several assertions: 1. Giovanni Bellini is a member of the painter family. 2. Among the painter family members, he is the youngest. 3. Among the painter family members, he is the most gifted. 4. Giovanni Bellini painted Enthroned Madonna with Job and St. Sebastian in 1485. 5. The painting Enthroned Madonna with Job and St. Sebastian showcases gentle humanity. The hypothesis can also be broken down into two assertions: 1. Giovanni Bellini is the youngest member of the family. 2. Giovanni Bellini is the most gifted member of the family. Now, looking at the assertions within the premise, we can notice that Assertion 2 and Assertion 3 directly correspond with the two assertions of the hypothesis. Assertion 2 states that Giovanni Bellini is the youngest amongst the painter family, which aligns with Assertion 1 of the hypothesis. Assertion 3 states that Giovanni Bellini is the most gifted within the painter family, which matches Assertion 2 of the hypothesis. Assertions 1, 4, and 5 from the premise provide relevant context and specific details about Giovanni Bellini's artistic career and accomplishments, such as being part of the painter family and creating Enthroned Madonna with Job and St. Sebastian in 1485. Although they do not directly or independently support the hypothesis, they reinforce the notion that Giovanni Bellini's exemplary qualities (specifically, his gentle humanity) and achievements contribute to his standing as the most gifted member of the family. In conclusion, if we accept the premise as true, it does entail the hypothesis, as the statements within the premise directly support the notion that Giovanni Bellini was both the youngest and the most gifted member of the painter family. The premise offers additional insights into his artistic talent and the influence of his work, which further solidifies his position as the family's most gifted artist."},{"instruction":"Continue writing the following text.

The sun was burning brightly in the sky, casting a warm glow over the suburban neighborhood. Tanya, an impatient and often irritable 16-year-old, was never one for unsolicited advice, and the reminder had come at the worst possible moment. She had just come back from an exhausting soccer practice, her muscles aching like she had personally pushed the earth around the sun. Carrie, the eldest of the two siblings and 18 years old, was more pragmatic in her approach to life. She had a natural inclination to help others, especially her teenage sister. Carrie aced her academics, excelled at extra-curricular activities, and had the most calming influence on her parents when things got tense. She was often seen as the golden child, but Tanya would never bother measuring up to her \\"perfect\\" sister, a fact that secretly pained Carrie. The garage was a battleground of unsorted, forgotten memories and trinkets. Father, who was away on a business trip, had asked them a week earlier to clean out the garage before he got back. Time had slipped by, and the task remained undone. But now, with father’s return looming closer and Tanya’s patience wearing thin, Carrie ventured one last time to remind her sister of their promise. As Carrie's gentle reminder floated through the air, Tanya's frustration exploded. Her anger was a mixture of annoyance, resentment, and the awkward weight of failure. She knew Carrie wasn't trying to make her feel small; this wasn't a brag or a jab meant to bring her down. Nevertheless, Tanya felt the pressure building inside her chest and knew that she should have been more attentive to her father's request. Her embarrassment quickly turned into fury, and she lashed out at Carrie, who did not foresee the emotional outpour. Carrie’s eyes widened at the outburst and she recoiled, hurt and shocked. Her kind intentions had been met with venom, leaving a palpable tension in the room. They stood face to face, two very different personalities, each carrying their own burdens. It was a jarring juxtaposition that threatened the fabric of their sisterly bond. As the dust settled, the two siblings weighed their emotional armor. Tanya could feel her anger slowly dissipating, replaced by a festering shame at how she had reacted. Carrie, ever the diplomat, hid her wounded spirit behind a serene mask and let out a sigh. Although the words rang in their ears, they realized that the task still had to be done. Together, Tanya and Carrie would tackle the garage, wading through memories and working side-by-side to accomplish their goal. Beneath the weight of resentment and harsh words, they would rediscover the meaning of sisterhood, that unbreakable bond that would weather storm after storm. The garage turned into a symbol of not only their shared responsibility, but also the journey that they would take together to rebuild their relationship. They would both make mistakes, face challenges, and battle their own demons.

Arendt's family was thoroughly assimilated and she later remembered: \\"With us from Germany, the word 'assimilation' received a 'deep' philosophical meaning. You can hardly realize how serious we were about it.\\" Arendt came to define her Jewish identity negatively after encountering antisemitism as an adult. She came to greatly identify with Rahel Varnhagen, a nineteenth-century Prussian hostess who desperately wanted to assimilate into German culture, only to be rejected because she was born Jewish. Arendt later said of Varnhagen that she was \\"my very closest woman friend, unfortunately dead a hundred years now.\\" After completing her high school studies in 1924, she enrolled at the University of Marburg, where she spent a year studying philosophy with Martin Heidegger. According to Hans Jonas, her only German-Jewish classmate, in her year at the university, Arendt began a long and problematic romantic relationship with Heidegger, for which she was later criticized because of his support for the Nazi Party while he was rector at the University of Freiburg. After a year at Marburg, Arendt spent a semester at Freiburg University, attending the lectures of Edmund Husserl. In 1926 she moved to the University of Heidelberg, where in 1929, she completed her dissertation under the existentialist philosopher-psychologist Karl Jaspers. Her thesis was Der Liebesbegriff bei Augustin: Versuch einer philosophischen Interpretation (\\"On the concept of love in the thought of Saint Augustine: Attempt at a philosophical interpretation\\").

The answer is:","output":"The book Strandloper is a historical fiction novel written by the English author Alan Garner. The story was published in 1996 and is based on the true story of William Buckley, an English convict who was transported to Australia in the early 19th century. William Buckley, the central character of the story, was born in Cheshire, England, in 1780. He was a bricklayer who had joined the British army during the Napoleonic Wars. However, his military career was short-lived, as he was convicted of a theft charge in 1803 and was sentenced to transportation to the convict settlement of Port Phillip, which is located in present-day Victoria, Australia. Upon arrival in Australia in 1804, Buckley managed to escape from the convict settlement along with a few other prisoners. He found his way to an Aboriginal group called the Wathaurong people, living in the area around Geelong and the Bellarine Peninsula. Buckley lived with the Wathaurong people for over 30 years, adopting their customs, language, and lifestyle, becoming a respected member of their community. The novel Strandloper explores various themes, such as cultural identity, survival, and personal transformation, as it delves into the experiences of Buckley living among the Wathaurong people. Through the story, Garner attempts to showcase the complex and rich culture of the Australian Aboriginal peoples and their interaction with European settlers. Additionally, the novel highlights the challenges faced by European convicts like Buckley while adapting to the Australian landscape and engaging with its Indigenous peoples. In conclusion, the book Strandloper is based on the true story of an English convict, William Buckley, who was transported to Australia in the early 19th century. Through Buckley's experiences and the cultural complexities of the Aboriginal society, the novel paints a vivid picture of Australia during that period, while also offering an engaging tale of survival and transformation. The answer to the question, \\"Strandloper was based on the story about an English convict who was transported to what country?\\" is Australia."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Generate a 5-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package de.ub0r.android.websms.

Avoid placing your greenhouse in direct sunlight or you'll risk burning the seeds. Keep your greenhouse covered with the lid in order to trap the warmth. A grow light can also provide warmth for your seedlings. Position an incandescent light at least 24 inches (61 cm) away from your plants to keep them from burning. A florescent light can be placed just 6 inches (15 cm) away from your greenhouse. If you see water accumulating on the surface of the pellet, stop and water a bit less next time. Be aware that each pellet may require varying amounts of water daily. You should see sprouts start to pop out of the soil after around 10 days post-planting. If the tops of the sprouts reach the lid when closed, then you'll need to start leaving the lid off. The heat generated by the lid can actually burn the sprouts and damage them. Get a single 2 US gal (7.6 L) planting pot for every 3 pellets. Add potting soil into each pot until it is halfway full. Then, fill up the rest of the pots with bark mulch. Dig a hole for each pellet that is just slightly larger than the pellet's actual size. Gently lift each planting pellet and place it within a hole in the pot. It's fine to place multiple pellets in a single pot, as long as they are not directly touching. If a pellet doesn't have a visible sprout, you can still transplant it and hope that it will produce a plant in time. Cover each pellet with about 0.39 inches (0.99 cm) of potting soil, so that the top of the pellet is no longer visible. Extended direct sun will continue to burn your bamboo seedlings, so make sure that your plants get about half sun, half shade. You might even need to move your pots around to ensure that they get at least 6 hours of light. The seedlings should stay a bright green color. If they turn yellow or brown, then they are getting too much sun.","output":"In summary, to grow seedlings from seeds, it is important to provide them with the minimum amount of sunlight required and maintain an optimal environment for their growth. To do this, avoid direct sunlight and use a greenhouse with a lid to trap warmth. You can also use grow lights, such as incandescent lights placed 24 inches (61 cm) away or florescent lights positioned 6 inches (15 cm) away. Monitor the water levels daily, adjusting the amount as per the needs of each pellet. After approximately 10 days, sprouts should emerge from the soil. If sprouts reach the lid, remove it to prevent damage from the trapped heat. When it's time to transplant, use a 2 US gal (7.6 L) planting pot for every 3 pellets. Fill each pot halfway with potting soil and the rest with bark mulch. Create holes slightly larger than the pellets and gently place them inside, making sure they are not touching. Cover each pellet with 0.39 inches (0.99 cm) of potting soil. In order to prevent burning of the bamboo seedlings, provide them with a mix of sun and shade (about 6 hours of light) and monitor their color. If the seedlings turn yellow or brown, adjust the sunlight exposure as they are receiving too much sun. Keep moving the pots around if necessary to provide an ideal growing environment for the seedlings."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text.

Dr. Damien O'Donovan is about to leave his native village to practise medicine in a London hospital. Meanwhile, his brother Teddy commands the local flying column of the Irish Republican Army. After a hurling match, Damien witnesses the summary execution of his friend, Micheál Ó Súilleabháin, by British Black and Tans. Although shaken, Damien rebuffs his friends' entreaties to stay in Ireland and join the IRA, saying that the war is unwinnable. As he is leaving town, Damien witnesses the British Army vainly trying to intimidate a railway personnel for refusing to permit the troops to board. In response, Damien decides to stay and is sworn into Teddy's IRA brigade. After drilling in the mountains, the column raids the village's Royal Irish Constabulary barracks to acquire revolvers, then uses them to assassinate four Auxiliaries. In the aftermath, Anglo-Irish landowner Sir John Hamilton coerces one of his servants, IRA member Chris Reilly, into passing information to the British Army's Intelligence Corps. As a result, the entire brigade is arrested. In their cell, Damien meets the train driver, Dan, a union official who shares Damien's socialist views. Meanwhile, British officers interrogate Teddy, pulling out his fingernails when he refuses to give them the names of IRA members. Johnny Gogan, a British soldier of Irish descent, helps the prisoners escape, but three are left behind.

Sentence 1: 'This is all the reasonably reliable, reasonably legitimate data on Benny Boy that I could find.' This sentence indicates that the speaker has gathered information or data on \\"Benny Boy\\" and has found at least some information that they consider reasonably reliable and legitimate. The speaker doesn't mention that they didn't know about Benny Boy before conducting the research. Sentence 2: 'I didn't know anything about Benny.' This sentence states that the speaker didn't know anything about Benny. It doesn't specify when they didn't know, though. Now let's analyze the options: I. Yes: This option suggests that both sentences are true, in which case it is possible that the speaker did not know anything about Benny before finding the reasonably reliable, legitimate data. II. It is not possible to tell: This option leaves room for ambiguity and might suggest that we cannot deduce whether the second sentence is true based on the information provided in the first sentence alone. III. No: This option indicates that the second sentence could not be true if the first sentence is true, suggesting that the speaker must have known something about Benny before finding the reasonably reliable, legitimate data. Based on our analysis, the appropriate answer to the question is: II. it is not possible to tell This is because sentence 1 only deals with the current state of the speaker’s knowledge about Benny Boy after conducting research, while sentence 2 doesn't specify the time frame when the speaker didn't know anything about Benny. Therefore, we cannot conclusively determine whether the second sentence is true based solely on the information provided in the first sentence."},{"instruction":"Come up with a question and reasoning that would justify this answer: no","output":"Question: Is it possible for a person to survive without ever consuming water?

Options: - pocket - ashtray - slot machine - floor - coin collection. Explanation:","output":"The correct answer is 'ashtray' because the phrase \\"tossed aside carelessly\\" implies that the token was thrown away without much thought or attention to where it would land. An ashtray is typically a receptacle where people keep their ashes, cigarette butts, and other waste. Therefore, it is the most appropriate option among the given choices, when compared to the others. - Pocket: This option is incorrect because putting something in a pocket usually requires a deliberate action and is not considered careless. - Slot machine: This choice is not correct because inserting a token into a slot machine also requires deliberate action and purpose. - Floor: While an argument could be made that a carelessly tossed token may end up on the floor, the floor is not a specific location as all other options are, making it the less precise answer. - Coin collection: This option is also incorrect because a coin collection typically requires careful organization and is not associated with carelessness.

The company's transformation from a scare-oriented industry to laughter-powered energy was momentous, thanks to Michael \\"Mike\\" Wazowski and Sulley himself. But, with the role of the CEO on his shoulders now, the plot of our movie thickens. Act 1: The movie begins with a touching ceremony where Sulley is named CEO of Monsters, Inc., succeeding the retired CEO after serving in the field for over three decades. His proud scare-aide, Mike, is right by his side, thrilled to see his best friend taking up the prestigious position. Their celebration is cut short when Sulley is whisked away to his first board meeting, where he is met with unfamiliar faces, doubts, misgivings, and immense pressure to lead the company in the competitive energy industry. Act 2: With Sulley at the helm, Monsters, Inc., makes steady progress, embracing the laugh energy while still dealing with echoes of the old screams era. However, trouble brews when a rival company, \\"Fear Front,\\" headed by a cutthroat yet intriguing monster named Blight, begins to gain ground. Fear Front upholds the old ways, believing in scaring over laughter, and presents a formidable challenge to Monsters, Inc's new laughter model. Meanwhile, Sulley is fascinated by a young newcomer, a little monster named Lily, who despite her appearance gets laugh energy more than anyone in the Inc., becomes a beacon of hope for Sulley and the entire Company. Lily inspires the management to look beyond conventional means of energy collection and work towards harnessing energy from humans' positive emotions other than laughter - like kindness, empathy, and love. Act 3: Even with Lily’s efforts and innovation, Fear Front threatens to outdo Monsters, Inc. with its successful yet ethically dubious model based on fear extraction. It capitalizes on humans’ primal fears and the company's traditionalists who couldn't shift paradigm from scaring to eliciting laughter. Blight, viewing Sulley’s leadership as weak and unfit for the competitive energy market, steals Lily's innovative “Emotion Engine,” a groundbreaking device to harness diverse positive human emotions. In this sickening twist, Sulley and Mike, Lily, and a few trusted allies launch a covert operation to retrieve the stolen tech, expose Blight's deceptive practices, and save their company. Act 4: The climax of the movie witnesses a thrilling face-off between Sulley's team and Blight's goons inside the Fear Front's headquarters. Mike and Lily manage to retrieve the Emotion Engine while Sulley stands up to Blight. The operation unfolds amidst chaos, comedy, and suspense, culminating in a high-stakes chase across the city. In the end, Sulley, equipped with Lily’s tech, manages to expose Fear Front's exploitative practices to the Monsters’ world. The revelations led to Fear Front's shut-down. Sulley, backed by the triumphant public approval, manages to bring Monsters, Inc. back to its glory, proving that positive emotions and laughter are indeed more potent than fear and intimidation. Epilogue: Monsters, Inc., now even more successful, harnesses energy from a spectrum of positive human emotions, after Lily's Emotion Engine is successfully integrated into their model. Sulley’s role as CEO receives overwhelming approval, and his leadership sets the company on a path of steady growth and ethical business practices. The movie ends on a hopeful note, suggesting that courage, ingenuity, and a bit of laughter can keep the darkness at bay."},{"instruction":"Generate a question that has the following answer: Abel for the following movie plot: Nothing much happens in the lives of 20-something pals Dexter and Royce except for getting high and hanging out with Royceâs girlfriend, Matilda ('Mattie').

If she got 78 yellow scores, we need to find the difference between the number of black and white scores she used and then calculate 2/3 of that difference. The total parts representing the combined scores in the 7:6 ratio are 7 + 6 = 13. We can now find how many yellow scores resulted from one part of the combined scores: 78 yellow scores / 13 parts = 6 yellow scores per part Now we can find the number of white and black scores Taylor used: White scores: 7 parts * 6 yellow scores per part = 42 white scores Black scores: 6 parts * 6 yellow scores per part = 36 black scores Now let's find the difference between the number of black and white scores: Difference = 42 white scores - 36 black scores = 6 scores Finally, we calculate 2/3 of the difference: (2/3) * 6 scores = 4 scores So, 2/3 of the difference between the number of black and white scores Taylor used is 4 scores."},{"instruction":"Summarize: Traders have taken some confidence from a pledge by the Japanese government to stabilise the financial markets. The Nikkei closed 2.4% up at 15,309.21 after losing almost 8% on Friday. The yen, though, remains strong at 101.8 to the dollar. This hurts Japan's exporting firms by making their goods more expensive on world markets. Follow the latest developments on our live page The yen has gained ground because it is considered a haven currency, a status which has been bolstered by the continued decline of the pound. The pound continued to slide in trading in Asia on Monday, adding to Friday's record one-day decline. In a response to the currency moves and the risk it poses to Japan's crucial export sector, the government held an emergency meeting with the central bank. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told Finance Minister Taro Aso to watch currency movements \\"ever more closely\\" and take steps if necessary. \\"Risks and uncertainty remain in financial markets,\\" Mr Abe said. \\"We need to continue to work toward market stability.\\" It is difficult to guess if investors are bargain hunting or if the prime minister's repeated promise to intervene if necessary have calmed the market. The yen, which surged to the highest level since 2013 on Friday, has stabilised for now, which helps shares in Japanese exporters. But analysts say the volatility in the Japanese yen will continue and the government might still have to intervene. Shoppers that I spoke to in Ginza on Sunday all expressed concerns. \\"It is disappointment for Japan,\\" one woman said. \\"In terms of exports and especially when we think about those Japanese companies in UK. I hear Brexit may have a longer effect than the financial crisis so I am worried.\\" Others were concerned about the direct impact on Japanese companies with their overseas investments being affected. \\"I am worried because my company has business with UK so I am concerned about the future,\\" one shopper told me.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng index closed down 0.2% at 20,227.30 points, while China's benchmark Shanghai Composite finished up 1.5% at 2,895.70. Over the weekend, China's Finance Minister Lou Jiwei said the consequences of the UK leaving the EU were still unclear, but that they would be felt for years to come. The country's central bank weakened the yuan fix by 0.9%, on Monday, the biggest daily move since August 2015. South Korea's benchmark Kospi index finished flat at 1,926.85. Australia's ASX/200 in Sydney closed 0.5% higher at 5,137.20. Both the Kospi and the ASX/200 had lost more than 3% on Friday in the wake of the UK's vote to leave the EU.

Answer:","output":"The last step of the process resulting from acid rain could be a series of negative ecological, environmental, and human impacts. Here is a detailed explanation of the final step of acid rain consequences: 1. Disruption of aquatic ecosystems: Acid rain pollutes water bodies like rivers, lakes, and streams, leading to a decrease in their pH levels. This makes the water more acidic, causing harm to aquatic life, such as fish, plankton, and other organisms. A drop in pH can lead to a decrease in biodiversity as sensitive species succumb to the acidic conditions, resulting in a shift in the structure and function of the ecosystem. In extreme cases, the acidification of water can lead to the complete collapse of local aquatic ecosystems, affecting the food chain and remaining organisms. 2. Soil and nutrient depletion: Acid rain affects the soil by altering its chemical composition. This results in the leaching of essential nutrients like magnesium and calcium, which are vital for the growth of plants. The depletion of necessary soil nutrients has an adverse effect on plant growth, crop yield, and overall forest health. Moreover, the acidification of the soil releases toxic metals like aluminum, which can be absorbed by the root systems of plants, causing damage and additional stress. 3. Damage to buildings and infrastructure: Acid rain contributes to the deterioration of buildings, monuments, bridges, and other structures, particularly those made of limestone, concrete, or metal. The acid in the rain reacts with the minerals in these materials, causing chemical weathering, corrosion, and a subsequent decline in their structural integrity. This not only has a significant cultural and historical impact but also entails financial consequences, as the damage necessitates repair or replacement. 4. Human health risks: Although acid rain does not directly harm people, it can lead to indirect adverse effects on human health. For instance, the release of toxic substances into the soil and water systems due to acid rain may contaminate drinking water or be taken up by plants that are later consumed by humans. Moreover, gaseous precursors of acid rain, such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, contribute to the formation of particulate matter, which can become lodged in lung tissue and exacerbate respiratory illnesses like asthma and bronchitis. 5. Climate change: The emissions that lead to acid rain are also linked to climate change. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are greenhouse gases that trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, contributing to global warming and causing changes in weather patterns, increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, and disruptions to ecosystems. To summarize, the last step of the process initiated by acid rain would consist of a wide range of detrimental effects on ecosystems, infrastructure, and human health. Acid rain disrupts the balance of both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, damages built structures, poses risks to human health, and contributes to climate change. Consequently, efforts to reduce emissions and mitigate the impact of acid rain are essential to preserving the environment and ensuring the well-being of human populations and natural habitats."},{"instruction":"He went to Glasgow and met with the Bishop of Glasgow, Robert Wishart. Rather than excommunicate Bruce, Wishart absolved him and urged people to rise in his support. They both then travelled to Scone, where they were met by Lamberton and other prominent churchmen and nobles. Less than seven weeks after the killing in Dumfries, at Scone Abbey on 25 March 1306, Robert Bruce was crowned as King Robert I of Scotland. He then began a new campaign to free his kingdom. After being defeated in battle, he was driven from the Scottish mainland as an outlaw. Bruce later came out of hiding in 1307. The Scots thronged to him, and he defeated the English in a number of battles. His forces continued to grow in strength, encouraged in part by the death of Edward I in July 1307. The Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 was an especially important Scottish victory. In 1320, the Declaration of Arbroath was sent by a group of Scottish nobles to the Pope affirming Scottish independence from England. Two similar declarations were also sent by the clergy and Robert I. In 1327, Edward II of England was deposed and killed. The invasion of the North of England by Robert the Bruce forced Edward III of England to sign the Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton on 1 May 1328, which recognised the independence of Scotland with Bruce as King. To further seal the peace, Robert's son and heir David married the sister of Edward III. Based on the above article, answer a question.

Stream of Consciousness Reasoning: When we think about the various functions of the human body, we can quickly identify that there are specific parts responsible for certain tasks. For example, our eyes are responsible for giving us the ability to see, our hands help us in performing physical tasks, and our hearts pump blood throughout. Now, let's consider the functions mentioned in the question - speaking, eating, and starting the process of digestion. When we communicate, our vocal cords produce sound but there's another body part that plays an important role in articulation and expression - the part that allows us to produce different sounds and words through movements and manipulation of airflow. That same body part is also responsible for taking in food, which is essential for our survival. Lastly, when we consume food, the initial break down of nutrients starts at this particular part of our body, before it continues down our digestive system. Considering these facts, the answer to the question is the mouth. It is the part of the human body that plays a crucial role in speaking, eating, and kick-starting the process of digestion by breaking down food through chewing and mixing it with saliva, which contains enzymes that start breaking down food components."},{"instruction":"Write the answer: King Hussein of Jordan dies, Chinese embassy in Belgrade bombed by NATO planes, and Prince Edward marries.

Hint: In nature, when the population size is small, there is usually plenty of food and other resources for each individual. When there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can easily reproduce, so the birth rate is high. As the population increases, the food supply, or the supply of another necessary resource, may decrease. When necessary resources, such as food, decrease, some individuals will die. Overall, the population cannot reproduce at the same rate, so the birth rates drop.

Italy has a small population, which indicates that there is a higher likelihood of having more food and other resources available per individual. When the food supply is abundant, the organisms can easily reproduce, leading to high birth rates at the time. 2. In contrast, Spain has a very large population. With a large population, there is an increased possibility of decreased food supply or other resources.

The Illinois Supreme Court is pushing for legislation that would allow it to dedicate money raised through the fee hikes to legal services to the poor. The justices are floating a 42 increase to shore up financing for pro-bono work, as the normal funding mechanism for legal services has fallen short in recent years. Currently, support for non-profit legal aid groups comes from interest generated on the Lawyers' Trust Fund, which pools clients' money that attorneys hold for such matters as escrow funds. But low interest rates and a sagging economy mean there is less money being generated. After hours of discussion, the high court agreed that raising the registration fees would be the best way to address the declining revenues, Chief Justice Moses W. Harrison II said. The judges were reluctant to raise those fees but eventually decided that supporting probono services was important enough \\"and lawyers had a responsibility to contribute\\" to the cause, Harrison said. Last year, the high court raised the base fee for active attorneys to 180 from 140. Lawyers in their first three years of practice or who are inactive pay 90, and retired lawyers pay nothing. Legislation circulated by the high court's lobbyist specifies that the hike would apply to attorneys \\"paying full annual registration fees.\\" In 2001, there were 57,392 active attorneys in Illinois and 74,311 on the full roll, according to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission. The hike would raise roughly 2.4 million. Last year, interest on the trust fund totaled 4.5 million, but service and handling fees consumed 538,000 of that amount. This year's returns are projected to be anywhere between 700,000 and 1 million short of that mark, said Ruth Ann Schmitt, the executive director of Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois. Harrison said the fee hikes are designed only to counter the shortfall in interest income, not add to the total amount available. \\"Our legal services are already stretched to the breaking point,\\" Schmitt said. \\"We have a tough time raising enough money to properly fund services that our clients need.\\" Neither the Illinois State Bar Association nor The Chicago Bar Association has taken a stance on the proposed hikes. After reading the above, is \\"To fund raise for a new law scholarship\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Why did the high court raise the base fee for active attorneys to 180 from 140?\\"?","output":"No, the correct answer is not \\"To fund raise for a new law scholarship.\\" The high court raised the base fee for active attorneys to 180 from 140 to address declining revenues and support pro bono services and lawyers with drug and alcohol problems.

Failing to sell at the Summer Exhibition, The Combat was bought from Etty by fellow artist John Martin for 300 guineas (about £24,000 in 2019 terms), following a promise Martin had made to Etty before the painting was complete. The painting was too large for Martin's house, and in 1831 he sold it on to the Royal Scottish Academy. It was transferred in 1910 to the nearby National Gallery of Scotland where it remains. One of Etty's major works, it was exhibited at numerous major exhibitions including the seminal Art Treasures Exhibition of 1857, before Etty fell out of fashion in the second half of the 19th century. Throughout his life, The Combat continued to be considered one of Etty's most powerful paintings. In 1845, Etty took a smaller 89 by 118 cm (35 by 46 in) copy of The Combat, which had been painted by an unknown Edinburgh artist, and completely reworked it to serve as the basis for an engraving by George Thomas Doo. The engraving was published three years later, and the painting used as its model passed through the hands of several collectors in subsequent years, before entering the collection of the Ringling Museum in 1934. A number of sketches attributed to Etty, under the name of A Study for Mercy Interceding for the Vanquished, are also in circulation.After the success of The Combat, Etty continued with his preferred theme of history paintings containing nudity; of the 15 pictures he exhibited at the Royal Academy during the 1820s (including Cleopatra, Pandora and The Combat) all but one contained a nude figure. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, at that time the most prestigious honour available to an artist. The Combat was the first very large work attempted by Etty, and its success prompted him to produce further works on a similar scale over the rest of his career; he produced nine very large paintings illustrating moral themes throughout his career. As time went by his canvases came to be increasingly dominated by nude women.The 1832 exhibition of Youth on the Prow, and...

Context: Two chains of DNA twist around each other to form a DNA double helix with the phosphate-sugar backbone spiralling around the outside, and the bases pointing inwards with adenine base pairing to thymine and guanine to cytosine. The specificity of base pairing occurs because adenine and thymine align form two hydrogen bonds, whereas cytosine and guanine form three hydrogen bonds. The two strands in a double helix must therefore be complementary, with their sequence of bases matching such that the adenines of one strand are paired with the thymines of the other strand, and so on.:4.1","output":"The answer to the question is that the adenine-thymine pairs are connected by two hydrogen bonds."},{"instruction":"Continue writing the following text.

As a junior, Barkley stood 5 ft 10 in (1.78 m) and weighed 220 pounds (100 kg). He failed to make the varsity team and was named as a reserve. However, during the summer Barkley grew to 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) and earned a starting position on the varsity as a senior. During his 16-year NBA career, Barkley was regarded as one of the most controversial, outspoken and dominating players in the history of basketball. His impact on the sport went beyond his rebounding titles, assists, scoring and physical play. His confrontational mannerisms often led to technical fouls and fines on the court, and his larger than life persona sometimes gave rise to national controversy off of it, such as when he was featured in ads that rejected pro athletes as role models and declared, \\"I am not a role model.\\" Although his words often led to controversy, according to Barkley his mouth was never the cause because it always spoke the truth. He stated, \\"I don't create controversies. They're there long before I open my mouth. I just bring them to your attention.\\" Besides his on-court fights with other players, he has exhibited confrontational behavior off-court. He was arrested for breaking a man's nose during a fight after a game with the Milwaukee Bucks and also for throwing a man through a plate-glass window after being struck with a glass of ice. Barkley continues to be popular with the fans and media because of his sense of humor and honesty. As a player, Barkley was a perennial All-Star who earned league MVP honors in 1993. He employed a physical style of play that earned him the nicknames \\"Sir Charles\\" and \\"The Round Mound of Rebound\\". He was named to the All-NBA team eleven times and earned two gold medals as a member of the United States Olympic Basketball team. He led both teams in scoring and was instrumental in helping the 1992 \\"Dream Team\\" and 1996 Men's Basketball team compile a perfect 16-0 record. He retired as one of only four players in NBA history to record at least 20,000 points, 10,000 rebounds and 4,000 assists in their career, In recognition of his collegiate and NBA achievements, Barkley's number 34 jersey was officially retired by Auburn University on March 3, 2001. In the same month, the Philadelphia 76ers also officially retired Barkley's jersey. On March 20, 2004, the Phoenix Suns honored Barkley as well by retiring his jersey including him in the \\"Suns Ring of Honor\\". In recognition of his achievements as a player, Barkley was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: does it say why he got into the fight?","output":"Barkley is a basketball player who was known for being very talented, but also for getting into some trouble.

Assess the situation: The president would first gather information on the nature of the hate attack, who the perpetrators are, their motivations, and the extent of the damage. 2. Consult advisors: The president would consult with their national security team, military advisors, and other key stakeholders to evaluate possible responses to the attack and their implications. 3. Analyze options: In this case, the president may consider the following options: a. Wage war: This would involve a large-scale, declared military conflict against the perpetrators or their supporters. This option may be chosen if the attack represents a threat to national security or the president deems it necessary to defend the nation. b. Fight enemy: This option is similar to waging war, but it may be less intense or involve covert operations rather than a formal declaration of war. The president could deploy military force or intelligence resources to target and neutralize the perpetrators. c. Kill (assassinate): This response could involve targeting and killing leaders of the group responsible for the hate attack, either with a targeted strike or special operations forces. This might be chosen if the president believes this would deter future attacks and minimize the risk of escalation. d. Destroy enemy: This would involve a more comprehensive approach to dismantling the attackers' organization, potentially through military action, economic sanctions, or diplomatic pressure. e. Attacked his country: This option seems out of context, as it implies the president attacking their own country. Please clarify if you meant something different. 4. Consider repercussions: The president must also weigh the potential consequences of their chosen response, including possible retaliation from the perpetrators, international implications, and domestic political reactions. 5.

Some kids might resent their father micromanaging their sports participation, but I knew I was lucky. There was no one better than my dad when it came to baseball.\\" The reason I chose the word 'baseball' to fill the blank space is because of the context of the passage. The sentence mentions the child aiming to be ready for the major leagues, which highly suggests that the sport being referred to is baseball, as the Major League Baseball (MLB) is one of the most well-known professional sports leagues in the United States. Moreover, the fact that the child feels lucky to have their father's guidance in the sport implies a level of expertise and experience that the father possesses in that specific field. Baseball is a sport where having a knowledgeable and experienced coach or mentor can significantly impact a player's performance and growth. In this passage, the relationship between the child and their father revolves around the shared passion for baseball. The father, with his expertise and experience in the sport, helps nurture and develop the child's talent. The child, on the other hand, is grateful for having their father by their side, contributing valuable insights and advice to enhance their skills in the sport. Having a father who excels in baseball can indeed be an invaluable asset for a child aspiring to join the major leagues. The father's know-how of the game, combined with years of experience, would enable them to impart precious strategies, techniques, routines, and other critical aspects related to baseball. This kind of support and guidance would not only help the child grow as an athlete but also foster a deep bond between them and their father, united by their love for the game. In conclusion, the word 'baseball' best fits the blank space in the given passage, as it conveys the essence of the story and completes the narrative of the child's appreciation for their father's expertise and guidance in the sport. The child's aspiration to be ready for the major leagues and their acknowledgment of their father's invaluable role in helping them highlights the significance of their shared devotion to baseball."},{"instruction":"Problem: Solve a = 8*a - 28 for a.

Now, the equation says that the same number of apples is equal to 8 times \\"a\\" apples minus 28 apples. We want to find out how many apples you have. To do this, follow these steps: 1. Subtract \\"a\\" from both sides of the equation (to have all the \\"a\\" terms on one side): - a - a = 8*a - a - 28 - 0 = 7*a - 28 2. Now, we have 7 times the number of apples minus 28 equals 0. To find out how many apples you have, we need to isolate \\"a\\". So, let's add 28 to both sides of the equation: - 7*a - 28 + 28 = 0 + 28 - 7*a = 28 3. Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 7 to find out the value of \\"a\\": - 7*a / 7 = 28 / 7 - a = 4 So, the answer is: You have \\"a\\" = 4 apples."},{"instruction":"I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the whole first name of the person who saves Gaby's life? ?

The meaning and sentiment of the sentence are highly dependent on the situation and the overall tone of the conversation. Option 1 - Negative: If the sentence is used in a negative context, it might imply a sense of discomfort, disinterest, or possibly even danger. For example, if the speaker is referring to an argument, an awkward situation, or witnessing a disturbing event, then the sentiment of the sentence is negative. In these examples, being able to look away would mean they desire to temporarily escape from the unpleasant situation. Option 2 - Positive: However, if the sentence is used in a positive context, it might imply an aspect of fascination, engagement, or wonder. For example, if the speaker is discussing an engrossing movie, an intriguing conversation, or an awe-inspiring sight, then the sentiment of the sentence would be positive. In these examples, being unable to look away would mean that the subject is capturing their full attention and interest. As an AI assistant, my primary task is to provide a detailed answer. Without specific context, it is impossible to definitively determine whether the sentiment of the sentence \\"be able to look away for a second\\" is positive or negative.

Step 1: Understand the process Here, the process described is the formation of fossil fuels, specifically oil, from the remains of dead plants and animals. Step 2: Analyze the perturbation The perturbation mentioned is the increased death of plants and animals. Step 3: Establish the relationship An increased amount of dead plants and animals leads to more organic matter that can potentially form oil. Step 4: Examine the influence As the amount of dead plants and animals increases, the potential for more organic matter to be buried under layers of soil and convert into oil also increases. Step 5: Determine the effect The supposed perturbation (more plants and animals dying) would have a \\"more\\" effect on the formation of oil.

A typical definition of gravity is that it is a force. It causes an attraction between two masses. According to this definition, anything that has mass exerts a force. Any object exerts gravity on other objects. It does not matter how small it is, it has gravity. The more matter an object has, the more gravity it has. Your pencil has a tiny bit of gravity, but far too little to notice. What about a planet? It would have a lot of gravity. An objects gravity exerts a pull on other objects. Friction only occurs between objects that are touching. Gravity can act between objects that are not touching. In fact, gravity can act over very long distances. Where else can you feel gravity?

Queen are a British rock band that formed in London in 1970. Their classic line-up was Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (lead guitar, vocals), Roger Taylor (drums, vocals), and John Deacon (bass guitar). Queen's earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock, into their music. At the end of 2004, May and Taylor announced that they would reunite and return to touring in 2005 with Paul Rodgers (founder and former lead singer of Free and Bad Company). Brian May's website also stated that Rodgers would be \\"featured with\\" Queen as \\"Queen + Paul Rodgers\\", not replacing Mercury. The retired John Deacon would not be participating.

Between 2005 and 2006, Queen + Paul Rodgers embarked on a world tour, which was the first time Queen toured since their last tour with Freddie Mercury in 1986. The band's drummer Roger Taylor commented; \\"We never thought we would tour again, Paul [Rodgers] came along by chance and we seemed to have a chemistry. Paul is just such a great singer.

The display of raw emotion showcases the decades-old wounds that Bulger's alleged crimes have left on the families of his victims. James \\"Whitey\\" Bulger, infamous for his involvement in organized crime, has been charged with several counts, including murder, racketeering, and drug trafficking. As the trial continues, friends and family members of the victims have become increasingly frustrated with the proceedings. The widow, visibly shaken and angry, shouted toward Bulger as she disrupted the trial. Her son later told reporters, \\"He is going to take his secrets to the grave with him.\\" The pain and anguish caused by the loss of a loved one at the hands of a brutal criminal is evident in these powerful words. Bulger, noticeably unfazed by the interruption, responded to the judge with a dismissive, \\"This is a sham. Do what ya's want with me.\\" His nonchalance in the face of the emotional turmoil surrounding the case offers a chilling insight into the mind of a man who has been extensively involved in criminal activity. In an unexpected move, Bulger has offered assets of nearly 822,000 to the victims' families if he is convicted of the charges against him. Many have questioned the motives behind this generous offer, as some see this action as an attempt to regain public support or alleviate guilt. However, it is undeniable that this financial assistance could provide some level of comfort to the family members who have endured severe heartache following the untimely deaths of their loved ones. The heated exchanges between the accused mobster and the victims' families paint a vivid picture of the emotional intensity that has come to define this trial. As evidence continues to stack up against Bulger, it remains to be seen whether he will indeed take his secrets to the grave or face justice. Not only does the story of James \\"Whitey\\" Bulger bring attention to the deeply rooted issues in the world of organized crime, but it also serves as a poignant reminder of the human cost of such atrocities. Displaying resilience and determination, the families of Bulger's alleged victims stand strong and united against the man who has caused them so much pain and sorrow. In conclusion, the trial of James \\"Whitey\\" Bulger continues to captivate the nation as a harrowing and profound testimony to the consequences of a life led on the wrong side of the law. As the drama unfolds, one can only hope that justice will be served for the victims' families and that the truth will be unveiled, providing closure and allowing for healing to begin."},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given a question and a context passage.

Question: neurons talk each other through Context: The brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals. Only a few invertebrates such as sponges, jellyfish, adult sea squirts and starfish do not have a brain; diffuse or localised nerve nets are present instead. The brain is located in the head, usually close to the primary sensory organs for such senses as vision, hearing, balance, taste, and smell. The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. In a typical human, the cerebral cortex (the largest part) is estimated to contain 15–33 billion neurons, each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells.

Can you help me answer a few questions? If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\". Question: Who hired the hitman that kidnapped Aladeen? Movie title: The Dictator Movie plot: For years, the Republic of Wadiya has been ruled by Admiral General Haffaz Aladeen (Sacha Baron Cohen), a childish, tyrannical, sexist, anti-western, and antisemitic despot who surrounds himself with female bodyguards, sponsors al-Qaeda (specially giving shelter to Osama Bin Laden after \\"they killed his double one year ago\\") and is working on developing nuclear weapons to attack Israel. He also refused to sell Wadiya's oil fields, a promise he made to his father on his deathbed. After the United Nations Security Council resolves to intervene militarily, Aladeen travels to the UN Headquarters in New York to address the council. Shortly after arriving, Aladeen is kidnapped by Clayton (John C. Reilly), a hitman hired by his treacherous uncle Tamir (Ben Kingsley), whom Aladeen's father passed over as successor in favor of his son. Tamir then replaces Aladeen with a dimwitted political decoy named Efawadh (Baron Cohen), whom he intends to manipulate into signing a document nominally democratizing Wadiya while opening the country's oil fields to Chinese and other foreign vested interests. Aladeen escapes after Clayton accidentally kills himself in a botched torture attempt; when his corpse is discovered Tamir thinks Aladeen has been killed. However, Aladeen is practically unrecognizable as Clayton shaved off his trademark long beard prior to his death. Wandering through New York, Aladeen encounters Zoey (Anna Faris), a human rights activist who offers him a job at her socially progressive, alternative lifestyle co-op. Aladeen refuses the offer and encounters \\"Nuclear\\" Nadal (Jason Mantzoukas), the former chief of Wadiya's nuclear weapons program, whom Aladeen thought he had previously executed over an argument about the warhead's shape. Aladeen follows him to New York's \\"Little Wadiya\\" which is populated by refugees from his country, and meets him in Death to Aladeen Restaurant, run by and visited by numerous people whom Aladeen had personally ordered executed. Nadal saves Aladeen from nearly being recognized by... A:","output":"In the movie \\"The Dictator,\\" the character that hired the hitman to kidnap Aladeen is his uncle, Tamir, played by actor Ben Kingsley. Tamir is a treacherous individual motivated by a desire for power and control over Wadiya's resources. Tamir's plan to usurp Aladeen and seize power in Wadiya involves hiring hitman Clayton (John C. Reilly) to kidnap and kill Aladeen while he is in New York City to address the United Nations Security Council. Tamir aims to replace Aladeen with a dimwitted political decoy named Efawadh, portrayed also by Sacha Baron Cohen, whom he can manipulate to serve his own interests. Tamir intends to use Efawadh to sign a document that nominally democratizes Wadiya, while in reality, opening up the country’s oil fields to foreign vested interests, including those from China. Tamir's actions are driven by greed and a need for control, hoping to benefit personally from the exploitation of Wadiya's resources. However, Aladeen manages to escape the kidnapping attempt after Clayton accidentally kills himself during a botched torture attempt. Aladeen's survival and eventual return to power, with the help of his former nuclear weapons chief \\"Nuclear\\" Nadal, ultimately foil Tamir's power-hungry scheme. In conclusion, the hitman's hiring in \\"The Dictator\\" is a critical plot point that highlights the treacherous intentions of Tamir in his quest for power and control over Wadiya's resources. This crucial element of the story drives the narrative forward, allowing for character development and a resolution that ultimately sees Aladeen thwarting his uncle's malicious plans. As you consider whether to invest in this film proposal, it's essential to examine the various plot points and character motivations to determine if the story would be engaging, resonant, and successful with audiences."},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given inputs i and A, where i is an integer and A is a list.

A:","output":"Igneous intrusion is a geological process where molten magma forces its way through the Earth's crust and solidifies underground, creating various rock formations and contributing to the natural development of various mineral deposits. There are a few valuable products created through this process, including economic resources, distinct geological structures, and a variety of rock types. 1. Economic resources: One of the most significant outcomes of igneous intrusion is the formation of mineral deposits and ores. As the magma cools and solidifies, it can concentrate valuable elements and minerals, like gold, copper, silver, and rare earth elements. These resources are often extracted through mining operations, making igneous intrusion host rock for the extraction of economically important minerals. 2. Geological structures: Igneous intrusions create a variety of geological structures, including dikes, sills, laccoliths, batholiths, and plutons. These geological features provide insight into the Earth's history, tectonic activity, and the distribution of mineral resources. For example, scientists can study these structures to understand how and when the magma intruded, how it interacted with the existing rock layers, and the implications of the intrusion for landscape evolution. 3. Rock types: Igneous intrusions result in the creation of different rock types, depending on the chemical composition and cooling rate of the magma. The most common types of igneous rocks formed through intrusive processes are granite, gabbro, diorite, and peridotite. These rocks can vary in appearance and properties, providing unique opportunities for research, construction, and decorative purposes. While igneous intrusion contributes to processes such as metamorphism wherein rock layers surrounding the intrusion can be altered by added heat and pressure, the correct answer to the question \\"what does igneous intrusion create?\\" is not explicitly \\"adding heat.\\" Instead, a more comprehensive answer would include the creation of valuable economic resources, distinct geological structures, and various rock types, as mentioned above."},{"instruction":"People do what during their time off from work?

People's activities during their time off from work vary significantly depending on their personal interests, lifestyles, and circumstances. However, among the options provided, taking trips is the most suitable one, as it is a common way for people to spend their leisure time and de-stress. In more detail, during their time off from work, people often aim to detach from their work environment and routine. In this context, taking trips, whether short or long ones, is a popular choice. Traveling provides people with opportunities to explore new places, experience different cultures, and create memories. It also serves as an effective way of relaxation and rejuvenation, allowing people to return to work with a fresh mind and a renewed sense of energy. Though the other options might be applicable in some contexts, they are not as universally fitting. For instance, learning from each other (option B) or talking to coworkers (option D) are activities typically associated with work or professional development rather than leisure time. Option A (grow shorter) and E (become hysterical) are not related to typical activities during time off from work. In addition, it's important to note that other common activities during time off that were not provided in the options might include pursuing hobbies, spending time with friends and family, engaging in physical activities or sports, reading, watching movies, or simply resting and doing nothing in particular."},{"instruction":"Translate to French: The referring court proceeded on the premiss that if a Member State has correctly implemented the provisions of a directive, such as Article 11A(1) of the Sixth Directive, in domestic law, individuals are thereby deprived of the possibility of relying before the courts of that Member State on the rights which they may derive from those provisions.","output":"La cour de renvoi a procédé sur la base de l'hypothèse selon laquelle si un État membre a correctement mis en œuvre les dispositions d'une directive, telles que l'article 11A(1) de la sixième directive, dans le droit national, les individus sont ainsi privés de la possibilité de se prévaloir devant les tribunaux de cet État membre des droits dont ils peuvent tirer de ces dispositions.

Article: Do you know why different animals or pests have their special colors? Colors in them seem to be used mainly to protect themselves. Some birds like eating locusts. but birds cannot easily catch them. Why? It is because locusts change their colors together with the change of the colors of crops. When crops are green, locusts look green. But as the harvest time comes, locusts change to the same brown color as crops have. Some other pests with different colors from plants are easily found and eaten by others. So they have to hide themselves for lives and appear only at night. If you study the animal life, you'll find the main use of coloring is protecting themselves. Bears, lions and other animals move quietly through forests. They cannot be seen by hunters. This is because they have the colors much like the tree. Have you ever noticed an even more strange act? A kind of fish in the sea can send out a kind of very black liquid when it faces danger.

In 1979, the locomotive was renumbered \\"1881\\", painted black with silver stripes, and leased to a Hollywood company for use in the filming of the horror movie Terror Train (1979), starring Jamie Lee Curtis. In 1980, the locomotive was repainted with a color scheme used by Canadian Pacific in the 1930s. The black, gold, and Tuscan red paint job was popular with railroad enthusiasts and photographers. The number 1293 was also restored to the engine. In February 1982, the headlights, handrails, and cab roof of 1293 were damaged when the roof of a Steamtown storage building gave way to heavy snow.Although the Steamtown Special History Study reasoned that, since this type of locomotive had historically operated in New England, perhaps as far south as Boston, it qualified to be part of the federal government's collection, the Canadian native sat unused for 12 years following the move to Scranton. Ohio Central Railroad System purchased it in 1996, and it underwent a 13-month restoration. As of July 2010, Ohio Central Railroad has lost control of most of its holdings, but former owner, Jerry Joe Jacobson, maintained a collection of vintage equipment including CPR 1293 and her sister, CRP 1278, which is also a veteran of Steamtown, U.S.A. operational locomotives. No. 1293 is still operational as of October 2011.Canadian Pacific Railway No. 1278, like her sister, CPR 1293, was also built by Canadian Locomotive Company in 1948, and is a type 4-6-2, class G5d light-weight \\"Pacific\\" locomotive. It was purchased by Blount in May 1965, and renumbered 127. Blount had planned to renumber all three of the series 1200 CRP locomotives in his collection from 1246, 1278, and 1293 to 124, 127 and 129 respectively, but 1278 was the only one of the three that underwent the change. The new number remained on the locomotive from 1966 until 1973, when its former number was restored. The locomotive was leased to the Cadillac and Lake City Railroad in Michigan from 1970 to 1971.

Purchase seeds or seedlings. Choose a sunny location for the tree.\\" Article:","output":"Title: A Step-by-Step Guide to Cultivating Almond Trees in Your Garden Introduction Almond trees are not only a beautiful addition to your garden but also a source of delicious and nutritious nuts that can be enjoyed year after year. However, before you jump into the almond cultivation process, it’s essential to understand the specific growing conditions and requirements needed for these trees to thrive. This article will provide a detailed guide on how to ensure proper almond growing conditions in your area, the best way to purchase seeds or seedlings, and choosing the perfect sunny spot for your almond tree to flourish. Step 1: Ensure Proper Almond Growing Conditions Almond trees (Prunus dulcis) thrive in Mediterranean climates with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. These conditions are essential for successful almond production, as the trees require a long and frost-free growing season and plenty of sunlight for their flowers and fruits to develop properly. Some key factors to consider for proper almond growing conditions include: 1. Climate: Aim for a location with a USDA hardiness zone between 7 and 9. Almond trees are susceptible to frost damage during their flowering and budding stages; a suitable climate should have mild winters and low frost risk. 2. Soil: Almond trees prefer well-draining, deep, and loamy soil with a pH level between 6 and 8. Avoid areas with heavy clay or poorly draining soil, as these conditions can stunt the tree's growth and reduce overall yield. 3. Water Requirements: While almond trees are relatively drought-tolerant, they still need a consistent supply of water throughout the growing season. Ensure your chosen area has access to a reliable water source or plan for a consistent watering schedule. Step 2: Purchase Seeds or Seedlings After you’ve established that your area meets the proper almond growing conditions, the next step is to purchase almond seeds or seedlings. Here's what you need to know: 1. Seeds: Almond seeds can be more challenging to cultivate, as they require stratification or a period of cold temperature exposure to break dormancy. Additionally, almond trees grown from seeds may take up to 5 years to bear their first fruits. When purchasing almond seeds, choose a reputable supplier to ensure high-quality seeds free of contaminants. 2. Seedlings: If you prefer a faster and more consistent route, you can buy almond seedlings or grafted trees from a local nursery or online retailer, with the added benefit of reaping the rewards of your efforts sooner. Grafted trees are often preferred as their growth and yield have specific characteristics from the parent tree. Step 3: Choose a Sunny Location The final step to plant and grow your almond tree is selecting the perfect location in your garden that meets its sunlight requirements. Almond trees need at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight every day for proper growth and fruit development. Here are some tips for choosing the right spot: 1. Evaluate Sun Exposure: Monitor different areas of your garden throughout the day to determine which spots receive the most sunlight. Morning sun exposure is preferred, as it helps dry dew on the leaves and minimizes potential fungal diseases. 2. Spacing Requirements: Almond trees can grow up to 15-25 feet tall, with a similar spread. Make sure to plant your trees at least 15-20 feet apart to accommodate their mature size and provide sufficient airflow. 3. Protection from Winds: Locate your almond trees in an area protected from strong winds, as these can damage blossoms and young fruits. The use of windbreaks like hedges or other larger trees can provide extra protection if needed. Conclusion Growing almond trees in your garden can be deeply rewarding, offering a source of beautiful blossoms each spring and delicious almonds with many health benefits. By following this step-by-step guide, from ensuring proper almond growing conditions to purchasing high-quality seeds or seedlings and finding the perfect sunny location, you will be well on your way to enjoying a thriving and productive almond tree in your garden."},{"instruction":"How is \\"(3) An application under this section may be filed even if the patent has lapsed.\\" said in French?","output":"\\"(3) Une demande selon cette section peut être déposée même si le brevet a expiré.\\" Voici comment on dit ça en français.

In contrast, gram-negative bacteria have a relatively thin cell wall consisting of a few layers of peptidoglycan surrounded by a second lipid membrane containing lipopolysaccharides and lipoproteins. Lipopolysaccharides, also called endotoxins, are composed of polysaccharides and lipid A that is responsible for much of the toxicity of gram-negative bacteria. Most bacteria have the gram-negative cell wall, and only the Firmicutes and Actinobacteria have the alternative gram-positive arrangement. These two groups were previously known as the low G+C and high G+C Gram-positive bacteria, respectively. These differences in structure can produce differences in antibiotic susceptibility; for instance, vancomycin can kill only gram-positive bacteria and is ineffective against gram-negative pathogens, such as Haemophilus influenzae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. If the bacterial cell wall is entirely removed, it is called a protoplast, whereas if it is partially removed, it is called a spheroplast. β-Lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin, inhibit the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links in the bacterial cell wall. The enzyme lysozyme, found in human tears, also digests the cell wall of bacteria and is the body's main defense against eye infections. What can different structure of the cell walls of bacteria effect?","output":"The different structures of the cell walls of bacteria can greatly influence various aspects of their biological properties, behavior, and interaction with their environment, such as: 1. Classification and identification: The differences in the cell wall structure form the basis for the Gram stain technique, which is a fundamental tool in classifying bacteria as either Gram-positive or Gram-negative and aids in their identification and diagnosis. 2. Pathogenicity and virulence: Gram-negative bacteria possess lipopolysaccharides (LPS) on their outer membrane, which function as endotoxins. These endotoxins can trigger an immune response in the host, leading to inflammation and fever. The presence of teichoic acids in Gram-positive bacteria can also contribute to their pathogenicity by facilitating adherence to host tissues. 3. Antibiotic susceptibility: The variation in cell wall structure affects the ability of some antibiotics to target and kill bacteria effectively. For example, Gram-positive bacteria are more susceptible to vancomycin, which disrupts the synthesis of peptidoglycan, whereas Gram-negative bacteria are generally more resistant due to their outer membrane acting as a barrier against the antibiotic. Conversely, β-lactam antibiotics, like penicillin, are effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria because they inhibit the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links that are critical for the integrity of the bacterial cell wall. 4. Immune response and evasion: Different cell wall components can trigger specific immune responses in the host organism. For instance, LPS in Gram-negative bacteria can activate the host's immune system, leading to the production of pro-inflammatory molecules. However, the presence of capsules around certain Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria can protect them from being detected and targeted by the host's immune system, allowing for evasion and prolonged survival. 5. Environmental adaptation: The cell wall composition and structure may provide specific advantages to bacteria in their environment. For example, the thick layer of peptidoglycan in Gram-positive bacteria can heighten their resistance against osmotic pressure and mechanical stress. Additionally, environmental factors such as temperature, pH, and nutrient availability can impact the composition and properties of the bacterial cell wall, allowing for better adaptation and survival. 6. Cell shape and division: The cell wall plays a crucial role in maintaining the shape and stability of bacterial cells. The differences in cell wall structure can result in variations in cell shape, such as cocci, rods, or spirals, which may affect their motility and ability to colonize specific environments. Additionally, the cell wall is involved in the process of bacterial cell division, with different mechanisms adopted by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In conclusion, the different structures of bacterial cell walls can significantly influence their classification, pathogenicity, antibiotic susceptibility, immune evasion, environmental adaptation, and overall biology. Understanding these complex interactions can help in the development of more effective antibacterial strategies and provide insights into the diverse and dynamic world of microbial ecosystems."},{"instruction":"I know that the answer to the question \\"Which is not a part of birds' bodies: breast, brood, or abdomen?\\" is in \\"Incubation, which optimises temperature for chick development, usually begins after the last egg has been laid. In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation. Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through brood patches, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds. Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as 83 grams (2.9 oz) of body weight per day of incubation. The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic sources. Incubation periods range from 10 days (in woodpeckers, cuckoos and passerine birds) to over 80 days (in albatrosses and kiwis).\\".

It is the southernmost district of Transnistria, located mostly south of Tiraspol. Its seat is the city of Slobozia, located at , on the river Dniester. The district contains 4 cities/towns and 12 communes (a total of 24 localities, including small villages/hamlets): - Beer is the world's oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drink; it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea. The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grainsmost commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used. Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect, although this is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and \\"The Hymn to Ninkasi\\", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people. - Tîrnauca (Romanian \\"Ternivka\\", , \\"Ternovka\\") is a commune and village in the Slobozia District of Transnistria, Moldova, situated on the east bank of the river Dniester, between Tighina and Tiraspol. It is notable for being home to the largest bottle-shaped building in the world, the Butylka hotel and museum. - A is a type of hotel developed in Japan that features a large number of extremely small \\"rooms\\" (capsules) intended to provide cheap, basic overnight accommodation for guests who do not require the services offered by more conventional hotels. - Tiraspol (Russian and ) is internationally recognised as the second largest city in Moldova, but is effectively the capital and administrative centre of the unrecognised Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (Transnistria). The city is located on the eastern bank of the Dniester River. Tiraspol is a regional hub of light industry, such as furniture and electrical goods production. - Butylka ( Russian for bottle ) is the name of a museum and hotel , sometimes also called the Spirit Museum Hotel . It is located in the village Tîrnauca ( Ternovka ) , 10 km from Tiraspol , the capital of Transnistria . The museum is notable for being housed inside a five - story structure shaped like a giant bottle . It is listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest building in the world in the shape of a bottle . The museum features owner Grigory Korzun 's vast collection of liquor . - The Dniester River, or Dnister River ( translit. \\"Dnister\\", , ) is a river in Eastern Europe. It runs first through Ukraine and then through Moldova (from which it separates the breakaway territory of Transnistria), finally discharging into the Black Sea on Ukrainian territory again. - Moldavia (or \\"\\", Romanian Cyrillic alphabet: ) is a historical region, and former principality in Eastern Europe, corresponding to the territory between the Eastern Carpathians and the Dniester river. An initially independent and later autonomous state, it existed from the 14th century to 1859, when it united with Wallachia as the basis of the modern Romanian state; at various times, Moldavia included the regions of Bessarabia (with the Budjak) and all of Bukovina. - A hotel is an establishment that provides paid lodging on a short-term basis. Facilities provided may range from a modest-quality mattress in a small room to large suites with bigger, higher-quality beds, a dresser, a fridge and other kitchen facilities, upholstered chairs, a flatscreen television and en-suite bathrooms. Small, lower-priced hotels may offer only the most basic guest services and facilities. Larger, higher-priced hotels may provide additional guest facilities such as a swimming pool, business centre (with computers, printers and other office equipment), childcare, conference and event facilities, tennis or basketball courts, gymnasium, restaurants, day spa and social function services. Hotel rooms are usually numbered (or named in some smaller hotels and B&Bs) to allow guests to identify their room. Some boutique, high-end hotels have custom decorated rooms. Some hotels offer meals as part of a room and board arrangement. In the United Kingdom, a hotel is required by law to serve food and drinks to all guests within certain stated hours. In Japan, capsule hotels provide a tiny room suitable only for sleeping and shared bathroom facilities. - A bottle is a rigid container with a neck that is narrower than the body and a mouth. By contrast, a jar has a relatively large mouth or opening which may be as wide as the overall container. Bottles are often made of glass, clay, plastic, aluminium or other impervious materials, and typically used to store liquids such as water, milk, soft drinks, beer, wine, cooking oil, medicine, shampoo, ink, and chemicals. A device applied in the bottling line to seal the mouth of a bottle is termed an external bottle cap, closure, or internal stopper. A bottle can also be sealed by a conductive \\"innerseal\\" by using induction sealing. - A museum is an institution that cares for (conserves) a collection of artifacts and other objects of artistic, cultural, historical, or scientific importance and some public museums make them available for public viewing through exhibits that may be permanent or temporary. Most large museums are located in major cities throughout the world and more local ones exist in smaller cities, towns and even the countryside. Museums have varying aims, ranging from serving researchers and specialists to serving the general public. The goal of serving researchers is increasingly shifting to serving the general public. - Transnistria (Moldovan: ), officially the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR ); also called Transdniester, Trans-Dniestr, Transdniestria, or Pridnestrovie, is a self-proclaimed republic on a strip of land between the River Dniester and the border with Ukraine, recognised only by three non-United Nations (UN) states. The region is considered by the UN to be part of Moldova. The PMR controls most of the territory to the east of the River Dniester, and also the city of Bender and its surrounding localities on the west bank, in the historical region of Bessarabia. - Moldova (or sometimes ), or Moldavia, officially the Republic of Moldova, is a landlocked country in Eastern Europe, bordered by Romania to the west and Ukraine to the north, east, and south. The capital city is Chiinu. - Bessarabia (; \\"Bessarabiya\\"; \\"Besarabiya\\") is a historical region in Eastern Europe, bounded by the Dniester river on the east and the Prut river on the west. Today Bessarabia is mostly occupied by modern-day Moldova, with the Ukrainian Budjak region covering the southern coastal region and part of the Ukrainian Chernivtsi Oblast covering a small area in the north. - Ukraine (tr. ) is a sovereign state in Eastern Europe, bordered by Russia to the east and northeast, Belarus to the northwest, Poland and Slovakia to the west, Hungary, Romania, and Moldova to the southwest, and the Black Sea and Sea of Azov to the south and southeast, respectively. Ukraine is currently in territorial dispute with Russia over the Crimean Peninsula which Russia annexed in 2014 but which Ukraine and most of the international community recognise as Ukrainian. Including Crimea, Ukraine has an area of , making it the largest country entirely within Europe and the 46th largest country in the world. It has a population of about 44.5 million, making it the 32nd most populous country in the world. - Clay is a fine-grained natural rock or soil material that combines one or more clay minerals with traces of metal oxides and organic matter. Clays are plastic due to their water content and become hard, brittle and nonplastic upon drying or firing. Geologic clay deposits are mostly composed of phyllosilicate minerals containing variable amounts of water trapped in the mineral structure. Depending on the soil's content in which it is found, clay can appear in various colours from white to dull grey or brown to deep orange-red. Although many naturally occurring deposits include both silts and clay, clays are distinguished from other fine-grained soils by differences in size and mineralogy. Silts, which are fine-grained soils that do not include clay minerals, tend to have larger particle sizes than clays. There is, however, some overlap in particle size and other physical properties. The distinction between silt and clay varies by discipline. Geologists and soil scientists usually consider the separation to occur at a particle size of 2 µm (clays being finer than silts), sedimentologists often use 45 m, and colloid chemists use 1 m. Geotechnical engineers distinguish between silts and clays based on the plasticity properties of the soil, as measured by the soils' Atterberg limits. ISO 14688 grades clay particles as being smaller than 2 m and silt particles as being larger. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - Wine (from Latin \\"vinum\\") is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grapes. These grapes are generally \\"Vitis vinifera,\\" or a hybrid with \\"Vitis labrusca\\" or \\"Vitis rupestris\\". Grapes are fermented without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production.

At the age of 30, aware of the desperate medical needs of Africans, he decided to become a doctor and devote the rest of his life to direct service in Africa. In 1913, at the age of 38, Dr.Schweitzer and his wife, Helene, opened a hospital in Lambarene, Gabon- then a province of French Equatorial Africa.Not even serious setbacks of World War I, part of which he and Helene spent as prisoners of war in France, _ him from continuing commitment to his job. In 1915,troubled daily by the vast numbers of suffering patients coming to his hospital for help, he experienced as a revelation the idea of \\"Reverence for Life\\" as the elementary and universal principle of ethics that he had been seeking for so long. By stressing the interdependence and unity of all life, he was a forerunner of the environmental and animal welfare movements - Rachel Carson dedicated Silent Spring to him. In 1952, at the age of 77, Schweitzer was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. During the last twelve years of his life, his speeches and writings emphasized the dangers of atmospheric nuclear test explosions and the suicidal nuclear arms race between the superpowers. After retiring as a practicing doctor, Albert Schweitzer continued to oversee the hospital until his death at the age of 90. To the end, his one frustration was that he had not succeeded in convincing the world to abolish nuclear weapons. He and his wife are buried on the Hospital grounds in Lambarene.

The woodcutter claims he found the body of a murdered samurai three days earlier while looking for wood in the forest; upon discovering the body, he says, he fled in a panic to notify the authorities. The priest says that he saw the samurai with his wife traveling the same day the murder happened. Both men were then summoned to testify in court, where they met the captured bandit TajÅmaru (å¤è¥ä¸¸), who claimed responsibility for killing the samurai and raping his wife. The bandit's story[edit] TajÅmaru (Toshiro Mifune), a notorious brigand, claims that he tricked the samurai to step off the mountain trail with him and look at a cache of ancient swords he discovered. In the grove he tied the samurai to a tree, then brought the samurai's wife there. She initially tried to defend herself with a dagger, but was eventually \\"seduced\\" by the bandit.

Answer choices: - oxidation reaction - adding heat - Water - Name - Mutagenic chemicals - permineralization - Air - that material's properties A:","output":"Mutagenic chemicals may change the structure of a nucleotide. Other factors that can potentially alter the structure of a nucleotide include: 1. Oxidation reaction: Oxidative stress can cause damage to DNA, resulting in changes to nucleotide structure through reactions with reactive oxygen species (ROS). This can lead to the formation of modified bases and strand breaks. 2. Adding heat: High temperatures can cause DNA denaturation, in which the hydrogen bonds between the complementary bases break, and the double-stranded DNA molecule unwinds into two separate single strands. While this process does not directly modify the nucleotide structure, it might make the DNA more susceptible to damage or other reactions when the DNA strands are separated. Water, name, permineralization, and air are not factors that directly change the structure of nucleotides. However, it is important to note that environmental factors, such as humidity (related to water content in the air) or temperature (which can be influenced by air or water) can indirectly impact the stability and integrity of DNA molecules. In summary, oxidation reactions, high temperatures, and mutagenic chemicals are factors that can directly change the structure of a nucleotide. Other factors like water, name, permineralization, air, and material properties might have indirect effects on the stability and integrity of DNA."},{"instruction":"Write an article using the following points: Agents who investigated Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab said he was forthcoming about his plans.

Article:","output":"Title: \\"Peculiar Insight into the Incriminating Investigation of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab\\" Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, an infamous Nigerian terrorist, received consequential legal retribution for his notorious criminal acts, resulting from an exhaustive investigative procedure conducted by diligent and meticulous agents. Driving deep into the heart of Abdulmutallab's intentions, investigators discovered a riveting truth that suggested the scope of Abdulmutallab's plans and affiliation with the infamous terror outfit, al-Qaeda. The agents who carried out the investigation into Abdulmutallab reported an intriguing detail about him, he was exceptionally forthcoming about his radical plans. The revelation sent shockwaves across the global intelligence community not only because of the audacity of the planned act, but also for his unusual willingness to share details. Typically, individuals involved in such actions are trained to withstand questioning and carry little to no information that could compromise their mission. However, in the case of Abdulmutallab, this traditional defense mechanism seemed conspicuously absent. His ready confession and disclosure of his plans provided crucial information that helped authorities to delve deeper into the nefarious web of al-Qaeda. Abdulmutallab, showing no signs of remorse, pleaded guilty earlier this year. His admission of guilt led to him being sentenced to three life terms, marking a significant victory for justice and the relentless fight against global terrorism. The severity of the sentence mirrored the enormity of the crime he planned to commit – an orchestrated act of terror that could have claimed countless lives. A startling revelation in the investigation was the potential involvement of Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri, the infamous al-Qaeda bombmaker. Al-Asiri is known for his adeptness in creating compact and powerful explosive devices, often designed to bypass common detection methods. Investigators claimed that evidence pointed towards al-Asiri as the architect of the device intended for Abdulmutallab’s mission. The collaboration between Abdulmutallab, a man willing to lay his life for the destructive cause, and al-Asiri, an expert bomb-maker, all under the auspices of al-Qaeda, represented an alarming threat that the intelligence community were now better prepared to face. The case of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, unanimously remembered by the enormity of his planned crime and the promptness of his confession, will serve as a stark reminder of the looming threats that nations confront. It has also underscored the criticality of thorough investigative efforts in unravelling complex terror plots and connections. Now, more than ever before, the nexus between Abdulmutallab and al-Asiri highlights the importance of international cooperation in both intelligence gathering and sharing, to thwart similar threats in the future. In conclusion, the sentencing of Abdulmutallab offers a semblance of closure, but the darkness of the threat he embodied still lurks in the shadows of global security. There is a pressing need for increased vigilance and developing smarter, robust counter-terrorism tactics. Abdulmutallab's case, therefore, not only represents a closure but also serves as a crucial lesson for the reinforcement of global security strategies moving forward."},{"instruction":"Continue writing the following text. Jeffrey could not bend over to retrieve items unlike Adam because","output":"of a severe spinal injury he had sustained a few years back in a tragic car accident. The accident had left Jeffrey with a fused spine, rendering him incapable of bending or twisting like he used to. The days when Jeffrey could perform his daily activities without assistance were gone, and he was forced to adapt to a new way of living. Adam, Jeffrey's kind-hearted and caring younger brother, keenly observed Jeffrey's struggles and often wondered how to bring some ease into his life. During his free time, Adam researched about spinal injuries, its consequences, and various techniques to support his brother in leading a more comfortable life. He read about different tools and gadgets that could potentially aid Jeffrey in accomplishing seemingly simple tasks, such as picking up objects from the ground. One day, as Jeffrey sat in his wheelchair in the living room, Adam entered with a sense of excitement in his eyes. Jeffrey noted this curiosity but remained silent, waiting for Adam to reveal what he had discovered. Adam pulled a long stick-like apparatus with a claw at the end from behind his back. It was a reacher grabber tool designed to help people with limited mobility pick up and retrieve objects from difficult-to-reach places. \\"I've found the perfect solution!\\" Adam exclaimed as he demonstrated the tool to Jeffrey. Slowly letting the understanding of the concept dawn upon Jeffrey. \\"You can now pick up items without having to bend, twist, or rely on someone else. This could bring some independence back into your life.\\" Jeffrey's eyes lit up with hope as he watched Adam deftly lift a book from the ground using the tool. He never allowed himself to lose faith that there could be a life beyond his debilitating spinal injury. Motivated by his brother's ingenuity and relentless optimism, Jeffrey grew more determined to regain as much ground as his condition would allow. Over the subsequent weeks, the brothers experimented with the reacher grabber, refining their techniques and getting additional attachments that could help Jeffrey perform specific tasks with ease. Motivated by this breakthrough, they researched other accessibility devices, including raised toilet seats, ergonomic cushions, and motorized wheelchairs to further improve Jeffrey's quality of life. Jeffrey's self-confidence began to grow. With every incremental improvement, he felt a renewed sense of hope, inspired in part by his brother's unwavering belief in his capabilities. The bond between the two brothers only grew stronger as they faced these challenges together. Their determination to adapt and find innovative ways to overcome obstacles was a testimony to the power of love, collaboration, and resilience in the face of adversity. Rather than allowing his injury to dictate the terms of his life, Jeffrey began to see a new horizon packed with fresh opportunities to reinvent himself. He learned to appreciate the simpler things in life, finding joy in moments shared with his supportive family and friends, and absorbing the beauty of the world around him. Though he may never recover the full function of his spine, Jeffrey emerged as a living testament to the indomitable spirit that many such individuals possess. And in the end, it became clear that while Jeffrey could not bend over to retrieve items unlike Adam, he was more than capable of overcoming his challenges, embracing his new reality, and living a rich and fulfilling life - all with Adam by his side."},{"instruction":"The Giants opened the regular season against the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday night, September 10. In a highly anticipated matchup that was nicknamed \\"Manning Bowl I\\", quarterback Eli Manning had to lead his Giants against his older brother, quarterback Peyton Manning, and the Colts. The Giants fell behind early as Peyton led the Colts on a 17-play, 58-yard drive that ate up 8:53, ending with kicker Adam Vinatieri hitting a 26-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Colts would build their lead with a 32-yard Vinatieri field goal, and after Jay Feely missed a 40-yard field goal wide left for the Giants, Peyton Manning found tight end Dallas Clark on a 2-yard touchdown pass. Down 13-0, and starting at their own 14-yard line with 2:18 to play in the half, the Giants' offense woke up, with Eli completing a 34-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Plaxico Burress with 40 seconds to play in the half.

Answer:","output":"The common name for 'Nacre' is 'Mother of Pearl'. Nacre, also known as mother of pearl, is an organic-inorganic composite material produced by some mollusks as an inner shell layer. It is strong, resilient, and iridescent, making it highly valued for its unique aesthetic qualities. Mother of pearl is formed primarily by oysters, abalones, and some other bivalve mollusks. The mollusk secretes a substance called calcium carbonate, which forms layers on the inner surface of the shell. As layers accumulate, nacre is formed. The intricate, repetitive structure of these layers gives nacre its iridescence, reflecting light in a way that creates a beautiful play of colors. The name \\"mother of pearl\\" stems from the fact that this material is the source of pearls. Pearls are formed when an irritant, such as a grain of sand, gets trapped inside the mollusk's shell. To protect itself from the irritant, the mollusk coats the foreign object with the same substance used to create its shell, which eventually forms a pearl. Thus, mother of pearl is considered the \\"mother\\" or origin of pearls. Mother of pearl has been used throughout history for various decorative and functional purposes. In ancient Egypt, it was incorporated into jewelry, furniture, and even sarcophagi. In Asia, it was popularly used for intricate inlays in furniture, lacquerware, and other decorative items. Mother of pearl continues to be highly sought after for its natural beauty, and it is often used in luxurious artisan creations such as jewelry, watch faces, and guitar inlays. In addition to its aesthetic value, mother of pearl has unique physical properties that make it ideal for various practical uses. It is strong and lightweight, making it suitable for use in advanced materials science applications, such as lightweight composites for aerospace constructions. The microstructure of nacre has also inspired researchers to develop biomimetic materials with similar mechanical properties, which could have potential in a variety of industries. In conclusion, the common name for nacre is mother of pearl, a lustrous and iridescent material produced by mollusks for the formation of their inner shell. This beautiful material has been cherished and utilized for thousands of years, both for its aesthetic qualities and its functional properties. From ancient artifacts to modern applications in the high-tech industries, mother of pearl continues to be a material of intrigue and fascination."},{"instruction":"Definition: In this task you are given a tweet.

Howard previously played for the Philadelphia Phillies of Major League Baseball (MLB) from 2004 to 2016. Howard stands 6 feet 4 inches (193 cm) and weighs 240 pounds (110 kg). He bats and throws left-handed. Howard has a fraternal twin brother named Corey, as well as an older brother and a sister. He says he is the smallest of the Howard sons. His favorite baseball team growing up was the St. Louis Cardinals. Howard has a son named Darian Alexander, who was born January 26, 2001. Howard graduated from Lafayette High School (Wildwood, St. Louis County, Mo.) in 1998, where he played trombone. While attending Missouri State University he became a member of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity and his line name was \\"Blue Hurt\\". Howard is a representative for a number of products including Under Armour and the Subway restaurant chain. He also appeared on the cover of MLB 08: The Show. Howard appeared alongside teammate Chase Utley as himself on the 2010 episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia \\"The Gang Gets Stranded in the Woods\\". He also appeared as himself during the 7th season of Entourage in the episode \\"Lose Yourself\\" and appeared in the final season of The Office; set in Scranton and created during his time in Triple-A there.

Both devices play critical roles in producing and regulating the electric current we depend on in our daily lives. Electric generators use electromagnetic induction to change kinetic energy to electrical energy. They produce electricity in power plants. Electric transformers use electromagnetic induction to change the voltage of electric current. Some transformers increase voltage and other decrease voltage. Now, I have a new situation: Bob works for the local electric power company. Part of is job involves checking the generators and transformers. His work schedule allows him to work on the generator tagged as gen A only on Mondays, and the transformer tagged as tran B only on Tuesdays. Answer this question please: Which one would most likely be located in a power plant, gen A or tran B? The answer to this question is:","output":"Gen A would most likely be located in a power plant. This is because, as mentioned in the background information, electric generators use electromagnetic induction to change kinetic energy to electrical energy, and they produce electricity in power plants. Since Bob works for the local electric power company, it is reasonable to assume that part of his job related to checking the generators and transformers would be within a power plant setting. As gen A is a generator, it would be responsible for producing electricity within the power plant through the process of electromagnetic induction. On the other hand, tran B is a transformer which is responsible for changing the voltage of electric current. Transformers are typically located in various parts of the electrical grid, including in substations, distribution networks, and even sometimes in power plants. However, the primary function of a power plant is to produce electricity, making it more likely that gen A, the generator, would be located in the power plant. Bob's schedule of working on gen A on Mondays (presumably when he is at the power plant) further suggests that gen A would be the device located within the power plant."},{"instruction":"Instructions: You are given a sentence in Italian.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less virus enters a body happens, how will it affect MORE oxygen reaching the body. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"The proposed perturbation suggests that less virus enters the body, and we are to examine its effects, if any, on the oxygen supply to the body. To clarify the relationship between the perturbation and the process of oxygen distribution in the body, let's discuss both components in detail. Process of oxygen distribution in the body: 1. Air, containing oxygen, is taken into the body through the mouth or nose during inhalation. 2. The air travels down the trachea and bronchial tubes, entering the lungs. 3. Within the lungs, the oxygen-rich air reaches tiny air sacs called alveoli, where gas exchange occurs. 4. Oxygen from the air diffuses across the alveoli's thin walls into surrounding capillaries, entering the bloodstream and binding to hemoglobin in red blood cells. 5. Carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular metabolism, diffuses out of the blood and into the alveoli, where it can be exhaled. 6. Oxygenated blood is pumped to all parts of the body by the circulatory system, where oxygen is delivered to cells for energy production and other vital processes. Perturbation hypothesis: a lesser amount of virus entering the body For this hypothesis, it is crucial to mention which type of virus we are referring to, as different viruses affect the body in various ways. However, since the question does not specify a particular virus, we will consider a generic viral infection and its possible effects on oxygen supply. Potential effects of the perturbation on the process: 1. Direct impact: viral infections that target the respiratory system, such as influenza or coronavirus, could directly influence the oxygen distribution process. If less virus enters the body, the severity of respiratory symptoms may be diminished. This could lead to a reduced obstruction in the airways, potentially promoting more efficient gas exchange and, subsequently, better oxygen delivery throughout the body. 2. Indirect impact: regardless of the specific virus type, viral infections typically trigger an immune response, causing inflammation and release of chemical mediators. This immune response may affect different organs and systems, including the circulatory system, and may cause general malaise and fatigue. If the infection's severity is reduced due to less virus entering the body, the body's overall energy consumption might decrease, indirectly leading to less oxygen demand and potentially allowing more oxygen to reach cells in need. To summarize, while a lesser amount of virus entering the body could potentially have direct and indirect effects on oxygen distribution, it is important to consider the specific virus type and infection severity. Additionally, several other factors, such as genetic predisposition, underlying health conditions, and immune system strength, may influence the overall effects of the perturbation on oxygen supply to the body."},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to Czech: Procurement and supply Czech:","output":"Nákup a zásobování"},{"instruction":"Translate to French: In the absence of ongoing collection and treatment, the discharge of contaminated water from the site would violate the Fisheries Act.","output":"Étape 1 : Identifier les principales parties de la phrase pour préparer la traduction. - \\"In the absence of ongoing collection and treatment\\" : contexte conditionnel - \\"the discharge of contaminated water from the site\\" : sujet principal - \\"would violate the Fisheries Act\\" : action conséquence Étape 2 : Traduire les principales parties de la phrase en français. - \\"In the absence of ongoing collection and treatment\\" : \\"En l'absence de collecte et de traitement continus\\" - \\"the discharge of contaminated water from the site\\" : \\"le rejet d'eau contaminée du site\\" - \\"would violate the Fisheries Act\\" : \\"violeraient la Loi sur les pêches\\" Étape 3 : Assembler les parties traduites en une phrase cohérente en français. \\"En l'absence de collecte et de traitement continus, le rejet d'eau contaminée du site violeraient la Loi sur les pêches.\\""},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"\\"Les vastes montagnes s'élèvent majestueusement dans le paysage, révélant une nature préservée et la beauté à couper le souffle de la terre.\\" Translation: The vast mountains rise majestically in the landscape, revealing pristine nature and the breathtaking beauty of the earth.

How to understand computer system security needs Analyze the operating system on the machine (s). Security requirements will vary depending on which os and which version you are running. Make sure that the latest service packs and patches are installed.","output":"In order to understand computer system security needs, it is crucial to consider various aspects that help in ensuring the protection and safety of your data, applications, and networks. Analyzing the operating system on the machines and ensuring that they have the latest service packs and patches installed is only the first step in the process. The most logical next event involves the following steps: 1. Identify and assess potential threats and vulnerabilities: To determine the security needs of a computer system, you should first identify any potential risks and vulnerabilities present in the environment. This involves keeping yourself updated on known security threats, vulnerabilities in software and hardware, and potential weaknesses or misconfigurations in your system that could be exploited by attackers. 2. Implement an access control system: Restrict access to sensitive resources and implement strong authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access the system. This can involve using multi-factor authentication (MFA), strong passwords, and role-based access control (RBAC) where necessary. Additionally, limit the number of users with high-level privileges (such as administrators) and monitor their activities regularly. 3. Secure the network: Implement proper network security measures, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to protect your network from potential attacks. Encrypt all sensitive data transmitted over the network and use secure communications protocols to ensure data confidentiality and integrity during transmission. 4. Regularly backup and encrypt data: To protect against data loss in the event of hardware failure, human error, or an attack, regularly back up all important data and store it securely off-site.

Ensure proper system and application security: Keep all software and applications up to date with the latest patches and updates. Regularly run vulnerability scans and penetration tests to identify potential weaknesses in your applications and apply necessary fixes. Furthermore, disable or remove any unnecessary services or applications to minimize potential attack vectors. 6. Employee training and awareness: Educate staff members on basic cybersecurity principles and safe online practices. Implement a comprehensive security awareness program that includes regular training sessions on topics such as phishing, malware, social engineering, and using a virtual private network (VPN) when connecting to the organization's network from remote locations. 7. Develop and maintain an incident response plan: Create a clear and comprehensive plan of action to handle security incidents in a timely and effective manner. This should include proper communication channels, roles, and responsibilities for different team members during an incident, as well as guidelines on how to restore systems to normal operations. 8. Test and evaluate security measures: Regularly review and evaluate the effectiveness of your security measures. This includes performing regular security audits, vulnerability scanning, and penetration testing to identify areas for improvement. Based on the findings, revise and update your security policies and procedures as needed. 9. Monitor and maintain security: Implement continuous monitoring and logging solutions to track user activities and detect any potential or ongoing security threats. Regularly review and analyze logs for signs of suspicious activity or security incidents. Respond swiftly to any detected security events and remediate any discovered vulnerabilities. 10. Stay informed: Keep yourself updated with the latest developments in the field of cybersecurity and emerging threats. Subscribe to relevant security news sources, join cybersecurity forums or communities, and attend security conferences to stay informed and ensure that your computer system security is up to date with the latest best practices. By following these steps, you can gain a comprehensive understanding of your computer system security needs and implement the necessary measures to protect your systems and data from potential threats and attacks. Remember that security is an ongoing process, and maintaining a strong security posture requires constant vigilance, monitoring, and adaptation to new threats and vulnerabilities."},{"instruction":"Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Lancôme Juicy Tubes changed my life. Ok, well that’s a slight exaggeration but it was the first high-end make-up item that I ever bought and it made me feel like I was really getting somewhere. I’d got a good job, was in the process of buying my own house and I could afford to buy premium beauty products. I chose a transparent lemon yellow gloss with tiny flecks of iridescent glitter in, and over the following months I treated myself to several other Juicy Tube variants including a shimmery nude gloss called Pamplemousse which I wore on nights out for years (incidentally Pamplemousse is still going!). Fast forward several (ahem…) years and Juicy Tubes are still going strong, but there’s a new member of the Juicy family vying for attention – the Juicy Shaker.*. Another lip product, this one is a nourishing tinted lip oil which acts a bit like a gloss, and I was sent two of the new shades to try out – Piece of Cake and Show Me The Honey. Juicy Shakers are a bi-phase nourishing lip oil, when the product is allowed to settle the pigment falls to the bottom and the oil rises to the top, giving a split effect. Then you need to shake the bottle to mix the two layers together, giving the product it’s name. The ingredients include sweet almond oil, omega 3 and cranberry oil and really help care for your lips unlike most other glosses. Show Me The Honey is a nude coral shade, it looks rather orange and scary in the bottle but in reality it’s much more of a gentle shade. Piece of Cake is a damson pink, and again looks much darker in the bottle. I found that Piece of Cake matches almost exactly with the natural colour of my lips so it’s perfect for when I want my make-up to look really pared back with glossy supple natural looking lips.

It’s better to be on a “Way” than a “Street,” pick a female real-estate agent and try to be close to a Starbucks. That’s the advice of Spencer Rascoff, CEO of Zillow.com, who collected statistics from his site’s database of 110 million homes to find trends in real-estate pricing. Along with Zillow economist Stan Humphries, he has written “The New Rules of Real Estate” (Grand Central), out Tuesday. Some of his findings: The Starbucks effect. Take two identical homes sold in 1997. One near Starbucks would have sold for an average of 137,000, while the same home without a Starbucks would have sold for 102,000. Fast-forward 15 years: the average US home appreciated 65 percent to 168,000, but the property next to Starbucks skyrockets 96 percent to 269,000. All renovations are not created equal. The greatest return for your investment is a mid-range bathroom remodel, a 3,000 job that returns 1.71 for every dollar spent. The worst home improvements for value are kitchen remodeling and finishing a basement. A top-of-the-line kitchen reno will cost you 22,000, and you’ll only get about 0.51 back for every 1 you spend. Use the right words in a listing. Avoid “unique,” “TLC,” “investment” and “potential” — these could lower sale prices by as much as 7 percent. But words like “luxurious” for bottom-tier homes and “captivating” for top-tier homes could add 8.2 percent to your home’s value. Longer, more-detailed listings often sell for more. “When” is as important as “how much.” In New York, the worst time to sell is the second week of December (listings sold for 2.8 percent less than average). The best time is March, when homes sold faster and for 2 percent more. Seven is an unlucky number. Homes with “777” as their address sell for 2.1 percent less than their estimated value; house numbers that just include 777 (such as 17779 Main St.), sell for 1.8 percent less. Oddly, houses with just 7 as their number sell for 1.8 percent more than the estimated sale price. Psychological pricing works. Listings with a nine in the thousand digit (450,000 vs. 449,000) sell anywhere from four days to a full week faster. Female agents tend to sell homes faster and for higher prices. ||||| What fuels gentrification? The answer is the same thing that fuels the rest of us: coffee. But not just any old cup o’ joe. Starbucks, the iconic coffee roaster and retailer, has grown into a 15 billion company, with more than 19,000 locations in more than 60 countries. You can spot that familiar green-and-white logo from Saudi Arabia to Switzerland, in a Dubai shopping mall, or on a Carnival Cruise ship. Where the Berlin Wall once stood, there’s a shiny new Starbucks instead. Conveniently, one of our desks has a view of the original Starbucks store in Pike Place Market. Starbucks’ mission is “to inspire and nurture the human spirit—one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time.” Any college student downing venti caramel macchiatos to stay awake the night before a big exam can testify to Starbucks’, in a word, nurturing qualities. But as it turns out, Starbucks correlates with something else, too: rising home values. To explore exactly how closely the two correlate, we compared a database of Starbucks locations with Zillow data. And since Starbucks’ corporate headquarters in Seattle is located just a few miles down the road from Zillow, we also took the opportunity to pay our neighbors a visit, and to pick the brains of Starbucks’ own real estate analytics team—the whizzes who determine where to put that next Starbucks location. Here’s what we can tell you: Starbucks equates with venti-sized home-value appreciation. Moreover, Starbucks seems to be fueling—not following—these higher home values. And the reason why is that Starbucks’ real estate choices are, in their words, “as much an art as a science.” When deciding where to hang its next shingle, the company marries right-brain ingenuity with hard-headed, left-brain analysis—exactly as you should. Let’s take these fresh-brewed insights one at a time. Starbucks equals big bucks Although some may scoff that the predictive value of a given retail chain doesn’t mean much, locations near Starbucks are, indisputably, highly lucrative. True, properties near Starbucks locations tend to start out more expensive. But as you can see, these properties appreciate at a faster rate than US housing on the whole. Interestingly, they’re also recovering much more quickly from the housing bust. What does that look like in practice? Let’s look at the historical home value appreciation of areas that now are located within a quarter mile of a Starbucks. A home that is now near a Starbucks would have sold, on average, for 137,000. A home that is not near a Starbucks would have sold, on average, for 102,000. Fast-forward 17 years to 2014. That average American home has now appreciated 65%, to 168,000. But the Starbucks-adjacent property has far outpaced that, appreciating 96% to 269,000. Starbucks is the fuel, not the follower “Try some decaf,” you may be thinking. “Home prices rise and fall for a lot of reasons. How do we know this has anything to do with Starbucks?” For instance, maybe this isn’t a Starbucks Effect at all. Maybe it’s just a coffeeshop effect. To examine that possibility, we took a look at another prominent coffee chain, Dunkin’ Donuts. What did we learn? Homes near Dunkin’ Donuts reflect a similar historical trend. But while they appreciate faster than the nation’s housing as a whole, they still don’t appreciate as fast as properties that are now a quarter-mile from a Starbucks. In fact, between 1997 and 2012, homes now located near Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts followed similar historical trajectories, substantially outpacing the overall home value appreciation. But their paths diverged during the recent housing recovery such that, today, homes near Dunkin’ Donuts have appreciated 80% since 1997 whereas homes near Starbucks have appreciated 96%, almost doubling their value. Even so, you may be saying, is it possible that the Starbucks Effect is really just a coastal effect? Or an urban effect? Maybe people really like living in Seattle and Boston, and the Starbucks locations dotting their neighborhoods are just incidental. We wondered this, too. After all, when we looked at a map of Starbucks locations in the United States, it’s readily apparent that historically they have clustered on the coasts, in the Midwest, and in urban areas. Moreover, maybe Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts are just waiting for a neighborhood’s property values to heat up before moving in and setting up shop. What’s to say that Starbucks is the cause, rather than a consequence, of higher home values? To attempt to rule out these possibilities, we tracked values of homes in a very tight ring within a quarter mile of Starbucks (so close you could practically smell the dark roast from your front porch) and compared those very-Starbucks-adjacent homes to houses slightly farther away, in a ring of homes between a quarter- and a half-mile from a Starbucks. And we compared home values in these two rings (adjacent and nearby) for only the five years after the Starbucks location actually opened, in order to see whether the effect took place after the opening or already existed before the store opened. Lo and behold, the adjacent homes beat out the nearby homes. Those houses closest to Starbucks appreciated a little more than 21% over five years, while the houses slightly farther away only appreciated just less than 17%. So, yes, some of the difference is related to the location itself, but there’s still a healthy difference attributable to the arrival of a Starbucks. Whatever the reasons—because they genuinely like drinking coffee, or because they see Starbucks as a proxy for gentrification—it seems pretty clear that people are paying a premium for homes near Starbucks. And furthermore, it looks like Starbucks itself is driving the increase in home values. Picking locations—An art and a science Armed with this data, we headed down Seattle’s First Avenue to Starbucks HQ. There, we had the pleasure of chatting with Arthur Rubinfeld, who oversees Starbucks’ location selection process, and his extremely talented team. We asked them, is the Starbucks Effect the product of careful, data-driven decisions on their part? And their answer was, more or less, yes. The Starbucks team explained that while they have 20 or so analytics experts around the world poring over maps and geographic information systems data—assessing factors like an area’s traffic patterns and businesses—the company also empowers dozens of regional teams to come to their own conclusions about location, store design, and a host of other issues. Yet, even with their reams of data and locally-driven decision making, our Starbucks friends noted that there was no single silver bullet. “The beauty of Starbucks is our understanding of real-estate site locationing,” Arthur told us. “It’s an art and a science.” We couldn’t have put it better ourselves. There have been times and places—like before the financial crisis, when Starbucks bet on an up-and-coming Seattle commercial area that never materialized—where the art of site location is displayed in all of its messiness. In other instances, the science has delivered big-time returns. Ultimately, one Starbucks pro told us, “We try to provide consistency in the science… so that local decision makers have everything they need at their fingertips to make easy decisions.” Indeed, at the end of the day, where you buy a home is based on countless subjective factors. As in Moby-Dick—whose pages gave us the first mate Starbuck and inspired the Starbucks name—finding that perfect, ahead-of-the- curve home can sometimes seem like chasing your very own white whale. But some factors can make that search a little bit easier. So grab a venti skim latte—hey, get the extra shot—and go find the right home for you.

My back left wisdom tooth was growing sideways into my other teeth . Answer the following question: Why does the person feel relieved of stress ?","output":"The person likely feels relieved of stress for several reasons: 1. Successful surgery: Undergoing surgery can be a cause of anxiety and stress for many individuals. The statement that \\"my surgery went off without a hitch\\" indicates a seamless surgical experience, alleviating any concerns the person may have had about potential complications or issues during the procedure. The successful removal of the problematic wisdom tooth would have contributed to the feeling of relief and satisfaction post-surgery. 2. Expedited diagnostic process: In this case, the person hadn't undergone an x-ray before the surgery; however, they were able to get it done on-site, which saved both time and effort. This one-stop-shop service streamlined the process and eliminated the need for additional appointments or wait times, effectively reducing any potential stress that one might experience when dealing with multiple medical appointments. 3. Addressed tooth impaction: As mentioned in the description, the person's back left wisdom tooth was growing sideways into the adjacent teeth. Impacted teeth can be incredibly painful and may lead to swelling, infection, and even damage to neighboring teeth. With the successful removal of the impacted tooth, the person is likely to experience reduced pain and discomfort, contributing to an overall sense of stress relief. 4. Prevention of future dental issues: The extraction of an impacted wisdom tooth minimizes the risk of future dental problems, such as infections, misalignment, and tooth decay. The person might experience relief knowing that they have taken a proactive step in maintaining their oral health, potentially preventing more significant issues down the line. 5. Confidence in healthcare providers: The person might also feel relieved knowing that their healthcare providers were efficient, competent, and able to handle their situation by conducting an x-ray examination and subsequent surgery all in one go. Trusting the professionals can be a significant source of stress relief and reassurance. 6. Recovery and healing: With the surgery now completed, the person can focus on their recovery and healing process. Post-surgery stress relief might stem from the knowledge that they are now on their way to regaining optimal health and can work towards getting back to their regular activities and routines without fearing additional pain or complications. In summary, the person feels relieved of stress because their surgery was successful, their diagnostic and treatment process was streamlined, their impacted tooth issue was resolved, and the risk of future dental problems has been minimized. Additionally, the person likely has confidence in their healthcare providers and can now focus on recovery and healing, providing a tremendous sense of relief in this entire experience."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence not in English.","output":"Je mange une pomme.

Let's answer step by step:","output":"Step 1: Calculate the number of visitors in November. In October, there were 100 visitors. Since the number of visitors increased by 15% in November, we can find the increase in visitors: 15% of 100 = (15/100) * 100 = 15 visitors Now, let's find the total number of visitors in November: 100 (October) + 15 (increase) = 115 visitors Step 2: Calculate the number of visitors in December. There were 15 more visitors in December than in November. So, let's add 15 to the number of visitors in November: 115 (November) + 15 = 130 visitors Step 3: Calculate the total number of visitors for the three months. Now, let's add the number of visitors for each month to find the total number of visitors: 100 (October) + 115 (November) + 130 (December) = 345 visitors So, the total number of visitors for these three months is 345."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"What's the feather for?\\" to Czech?","output":"To translate \\"What's the feather for?\\" to Czech, I will follow these steps: 1.

Which documentary film is older, Superjews or Feiyu Show? The answer to this question is:","output":"To address this question, we need to research both documentary films—Superjews and Feiyu Show—and identify their release dates. After that, we'll be able to determine which one is older. However, it's important to note that without a direct access to a database or the internet, as an AI, I won't be able to provide real-time data. Let us firstly talk about Superjews, a documentary film that portrays a story about certain sports or fitness events. Documentaries like this typically focus on a unique aspect or perspective regarding a particular team or individual, providing a broader context and enabling viewers to better understand the role of sports in society. Documentaries can also shine a light on lesser-known aspects of the sports world, making them an intriguing watch for both serious sports fans and casual viewers alike. Now let's go to the Feiyu Show, which could possibly revolve around a media, cultural, or entertaining events. Documentaries like this could feature artists, actors, comedians, or any individuals or events who have a significant influence on the art, media, or entertainment scene. They could explore the insights, journeys, or even challenges these individuals or events experience or present. There are various elements that influence the production of a documentary, including economic factors, cultural variations, technical advancements, and shifting societal perceptions. Documentary filmmaking has been an essential platform for storytelling, bringing crucial topics and unique stories to the fore. By combining elements of journalism, entertainment, education, and sometimes activism, documentary filmmaking plays a key role in society's understanding of itself. Now, assuming that we know the release dates of Superjews and the Feiyu Show, we could simply compare these dates to determine which documentary is older. Let's say, for instance, Superjews was released in 1982, while the Feiyu Show was released in 1999. In this hypothetical scenario, Superjews would be the older documentary film of the two. Bear in mind, this is just a hypothetical situation. For a precise and factual comparison of the ages of these two documentaries, one would need the actual dates these two documentaries were released. In conclusion, the age of a documentary can be determined by comparing the release dates. The documentary with the earlier release date is the older one. In this scenario, to identify which documentary is older—Superjews or Feiyu Show—the release dates of both documentaries would need to be known and compared. Whichever documentary was released first would be the older of the two. However, as an AI without access to a live database or internet, I'm unable to provide the accurate answer to this question. It's recommended to check reliable film databases like IMDb for the release dates of these documentaries."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: Given a sentence in the Japanese and Lao language.

It is the time when I realize that the books my English teacher assigned to me are not going to read themselves and that I have a difficult month in front of me. You might think that I don't want to spend my summer reading, but that's not the problem: I love reading. On the first day of my summer holidays this year, I went to the library and got \\"A Gathering of Old Men\\" by African-American writer Ernest Gaines. I enjoyed it very much. I read all the magazines that my parents subscribe to and spend about 30 minutes every day with the morning paper. So why do I hate summer reading for school? Because the books on summer reading lists are often slow-going and just uninviting. Teachers and librarians don't understand that summer reading can be entertaining as well as educational. They choose books that a friend of my mother's calls \\"spinach books\\": good for you, but not much fun to take in. Every summer, I read them, hate them and get bitter about the experience. This bitterness started three years ago when I was about to begin high school. As preparation, my English teacher told me to read \\"The Age of Innocence\\" by American author Edith Wharton. I'm sure there are many people who enjoyed \\"The Age of Innocence\\"--some might even say it's their favorite book. But I don't think any of these people read it as a 14-year-old boy on his summer vacation. \\"The Age of Innocence\\" is the story of a forbidden romance in prefix = st1 /New York100 years ago. At 14, my only experience with romance was my love for baseball. I couldn't imagine being in love, much less being in love in 1900. \\"The Age of Innocence\\" was totally different to my life.

It was closed after the Tibetans captured it in 678, but in 699, during Empress Wu's period, the Silk Road reopened when the Tang reconquered the Four Garrisons of Anxi originally installed in 640, once again connecting China directly to the West for land-based trade. The Tang captured the vital route through the Gilgit Valley from Tibet in 722, lost it to the Tibetans in 737, and regained it under the command of the Goguryeo-Korean General Gao Xianzhi. When the An Lushan Rebellion ended in 763, the Tang Empire had once again lost control over its western lands, as the Tibetan Empire largely cut off China's direct access to the Silk Road. An internal rebellion in 848 ousted the Tibetan rulers, and Tang China regained its northwestern prefectures from Tibet in 851. These lands contained crucial grazing areas and pastures for raising horses that the Tang dynasty desperately needed.Despite the many expatriate European travelers coming into China to live and trade, many travelers, mainly religious monks and missionaries, recorded the strict border laws that the Chinese enforced. As the monk Xuanzang and many other monk travelers attested to, there were many Chinese government checkpoints along the Silk Road that examined travel permits into the Tang Empire. Furthermore, banditry was a problem along the checkpoints and oasis towns, as Xuanzang also recorded that his group of travelers were assaulted by bandits on multiple occasions. The Silk Road also affected Tang dynasty art. Horses became a significant symbol of prosperity and power as well as an instrument of military and diplomatic policy.

By Chris Pleasance The Italian navy rescued nearly 500 people, including more than 100 children, in an all-night operation yesterday as the immigrants tried to cross from Africa into Europe. The operation began as 133 children along with 74 women were brought aboard two navy vessels Monday evening from two fishing boats tethered together off Sicily. The rescue then had to be suspended due to rough waters, the navy said. The remaining migrants, 281 men, were thrown life preservers and rescued on Tuesday. More than 100 children, including babies, were rescued from the boat. Save the Children have warned that an increasing number of youngster are being sent across unaccompanied There has been an enormous jump this year in the number of migrants trying to cross the","output":"Mediterranean Sea into Europe, fueled by political instability, widespread violence, and economic hardships in their home countries. As a result, European nations have been grappling with how to handle the influx of migrants and refugees. The story of the Italian navy rescuing 500 people, including over 100 children, unfolds over the course of several days, encompassing multiple rescue operations and stressing the immense challenges these desperate populations face on their journey. After the initial rescue of 133 children and 74 women who were taken aboard two navy vessels on Monday evening, rough seas forced the navy to suspend the operation temporarily. Meanwhile, the remaining 281 men had life preservers thrown to them, but their rescue had to be postponed. The rescue resumed on Tuesday, and the navy was finally able to reach the remaining men. They discovered that over 100 children, some of them infants, were also aboard the boats, further highlighting the increasing number of youngsters being sent on dangerous, solitary journeys across the Mediterranean. Save the Children and other humanitarian organizations have been sounding the alarm on this troubling trend. Upon the completion of the rescue operation, all 500 individuals were safely brought aboard the navy vessels and provided with immediate medical care and other necessities. Both NGOs and government agencies worked together to ensure their well-being, and the migrants were eventually taken to reception centers in Sicily for further processing. As this crisis unfolded, it quickly garnered global attention, sparking debates over Europe's immigration policies and the moral obligation to help those fleeing wars, persecutions, and poverty. Public pressure mounted on European leaders to respond to the crisis with compassion and long-term solutions. In response, several countries ramped up rescue efforts, increased funding for migrant services, and re-evaluated their approach to the integration of these new arrivals. Over the following months and years, the European Union reexamined its strategies with regards to the migration crisis. Nations across the EU collaborated to enhance border controls while also increasing their commitment to supporting the countries from where these migrants were fleeing. In an attempt to address the root causes of migration, EU countries began providing aid and assistance to countries in Africa and the Middle East, promoting economic stability and good governance. Additionally, Europe implemented various programs focused on supporting unaccompanied minors, providing them with legal assistance, education, and psychological support. These measures aimed to protect the welfare of these vulnerable children and help them integrate into their new communities. As the world continued to grapple with this humanitarian crisis, the rescued migrants slowly began rebuilding their lives in Europe, thanks to the assistance they received from local communities, NGOs, and government agencies. While the road to integration was challenging for many, the sense of security, opportunities, and hope they found in their new homes afforded them a chance at a better life. This story, though a glimpse into one specific rescue operation, forms part of a broader narrative of the international community's ongoing struggle to address the migration crisis. It serves as a reminder of both the human cost of such tragic events and the importance of swift and decisive cooperation between nations and organizations to ensure the safety, well-being, and dignity of those forced to flee their homes in search of sanctuary."},{"instruction":"Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce turned some heads Sunday when he trashed the officials after the Chiefs' 18-16 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Food quality: To start, the food itself left a lot to be desired. My appetizer, the coconut shrimp, was overcooked and lacked the promised crispy texture. The main course, a grilled salmon, was too dry and had a slightly off flavor, indicating that it might not have been as fresh as advertised. Service: In addition to the food, the service was subpar. Our server was inattentive and slow, causing us to wait for long periods between courses. I also found it difficult to get our server's attention when needing assistance or refills on our drinks. Ambiance: As for the ambiance, the lighting in the restaurant was too dim, making it hard to read the menu, and the music was excessively loud, making conversation difficult. The tables were also placed too close together, leaving little privacy for diners. Conclusion: Overall, I had a disappointing experience at The Bistro Lounge, and I find it hard to recommend it to others.

Given the above question, please answer with reasoning first!","output":"It is difficult to accurately determine whether a Tiny House ceiling would have been out of Osama bin Laden's reach without clear information about the dimensions of the specific tiny house in question. However, I can provide some general reasoning based on typical tiny house dimensions and bin Laden's height. Tiny houses are compact residential structures, often built on wheels, and they are designed to maximize space while being portable. Most tiny houses have interiors with a height of around 6.5 to 13.5 feet (about 2 to 4 meters). Osama bin Laden was reported to be approximately 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 meters) tall. Based on this information, it is likely that in some tiny houses with lower ceilings, bin Laden would have been able to touch the ceiling, while in others with higher ceilings, he might not have been able to do so. Additionally, the actual reachable height would also depend on the individual's arm length and ability to stretch. In conclusion, it cannot be definitively asserted whether a tiny house ceiling would have been out of Osama bin Laden's reach without knowing the specific dimensions of the tiny house being referred to. However, based on general tiny house dimensions, it is likely that some ceilings would have been within his reach, while others would not have been."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence based on \\"republicans renewing effort to gain support of women\\"","output":"\\"Republicans are trying very hard again to make friends with women and have them join their team.\\""},{"instruction":"You are given a sentence in Italian.

These soccer field dimensions are wider than the regulation American football field width of 53 ⁄ yards (48.8 m), or the 65-yard (59 m) width of a Canadian football field. The playing surface typically consists of grass as opposed to artificial turf, as the latter is generally disfavored for soccer matches since players are more susceptible to injuries. However, some soccer specific stadiums, such as Portland's Providence Park and Creighton University's Morrison Stadium, do have artificial turf. Available choices: [A]. no. [B]. yes.","output":"Based on the provided text, it is true that a FIFA soccer field is bigger than an American football field and a Canadian football field. According to FIFA's optimal field dimensions for soccer, the field should be 110-120 yards (100-110 m) long by 70-80 yards (64-73 m) wide.

Additionally, the text does not provide the exact length of American and Canadian football fields; however, it is important to note that soccer fields have varying lengths, highlighting that soccer fields can potentially be longer compared to the other fields. Moreover, the playing surface of soccer fields typically consists of grass instead of artificial turf, which can be found in some football fields. This difference in playing surface can also contribute to the soccer fields being larger overall.

Problem:OBJECTIVES We investigated the role of cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in cachexia development in newly diagnosed nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. METHODS : We evaluated 44 (M/F:41/3) NSCLC patients and 12 (M/F:10/2) age matched healthy smokers. NSCLC cases with a weight loss of > or =10% consisted the cachectic group (n:23, M/F:21/2) and the ones with <10% weight loss consisted the noncachectic group (n:21, M/F:19/2). RESULTS Body mass index (BMI) of cachectics was significantly lower than that of noncachectics (21.0 +/- 2.9 versus 24.5 +/- 3.6, P = 0.02) and controls (21.0 +/- 2.9 versus 25.5 +/- 2.6, P = 0.01). Serum TNF-alpha level did not differ between cachectic and noncachectics (37.3 +/- 39.1 and 51.6 +/- 84.2 pg/mL, respectively). However, it was significantly higher in NSCLC patients compared with controls (44.1 +/- 64.3 and 15.1 +/- 14.3 pg/mL, P = 0.03). Serum IL-6 level was not different between 3 groups (6.4 +/- 4.1, 8.9 +/- 16.3, and 4.1 +/- 3.5 pg/mL, respectively) but it correlated significantly with TNF-alpha (r = 0.4, P = 0.006) and BMI (r = -0.3, P = 0.03). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) correlated significantly with TNF-alpha (r = 0.4, P = 0.003) and BMI (r = -0.3, P = 0.03). Among 44 cases, survival of 12 and 17 patients was recorded in cachectics and noncachectics, with no statistical difference (12.2 +/- 3.7 and 11.2 +/- 1.0 months, respectively). CONCLUSIONS TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels did not differ significantly between cachectics and noncachectics. However, significant correlations between IL-6, BMI, and TNF-alpha suggested that these cytokines acted as cofactors in weight loss. Survival was neither influenced by BMI, nor the cytokine levels in the present study. The significant correlation of ESR with TNF-alpha suggested that ESR could provide valuable clue for considerable weight loss in the follow-up of NSCLC patients.

Possible A: dead, construction site, under ground, egypt, cemetary Why is \\"cemetary\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"\\"Cemetery\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense in the context of the question because it connects well with the themes and concepts mentioned in the question. There are several factors that make \\"cemetery\\" a sensible answer choice. 1. Relevance to the case: The question deals with a murder case. A cemetery is directly related to death, and it is a common final resting place for those who have lost their lives, including murder victims. 2. Connection to reopening the case: When the judge decides that the murder case can be reopened, it suggests that new information or evidence might have come to light. This could mean that there might be a need to exhume a body or look for additional evidence in a burial site. A cemetery would be a logical place to start this process, as it is where bodies are often interred, and new evidence might be discovered during the excavation. 3. Suitability for excavation: Of the possible answers given, a cemetery is a location where excavation is more likely to be carried out in the context of a murder investigation. Excavating other sites like a construction site, underground facility, or in Egypt may not be directly related to the case, could have legal implications, and might involve unrelated parties. Excavating a cemetery would be more focused on the matter at hand, with a higher likelihood of yielding pertinent evidence or information. 4. Commonness of events: Although it is not an everyday occurrence, the exhumation of a body for further investigation in a criminal case is not unheard of. In high-profile or complex murder cases, where new evidence emerges, it is feasible that the authorities may need to exhume a body to carry out forensic examinations. Given this context, it is more aligned with human understanding and common sense that a cemetery would be the site of excavation in a reopened murder case. By considering these factors, it becomes clear that \\"cemetery\\" is an answer that aligns with human common sense because it is consistent with the concepts, themes, and actions presented in the question. It represents a logical and suitable location for the progression of a murder case and relates well to the circumstances mentioned in the question."},{"instruction":"This is the sort of thing that only now thrills the film eggheads.

This work is an imaginative and fanciful account of British kings from the legendary Trojan exile Brutus to the 7th-century Welsh king Cadwallader. Geoffrey places Arthur in the same post-Roman period as do Historia Brittonum and Annales Cambriae. He incorporates Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, his magician advisor Merlin, and the story of Arthur's conception, in which Uther, disguised as his enemy Gorlois by Merlin's magic, sleeps with Gorlois's wife Igerna (Igraine) at Tintagel, and she conceives Arthur. On Uther's death, the fifteen-year-old Arthur succeeds him as King of Britain and fights a series of battles, similar to those in the Historia Brittonum, culminating in the Battle of Bath. He then defeats the Picts and Scots before creating an Arthurian empire through his conquests of Ireland, Iceland and the Orkney Islands. After twelve years of peace, Arthur sets out to expand his empire once more, taking control of Norway, Denmark and Gaul. Gaul is still held by the Roman Empire when it is conquered, and Arthur's victory leads to a further confrontation with Rome. Arthur and his warriors, including Kaius (Kay), Beduerus (Bedivere) and Gualguanus (Gawain), defeat the Roman emperor Lucius Tiberius in Gaul but, as he prepares to march on Rome, Arthur hears that his nephew Modredus (Mordred)—whom he had left in charge of Britain—has married his wife Guenhuuara (Guinevere) and seized the throne.

During my days as an inmate in Bridges House at the University of New Brunswick, I shared this space with about 99 other testosterone-addled 'young adults' whose charming tendency to get completely out of hand was barely held in check by the rod of authority of the Don and Resident Fellow. This is not to say that these two worthies weren't good at their jobs; more accurately, their task was more akin to herding cats -- fairly obtuse, barely socialized cats. Given the state of controlled chaos that existed, it wasn't unusual for little conflicts to arise from time to time. Being rather physically small and odd, I came in for a certain amount of abuse from someone called Scut, a large and obnoxious Newfie (hmmm, that's like saying that water is wet).

So influential is the First Lady that she has 11 times more selling power than the Duchess. Speaking about his results, Sehdev said: 'Her influence is not what it’s being made to be and, in the eyes of the modern woman in both the U.S. and the U.K., she’s not heralded in that way. 'Does she even deserve the title of style icon? The answer is no, because she doesn’t measure on the criteria of the style icon.' So why has the new mother fallen out of favour? While 68 per cent of those surveyed believe her style has a certain timelessness, Michelle Obama is seen to be fives time as daring in her dressing. Sehdev also believes that Kate's move from high street offerings such as Reiss and L.K. Bennett to designer garments such as Alexander McQueen means her style resonate less with the masses. 'Style icons today have to be enormously sexy and they have to have a great sense of style and fashion and flair and individuality and they also have to be dressing for themselves and not others,' Sehdev added. Her best fashion moments: From the Zara cornflower blue dress she wore after announcing her engagement, right, to the vibrant pink jeans she wore to play hockey in, left, whatever the Duchess of Cambridge touches turned to gold when the Kate effect was in full swing. Highlights:","output":"1. The Duchess of Cambridge's clothing choices, once driving high street sales, may be losing their influence as per new research. 2. A recent survey reveals women are now more likely to emulate the style of reality TV stars such as Binky Felstead, Lauren Pope, and Snooki over the royal fashionista. 3. The 'Kate effect' apparently may not be as impactful anymore, with women being more swayed by reality TV stars, musicians, models, and movie stars for fashion inspiration. 4. Celebrity branding expert and University of Southern California marketing professor, Jeetendr Sehdev, revealed that women both in the USA and the UK claim to be more influenced by the likes of the Kardashians, Taylor Swift, Sienna Miller, and Michelle Obama. 5. The survey highlighted that Michelle Obama seems to have a significantly greater selling power than the Duchess, edging out Kate Middleton by having 11 times more influence. 6. The survey participants believe that while Kate's style possesses a timeless quality, Michelle Obama's dressing sense is seen as five times more daring. 7. The shift in Kate's clothing preferences from high street brands to designer labels such as Alexander McQueen may have resulted in her style resonating less with the masses."},{"instruction":"Is the premise \\"young Chinese children are at band practice.\\" true if \\"Men are rock climbing.\\"?

Sadly, they WERE released, and most are either forgettable or obnoxious. Almost every track on Enigma's previous albums was of high quality, and I liked almost all of them. In contrast, I like 2 out of 11 tracks on Voyageur, not a good percentage. Buy A Posteriori instead, if you already have the first four albums and are looking for more.

Step 1: Analyze the title The title, \\"Skip this one,\\" implies that the reader should avoid the product, suggesting a negative tone.

Movie title: Tomorrow Never Dies Movie plot: MI6 sends James Bond, agent 007, into the field to spy on a terrorist arms bazaar on the Russian border. Despite M's insistence to let 007 finish his reconnaissance, British Admiral Roebuck orders the frigate HMS Chester to launch a missile attack on the arms bazaar. Bond then discovers two nuclear torpedoes mounted on an L-39 Albatros, and as the missile is too far along to be aborted, 007 hijacks the L-39 and flies away seconds before the bazaar is destroyed. The media baron Elliot Carver soon begins his plans to use an encoder stolen from the bazaar by his henchman, cyberterrorist Henry Gupta, to provoke war between China and the United Kingdom; he hopes to replace the Chinese government with one that will give him exclusive broadcasting rights. Meaconing the GPS signal using the encoder, Gupta sends the British frigate HMS Devonshire off-course into Chinese-held waters in the South China Sea, where Carver's stealth ship, commanded by Mr. Stamper, sinks it and steals one of its missiles, while shooting down a Chinese J-7 fighter jet and killing off the Devonshire's survivors with Chinese weaponry. The British Minister of Defence orders Roebuck to deploy the British Fleet to recover the frigate, and possibly retaliate, while leaving M only 48 hours to investigate its sinking and avert a war. M sends Bond to investigate Carver after he releases news articles about the crisis hours before MI6 had learned of it. Bond travels to Hamburg and seduces Carver's wife, Paris, who is also Bond's ex-girlfriend, to get information that would help him enter Carver's newspaper headquarters. He also knocks out three of Stamper's men and cuts Carver off the air while he is giving a speech during the inaugural broadcast of his satellite network. After Bond steals back the GPS encoder, Carver orders Paris and Bond killed. Paris is murdered by Carver's personal assassin Dr. Kaufman, but Bond kills Kaufman and escapes, protecting the encoder. Bond learns that the encoder had been tampered with, and goes to the South China Sea...

Sometimes, you feel as if you're on top of the world. But occasionally you feel horrible, and you lose things and you cannot focus on your schoolwork. For more than 20 years, scientists have suggested that high self-esteem is the key to success. Now, new research shows that focusing just on building self-esteem may not be helpful. In some cases, having high self-esteem can bring bad results if it makes you less likeable or more upset when you fail at something. \\"Forget about self-esteem,\\" says Jennifer Crocker, a psychologist at the University of Michigan, US. \\"It's not the important thing.\\" Feeling good Crocker's advice may sound a bit strange because it is good to feel good about yourself. Studies show that people with high self-esteem are less likely to be depressed, anxious, shy, or lonely than those with low self-esteem. But, after reviewing about 18,000 studies on self-esteem, Roy Baumeister, a psychologist at Florida State University, has found that building up your self-esteem will not necessarily make you a better person. He believes that violent and wicked people often have the highest self-esteem of all. He also said: \\"There's no evidence that kids with high self-esteem do better in school.\\" Problems All types of people have problems. People with high self-esteem can have big egos that can make them less likeable to their peers , said Kathleen Vohs, a psychology professor at Columbia University. People with high self-esteem tend to think more of themselves, Vohs says. People with low self-esteem are more likely to rely on their friends when they need help. What to do Researchers say it is best to listen to and support other people. Find positive ways to contribute to society.

But the only thing that wasn't very fun about it was that he could catch many fish while I couldn't catch anything. I usually got pretty upset and kept asking him why. He always answered, \\"Son, if you want to catch a fish, you have to think like a fish\\", I remember being even more upset then because, \\"I'm not a fish!\\" I didn't know how to think like a fish. Besides, I reasoned, how could what I think influence what a fish does? As I got a little older I began to understand what my dad really meant. So, I read some books on fish. And I even joined the local fishing club and started attending the monthly meetings. I learned that a fish is a cold-blooded animal and therefore is very sensitive to water temperature. That is why fish prefer shallow water to deep water because the former is warmer. Besides, water is usually warmer in direct sunlight than in the shade. Yet, fish don't have any eyelids and the sun huts their eyes... The more I understood fish, the more I became effective at finding and catching them.. When I grew up and entered the business world, I remember hearing my first boss say, \\"We all need to think like sales people.\\" But it didn't completely make sense. My dad never once said, \\"If you want to catch a fish you need to think like a fisherman.\\" What he said was, \\"You need to think like a fish.\\" Years later, with great efforts to promote long-term services to people much older and richer than me, I gradually learned what we all need is to think more like customers.

The sentence could be a metaphor or a poetic expression about something surprising or unexpected happening, represented by the appearance of a star from a hole. However, in a literal sense, it does not make sense. - Sentence B: \\"All at once, a rabbit came out of a hole.\\" This sentence is more logical because rabbits are known to live in burrows or holes they dig in the ground.

However, I must honestly and regrettably say that I was plagued with an incredibly disappointing experience, which ultimately led me to leave a 1-star review – essentially the lowest rating. From the moment I installed the app, I had high hopes for a transformative means of simplifying my day-to-day interactions with my phone. Sadly, this anticipation was short-lived. The setup process turned out to be highly problematic, with unclear instructions and poorly designed interface elements. For an app designed specifically to assist individuals with visual impairments, this deficiency proved particularly frustrating. One of the most glaring issues with the com.google.android.marvin.talkback app was the voice feedback feature. The voice was extremely monotonous and robotic which made it strenuous to comprehend. Simple button presses often led to long, tedious responses that were quite exasperating and did nothing to enrich my user experience. Another significant problem involved Gesture Controls. The app is severely lacking in the intuitiveness and responsiveness department. Various actions required unintuitive multi-finger gestures that were challenging to execute accurately. This was compounded by the fact that certain gestures did not register reliably. Rather than facilitating increased accessibility, this made using my device even more cumbersome and infuriating. Furthermore, the slow response times caused several instances of crashes and system-wide lags, practically rendering my phone unusable. What's worse, I observed noticeable battery drainage happening during the short span I had the app activated, seriously putting me off. The user navigation and interface is another aspect that deserves strong criticism. Frequently-used settings were buried behind menus and submenus; the sheer number of clicks and swipes required to perform simple tasks made the whole ordeal absurdly impractical. Consequently, customer support was disappointingly unhelpful in resolving my concerns. I attempted to reach out to the team multiple times for assistance but was met with scripted, generic replies that did little or nothing to address my complaints. All in all, my experience with the com.google.android.marvin.talkback app was severely disheartening. It caused unwarranted stress and frustration that heavily overshadowed any potential benefits it may have provided. The lack of user-friendly design, performance issues, and ineffective customer support leaves a lot to be desired. For these reasons, I profoundly regret having to assign a 1-star rating to the app and, sadly, I cannot recommend it to anyone in its current state. It is my earnest hope that the developers take these concerns seriously and substantially improve the app, making it the useful accessibility tool it has the potential to be. Until then, I must persist with alternative solutions to fulfill my needs."},{"instruction":"Write a sentence based on this summary: polish lithuanian presidents hold phone talk","output":"Step 1: Identify the main components of the summary. - The summary includes information about a conversation the \\"Polish\\" and \\"Lithuanian\\" presidents had over the phone.

As they learn more about the wealthiest individuals residing in the Marbella, one name consistently stands out: Commodore Schmidlap, a billionaire businessman known for his extravagant yacht parties and mysterious ventures. Rumors begin circulating about Schmidlap's involvement in criminal activities, including an endangered species smuggling ring, which devastates Emma and Jake when they discover that endangered animals are being exploited for these cruelties. However, there is no concrete evidence against him. Determined to uncover the truth, the four friends hatch a plan to infiltrate Schmidlap's yacht party and gather proof of his wrongdoings. Act 2: Using Leon's connections in the yacht industry, the group manages to secure invitations to the next party hosted on Schmidlap's lavish yacht, The Mistress of the Sea. Disguising themselves as elite guests, Emma, Jake, Naomi, and Leon attend the party, but they quickly realize that they're in for more than they bargained for. As they explore the yacht, they discover a secret underground vault containing numerous exotic and endangered animals, marketed as exclusive \\"merchandise\\" to the wealthy clientele. They also stumble upon encrypted digital records of Schmidlap's other illegal ventures, such as money laundering and tax evasion.

Percy Aldridge Grainger (born George Percy Grainger; 8 July 1882 – 20 February 1961) was an Australian-born composer, arranger and pianist who lived in the United States from 1914 on and became a citizen in 1918. In the course of a long and innovative career, he played a prominent role in the revival of interest in British folk music in the early years of the 20th century. Although much of his work was experimental and unusual, the piece with which he is most generally associated is his piano arrangement of the folk-dance tune \\"Country Gardens\\". Grainger left Australia at the age of 13 to attend the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt. Between 1901 and 1914 he was based in London, where he established himself first as a society pianist and later as a concert performer, composer and collector of original folk melodies. As his reputation grew he met many of the significant figures in European music, forming important friendships with Frederick Delius and Edvard Grieg. He became a champion of Nordic music and culture, his enthusiasm for which he often expressed in private letters, sometimes in crudely racial or anti-Semitic terms. In 1914, Grainger moved to the United States, where he lived for the rest of his life, though he travelled widely in Europe and in Australia. He served briefly as a bandsman in the United States Army during the First World War through 1917–18, and took American citizenship in 1918. After his mother's suicide in 1922, he became increasingly involved in educational work. He also experimented with music machines, which he hoped would supersede human interpretation. In the 1930s he set up the Grainger Museum in Melbourne, his birthplace, as a monument to his life and works, and as a future research archive. As he grew older, he continued to give concerts and to revise and rearrange his own compositions, while writing little new music. After the Second World War, ill health reduced his levels of activity. He considered his career a failure. He gave his last concert in 1960, less than a year...

Slayer is an American thrash metal band from Huntington Park, California. The band was formed in 1981 by vocalist and bassist Tom Araya and guitarists Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman. Slayer's fast and aggressive musical style made them one of the founding \\"big four\\" bands of thrash metal, alongside Metallica, Megadeth and Anthrax. Slayer's current lineup comprises King, Araya, drummer Paul Bostaph and guitarist Gary Holt. Hanneman and drummers Dave Lombardo and Jon Dette are former members of the band. In the original line-up, King, Hanneman and Araya contributed to the band's lyrics, and all of the band's music was written by King and Hanneman. The band's lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as murder, serial killers, necrophilia, torture, genocide, human experimentation, Satanism, hate crimes, terrorism, religion, antireligion, Nazism and war, have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits and criticism from religious groups and factions of the general public. However, its music has been highly influential, often being cited by many bands as an influence musically, visually and lyrically; the band's third album, Reign in Blood (1986), was described as one of the heaviest and most influential thrash metal albums. Slayer has released twelve studio albums, two live albums, a box set, six music videos, two extended plays and a cover album. Four of the band's studio albums have received gold certification in the United States. The band has received five Grammy Award nominations, winning one in 2007 for the song \\"Eyes of the Insane\\" and one in 2008 for the song \\"Final Six\\", both of which were from the album Christ Illusion (2006).

Zizka is held to be one of the most renowned military leaders by many historians and today he is widely considered a Czech national hero. He was born in the small village of Trocnov (now part of Borovany) in the Kingdom of Bohemia into an aristocratic family. Context: Zizka helped develop tactics of using wagon forts, called vozova hradba in Czech or Wagenburg by the Germans, as mobile fortifications. When the Hussite army faced a numerically superior opponent they prepared carts for the battle by forming them into squares or circles. The carts were joined wheel to wheel by chains and positioned aslant, with their corners attached to each other, so that horses could be harnessed to them quickly, if necessary. In front of this wall of carts a ditch was dug by camp followers. The crew of each cart consisted of 16-22 soldiers: 4-8 crossbowmen, 2 handgunners, 6-8 soldiers equipped with pikes or flails (the flail was the Hussite \\"national weapon\\"), 2 shield carriers and 2 drivers. The Hussites' battle consisted of two stages, the first defensive, the second an offensive counterattack. In the first stage the army placed the carts near the enemy army and by means of artillery fire provoked the enemy into battle. The artillery would usually inflict heavy casualties at close range. In order to avoid more losses, the enemy knights finally attacked. Then the infantry hidden behind the carts used firearms and crossbows to ward off the attack, weakening the enemy. The shooters aimed first at the horses, depriving the cavalry of its main advantage. Many of the knights died as their horses were shot and they fell. As soon as the enemy's morale was lowered, the second stage, an offensive counterattack, began. The infantry and the cavalry burst out from behind the carts striking violently at the enemy, mostly from the flanks. While fighting on the flanks and being shelled from the carts the enemy was not able to put up much resistance. They were forced to withdraw, leaving behind dismounted knights in heavy armor who were unable to escape the battlefield. The enemy armies suffered heavy losses and the Hussites soon had the reputation of not taking captives. Question: \`How did that crew fight? Answer:","output":"The crew of each cart in Jan Zizka's wagon fort fought using a combination of defensive and offensive tactics, utilizing different types of soldiers and weapons for various purposes. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how they fought: 1. Positioning of carts: The crew formed carts into squares or circles and joined them wheel to wheel with chains. This allowed the creation of a mobile wagon fort that could be quickly repositioned if necessary. 2. Digging a ditch: A protective ditch was dug in front of the carts by camp followers, adding an extra layer of defense. 3. Cart crew composition: Each cart consisted of 16-22 soldiers, including crossbowmen, handgunners, pikemen or flail users, shield carriers, and drivers. 4. First stage - Defensive tactics: The battle started by positioning the carts near the enemy army and provoking them with artillery fire. This inflicted heavy casualties and forced the enemy to attack. 5. Defense against enemy charge: While the enemy charged, the infantry hidden behind the carts used firearms and crossbows to repel the attack. They targeted the horses first, eliminating the advantage of enemy cavalry. 6. Second stage - Offensive counterattack: With the enemy morale lowered, the infantry and cavalry came out from behind the carts to initiate a counterattack, primarily targeting the flanks. 7. Exploiting enemy weaknesses: The combination of flank attacks and continuous bombardment from the carts overwhelmed the enemy, who were forced to retreat. 8. No captives policy: The Hussites had a reputation for not taking captives, which further demoralized their enemies. These steps showcase how Jan Zizka's crew effectively executed defensive and offensive strategies using the wagon fort system to achieve numerous victories and forge a reputation as formidable warriors."},{"instruction":"- The cold water forms ice crystals - The ice crystals grow by absorbing surrounding water droplets - Form snowflakes - The snowflakes fall to the ground.

It is not clear how and when he became part of Atta's circle. He became particularly friendly with Binalshibh after meeting him at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, which Jarrah began attending regularly in late 1997. The worshippers at this mosque featured an outspoken, flamboyant Islamist named Mohammed Haydar Zammar. A well-known figure in the Muslim community (and to German and U.S. intelligence agencies by the late 1990s), Zammar had fought in Afghanistan and relished any opportunity to extol the virtues of violent jihad. Indeed, a witness has reported hearing Zammar press Binalshibh to fulfill his duty to wage jihad. Moreover, after 9/11, Zammar reportedly took credit for influencing not just Binalshibh but the rest of the Hamburg group. In 1998, Zammar encouraged them to participate in jihad and even convinced them to go to Afghanistan. Owing to Zammar's persuasion or some other source of inspiration, Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah eventually prepared themselves to translate their extremist beliefs into action. By late 1999, they were ready to abandon their student lives in Germany in favor of violent jihad. This final stage in their evolution toward embracing Islamist extremism did not entirely escape the notice of the people around them. The foursome became core members of a group of radical Muslims, often hosting sessions at their Marienstrasse apartment that involved extremely anti-American discussions. Meeting three to four times a week, the group became something of a \\"sect\\" whose members, according to one participant in the meetings, tended to deal only with each other. Atta's rent checks for the apartment provide evidence of the importance that the apartment assumed as a center for the group, as he would write on them the notation \\"Dar el Ansar,\\" or \\"house of the followers.\\" In addition to Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah, the group included other extremists, some of whom also would attend al Qaeda training camps and, in some instances, would help the 9/11 hijackers as they executed the plot: Said Bahaji, son of a Moroccan immigrant, was the only German citizen in the group. Educated in Morocco, Bahaji returned to Germany to study electrical engineering at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg. He spent five months in the German army before obtaining a medical discharge, and lived with Atta and Binalshibh at 54 Marienstrasse for eight months between November 1998 and July 1999.

Questions: Someone probably used more than one horse to make one of these? Options: - horseradish - farmyard - western movie - canada - race track The answer is:","output":"\\"western movie\\" First, let's break down each option: - horseradish: It's a type of root used in cooking and has nothing to do with horses in terms of its creation. - farmyard: While horses are a common animal found in a farmyard, they are not necessary or exclusively used to 'create' one. - western movie: A genre of film often featuring cowboys and historical aspects of the American Wild West, these frequently feature horses as part of their narrative and production. - canada: As a country, Canada was not made by horses. - race track: While horses are a part of the racing activities conducted on a race track, they do not physically 'make' the race track. Upon examining each choice, a 'western movie' seems to best fit the question. Western movies often feature more than one horse during the film's production, both in front of the camera (for scenes involving horse riding, carriage pulling, etc.) and possibly behind-the-scenes as well (for off-camera transportation in particularly rustic or off-road filming locations).

Best of all, catnip is safe. It can even be grown next to plants that typically attract mosquitoes as a deterrent. Keep in mind, however, that the catnip will attract cats into your yard. Catnip is an aggressive grower, like a weed. Be sure to keep it reined in, or it will take over your flowerbed. in your garden or yard. Citronella masks the surrounding scents around your home and garden that attract mosquitoes, preventing them from coming too near. If you live in warm climates where frost does not occur, plant citronella directly into the ground behind your other plants. Citronella can grow to a height of up to between 5 and 6 feet (1.52 and 1.82 meters) and forms in large, grassy clumps. If you live in a cold, freezing climate, plant citronella in large planters. This way, you can move the planters indoors during freezing temperatures and harsh weather conditions. Verify that the citronella plants you use are called Citronella winterianus or Cymbopogon nardus, as opposed to plants labeled \\"citronella-scented,\\" which may not be authentic citronella plants. Not only will you have something that you can use in your cooking, but you will be keeping the mosquitoes away. Many herbs also develop small white or purple flowers. Here are some popular herbs that keep mosquitoes at bay: Basil Garlic Lavender, Lemon balm, and Lemongrass Peppermint Rosemary These small blue and purple flowers are hard, suitable for just about any climate. The plant grows up to 18 inches (45.72 cm) tall, making it ideal for the back of flowerbeds. It needs partial or full sunlight. Ageratum secretes a scent considered offensive to mosquitoes. The smell that these flowers emit will prevent mosquitoes from entering a specific area, functioning similar to a border. Plant marigolds in areas with fertilized soil that can be exposed to full sunlight at all times. They will add color and fragrance to your yard, while keeping mosquitoes at bay. Consider planting some of these flowers into flower pots, and placing them near doorways and windows. Flowers that repel mosquitoes include: Geranium Mums Pennyroyal Tansy Horsemint works similarly to citronella, but can withstand dry weather, sandy soil, and salty air. Grow horsemint in either a shaded or sunny area with enough room to allow the plant to grow between 2 and 3 feet (60.96 and 91.44 cm) in both width and height. There are many other wild plants that also repel mosquitoes. If any of these plants are native to the area you live in, consider planting some in your garden. You may already have some growing in or near your garden. Cedar trees Mugwort and Nodding onion Pineapple weed Snowbrush, Sweetfern, and Sagebrush, Wild bergamot, Wormwood, and Vanilla Leaf What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article discusses the use of various plants as natural mosquito repellents in gardens and yards. Catnip is mentioned as a safe and effective alternative to chemical repellents like DEET but can attract cats and grow aggressively. Citronella is another effective mosquito repellant, which can be grown directly in the ground in warm climates or in planters in colder climates. Authentic citronella plants (Citronella winterianus or Cymbopogon nardus) should be used for optimal results. Additionally, several herbs with mosquito-repelling properties, such as basil, garlic, lavender, lemon balm, lemongrass, peppermint, and rosemary, serve dual purposes in cooking and pest control. The article also highlights other mosquito-repellent flowers, like ageratum, marigolds, geraniums, mums, pennyroyal, tansy, and horsemint. Lastly, it suggests considering native wild plants like cedar trees, mugwort, nodding onion, pineapple weed, snowbrush, sweetfern, sagebrush, wild bergamot, wormwood, and vanilla leaf for further mosquito control.

Babrak Karmal (Dari/Pashto: bbrkh khrml, born Sultan Hussein; 6 January 1929 - 1 or 3 December 1996) was an Afghan politician who was installed as president of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union when they invaded in 1979. Karmal was born in Kamari and educated at Kabul University. When he came to power, Karmal promised an end to executions, the establishment of democratic institutions and free elections, the creation of a constitution, and legalization of alternative political parties. Prisoners incarcerated under the two previous governments would be freed in a general amnesty. He promised the creation of a coalition government which would not espouse socialism. At the same time, he told the Afghan people that he had negotiated with the Soviet Union to give economic, military and political assistance. The mistrust most Afghans felt towards the government was a problem for Karmal. Many still remembered he had said he would protect private capital in 1978--a promise later proven to be a lie. Karmal's three most important promises were the general amnesty of prisoners, the promulgation of the Fundamental Principles of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and the adoption of a new flag containing the traditional black, red and green (the flag of Taraki and Amin was red). His government granted concessions to religious leaders and the restoration of confiscated property. Some property, which was confiscated during earlier land reforms, was also partially restored. All these measures, with the exception of the general amnesty of prisoners, were introduced gradually. Of 2,700 prisoners, 2,600 were released from prison; 600 of these were Parchamites. The general amnesty was greatly publicized by the government. While the event was hailed with enthusiasm by some, many others greeted the event with disdain, since their loved ones or associates had died during earlier purges. Amin had planned to introduce a general amnesty on 1 January 1980, to coincide with the PDPA's sixteenth anniversary. Work on the Fundamental Principles had started under Amin: it guaranteed democratic rights such as freedom of speech, the right to security and life, the right to peaceful association, the right to demonstrate and the right that \\"no one would be accused of crime but in accord with the provisions of law\\" and that the accused had the right to a fair trial. The Fundamental Principles envisaged a democratic state led by the PDPA, the only party then permitted by law. The Revolutionary Council, the organ of supreme power, would convene twice every year. The Revolutionary Council in turn elected a Presidium which would take decisions on behalf of the Revolutionary Council when it was not in session. The Presidium consisted mostly of PDPA Politburo members. The state would safeguard three kinds of property: state, cooperative and private property. The Fundamental Principles said that the state had the right to change the Afghan economy from an economy where man was exploited to an economy were man was free. Another clause stated that the state had the right to take \\"families, both parents and children, under its supervision.\\" While it looked democratic at the outset, the Fundamental Principles was based on contradictions. The Fundamental Principles led to the establishment of two important state organs: the Special Revolutionary Court, a specialized court for crimes against national security and territorial integrity, and the Institute for Legal and Scientific Research and Legislative Affairs, the supreme legislative organ of state, This body could amend and draft laws, and introduce regulations and decrees on behalf of the government. The introduction of more Soviet-style institutions led the Afghan people to distrust the communist government even more. were these principles followed?","output":"The principles laid out by Babrak Karmal in the Fundamental Principles of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan were not followed to their fullest extent. His promises of implementing democratic reforms, ensuring individual rights, and forming a government that would not espouse socialism were not completely fulfilled during his rule. Although there were some attempts to grant concessions to religious leaders, restore confiscated property, and release a portion of the prisoners, the overall impact of these measures was limited. The establishment of the Special Revolutionary Court and the Institute for Legal and Scientific Research and Legislative Affairs, both Soviet-style institutions, raised doubts among the Afghan people and contributed to their mistrust of the communist government. Additionally, many Afghans felt betrayed due to Karmal's earlier promises, such as protecting private capital, which were later proven to be false. While Karmal's government made efforts in some areas, the general lack of progress in establishing a more democratic and inclusive governance structure, along with ongoing Soviet influence, suggests that the principles were not fully followed or effectively implemented."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - A record producer or music producer oversees and manages the sound recording and production of a band or performer's music, which may range from recording one song to recording a lengthy concept album. A producer has many roles during the recording process. The roles of a producer vary.

The name of the band comes from the Kingdom of Delain in Stephen King's novel, \\"The Eyes of the Dragon\\". - A film score (also sometimes called background score, background music, movie soundtrack, film music or incidental music) is original music written specifically to accompany a film. The score forms part of the film's soundtrack, which also usually includes dialogue and sound effects, and comprises a number of orchestral, instrumental, or choral pieces called cues, which are timed to begin and end at specific points during the film in order to enhance the dramatic narrative and the emotional impact of the scene in question. Scores are written by one or more composers, under the guidance of, or in collaboration with, the film's director or producer and are then usually performed by an ensemble of musicians most often comprising an orchestra or band, instrumental soloists, and choir or vocalists and recorded by a sound engineer. - Marko Tapani \\"Marco\\" Hietala (born 14 January 1966) is a Finnish heavy metal vocalist, bass guitarist and songwriter. Internationally, he is most known as the current bass guitarist, male vocalist and secondary composer to Tuomas Holopainen, of the symphonic metal band Nightwish. He is also the vocalist and bassist as well as composer and lyricist for the heavy metal band Tarot. - Within Temptation is a Dutch symphonic metal band founded in April 1995 by vocalist Sharon den Adel and guitarist Robert Westerholt. They have always been classified by critics as gothic metal, although the \\"gothic\\" influence varies with each album. Their most prominent and well-known sound is described as symphonic metal, although their earlier material, such as debut album \\"Enter\\", was mostly gothic metal. \\"Enter\\" even had a hint of doom metal. In an interview, Den Adel said they fell into a symphonic rock genre with various influences. In a later interview with Dutch music platform 3VOOR12, den Adel stated that \\"we consider ourselves more a symphonic rock band ... in my opinion, we are no gothic band\\". - Nightwish is a symphonic power metal band from Kitee, Finland. The band was formed in 1996 by lead songwriter and keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen, and lead singer Tarja Turunen. The band soon picked up drummer Jukka Nevalainen, and then bassist Sami Vänskä after the release of their debut album, \\"Angels Fall First\\" (1997). In 2002, Vänskä was replaced by Marco Hietala, who also took over the male vocalist role previously filled by Holopainen or guest singers. - Erno \\"Emppu\\" Matti Juhani Vuorinen (born 24 June 1978) is a Finnish guitarist, most famous for being a founding member and occasional songwriter of the symphonic metal band Nightwish.

A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west, the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east. Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland. Finland is a Nordic country situated in the geographical region of Fennoscandia, which also includes Scandinavia. Finland's population is 5.5 million (2014), staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades. The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region. In terms of area, it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union. - Angels Fall First is the debut studio album by Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish. The original 500-copies limited edition features seven tracks, two of which are not on the regular edition. This edition is highly sought after by collectors and in 2012 a copy was sold for 1137.23 on eBay. The album was released in the US by Century Media in March 2001. - The tarot (first known as trionfi and later as tarocchi, tarock, and others) is a pack of playing cards, used from the mid-15th century in various parts of Europe to play games such as Italian tarocchini and French tarot. In the late 18th century, it began to be used for divination in the form of tarotology/cartomancy. - Power metal is a subgenre of heavy metal combining characteristics of traditional metal with speed metal, often within symphonic context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a more uplifting sound, instead of the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in styles such as doom metal and death metal. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally \\"powerful\\" sound. The term was first used in the middle of the 1980s and refers to two different but related styles: the first pioneered and largely practiced in North America with a harder sound similar to speed metal, and a later more widespread and popular style based in Europe (especially Scandinavia, Germany, Greece and Italy), South America (especially Brazil and Argentina) and Japan, with a lighter, more melodic sound and frequent use of keyboards. - Gothic metal (or goth metal) is a fusion genre combining the heaviness of heavy metal with the dark atmospheres of gothic rock. The music of gothic metal is diverse with bands known to adopt the gothic approach to different styles of heavy metal music. The genre originated during the early 1990s in Europe originally as an outgrowth of death-doom, a fusion of death metal and doom metal. Lyrics are generally dark and introspective with inspiration from gothic fiction as well as personal experiences. - Sami Vänskä (born 26 September 1976) is the former bassist of Finnish symphonic power metal band Nightwish. - Jukka Antero \\"Julius\\" Nevalainen (born 21 April 1978, Kitee, Finland) is the drummer in the Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish and the Finnish progressive metal band Sethian. - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows: European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity. - Symphonic metal is a subgenre of metal music which combines the characteristics of this genre, such as heavy drums and guitars, with different elements of classical music including symphonic instruments, choirs and on occasion, a full symphony orchestra. Keyboards reminiscent of power metal also often find a dominant place in this subgenre. Symphonic metal bands often feature classically trained female vocalists, giving rise to the nickname opera metal or operatic metal, and it is not uncommon for them to feature a second vocalist performing growls, a more common characteristic of gothic metal. Perhaps the most typical and prominent examples of symphonic metal bands are Finnish band Nightwish, Dutch bands Within Temptation, Delain and Epica, and Swedish band Therion, all four of which place a large focus on elements prevalent in film scores on top of the more basic classical components utilized more widely in the genre. - Tuomas Lauri Johannes Holopainen (born 25 December 1976) is a Finnish songwriter, multi-instrumentalist musician (but mainly keyboardist) and record producer, best known as the founder, leader, keyboardist and songwriter of symphonic metal band Nightwish. He has also studied jazz and classical styles, but prefers to be influenced by harmonic film music. - A choir (also known as a chorale or chorus) is a musical ensemble of singers. Choral music, in turn, is the music written specifically for such an ensemble to perform. Choirs may perform music from the classical music repertoire, which spans from the Medieval era to the present, and/or popular music repertoire. Most choirs are led by a conductor, who leads the performances with arm and face gestures. - A songwriter is an individual who writes the lyrics, melodies and chord progressions for songs, typically for a popular music genre such as rock or country music. A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers. What entity does 'over the hills and far away ' has the relation 'genre' with?

Given the context: How would Sydney feel afterwards? The answer is:","output":"As an AI, I cannot predict individual emotions with certainty; however, I can provide a possible description based on the context provided. Sydney, being a witch with the power to turn back time, would probably feel a mix of emotions after using her ability. Her feelings would likely depend on the specific situation, the motivation behind her decision to turn back time, and the results of her actions. 1. If Sydney turned back time for a positive reason, such as to save a loved one or correct a terrible event, she might feel relieved, triumphant, and satisfied that she could make such a difference with her powers. 2. However, if Sydney turned back time for selfish reasons, or if her actions resulted in negative consequences, she may feel guilty, remorseful, or even regretful for abusing her powers. 3. It is also possible that Sydney could feel overwhelmed or burdened by the weight of her powers and the responsibility that comes with them. Knowing that she has the ability to alter the past might make her question every decision she makes. In conclusion, Sydney's feelings after turning back time would be shaped by many factors, including her motivation, the outcome of her actions, and the personal responsibility she feels for her powers."},{"instruction":"the more i think about it, there was nothing redeeming about this movie. i saw it 9 months ago, so my memory might have made it worse than it was, but i do know it was at least as bad as a 4 out of 10. after seeing the movie, i met the director. he seemed so clueless as to what he was doing or what he had done, and as far as i could tell, he didn't care for the film either. even he agreed that he didn't really know what he was doing, and he was forced to do certain things because it was filmed digitally. i felt that the movie was trying to hard to fit in to the formula that it built for itself: \\"9 people all have to be connected in some way. how can we get from point 'A' to point 'B'\\" so in order get from the prostitute we see in the start and back to her at the end they 10 minutes on each character's relationship to another person. it makes one feel choked by the 2 demensional, badly drawn characters.

Which farm used fewer cover crops?","output":"To determine which farm used fewer cover crops, we can examine the actions taken by each farm and deduce their implications on cover crop usage. Step 1: Analyze the actions taken by Apple Farm Apple Farm started an agroforestry system and adopted other methods to protect their depleted soils. Agroforestry involves growing trees or shrubs in combination with crops or pastureland, which can offer various benefits, such as the prevention of soil erosion, maintaining soil fertility, and providing a diverse habitat for wildlife. While agroforestry doesn't explicitly mention the use of cover crops, some agroforestry practices can incorporate them to enhance soil health. Step 2: Analyze the actions taken by Pear Farm Pear Farm did not take any measures to address their depleted soils and experienced significant losses in the following years. Since no specific actions are mentioned, it's difficult to determine if Pear Farm used any cover crops or not. Step 3: Compare cover crop usage between the two farms Based on the information provided, Apple Farm actively implemented agroforestry practices and possibly used cover crops as part of their approach to improve their depleted soils. Conversely, Pear Farm did not take any specific actions to address their soil depletion. Given that Pear Farm did not implement any techniques to improve its soil health, it is safe to assume that Apple Farm likely used more cover crops, leaving Pear Farm with fewer. Therefore, Pear Farm used fewer cover crops, by our best estimation."},{"instruction":"Please answer this question: when did the original movie mamma mia come out?","output":"To answer this question, I will perform an internet search to find the release date of the original movie \\"Mamma Mia!\\" Step 1: Access an internet search engine I will access a popular search engine such as Google in order to find information about the Mamma Mia movie release date.

On the tapes, Marc can be heard to say \\"He'd kill us if he had the chance.\\" When he worked on the East Coast, Caul had participated in a surveillance that led to the deaths of two persons. He worries that this might happen again, and goes to church to confess his sins.After Amy breaks off their relationship, Caul attends a surveillance convention. Martin also attends, and Caul confronts him and orders Martin to stop following him. He learns that Stan has gone to work for Moran (Alan Garfield), a Detroit-based surveillance expert looking to expand to the West Coast. Moran demonstrates to convention goers a new remote audio system that turns any telephone into a live microphone. Although Caul persuades Stan not to work for Moran after the convention is over, Moran is effusive in his praise for Caul. Lonely and enjoying the positive attention, Caul lets his guard down and takes Moran, Stan and several others back to his workroom for a post-convention... Answer:","output":"Yes, the tragedy which Caul is anticipating occurs. The plot of The Conversation reveals that Caul's concern for the safety of Ann and Marc is justified. He fears that handing over the tapes to the Director would result in harm to the couple due to Marc's words on the tape, \\"He'd kill us if he had the chance.\\" Caul's past experience with a surveillance job that led to the deaths of two people further intensifies his worry that a similar tragedy might happen again. Despite his attempts to protect Ann and Marc by withholding the tapes from the Director's assistant Martin, ultimately, the tragedy he anticipates does take place."},{"instruction":"How is \\"I just got off the phone with a man who asked, \\"How do I know which plane to get on?\\"\\" said in Russian?","output":"In Russian, the phrase \\"I just got off the phone with a man who asked, \\"How do I know which plane to get on?\\"\\" can be translated as: «Я только что разговаривал по телефону с мужчиной, который спросил: \\"Как мне узнать, на какой самолёт мне садиться?\\"» Here is a breakdown of the translation: - \\"I just got off the phone with a man\\" can be translated as \\"Я только что разговаривал по телефону с мужчиной\\" (Ya tol'ko chto razgovarival po telefonu s muzhchinoy). - \\"who asked\\" is \\"который спросил\\" (kotoryy sprosil). - \\"How do I know\\" can be translated as \\"Как мне узнать\\" (Kak mne uznat'). - \\"which plane to get on\\" can be translated as \\"на какой самолёт мне садиться\\" (na kakoy samolyot mne sadit'sya).

Before Oasis, he was the drummer of Starclub from 1991 to 1994. He is the longest serving drummer in Oasis's history, performing on four studio albums, two compilation albums and one live album during his tenure. He joined the band in May 1995 after the band's original drummer Tony McCarroll was removed from the band. In early 2004, White surprisingly left Oasis during the early recording sessions for the band's sixth album. According to Oasis' spokesperson, there were some new tracks and demos with White's performances, which were made at the end of 2003 and early 2004 as the very first demos for their upcoming album, before his departure. In an interview, Noel Gallagher alluded to White's personal problems: \\"He's a ******* great guy, and he's one of the best drummers I've ever met in my life, but his personal life is ******* chaos. In the end he ****** ***, and we haven't seen him since.\\" In an interview on Radio 1 with Chris Moyles (15 August 2008), Noel Gallagher stated that White was \\"kicked out\\" of the band. There is also evidence to suggest that White was upset that his drums were going down so low in the mix on top of the prevalence of drum loops (\\"Go Let It Out\\", \\"Gas Panic!\\", \\"The Hindu Times\\", \\"Better Man\\", \\"Force of Nature\\"). On one Q&A with Freddie Gee, he had said: \\"Well, I don't like that my drums get turned down with each successive mix we do of an album, but one mustn't grumble in this band.\\" White was replaced with Zak Starkey, The Who drummer and the son of The Beatles' Ringo Starr. Ringo particularly was cited as one of White's biggest drumming influences. Due to his departure, the band scrapped the first midway sessions and later suffered some prolonged and difficult recording for Don't Believe the Truth (2005). What did he do after leaving Oasis?","output":"After leaving Oasis, Alan White stayed involved in the music world, though he did not become part of another famous band like Oasis. He worked with different musicians and bands, playing drums and helping them with their music. He also had a music studio where he spent time working on projects and collaborating with other artists. So, even though he wasn't in a big popular band like Oasis anymore, Alan White continued to enjoy making music and working with other people in the music industry."},{"instruction":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Charlie Vansant, a college student of Athens, Ohio who reported that his car was stolen, got a surprise when he learned a woman had mistaken it for her daughter's car and taken it-using her key. Kate Anderson became an accidental car thief when picking up her daughter's car near an Ohio University building last week. Anderson spotted the Toyota Camry and used her daughter's key to unlock the car, start the engine and drive home-without realizing that the car wasn't her daughter's. When Charlie Vansant left class a short time later, he found only an empty parking spot. He first assumed the car had been _ , but when the police couldn't find a record of it, they took a theft report. The morning after Anderson took the car, her daughter discovered the Camry in the driveway wasn't hers. Anderson said she was able to find Vansant's name on paperwork in the glove compartment and look up his phone number on the website for the university. When Anderson told Charlie the car was in her driveway, \\"It sounded real suspicious at first, as she wanted to hold the thing for ransom ,\\" said Vansant. He eventually went to the house with a police officer, where he was reunited with his car. According to the police report, the case was closed \\"because of mistaken car identity\\", Anderson wasn't charged. Vansant seemed to blame the car company more than the \\"thief\\". \\"Her key fit not only my lock, but my ignition as well - so high-five for Toyota. I guess.\\" he said.

As the country endured another sodden week, following the wettest spring and early summer period since records began, it emerged that the wet weather will continue for another seven to 10 days. Matt Dobson, forecaster at MeteoGroup, said the main culprit was the jet stream, a fast wind that blows round the planet and moves our surface pressure systems. Sales of a 'mood boosting' supplement have increased drastically because of the terrible Britain weather, figures suggest. The gloomy and dreary weather conditions have likely contributed to an overall decrease in mood and energy levels among the population. As a result, people are seeking various ways to lift their spirits, including turning to mood-enhancing supplements. These supplements often contain ingredients such as St. John's Wort, vitamin D, and omega-3 fatty acids, which have been proven to help improve mood, cognitive function, and overall mental health. With the ongoing rain and lack of sunshine, it comes as no surprise that individuals are looking for alternative ways to brighten their days. In addition to supplements, people are also finding other methods to cope with the unfavorable weather. Indoor activities, exercise, and maintaining social connections can provide much-needed relief and help combat feelings of seasonal affective disorder (SAD) or the \\"winter blues.\\" As the nation prepares for the Olympics, the pressure is on for the weather to improve and provide both athletes and spectators with a more enjoyable experience. However, as long as the jet stream continues to cause havoc on the British climate, the search for remedies to combat its effects on mental well-being will remain essential for many. In conclusion, the relentless downpours and dreary conditions resulting from the jet stream have prompted a drastic increase in the sales of mood-boosting supplements. As people search for ways to improve their mental state in the face of such adverse weather conditions, it is essential that everyone prepares for the possibilities of more torrential rains throughout the summer and potentially into the start of the Olympics. Maintaining healthy habits and seeking support when needed is crucial in navigating these challenging times."},{"instruction":"(1) It was founded by Metin Üstündağ , Selçuk Erdem , Erdil Yasaroğlu and Bahadır Baruter in 2002 .

Jan Brewer will likely veto politically-charged legislation that supporters say promotes religious freedom and opponents contend discriminates against gays and lesbians. Brewer did not signal her intention either way in an exclusive interview with CNN on Monday at the National Governors Association meeting in Washington. \\"I can assure you, as always, I will do the right thing for the state of Arizona,\\" she said. But some Arizona Republicans who know her well say they are confident those comments mean Brewer will almost surely reject the bill that is generating nationwide controversy. The Republican-led measure would allow Arizona business owners to deny service to gay and lesbian customers as long as they assert their religious beliefs. Brewer is scheduled to return to Arizona on Tuesday, and a source tells CNN those familiar with her thinking say she will likely spend at least one full business day in the state before acting. \\"I'm going to go home, and when I receive the bill, I'm going to read it and I'm going to be briefed on it. We have been following it. And I will make my decision in the near future,\\" Brewer told CNN. She has until Saturday to sign or veto the bill. If she does nothing, it automatically becomes law. Arizona GOP sources say Brewer considers herself a pro-business governor -- someone who above all else wants to protect and promote Arizona's economic interests. They say she knows full well there will be economic consequences for the state if it has a law on the books perceived to effectively codify discrimination. \\"I have a history of deliberating and having an open dialogue on bills that are controversial, to listen to both sides of those issues, and I welcome the input, and information that they can provide to me. And certainly I am pro-business, and that is what's turning our economy around, so I appreciate their input, as I appreciate the other side,\\" Brewer said. Business leaders in Arizona and around the country, including the chief executive of American Airlines, have urged Brewer publicly and privately to veto the bill. Approval also is likely to trigger lawsuits. The bill was pushed by the Center for Arizona Policy, a conservative group opposed to abortion and same-sex marriage. The group argues the proposal protects people against increasingly activist federal courts. Brewer vetoed a similar bill last year, arguing that the state legislature should focus on more pressing issues, such as a Medicaid expansion plan she was promoting. Sources say she is concerned about this bill taking away from other issues she is now pressing, such as overhauling Arizona's child protective services system. Freedom or oppression?

I had arranged for a paid assistant to help me since the height of the ceiling and the weight of the wallboard was more than I could handle. When the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a “rage” of determination.

About a half hour after I finished, I was standing there smugly trying to figure how I did it so easily when there was a knock at the door. Of course it was the assistant with a lot of excuses. He seemed surprised when I told him I was finished. He looked up at the ceiling and said \\"how in the world did you get those up there by yourself?\\" I said, \\"Oh, believe me, You helped more than you will ever know!\\" I learned a lot from that.

In each of the nine cases, the Civilian Complaint Review Board, an independent agency that investigates police misconduct, recommended that the Police Department pursue the strongest form of punishment for the officers: an administrative trial, which could lead to termination. But the police commissioner has the final say in such cases, and in all but one of the cases decided, the officers were not disciplined, or were given the lightest possible sanction: a review of the rules. The department’s response in the nine cases, documented in monthly reports by the board, raised uncomfortable questions for the Police Department, which prohibits chokeholds because of the risk of serious injury or death, but in practice appears to treat the maneuver as little more than a lapse. How the department treats officers in such situations has come under new scrutiny after the death of the Staten Island man, Eric Garner, who was held by an officer in an apparent chokehold on Thursday. The officer, Daniel Pantaleo, was stripped of his badge and gun as an investigation into the death goes on. Video of the arrest, apparently for selling untaxed cigarettes, appeared to show Officer Pantaleo wrapping his arm around the neck of Mr. Garner, who had been arguing with officers and objecting to being arrested. The two men fell to the ground, and other officers joined in restraining Mr. Garner as he said he was not able to breathe. The two emergency medical technicians and the two paramedics who responded to Mr. Garner have been suspended without pay, the Richmond University Medical Center said Monday. Both Mayor Bill de Blasio and Police Commissioner William J. Bratton said the video appeared to show a chokehold. “Each case must be considered as to the specifics of the underlying actions,” said Stephen Davis, the department’s top spokesman. “The circumstances vary as to a number of different variables, ‘dangerousness’ being just one of them, the nature of the ‘chokehold’ being another.” Mr. Bratton has said the practice, more common in the 1980s before many departments banned its use, had not been a problem in the first six months of his tenure. He told reporters Friday that officers were officially reminded last year that chokeholds are not allowed. Despite the ban, complaints of officers’ using chokeholds have steadily come before the review board. From 2009 to 2013, the board received 1,022 such complaints. In nine of those cases, investigators were able to find evidence to back up the complaint and bring it to the attention of the department. Details of the nine substantiated cases were not immediately available, except for the precincts where they occurred and the basics of the dispositions. Most took place in the Bronx and Brooklyn; none were on Staten Island. The review board recommended that each officer be brought before an administrative court, on the fourth floor of Police Headquarters, where a department judge would rule in the case. If found guilty, the officer would face suspension or possible termination. But in two cases of chokeholds, in 2009 and in 2010, the department under Raymond W. Kelly, then commissioner, declined altogether to pursue an administrative trial, effectively deciding not to discipline the officer. In three cases, from 2009 to 2011, officers were issued “instructions” by Mr. Kelly, a designation that amounts to retraining on the rules. One officer retired before a judgment could be ruled, and two cases from 2013 are still pending a decision in an administrative trial. One pending case began with plainclothes officers approaching a man for riding his bike on a Queens sidewalk in January 2012, and ended with the officer and the man wrestling on the ground. The man said the officer held him in a chokehold for more than a minute; the officer has denied doing so. Only once in the last five years, August 2009, did Mr. Kelly issue a modest punishment against an officer for a chokehold, a command discipline that carried a loss of vacation days. So far, Mr. Bratton has not had to decide whether and how to discipline an officer for a chokehold. There is no set time, after a trial, for the police commissioner to render his decision. In the previous administration, such decisions could take up to a year. The last time a person died from an apparent chokehold was 1994; Mr. Bratton was commissioner then as well. A federal jury eventually convicted the officer. At least one complaint reported to the department in 2014 has been substantiated so far: a case in February in the 77th Precinct in Brooklyn. In that case, the review board recommended charges. A trial has yet to be scheduled.

Questions: Where is the best place to make food? Options: - kitchen - supermarket - table - stomach - restaurant Answer:","output":"The best place to make food, considering the options provided, is undoubtedly the kitchen. The kitchen is specifically designed and equipped for the purpose of preparing and cooking food. It usually contains all the necessary appliances, tools, and surfaces required to make a variety of dishes, and is the hub of culinary activity in most households and commercial spaces. Compared to the other options you have provided, the kitchen is the most logical choice. Let's take a look at why the other options are less suitable: - Supermarket: While a supermarket is a great place to purchase ingredients for preparing and cooking food, it is not intended for the actual process of making food. Although some supermarkets may house small food preparation stations or delis, their primary function is to sell groceries and other goods, meaning their facilities for making food are limited. - Table: A table is generally used for serving and consuming food after it has been prepared. While it is possible to do some minor food preparation tasks on a table, such as cutting bread or assembling a sandwich, the limited space and lack of appropriate tools and appliances make it an unsuitable choice for cooking or making most dishes. - Stomach: The stomach serves an entirely different purpose in relation to food; it is responsible for breaking down the food we consume through the digestive process. Food has already been prepared and consumed by the time it reaches the stomach, so it cannot be considered a place where we make food. - Restaurant: Although a restaurant is a place where food is made and served, it is not accessible to everyone as it is often considered a commercial establishment, and therefore, not everyone can go into a restaurant kitchen and make their own food. The primary purpose of restaurants is to serve customers with prepared dishes, and not to provide a space for everyone to make their own food. In summary, a kitchen is the most appropriate choice for making food among the options given. It is specifically designed and equipped for food preparation and cooking, making it the optimal environment for creating a wide range of dishes and recipes. Other options either lack essential tools, appliances, or accessibility or serve entirely different purposes in our relationship with food."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Bob rested his bottom on a chair in the orchestra pit.

For Mother's Day last year, Kyle picked a dozen roses from his garden, but this year, he was only able to pick half the number of roses. If Kyle wants to give his mother a bouquet with twice as many roses as last year and the grocery store sells one rose for 3, how much would Kyle have to spend?","output":"To find out how much Kyle would have to spend this year, we can go through the following steps: Step 1: Determine the number of roses Kyle picked this year. Last year, Kyle picked a dozen roses, which equals 12 roses. This year he was only able to pick half the number of roses, so we divide 12 roses by 2: 12 roses / 2 = 6 roses Step 2: Determine the number of roses Kyle wants to give this year. Since Kyle wants to give his mother a bouquet with twice as many roses as last year, we have to multiply the number of roses from last year by 2: 12 roses * 2 = 24 roses Step 3: Determine the number of roses Kyle needs to buy from the grocery store. Kyle has 6 roses already. To reach 24 roses for the bouquet, we subtract the roses he already has from the desired total number of roses: 24 roses - 6 roses = 18 roses Step 4: Calculate the cost for buying 18 roses. The grocery store sells one rose for 3, so Kyle has to spend: 18 roses * 3 per rose = 54 So, Kyle would have to spend 54 to buy the additional 18 roses he needs for the bouquet."},{"instruction":"Select your answer from the options.

However, the rest of the tweet conveys that the speaker is frustrated about waiting for months and not receiving the car yet. The use of multiple exclamation points at the end seems to emphasize the negative feeling and highlights the dissatisfaction.

Couple picked Mia because 'they both liked the name', says spokesman. Zara gave birth to Mia last week but spent just six hours in hospital. The baby is 16th in line to the throne but does not hold a royal title. Article:","output":"Title: Rugby Icon Mike Tindall Reveals Baby's Name on Twitter: A New Royal Steps Into the Sun In a modern and candid manifestation of celebrity birth announcements, Mike Tindall, a former England rugby star, has taken to social media to share his joyous news with the world. Via Twitter, Tindall has revealed the name of his newborn daughter: Mia. On this digital platform, where fans are usually updated about the latest sports news and insightful commentaries, Mike introduced his newest family member, blending personal joys with public revelation. As representative of a younger, digitally savvy generation, Tindall's choice to release the news via Twitter excitingly diverged from traditional birth announcements associated with the British Royal family. The couple made the decision to name their newborn Mia, a joint decision driven by mutual admiration for the name, as expressed by their spokesman. Primarily Italian and Spanish in origin, 'Mia' can mean 'mine' or 'my own,' symbolizing the deep personal connection the new parents have with their baby girl. While celebrity birth announcements are nothing new in our social media era, this particular event goes beyond the usual excitement. The rugby union legend and his wife, Zara, herself an accomplished equestrian and the daughter of Princess Anne, are closely associated with the royal household. Zara, an esteemed Olympian, is the eldest granddaughter of Queen Elizabeth II, making their newborn not just the child of popular athletes but the latest addition to the long line of British royals. Mia was born last week, with Zara reportedly spending only six brief hours in the hospital post-delivery. This quick return to the comfort and privacy of the home environment reflects the couple's desire for an ordinary family life despite their extraordinary public persona. The new baby further strengthens the line of the British throne as she falls 16th in direct succession. However, unlike her royal cousins, she does not don a royal title. This intentional decision not to take a royal title is in line with her mother, Zara, who was also brought up without a title. Zara's parents, Anne and Captain Mark Phillips, rejected offers of titles, ensuring their children would not be bound by the same traditional protocol that comes with such privilege. Despite the ties with royalty, the Tindall’s seem to approach life and parenthood with a view for normalcy and the everyday joys of a regular family. The disclosure of the royal baby's name through Twitter depicts the evolving landscape of royal communications, demonstrating how the couple is embracing elements of modernity while still respecting royal tradition. The name 'Mia' may well become a hot choice amongst expectant parents around the world, as is usually seen with royal names. The charm undoubtedly lies in its simplicity and the deep affection invested in it by her famous and well-liked parents. In the meantime, as the world celebrates the arrival of Mia, the newborn will remain ensconced in the love of her family and the well wishes of millions worldwide. The future holds great promise for the toddler, who, despite being born into extraordinary circumstances, begins her journey amidst the same pure joy and jubilation experienced by all newborns."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What happens before the season of sacrifice?\\" Context: \\"The term Carnival is traditionally used in areas with a large Catholic presence. However, the Philippines, a predominantly Roman Catholic country, does not celebrate Carnival anymore since the dissolution of the Manila Carnival after 1939, the last carnival in the country. In historically Lutheran countries, the celebration is known as Fastelavn, and in areas with a high concentration of Anglicans and Methodists, pre-Lenten celebrations, along with penitential observances, occur on Shrove Tuesday. In Eastern Orthodox nations, Maslenitsa is celebrated during the last week before Great Lent. In German-speaking Europe and the Netherlands, the Carnival season traditionally opens on 11/11 (often at 11:11 a.m.). This dates back to celebrations before the Advent season or with harvest celebrations of St. Martin's Day.\\" Answer: Answer:","output":"Before the season of sacrifice, various pre-Lenten celebrations and traditions take place in different regions and cultures all around the world. Primarily observed in countries with strong Christian influences, these celebrations serve as an opportunity for people to engage in festivities and enjoy the pleasures of life before the rigorous fasting and penitential observances of the Lenten season. In areas with a large Roman Catholic presence, the pre-Lenten season is marked by Carnival, which involves elaborate costume parades, music, dancing, and indulgence in food and drink. The Carnival season traditionally begins on the Feast of the Epiphany (January 6), and culminates with the Mardi Gras (Shrove Tuesday or Fat Tuesday), the day before the first day of Lent (Ash Wednesday). However, in countries such as the Philippines, which is predominantly Roman Catholic, Carnival is no longer celebrated after the dissolution of the Manila Carnival in 1939. Instead, Filipinos observe their own unique way to prepare for the Lenten season, called \\"Pabasa\\" or \\"Pasyon\\", which is a recitation of the narrative of Christ's life, passion, and death. In historically Lutheran countries like Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, the pre-Lenten celebration is known as Fastelavn. Traditionally held on the Sunday or Monday seven weeks before Easter, Fastelavn typically involves children dressing up in costumes, exchanging colorful cards known as \\"fastelavnskort,\\" and participating in fun activities, such as hitting a barrel filled with sweets and goodies (similar to a piñata) until it breaks open. In areas with a high concentration of Anglicans and Methodists, pre-Lenten festivities occur on Shrove Tuesday, which involves indulging in rich, fatty foods like pancakes before the fasting of Lent begins. It is often associated with penitential observances and reflection, preparing oneself spiritually for the coming season of sacrifice. In Eastern Orthodox nations, such as Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, the pre-Lenten season is called Maslenitsa or \\"Butter Week.\\" Celebrated during the week before Great Lent, Maslenitsa involves colorful festivities, folk music, games, and the consumption of traditional pancakes called \\"blini,\\" which symbolize the sun. As a fusion of pagan and Christian traditions, this celebration serves as a precursor to the stricter fasting period and religious observances that follow during Great Lent. In German-speaking Europe and the Netherlands, the Carnival season typically opens on November 11 (often at 11:11 a.m.)—a date that dates back to celebrations held before the Advent season or harvest celebrations of St. Martin's Day. These festivities, also known as Fasching or Fastnacht, are marked by parades, costume parties, and other merrymaking activities before the somber tone of the Lenten season sets in. In conclusion, the time before the season of sacrifice is marked by various celebrations that differ according to cultural and religious backgrounds. These festivities allow people to engage in fun, merrymaking, and often indulgence before they embark on the solemn, reflective, and penitential observances of the Lenten period."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Ben had to decide between the city and the suburb. Ben chose the Select from the following. [I] city because it was lightly populated in traffic.. [II] suburb because it was lightly populated in traffic..","output":"II] Ben chose the suburb because it was lightly populated in traffic. Growing up in the hustle and bustle of the city, Ben had been exposed to noisy streets, polluted air, and overcrowded roads for as long as he could remember. As an introvert, he craved the serenity of a peaceful environment. This desire led him to research new towns and areas to relocate to. In his research, he discovered a charming suburb only an hour's drive from the city where he worked. With vast green spaces, an excellent school district, and considerably less traffic, it seemed like the perfect escape from the metropolitan chaos. Once he had made up his mind to relocate there, Ben began searching for a suitable house. He sought the help of a local real estate agent who provided him a list of available properties. After viewing a few moderately sized houses surrounded by beautiful gardens and friendly neighbors, he settled on one that felt like it could become a true home. A two-story, three-bedroom house with an inviting front porch and a spacious backyard, perfect for gardening and hosting family barbecues. Ben cherished his weekends spent exploring the new area: bicycling along peaceful lanes framed by towering oak trees, stopping by the local farmers' market to pick up fresh produce, and even joining an amateur gardening group to connect with like-minded individuals. Being able to inhale the fresh air and enjoy the sight of children playing safely in their front yards brought immeasurable joy to Ben's heart. The most significant positive change, however, was the noticeable decline in traffic. With fewer cars populating the streets and less air pollution clouding the skies, Ben's overall quality of life improved. The shorter commute to work meant less stress and more free time to pursue his hobbies, like jogging along the scenic suburban trails and picking up landscape photography as a creative outlet. The tranquility of the area was soul-soothing and allowed him to recharge his batteries after work, away from the constant distractions of city living. Living in the suburb also offered a great opportunity for Ben to be more involved in his community. The tight-knit neighborhoods welcomed him with open arms, inviting him to participate in local events and helping him build lasting connections. From volunteering at the community library to organizing charity bake sales, Ben found a sense of belonging in his new surroundings. As the years passed, Ben's love for his suburban oasis continued to deepen. He eventually married and had children, and the suburb proved to be an excellent place for them to grow up. Access to excellent schools, sports clubs, and various extracurricular activities allowed his children to create lasting memories and enrich their lives. Of course, Ben never entirely gave up his connection to the city. His job still required him to commute, and he visited friends and family who remained there. But the relief of returning to the serene suburb after a long workday in the city reinforced his belief that he had made the right choice. In choosing a less congested life over the crowded city, Ben discovered greater happiness and rejuvenation in the calm and friendly suburb. It offered him tranquility, improved his well-being, and allowed him to enjoy his life in a way he had never been able to before. The suburb, once a distant unknown, became the sanctuary he never knew he needed, and a place where he could truly call home."},{"instruction":"The institute says 20% of young people smoke before the age of 15. Translate to Romanian","output":"Institutul afirmă că 20% dintre tineri fumează înainte de vârsta de 15 ani. În această declarație, Institutul pune accentul pe nivelul îngrijorător de fumători tineri care încep să fumeze înainte de vârsta de 15 ani, ceea ce poate avea implicații serioase pentru sănătatea lor pe termen lung. Aceasta ar trebui să fie o zonă de preocupare pentru autoritățile și societatea în ansamblu. Cercetările în domeniu sugerează că începerea fumatului la vârste atât de fragede contribuie la dezvoltarea dependenței de nicotină și a altor probleme de sănătate. De asemenea, se știe că fumătorii tineri au riscuri mai mari să facă abuz de alcool și droguri. Una din cauzele principale pentru care tinerii încep să fumeze la vârste fragede este presiunea din partea prietenilor din același grup de vârstă și a celor mai mari. Ei văd în fumat o modalitate de a se integra într-un grup și de a părea \\"cool\\". Acesta este motivul pentru care campaniile de prevenire și educație, precum și abordarea fenomenului de publicitate la produsele de tutun, sunt esențiale pentru a împiedica tinerii să înceapă să fumeze. Alte aspecte care pot influența fumatul în rândul tinerilor au legătură cu cultura și mediul în care trăiesc. De exemplu, dacă un adolescent are un membru al familiei care fumează, este posibil să își dorească să încerce și el, dând dovadă de imitație. Pentru a combate acest fenomen, este important ca societatea să ofere modele pozitive tinerilor în ceea ce privește comportamentul față de fumat și să promoveze discuții sănătoase despre riscurile și efectele pe termen lung ale acestui obicei. De asemenea, ar trebui să ne concentrăm pe promovarea bunăstării emoționale și pe ridicarea încrederii în sine a tinerilor, pentru ca aceștia să fie capabili să reziste presiunilor sociale care îi pot influența să înceapă să fumeze. În concluzie, afirmația institutului potrivit căreia 20% dintre tineri fumează înainte de vârsta de 15 ani evidențiază problema gravă a fumatului în rândul tinerilor și necesitatea de a întreprinde demersuri pentru a-i educa și proteja pe aceștia împotriva efectelor negative ale fumatului asupra sănătății."},{"instruction":"Generate an approximately fifteen-word sentence that describes all this data: Asam pedas REGION \\"Sumatra and Malay Peninsula\\"","output":"Asam pedas, a sour and spicy dish, originates from Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula, showcasing the regions' vibrant culinary flavors."},{"instruction":"The actual day was rainy and glum and fell on a Wednesday , when I have class from 3:00 - 10:00 - yuck .

And I was wondering What will happen to the audience?","output":"When a comedian, in this case, Quinn, experiences a poor performance and is booed off the stage at a comedy club, there are several possible outcomes for the audience. It's essential to consider that every comedy club and its management may handle such situations differently. Here are some probable scenarios: 1. Replacement Act: The host, emcee, or management may choose to bring on another comedian or act to try to lift the audience's spirits and ensure they have a better experience for the rest of the show. 2. Apology and Assurance: The host or management may apologize for the subpar performance, acknowledging that it wasn't up to the standard the audience deserves. They might also assure the audience of their commitment to bringing better comedians in the future shows. 3. Shortened Show: If there are no additional acts to fill the time slot, the comedy show might end earlier than planned. The management might or might not compensate the audience depending on their policies. 4. Audience Reaction: Some audience members may express their dissatisfaction by talking to the management, leaving the venue earlier than the show ends, or writing negative reviews online. Others may be empathetic with the comedian, understanding that everyone can have an off night. 5. Compensatory Actions (depending on the club's policies): Some comedy clubs may offer discounts on future shows, complimentary appetizers or drinks, or a similar incentive to compensate for the unsatisfactory experience. This gesture aims to retain customers and maintain a positive reputation despite the unpleasant event. Ultimately, the audience's experience will depend on the management's actions, and how they choose to address the situation. Every comedy club has its unique ways of handling less-than-ideal experiences, but it's reasonable to expect some action to acknowledge the audience's dissatisfaction and attempt to restore their trust in the club's ability to provide quality entertainment."},{"instruction":"Economic and political migrations made an impact across the empire.

Problem: sachin is younger than rahul by 4 years . if their ages are in the respective ratio of 7 : 9 , how old is sachin ? Options: a ) 24.9 , b ) 24.6 , c ) 24.2 , d ) 24.8 , e ) 24.5","output":"The task is asking for the age of a person named Sachin, given certain conditions related to his age and the age of another person, Rahul. Guidelines: 1. We are told that Sachin is younger by 4 years than Rahul. 2. Their ages are in the ratio 7:9. Using these guidelines, this problem can be tackled by applying the concepts of ratios and simple algebra. Step 1: Let's take the ratio of the ages of Sachin and Rahul to be 7x and 9x respectively. This is because we know their ages are in the ratio of 7:9, but we don't yet know the exact ages. Step 2: We know that Rahul is 4 years older than Sachin, which gives us the equation 9x = 7x + 4. Step 3: To solve this equation, reduce it by subtracting 7x from both sides, which gives us 2x = 4. Step 4: To find the value of x, divide the equation by 2, which gives x = 2. Step 5: Now, substitute x = 2 into the term for Sachin's age, which is 7x. This gives us Sachin's age as 7*2 = 14. So Sachin is 14 years old. However, none of the provided options matches this answer, which means there might be an error in either the problem statement or the options.

So, 19 - 15 is equal to 4. Now, our equation looks like this: n + 4 = 0 To find the value of n, we need to move the 4 to the other side of the equation. We can do that by subtracting 4 from both sides. So, n + 4 - 4 = 0 - 4 The 4's on the left side cancel each other out, leaving us with: n = -4 So, the solution for n in this equation is -4.

Article: Money spent on advertising is money spent as well as any I know of. It serves directly to assist a rapid distribution of goods at reasonable prices, thereby establishing a firm home market and so making it possible to provide for export at competitive prices. By drawing attention to new ideas it helps enormously to raise standards of living. By helping to increase demand it ensures an increased need for labor, and is therefore an effective way to fight unemployment. It lowers the costs of many services: without advertisements your daily newspaper would cost four times as much, the price of your television license would need to be doubled, and travel by bus or tube would cost 20 per cent more. And perhaps most important of all, advertising provides a guarantee of reasonable value in the products and services you buy. Apart from the fact that twenty-seven Acts of Parliament govern the terms of advertising, no regular advertiser dare promote a product that fails to live up to the promise of his advertisements. He might fool some people for a little while through misleading advertising. He will not do so for long, for mercifully the public has the good sense not to buy the inferior article more than once. If you see an article consistently advertised, it is the surest proof I know that the article does what is claimed for it, and that it represents good value.

First, we'll find the amount each person invested for the total duration of the year, which is 12 months. Step 1: Calculate the total amount invested by x for 12 months. x invested rs. 45000 for the whole year (12 months) so the investment made by x can be represented as: 45000 * 12 Step 2: Calculate the total amount invested by y for the remaining 8 months. y joined the business after 4 months, so y invested for 8 months (12 months in a year - 4 months). The investment made by y can be represented as: 30000 * 8 Step 3: Calculate the ratio of the investments x : y. The investment ratio can be calculated as (investment by x) : (investment by y). (45000 * 12) : (30000 * 8) Now, we can simplify the ratio by dividing both sides by the common factors.

Powerful yet refined, each swing allowed him to gain momentum, warming up his muscles and syncing his rhythm to the silent beat of his heart. As his speed increased, onlookers watched with bated breath, their own hearts keeping pace with the increasing tempo of his swings. Unfazed by the attention, the gymnast commenced a sequence of flips. He executed them with a graceful flair that showcased not just his technical prowess and physical strength, but also his fluidity and mastery over his motions. With each acrobatic feat, his audience could not help but marvel at the blend of power, precision, and balance that he embodied. Drumming up to the climax of his routine, he transitioned into a handstand. As he hoisted his body up, his muscles rippled and flexed, giving testament to the years of disciplined training each stance demanded. In the face of gravity's pull, he suspended himself in the air, the only points of contact with reality being the palms of his hands clutching the bars. Staying in that position for a few breathtaking moments, he perfectly maintained the delicate equilibrium; a visual epitome of the balance between strength and control. During these moments, his concentration was unbroken, every fiber of his being was focused, and his resolve was absolute. Then, with a final swift motion, he uncurled himself from the handstand. In one fluid movement, he swung downward, releasing his grip at the optimal moment to launch himself skyward. He completed a final twist in mid-air before his feet contacted the mat with a reassuring thud, signaling the end of the routine. His dismount was as much a part of his performance as all the other tricks he flawlessly executed. Panting, he stood upright, offering a courteous bow to his expectant audience and judges. Confidently, he marked the end of his routine, leaving a moment of silence that was shortly shattered by the uproar of applause. The young gymnast had just transformed the arena into a stage, his every move choreographed and performed with the elegance of a dance and the strength of a fight.

Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro \\"Matz\\" Matsumoto in Japan. According to its creator, Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including functional, object-oriented, and imperative. It also has a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. Ruby was conceived on February 24, 1993. In a 1999 post to the \\"ruby-talk\\" mailing list, Ruby author Yukihiro Matsumoto describes some of his early ideas about the language: Matsumoto describes the design of Ruby as being like a simple Lisp language at its core, with an object system like that of Smalltalk, blocks inspired by higher-order functions, and practical utility like that of Perl. The name \\"Ruby\\" originated during an online chat session between Matsumoto and Keiju Ishitsuka on February 24, 1993, before any code had been written for the language. Initially two names were proposed: \\"Coral\\" and \\"Ruby\\". Matsumoto chose the latter in a later e-mail to Ishitsuka. Matsumoto later noted a factor in choosing the name \\"Ruby\\" – it was the birthstone of one of his colleagues. The first public release of Ruby 0.95 was announced on Japanese domestic newsgroups on December 21, 1995. Subsequently, three more versions of Ruby were released in two days.

While it is true that Jay Kahn is a Democratic member of the New Hampshire Senate representing the 10th district, one cannot definitively ascertain whether or not he will choose to live in the 10th district after retirement. It is important to consider that personal choices and circumstances may change significantly over time, especially as individuals transition from a professional to a retired lifestyle. There is always the possibility that Jay Kahn would decide to stay in the 10th district after retirement, as he may have grown attached to the region he represents and formed strong connections with its residents. Additionally, he may be proud of the work he accomplished while in office and feel a sense of responsibility towards the area. In this situation, if he chooses to stay, it would be reasonable to hypothesize that he may continue to contribute to the community in a more informal capacity, given his knowledge of local issues and relationships with community members. On the other hand, it is equally plausible that Jay Kahn will choose to move elsewhere after retiring from the New Hampshire Senate. His retirement plans might include relocating to a different region or state altogether for various reasons. For example, he might choose to live closer to family members or friends, move to a location with a more desirable climate, or pursue various personal hobbies or interests that could be better accommodated in a different area. Moreover, it is worth noting that people may prioritize different factors in their retirement decisions, including factors unrelated to their previous work or affiliations. In conclusion, while Jay Kahn's career as a Democratic member of the New Hampshire Senate for the 10th district could potentially be an influential factor in his retirement plans, it is ultimately impossible to definitively predict his choice based on the context provided. Therefore, the hypothesis that Jay Kahn will live in the 10th district after retirement cannot be confirmed nor denied with certainty."},{"instruction":"Robert Dennis Crumb (; born August 30, 1943) is an American cartoonist and musician who often signs his work R. Crumb. His work displays a nostalgia for American folk culture of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and satire of contemporary American culture. Crumb is a prolific artist and contributed to many of the seminal works of the underground comix movement in the 1960s, including being a founder of the first successful underground comix publication, Zap Comix, contributing to all 16 issues. He was additionally contributing to the East Village Other and many other publications, including a variety of one-off and anthology comics. Crumb's father gave him 40 when he left home after high school. His first job, in 1962, was drawing novelty greeting cards for American Greetings in Cleveland, Ohio. He stayed with the company for four years, producing hundreds of cards for the company's Hi-Brow line; his superiors had him draw in a cuter style that was to leave a footprint on his work throughout his career. In Cleveland he met a group of young bohemians such as Buzzy Linhart, Liz Johnston, and Harvey Pekar. Dissatisfied with greeting card work, he tried to sell cartoons to comic book companies, who showed little interest in his work. In 1965, cartoonist Harvey Kurtzman printed some of Crumb's work in the humor magazine he edited, Help!. Crumb moved to New York, intending to work with Kurtzman, but Help! ceased publication shortly after. Crumb briefly illustrated bubblegum cards for Topps before returning to Cleveland and American Greetings. Crumb married Dana Morgan in 1964. Nearly destitute, the couple traveled in Europe, during which Crumb continued to produce work for Kurtzman and American Greetings, and Dana stole food. The relationship was unstable as Crumb frequently went his own way, and he was not close to his son Jesse (b. 1965). In 1965 and 1966 Crumb had a number of Fritz the Cat strips published in the men's magazine Cavalier. Fritz had appeared in Crumb's work as early as the late 1950s; he was to become a hipster, scam artist, and bohemian until Crumb abandoned the character in 1969. Crumb was becoming increasingly uncomfortable with his job and marriage when in June 1965 he began taking LSD, a psychedelic drug that was then still legal. He had both good and bad trips. One bad trip left him in a muddled state for half a year, during which for a time he left Dana; the state ended when the two took a strong dose of the drug together in April 1966. Crumb created a number of his best-known characters during his years of LSD use, including Mr. Natural, Angelfood McSpade, and the Snoid. Was Fritz a character he developed?","output":"Yes, Fritz the Cat was a character developed by Robert Crumb. Fritz first appeared in Crumb's work as early as the late 1950s.

Fritz the Cat gained significant popularity and was an important part of Crumb's body of work until he decided to abandon the character in 1969. Fritz the Cat is known for its satirical and provocative content, often reflecting the social and cultural issues of the time. The character played a crucial role in establishing Crumb's reputation as a groundbreaking and influential artist in the underground comix movement. In addition to Fritz the Cat, Crumb is also known for creating other memorable characters like Mr. Natural, Angelfood McSpade, and the Snoid, many of which were developed during his years of LSD use.

Use these to refer to something that is physically nearby. Use these to describe when something is figuratively nearby. Use these to introduce people to others.\\" Article:","output":"Title: A Comprehensive Guide to Using Pronouns, Demonstratives and Figurative Language to Replace Nouns Introduction Language is a dynamic and flexible tool that allows us to communicate our thoughts and ideas efficiently. One such means of achieving precision in language is through the use of pronouns, demonstratives, and figurative language. In this article, we will explore how these linguistic devices can replace nouns and create a more engaging and meaningful conversational experience. Specifically, we will discuss the use of pronouns and demonstratives in the context of spatial and temporal proximity, the use of figurative language in expressing abstract concepts, and the art of introducing people to others. Using Pronouns and Demonstratives to Replace Nouns Pronouns and demonstratives are essential for maintaining clarity and coherence in language. They help to avoid redundancy and make sentences easier to follow. Here, we will examine the role of pronouns and demonstratives in terms of spatial and temporal proximity. 1. Spatial proximity: One of the primary functions of demonstratives is to indicate the location of a particular noun. The words \\"this,\\" \\"these,\\" \\"that,\\" and \\"those\\" are used to replace nouns that are physically nearby. For example, if you are shopping with a friend and want to point out a dress that caught your eye, you can say, \\"Look at this dress!\\" Here, the demonstrative \\"this\\" replaces the noun \\"dress\\" and indicates that the dress is near you. 2. Temporal proximity: Pronouns and demonstratives can also be used to replace nouns that are closely related to the current topic of conversation or time frame. In these cases, the words \\"this,\\" \\"these,\\" \\"that,\\" and \\"those\\" are used to refer to something happening in the recent past or near future. For example, if you are discussing last weekend's events with a friend, you could say, \\"That party was so much fun.\\" In this sentence, the demonstrative \\"that\\" replaces the noun \\"party\\" and refers to an event that took place in the recent past. Using Figurative Language to Describe Abstract Concepts Figurative language, such as metaphors and similes, can be used effectively to describe abstract concepts by comparing them to something more concrete. This comparison allows the listener to better grasp an idea that is not immediately obvious or is more complex in nature. Consider the following sentence: \\"Her voice was like warm honey, soothing and sweet.\\" In this case, the simile creates a mental association between the speaker's voice and the tactile and sensory qualities of warm honey, providing a clear image of how pleasant and comforting her voice might be. Utilizing Language to Introduce People Introductions hold a significant social function, and using appropriate language is key to creating a positive first impression and building rapport between individuals. Establishing common ground and highlighting shared interests or connections can foster a sense of camaraderie and promote a congenial atmosphere. For example, when introducing two colleagues at a networking event, you could say, \\"Alice, meet Steve. Steve is our new marketing manager with a background in architecture like yours. I thought the two of you would get along well since you both enjoy exploring historical sites.\\" In this introduction, the shared background and interests are the focus, instantly creating an opportunity for the individuals to connect. Conclusion Incorporating pronouns, demonstratives, and figurative language into your communication can greatly enhance your ability to convey meaningful ideas and create clear, engaging conversations. By understanding the importance of spatial and temporal proximity in language, using figurative language to describe abstract concepts, and mastering the art of introducing people, you can elevate your interactions and foster a deeper sense of connection with those around you."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

They discuss the aftermath of Treadstone and decide to launch Operation Blackbriar, a top-secret program designed to create the ultimate espionage agents. The program's success lies with its ability to create agents who are not only skilled in combat, intelligence gathering, and deception, but also equipped with advanced technology and an unwavering loyalty to carry out their missions, no matter the cost. Enter James Carter (JC), a highly decorated Navy SEAL, who is recruited to be the first operative in the Blackbriar program. Chosen for his exceptional mental and physical abilities, JC undergoes rigorous training, both physically and mentally, pushing him to his breaking point. This includes learning various martial arts, advanced weaponry, cyber warfare, and mastering multiple languages. During his training, JC befriends two other Blackbriar recruits, Sarah Walker, an expert in communications and cryptography, and David Martinez, a former Green Beret with an unmatched talent for infiltration. As their training progresses, the trio builds a strong bond, but they're warned not to form any emotional attachments, given the nature of the work they will be doing. On completion of their training, JC and his team are sent on their maiden mission to eastern Europe. They must infiltrate a heavily guarded research facility controlled by a rogue terrorist group planning to weaponize a deadly virus. The team faces various challenges along the way, including dealing with high-level security systems, hidden tunnels, and well-trained enemy operatives. During the mission, JC uncovers evidence that links the terrorist group to another covert government organization. As he digs deeper, the complexity of the operation increases, and he realizes that Operation Blackbriar is involved in a global conspiracy entailing corruption, betrayal, and manipulation. As they complete their mission and successfully neutralize the virus, JC, Sarah, and David begin to question the true intentions of the Blackbriar program, questioning their own role in the ever-evolving web of subterfuge. Meanwhile, another Blackbriar team is dispatched to eliminate JC and his team, who are now deemed liabilities for knowing too much about the program's secrets. The climax of the movie involves JC and his team racing against time to gather evidence to expose Operation Blackbriar before they become targets themselves. They must dodge an elite squad of Blackbriar assassins as they navigate the treacherous world of international espionage, trying to piece together the puzzle and bring those responsible to justice. In the final revelation, it becomes apparent that the government officials who created Operation Blackbriar are part of a global shadow organization with its tentacles in all major international institutions. JC and his team uncover a plot to destabilize nations and foster chaos that can be manipulated for geopolitical advantage, economic gain, and social engineering. The nail-biting conclusion sees JC, Sarah, and David risking everything to bring the shadow organization's immoral machinations to light, even at the price of potentially sacrificing their lives. United by friendship and loyalty, they fight to not only bring down Operation Blackbriar but also expose the larger network that threatens global stability. 'Blackbriar Resurgence' is a thrilling spy-action movie that explores themes of loyalty, betrayal, and the ambiguous nature of power. With sleek action sequences, unexpected twists, and intricate character dynamics, audiences will be kept on the edge of their seats as they follow JC and his team on their mission to uncover the truth behind Operation Blackbriar."},{"instruction":"Grandaddy is an American indie rock band from Modesto, California. The group was formed in 1992, and featured Jason Lytle, Aaron Burtch, Jim Fairchild, Kevin Garcia and Tim Dryden. After several self-released records and cassettes, the band signed to Will Records in the US and later the V2 subsidiary Big Cat Records in the UK, going on to sign an exclusive deal with V2. The bulk of the band's recorded output was the work of Lytle, who worked primarily in home studios. Grandaddy was formed in 1992 by singer, guitarist and keyboardist Jason Lytle, bassist Kevin Garcia and drummer Aaron Burtch. The group was initially influenced by US punk bands such as Suicidal Tendencies and Bad Brains. Lytle was a former professional skateboarder, who had turned to music after a knee injury forced him to stop skating, working at a sewage treatment works to fund the purchase of equipment, and several of the band's early live performances were at skateboarding competitions. The band members constructed a studio at the Lytle family home, and the band's first release was the self-produced cassette Complex Party Come Along Theories in April 1994. Singles \\"Could This Be Love\\" and \\"Taster\\" followed later that year. In 1995, guitarist Jim Fairchild (another ex-pro-skater who had guested with the band before) and keyboardist Tim Dryden joined the band. A second cassette, Don't Sock the Tryer was withdrawn, with the band instead releasing debut mini-album A Pretty Mess by This One Band in April 1996 on the Seattle-based Will label. In 1997 they released their debut full-length album Under the Western Freeway, and, with the help of Howe Gelb, signed a UK deal with Big Cat Records (by then a subsidiary of V2), who reissued the album the following year. The album included the single \\"A.M. 180\\", which was featured during a sequence in the 2002 British film 28 Days Later. It was also used for the theme song for the BBC Four television series Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe, and in an advertisement for Colin Murray's BBC Radio 1 show. \\"A.M. 180\\" was also used in television commercials for the Dodge Journey automobile. One of the album's singles, \\"Summer Here Kids\\", was rated as \\"Single of the Week\\" by popular British music magazine NME, and was also used as the theme music for another Charlie Brooker-fronted show, BBC Radio 4's So Wrong It's Right. The album led to an increase in the band's popularity in Europe, and a main stage performance at the Reading Festival in 1998. The album was only a success in the US when later reissued by V2. With the band busy touring in 1999, their next release was the compilation The Broken Down Comforter Collection.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: How did they get together?","output":"Grandaddy was formed in 1992 by singer, guitarist and keyboardist Jason Lytle, bassist Kevin Garcia and drummer Aaron Burtch.

Options: - Sentence A: \\"He drove his sock.\\" - Sentence B: \\"He drove his car.\\" A: Sentence A Explain how we arrive at this answer:","output":"We arrive at this answer by examining both sentences and determining which one contradicts our understanding of the objects involved and their expected behavior. Sentence A: \\"He drove his sock.\\" - In this sentence, the verb \\"drove\\" implies that the object (the sock) is being used as a mode of transportation. As per our common sense, socks are items of clothing worn on the feet, not vehicles or means of transportation. This statement contradicts our understanding of how socks are used. Sentence B: \\"He drove his car.\\" - In this sentence, the verb \\"drove\\" refers to the operation of a vehicle (the car). It makes sense because cars are designed as modes of transportation, and driving them is a common activity. This statement aligns with our understanding of cars and their purpose. Since Sentence A (\\"He drove his sock\\") contradicts common sense, it is the correct choice as the sentence that goes against common sense."},{"instruction":"Fifty-seven senators , including 24 Republicans , have signed the letter .

He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party. Roland reluctantly stepped forward with the other crusaders. His longsword and dagger swung heavy at his waist. He wore them only because, as a knight, he was expected to.

They meet Mathias (Joe Anderson), a German tourist, who is looking for his brother Heinrich. His last known location is an archaeological dig at a remote Mayan ruin in the jungle. They are also joined by Dimitri (Dimitri Baveas), Mathias's friend. The group reaches the ruins of a Mayan temple, and are confronted by Mayan villagers with guns and bows. Mathias tries to explain their purpose, but the villagers do not understand Spanish or English. When Amy accidentally touches some vines the villagers become increasingly agitated. Dimitri approaches the villagers, hoping to appease them, but they shoot and kill him. The rest of the group flees up the steps of the ruins. At the top, they find an abandoned camp and a shaft in the center. The group cannot call for help since Eric's phone has no signal. They hear a cell phone ringing from somewhere inside the ruins. Believing it is Heinrich's phone ringing, the rest of the group lowers Mathias down the shaft with a rope. The rope breaks and Mathias falls, becoming completely paralyzed. Amy and Jeff descend the temple steps hoping to reason with the Mayans, but to no success. In anger, Amy throws a clump of vines at them and hits a young boy, whom the Mayans promptly kill. They realize the Mayans are afraid of the vines, and won't let them go since they have touched them. Later, Stacy and Amy descend the shaft to help Mathias and to find the phone. Jeff and Eric rig a backboard and bring Mathias out of the shaft. The next morning, Stacy sees a tendril of vine has crept into a wound on her leg. The vines have also wrapped themselves around Mathias's lower legs and eaten them down to the bone. Eric and Jeff are barely able to remove the vines from Stacy but cannot get them off of Mathias.

Under Keynesian economics macroeconomic trends can overwhelm economic choices made by individuals. Governments should promote aggregate demand for goods as a means to encourage economic expansion. Following World War II, Milton Friedman created the concept of monetarism. Monetarism focuses on using the supply and demand of money as a method for controlling economic activity. In the 1970s, monetarism has adapted into supply-side economics which advocates reducing taxes as a means to increase the amount of money available for economic expansion. Question: What did John Maynard Keynes want to separate?","output":"John Maynard Keynes wanted to separate the study of economics into two distinct branches: microeconomics and macroeconomics. This division was prompted in the 1920s, as Keynes sought to emphasize the importance of analyzing the economy on different levels, focusing on distinct aspects in order to better understand and manage economic activities. Microeconomics deals with the analysis of individual economic units such as households and firms, investigating the way they make decisions, interact with each other, and allocate their resources in response to supply and demand. By studying microeconomics, one can gain insights into the behavior of consumers, producers, and market structures, as well as the factors that determine the prices of individual goods and services. Macroeconomics, on the other hand, concentrates on the study of the economy as a whole, examining the behavior and interaction of various aggregate variables, such as national income, employment, inflation, and monetary and fiscal policies. In Keynesian economics, macroeconomic trends are viewed as having significant influence and can often overwhelm the economic choices made by individuals. Consequently, Keynes believed that governments should intervene to promote aggregate demand for goods, aiming to encourage economic expansion and stabilize the economy during recessions and depressions. This separation between microeconomics and macroeconomics enabled economists to focus on different aspects of economic reality, and to develop various theories and policy recommendations based on the specific features of each branch. With this distinction, Keynes paved the way for the establishment of macroeconomic theory and the subsequent development of other economic schools of thought, such as monetarism and supply-side economics, which evolved throughout the 20th century."},{"instruction":"Given the rationale, provide a reasonable question and answer.

Davey Gillen, a new IRA prisoner, arrives; he is categorised as a \\"non-conforming prisoner\\" for his refusal to wear the prison uniform. He is sent to his cell naked with only a blanket. His cellmate, Gerry, has smeared the walls with faeces from floor to ceiling as part of the no wash protest. The two men get to know each other and we see them living within the cell. Gerry's girlfriend sneaks a radio in by wrapping it and keeping it in her vagina. Prison officers forcibly and violently remove the prisoners from their cells and beat them before pinning them down to cut their long hair and beards, grown as part of the no-wash protest. The prisoners resist, Sands spitting into Lohan's face, who responds by punching him in the face and then swings again, only to miss and punch the wall, causing his knuckles to bleed. He cuts Sands' hair and beard; the men throw Sands in the bathtub and scrub him clean before hauling him away again. Lohan is then seen smoking a cigarette, as in the opening scenes, his hand bloodied. Later, the prisoners are taken out of their cells and given second-hand civilian clothing. The guards are seen snickering as they are handed to the prisoners who respond, after Sands' initial action, by tearing up the clothes and wrecking their cells. For the next interaction with the prisoners, a large number of riot police are seen coming into the prison on a truck. They line up and beat their batons against their shields and scream to scare the prisoners, who are hauled from their cells, then forced to run the gauntlet between the lines of riot police where they are beaten with the batons by at least 10 men at one time.

Think carefully first, then make a decision:","output":"In the United States, the minimum age to enlist in the military is 17 years old, with parental consent, or 18 years old without needing parental consent. So, while it is technically possible for someone who is still legally considered a child (under the age of 18) to become a soldier in the US Army, they must at least be 17 years old and have permission from their parents or guardians. That said, the enlistment age limit of 17 years old is in place to ensure that potential soldiers are mature enough to make appropriate decisions and handle the rigors of military service. Additionally, the US military adheres to international standards, such as the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict, which establishes 18 as the minimum age for direct participation in hostilities. Consequently, even if a 17-year-old is allowed to enlist, they would not be sent into combat until they reach the age of 18. In summary, while it is technically possible for a 17-year-old to be classified as a child and be a soldier in the US Army, strict regulations and age requirements are in place to ensure the safety and well-being of both the individual and the military as a whole."},{"instruction":"What is the missing first step of the following process: - Enters the lungs - The oxygen fills the sacs in your lungs - Carbon dioxide is removed from the lungs and exhaled - The oxygen is pass throughout your body.

In this case, the keywords are \\"inspiring,\\" \\"Hallmark card,\\" and \\"ultimately.\\" 2. Analyze the keywords: Next, I will analyze the meaning of these keywords in the context of the sentence: a. \\"inspiring\\" - This word generally has a positive connotation, as it suggests that something is motivating or uplifting. b. \\"Hallmark card\\" - Hallmark cards are generally intended to convey positive emotions like love, appreciation, or congratulations. They are often associated with sentimental vibes, but can sometimes be seen as generic or predictable in nature. c. \\"ultimately\\" - This word implies that the sentence is making a conclusive statement about the film's overall impact or message. 3. Evaluate the sentiment: Based on the combination of these keywords within the sentence, I will evaluate the sentiment: a. The sentence states that the film is as inspiring as a Hallmark card, which suggests that the film does possess some level of emotional or motivational impact. This can be perceived as somewhat positive. b. However, it is important to note that the comparison with a Hallmark card may also imply that the inspiring aspect of the film is somewhat predictable or lacks depth. This may or may not carry a mild negative connotation, depending on how the reader interprets the comparison. 4.

Choose your answer from: (A). can tear tissue ; (B). can stregthen tissue ;","output":"The correct answer is (B). can strengthen tissue. Nails are a part of our body that help in various tasks, like picking up small objects, scratching, and providing support to our fingers and toes. If we want to accomplish the goal of having strong and healthy nails, it is important that they strengthen the tissue around them rather than damaging it. Answer (A). can tear tissue is incorrect because tearing the tissue would not be helpful in achieving the goal of strong nails. If the tissue around the nails gets damaged, it may cause pain and discomfort, and would make our nails weaker. Therefore, it's better to have nails that can strengthen tissue, as described in Answer (B)."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence about this data: Chicago, leader, Rahm Emanuel.

The sun had just begun to rise, casting soft, golden rays of light through the dense forest that surrounded the village, creating a hauntingly beautiful sight. This picturesque scene was the setting for a momentous event that would change the lives of everyone involved forever. The pace and tone of this story were made abundantly clear from the very beginning with an intense, exhilarating fight scene set within these enchanting woods. Young Wah-jee and his wise, doting Uncle, had stumbled upon sinister secrets that put their lives in grave danger. Forced to flee from their home in the village, they found themselves in a heart-pounding chase from a gang of ruthless fighters led by the notorious warlord Mien Tsu-mun. As they desperately tried to escape his clutches, every step they took led them deeper and deeper into the labyrinthine forest. The tumultuous confrontation left Wah-jee battered and bruised, but being the resilient, resourceful individual that he was, he managed to emerge victorious and escape to safety. Now on the run, Wah-jee found refuge in a peaceful and secluded temple. Seeing that he was in desperate need of help, the benevolent monks took him in and nursed him back to health. Once Wah-jee had recovered, he was put to work at the temple completing various chores. Among them, he was tasked with making soy milk runs into town and cleaning out the temple's smoke-filled oven. Through these daily tasks, he began to find solace in the steady rhythm of monastic life. The tireless days spent laboring for the community humbled him and taught him the value of unity and the importance of empathy. As the weeks went by, Wah-jee learned a great deal about the teachings of the temple and grew close to the other monks. Word of his conflict with Mien Tsu-mun had spread amongst the townspeople, and he became known as a courageous and valiant defender of justice. It was during this time of growing fame that he crossed paths with Tsui-jee—the daughter of the enigmatic and often feared Huang. Huang was once a prominent figure in the village that Wah-jee had fled, but he had been pulled from his position of power by Tsui-jee's father due to their opposing beliefs. Tragedy struck when Wah-jee discovered that the silver-haired fighter who had taken his father's life belonged to the same group as Tsu-mun. Hungry for vengeance, he immediately connected the dots and realized that both Mien Tsu-mun and the silver-haired fighter were part of a larger, more insidious group that sought to conquer the whole region. With this revelation, Wah-jee's journey transformed from a personal quest for survival into a larger mission to save his village, as well as the surrounding communities, from the clutches of Mien Tsu-mun and his band of merciless warriors. Now armed with a renewed sense of purpose, his newfound companions, and the skills he had honed at the temple, Wah-jee embarked on a thrilling and action-packed journey to take down the menacing Mien Tsu-mun and his dangerous associates. Through cunning and bravery, Wah-jee tracked down the silver-haired fighter and, in an epic showdown, avenged his father's death. With each ally he vanquished, his strength and determination increased. Finally, he found himself face-to-face with the man who had caused him so much agony—Mien Tsu-mun. As they engaged in a ferocious, pulse-pounding battle, the forces of good and evil clashed in their final, decisive confrontation. Twists and turns punctuated each moment, as the fate of the entire region teetered on the edge of a knife. In the end, it was Wah-jee who emerged triumphantly, having brought a sense of hope and justice to his people. Battered but not broken, Wah-jee returned to the temple to share his tale of courage, love, and perseverance. His journey had revealed the true essence of what it meant to be a hero, and his revolution that had begun in the heart of a dense, hallowed forest concluded in the hearts of the men, women, and children who called this picturesque village home."},{"instruction":"Teacher:In this task, you are given a paper review.

The group released four studio albums between 1992 and 2002, which sold more than 30 million copies worldwide, making it the third-most successful Swedish band of all time, after ABBA and Roxette. Happy Nation (reissued as The Sign) is one of the best-selling debut albums of all time, and was certified nine times platinum in the United States. Context: Ace of Base released its fourth studio album, Da Capo, on September 30, 2002, in Europe, and in Japan through Toshiba EMI with a different cover and three bonus tracks. The album had originally been planned for release in mid-2000, but was repeatedly postponed due to record company complications. The album received only a soft release in the United Kingdom and was not released in America or Australia, though a release was planned for the United States in 2003. The album is named for the musical term da capo, which translates as \\"back to the beginning\\". It was intended to be a return to the band's earliest sound. Although the album entered the album charts in many European countries, it was not as successful as previous releases. Only Jenny and Ulf went on a promotional tour of Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Germany, Poland and Austria. Jonas didn't attend promotional activities because \\"it was better to be two then\\" because it led to \\"less questions\\" about Linn's lack of participation. Linn attended only one performance in Germany, which was her last public appearance. The first single release from the Da Capo album was \\"Beautiful Morning\\", which peaked at No.14 in Sweden and No. 38 in Germany, where it was followed by \\"The Juvenile\\"; this was used for a Christmas campaign by German TV channel RTL. \\"The Juvenile\\" was previously written for the GoldenEye James Bond movie in 1995. However, Arista, the band's American record label at the time, shelved the idea. In Scandinavia, Edel-Mega released the album's opening track, \\"Unspeakable\\", as the second single, but its poor chart performance ended the promotion of the album prematurely. Question: did it have any singles? Answer:","output":"Yes, the Ace of Base album Da Capo had singles. The first single released from the album was \\"Beautiful Morning,\\" which did well on the charts in Sweden and Germany. Another single, \\"The Juvenile,\\" was used for a Christmas campaign by a German TV channel.

The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

Remove them from the oven and allow them to cool for a minute or two. 3. Add ground beef: Take a warmed taco shell and carefully spoon the seasoned ground beef into the shell, filling it about 1/3 to 1/2 full. This will be the base layer of the taco. 4. Add lettuce: On top of the ground beef, place a layer of shredded lettuce, filling up another 1/4 of the taco shell. 5. Add tomatoes: Scatter the diced tomatoes on top of the lettuce layer, dividing them evenly among the tacos. 6. Add cheese: Sprinkle a generous amount of grated cheese over the tomato layer.

Here is a hypothesis: These settings are for the field. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"To determine whether the hypothesis follows from the premise, we need to analyze both the information provided in the premise and the content of the hypothesis. Premise: Field Settings. This premise is vague and does not provide a clear understanding of what \\"Field Settings\\" refer to. Field settings could suggest various things such as settings for a sports field, settings on a computer program or application involving fields, or even settings for agricultural fields. Due to this wide range of possibilities, any conclusion we make should be made with caution. Hypothesis: These settings are for the field. This hypothesis suggests that the settings being referred to have a direct connection to the field. It could imply that some specific settings are directly related to the field, but it does not mention which field or the context of this field. Now, to evaluate if the hypothesis follows from the premise, we'll consider different interpretations for \\"Field Settings\\": 1. Sports field: If \\"Field Settings\\" refers to configurations of a sports field, the hypothesis could hold true as it suggests that these settings are for the field itself, such as the layout, markings, dimensions, or goals. 2.

These settings would involve customizing aspects of the fields such as visibility, validation rules, or appearance. 3. Agricultural field: If \\"Field Settings\\" pertain to the configurations for an agricultural field, the hypothesis would also seem reasonable. These settings could include crop rotation, planting techniques, or irrigation systems which affect the agricultural field. Considering these different interpretations, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis could also be true.

Jose Mourinho spent long periods of last season bemoaning his lack of a 'real striker' - but this pre season he is putting in the hours to get exactly what he wants. At Chelsea's Waldarena training base in Austria, the Chelsea boss has been spending a lot of time with his new £32million hitman Diego Costa, working to ensure that the 25-year-old knows what his new manager expects of him. Mourinho's man-management skills have long been lauded as the best around. Back in his first spell at Stamford Bridge in 2004, he told Frank Lampard he was the best player in the world - and the prolific midfielder went on to guide the Blues to their first title in 50 years. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Diego Costa wax Xabi Alonso's leg sitting on the bench. Special ones: Jose Mourinho lets new signing Diego Costa know exactly what to do on the training field. Powerhouse: Costa will pose a handful for Premier League defences next season when on runs like this one. Rivals: Fernando Torres and new signing Costa will likely fight in out for one place up front at Stamford Bridge. This is how you do it: Mourinho put in a lot of time with his new striker to help him hit the ground running. Not-so-hot-shot: Cesar Azpilicueta aims a shot which Cech saves - the full back has just one goal for Chelsea. New boys galore: Cesc Fabregas gets away from Filipe Luis with youngster Izzy Brown approaching. First goal: Petr Cech, back in training with the first team, tries to get to a Luis shot across the goal. Now, Mourinho looks to be giving Costa the same treatment in the hope the addition of a proven goalscorer can help Chelsea go two marks better in the Premier League and the Champions League. In the second session of their Austrian training camp, Mourinho was often spotted having a word in Costa's ear, pointing out where he wanted to be and explaining his tactics. He wants the former Atletico forward to hit the ground running - and not to become the latest of Chelsea's scrapheap of failed big money striker purchases. And Costa, who had a difficult World Cup as Spain were knocked out in the group stage, looked to be pleased with how things are going since joining up with Chelsea's squad - smiling and posing for selfies with fans. Elsewhere, Petr Cech was back with the first team, fielding shots from new boy Filipe Luis among others as Chelsea prepare for their third pre season game on Wednesday against RZ Pellets. Let me take a selfie: Costa and Fabregas both pose for photos with Chelsea's fans at their Austria base. Back in town: Gary Cahill escapes the attentions of Lewis Baker and Nemanja Matic to play a pass. Relief: Mo Salah, fresh from the news he is not required for military service, takes possession of the ball. Not-so-hot-shot: Cesar Azpilicueta aims a shot which Cech saves - the full back has just one goal for Chelsea. Doing well: Mourinho's gesture appears to show his appreciation for the players' work in Austria. Taking it seriously: Skipper John Terry calls for the ball during a game organised by Mourinho. Utility man: Branislav Ivanovic, who played up front against Wimbledon at the weekend, tackles Dominic Solanke. Familiar territory: Ivanovic tries to get a diving header past Cech at the Waldarena. Mr Nice Guy: Costa signs autographs at the Waldarena in Austria and is joined by former Atletico team mate Filipe Luis. Get into the groove: Cech will have been relieved to make his return with Thibaut Courtois threatening his place. Youth vs new: Nathaniel Chalobah comes up against Fabregas in a midfield duel. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"The important parts of this article discuss how Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has been working closely with new signing Diego Costa during the team's pre-season training camp in Austria. Mourinho has been spending time with Costa, ensuring that the £32 million striker understands his expectations and tactics for the upcoming season. The article highlights Mourinho's man-management skills, which have been lauded as some of the best in the soccer world. It mentions how Mourinho had previously instilled confidence in Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard, which led to their first league title in 50 years back in 2004. Furthermore, the article mentions that Petr Cech has returned to first-team training, and he is competing against fellow goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois for a starting position. The team is preparing for their third pre-season game against RZ Pellets.

Barbara studies the formation of the ozone layer, while Jane studies about the stratosphere. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which student learned more about temperature inversion? Hint: The mechanism describing the formation of the ozone layer was described by British mathematician Sydney Chapman in 1930. Molecular oxygen absorbs high energy sunlight in the UV-C region, at wavelengths shorter than about 240 nm. Radicals produced from the homolytically split oxygen molecules combine with molecular oxygen to form ozone. Ozone in turn is photolysed much more rapidly than molecular oxygen as it has a stronger absorption that occurs at longer wavelengths, where the solar emission is more intense. Ozone (O3) photolysis produces O and O2. The oxygen atom product combines with atmospheric molecular oxygen to reform O3, releasing heat. The rapid photolysis and reformation of ozone heats the stratosphere resulting in a temperature inversion. This increase of temperature with altitude is characteristic of the stratosphere; its resistance to vertical mixing means that it is stratified. Within the stratosphere temperatures increase with altitude (see temperature inversion); the top of the stratosphere has a temperature of about 270 K (−3°C or 26.6°F). This vertical stratification, with warmer layers above and cooler layers below, makes the stratosphere dynamically stable: there is no regular convection and associated turbulence in this part of the atmosphere. However, exceptionally energetic convection processes, such as volcanic eruption columns and overshooting tops in severe supercell thunderstorms, may carry convection into the stratosphere on a very local and temporary basis. Overall the attenuation of solar UV at wavelengths that damage DNA by the ozone layer allows life to exist on the surface of the planet outside of the ocean. All air entering the stratosphere must pass through the tropopause, the temperature minimum that divides the troposphere and stratosphere. The rising air is literally freeze dried; the stratosphere is a very dry place. The top of the stratosphere is called the stratopause, above which the temperature decreases with height. Answer:","output":"Jane learned more about temperature inversion, as she studies the stratosphere, where temperature inversion occurs due to the rapid photolysis and reformation of ozone."},{"instruction":"Given the sentence \\"A boy selling lemonade for 1 rides his bike with no hands as he advertises his product to a long line of people.\\" is it true that \\"The boy is riding a bike with training wheels wile advertising his lemonade stand.\\"?

Jim's land is not very fertile because it has clay soil with a high pH, while Bob's land has very fertile soil and has a good productivity on it. But I can use this background: Alkali, or Alkaline, soils are clay soils with high pH (> 8.5), a poor soil structure and a low infiltration capacity. Often they have a hard calcareous layer at 0.5 to 1 metre depth. Alkali soils owe their unfavorable physico-chemical properties mainly to the dominating presence of sodium carbonate, which causes the soil to swell[1] and difficult to clarify/settle. They derive their name from the alkali metal group of elements, to which sodium belongs, and which can induce basicity. Sometimes these soils are also referred to as alkaline sodic soils. Alkaline soils are basic, but not all basic soils are alkaline. What is an answer for this question: Which of the two pieces of land has a high filtration capacity? A:","output":"Bob's land has a high filtration capacity. The provided background information tells us that Jim's land has alkali clay soil with high pH (> 8.5), poor soil structure, and low infiltration capacity due to the presence of sodium carbonate. This makes the soil swell and difficult to clarify or settle. On the other hand, Bob's land has fertile soil and good productivity, which implies that its soil structure is more favorable for plant growth and has a better ability to absorb and drain water. When we compare the two pieces of land, it becomes evident that Bob's land, with its fertile soil and good productivity, has a high filtration capacity, while Jim's land, characterized by alkali clay soil and low infiltration capacity, does not. This difference in filtration capacity can greatly impact the growth of plants and the overall success of agricultural activities on each piece of land. High filtration capacity allows soil to absorb and retain more water and nutrients, promoting healthier plant growth. The contrasting fertility levels and filtration capacities of the two lands would understandably result in different levels of agricultural productivity, as seen in the description provided."},{"instruction":"Definition: In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms.

The most reasonable action for Jordan to perform subsequent to obtaining and winding the hose around Jesse's way would be to water the garden. To elaborate further, the interaction between Jordan and Jesse may involve a sequence of tasks that need to be completed in the garden. They may be working together to provide optimal results in their gardening pursuits. These tasks might include fertilizing, pruning, planting, and finally, watering. Jordan may have completed the other tasks and the next step would be to ensure that the plants receive adequate water. Watering the garden is a crucial portion of any gardening routine. It provides plants with hydration, enabling them to thrive and experience healthy growth. Proper watering techniques also contribute to the successful outcome of the plants in the garden. Jordan, being knowledgeable about the importance of hydration for plants, would prioritize this task and aim to water the garden effectively.

Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that \\"I would see movies more often if I had the money.\\" However, we need to consider other factors to provide a more comprehensive understanding. First, let's analyze the financial aspect. Going to the movies can be an expensive recreational activity, especially if you include factors such as tickets, concessions, transportation, and any additional expenses like dining or babysitting. Moreover, the cost of movie tickets has increased over time, which may have further intensified your desire to watch movies more often if resources were not an issue. Secondly, it's crucial to consider your personal preferences and interests. If you are a movie enthusiast, then it's highly likely that you would want to watch movies more often if you had the money. Watching movies can provide entertainment, relaxation, and sometimes even emotional catharsis, depending on the content. For someone who enjoys this cinematic experience, having the financial means to indulge in this activity more often would be a highly appealing prospect. Furthermore, it's essential to consider the availability of alternatives and competing priorities. While financial constraints might be a significant limiting factor in your ability to watch movies more frequently, other factors may also come into play. For instance, you might have other hobbies or interests that require time, attention, and resources. In this case, even if the financial concerns were mitigated, there might still be constraints on your ability or desire to watch movies more often. Additionally, it's important to acknowledge the changing landscape of how movies are consumed today. With the advent of streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, and Disney+, many people are turning to these more cost-effective platforms to watch movies rather than going to the theater. If you have access to these services, it could be that you're already watching movies more frequently than you might at the theater, albeit in a different format. In this scenario, financial constraints may not significantly impact your overall movie consumption habits. In conclusion, although it is reasonable to infer from your statement that you would see movies more often if you had the money, it's important to consider other factors such as personal preferences, alternatives, and competing priorities. These factors may continue to influence your movie-watching habits even if financial constraints were no longer a concern. However, as a movie enthusiast, it's highly likely that if you had the financial means to watch more movies, you would take advantage of the opportunity to do so."},{"instruction":"next question: What do we call television that we enjoy watching a lot?

Pedro eventually ended up in the care of a man named Sebastian with many other children . Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","output":"Yes, these two sentences are paraphrases of each other. Both sentences convey the same core meaning, describing that Pedro, along with many other children, ended up being cared for by a man named Sebastian. The sentences have employed different sentence structures and word arrangements to achieve the same overarching message, but their core meaning remains the same. In the first sentence, 'Eventually, Pedro ended with many other children in the care of a man called Sebastian,' the key information is presented more linearly. The sentence starts with \\"eventually,\\" denoting that the event took place over time. It then describes Pedro's situation as \\"ended with many other children in the care,\\" emphasizing that Pedro was with a group of children looked after by Sebastian. In the second sentence, 'Pedro eventually ended up in the care of a man named Sebastian with many other children,' the adverb \\"eventually\\" is placed after Pedro, creating a sense of finality as to where Pedro ended up. In this sentence structure, the focus is shifted more towards Pedro's destination, followed by Sebastian's name as the caretaker. The fact that Pedro was accompanied by other children is mentioned at the end, but it still retains the same overall meaning that Pedro was not alone in Sebastian's care. In both sentences, the idea of Pedro being a part of a group of children under Sebastian's care is present, and the use of different words to describe Sebastian (\\"called\\" in the first sentence and \\"named\\" in the second) also adds a sense of variation. Despite the slight differences in structure, both sentences ultimately convey the same essential idea."},{"instruction":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

The narrator tells us, \\"The time is 2:45 a.m., two hours and fifteen minutes before time zero. At time zero a new type of atomic explosion, a plutonium bomb, will be detonated at Desert Rock, Nevada. These soldiers are to experience the Plutonium Explosion under simulated combat conditions.\\" Credits roll.Over a loudspeaker the troops are warned that in thirty seconds the explosion will happen. The countdown is started, but when zero is announced there is no explosion. The bombsite control officer (William Hughes) explains that there has been a malfunction and they must not leave their position and keep their dark glasses on. Col.

Manning, again on the phone, reports a civilian plane in the area and it seems to be in trouble. It crashes and Manning, against orders, runs out to render assistance.

Significant musical breakthroughs were achieved by the Edge in August 1982 during a two-week period of independent songwriting, while the other band members vacationed and Bono honeymooned with his wife Ali. From September to November, the group recorded War at Windmill Lane Studios. Lillywhite, who had a policy of not working with an artist more than twice, was convinced by the group to return as their producer for a third time. The recording sessions featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham and the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts. For the first time, Mullen agreed to play drums to a click track to keep time. After completing the album, U2 undertook a short tour of Western Europe in December. War's lead single, \\"New Year's Day\\", was released on 1 January 1983. It reached number 10 in the UK and became the group's first hit outside of Europe; in the US, it received extensive radio coverage and peaked at number 53. Resolving their doubts of the October period, U2 released War in February. Critically, the album received favourable reviews, although a few UK reviewers were critical of it. Nonetheless, it was the band's first commercial success, debuting at number one in the UK, while reaching number 12 in the US. War's sincerity and \\"rugged\\" guitar were intentionally at odds with the trendier synthpop of the time. A record on which the band \\"turned pacifism itself into a crusade\\", War was lyrically more political than their first two records, focusing on the physical and emotional effects of warfare. The album included the protest song \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", in which Bono lyrically tried to contrast the events of the 1972 Bloody Sunday shooting with Easter Sunday.

How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","output":"The linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"They let him go yesterday, he.\\" can be assessed from various perspectives, including grammar, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. We will analyze each of these aspects to determine the overall linguistic integrity. 1. Grammar: The sentence seems incomplete and contains some grammatical errors, which contribute to the lack of linguistic integrity. First, the pronoun \\"he\\" appears to be placed awkwardly at the end of the sentence, without a verb or a clear connection to the preceding clause. A more grammatically accurate placement of \\"he\\" would either involve a coordinating conjunction that links it to a verb (e.g., \\"and he\\" or \\"but he\\") or its removal in favor of a more coherent sentence structure. Second, the verb tense suggests that the action \\"let him go\\" happened in the past (\\"yesterday\\"), which is grammatically correct but may not be the intended meaning depending on the context. 2. Syntax: The syntax of the sentence presents a challenge, as the subject \\"they\\" is followed by the verb \\"let,\\" then the object \\"him,\\" and the adverb \\"yesterday.\\" In a typical English sentence, a subject is followed by a verb, then an object, and an adverb denoting temporal information. However, the placement of \\"he\\" at the end of the sentence disrupts the expected syntax and creates confusion. 3. Semantics: From a semantic perspective, the meaning of the sentence is relatively clear, stating that \\"they\\" had allowed \\"him\\" to leave or be released the previous day. However, the addition of the pronoun \\"he\\" adds ambiguity to the meaning of the sentence. Without additional context, it is unclear who \\"he\\" refers to and how \\"he\\" is related to \\"they\\" and \\"him.\\" 4. Pragmatics: In terms of pragmatics, the sentence may lack the necessary context to convey its intended message. For a listener or reader to fully understand the implications of the sentence, they would need more information about the situation, such as why \\"they\\" decided to let \\"him\\" go, what consequences this has on the individuals involved, and the significance of this event. In conclusion, the linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"They let him go yesterday, he.\\" is mostly compromised due to its grammatical errors, disrupted syntax, and ambiguous semantics. To improve the linguistic integrity, further context and proper sentence structure should be provided to convey a clear and cohesive message. A more accurate reconstruction of the sentence might be: \\"They let him go yesterday, and he was relieved.\\""},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the name of the person who was transferred to the asylum while one of his children was \\"crying as though her heart would break\\"? is inside the article: Smetana's biographers describe him as physically frail and unimpressive in appearance yet, at least in his youth, he had a joie-de-vivre that women evidently found attractive. He was also excitable, passionate and strong-willed, determined to make his career in music whatever the hardships, over the wishes of his father who wanted him to become a brewer or a civil servant. Throughout his career he stood his ground; when under the severest of criticism for the \\"Wagnerism\\" in Dalibor he responded by writing Libuše, even more firmly based on the scale and concept of Wagnerian music drama. His personal life became stressful; his marriage to Bettina was loveless, and effectively broke down altogether in the years of illness and relative poverty towards the end of his life. Little of his relationships with his children is on record, although on the day that he was transferred to the asylum, Žofie was \\"crying as though her heart would break\\". There is broad agreement among most commentators that Smetana created a canon of Czech opera where none had previously existed, and that he developed a style of music in all his compositions that equated with the emergent Czech national spirit. A modified view is presented by the music writer Michael Steen, who questions whether \\"nationalistic music\\" can in fact exist: \\"We should recognise that, whereas music is infinitely expressive, on its own it is not good at describing concrete, earthly objects or concepts.\\" He concludes that much is dependent upon what listeners are conditioned to hear.According to the musicologist John Tyrrell, Smetana's close identification with Czech nationalism and the tragic circumstances of his last years, have affected the objectivity of assessments of his work, particularly in his native land. Tyrrell argues that the almost iconic status awarded to Smetana in his homeland \\"monumentalized him into a figure where any criticism of his life or work was discouraged\\" by the Czech authorities, even as late as the last part of the 20th century.

However, despite his professional accomplishments, his personal life was filled with hardships, including a stressful marriage to Bettina and strained relationships with his children.

The debate, which also included Libertarian candidate Ted Metz, was marked by sharp personal attacks, hot-button issues such as immigration and health care, and continued allegations of voter suppression. There was also a moment of local TV awkwardness when the forum was interrupted by a fire alarm. The debate paused for a couple minutes until the alarm was turned off. With the race in solidly red Georgia currently rated a “toss-up” by the Cook Political Report, Abrams stands a chance at becoming the country’s first black female governor, and Tuesday’s debate could prove critical to either candidate. Here are five takeaways from the debate. Voter suppression allegations take center stage Allegations of voter suppression led by Kemp, Georgia's current secretary of state, have become a major issue in recent days. Abrams has called on Kemp to step down after The Associated Press reported that more than 53,000 voter registration applications — 70 percent of them from black voters — are on hold after failing to meet the state’s “exact match” law. Georgia law requires an applicant's information on a voter registration form to exactly match the information on a federal or state database. Kemp said he would not resign as the candidates skirted around the issue early in the debate. The moderators later asked Kemp directly about voter suppression. Kemp strongly defended himself against the allegation, saying he is “absolutely not” using his position to suppress the minority group. He called the idea that he is doing so a “farce” meant to be a “distraction” from Abrams’s “extreme agenda.” Abrams shot back that “the right to vote is a right,” discussing her family’s history struggling for voting rights. She alleged that “more people have lost the right to vote” under Kemp, saying that he helped create \\"an atmosphere of fear.\\" “Voter suppression isn’t only about blocking the vote. It’s also about creating an atmosphere of fear, making people worry that their votes won’t count,” she said. Immigration emerges as key issue Immigration also took the spotlight, with Kemp accusing Abrams of wanting to allow undocumented immigrants to vote in the election. Kemp appeared to be referring to comments Abrams made at a campaign stop earlier in October, where she said a coming “blue wave” will include both documented and undocumented immigrants. Conservatives have seized on the comments to accuse her of encouraging illegal voting. Kemp said “Georgians should simply Google the clip” to see for themselves what Abrams said. Abrams said she has “never in [her] life asked for anyone who is not legally eligible to vote” to do so. Instead, she brought the question back to the issue of voter suppression. “What I’ve asked for is that you allow those that are legally eligible to vote to allow them to cast their ballots,” she continued. Immigration came up again with a discussion about the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which the Trump administration moved to rescind last year. Multiple federal judges have blocked ending the program, which provides protections from deportation for immigrants brought to the country illegally as children, since that announcement. Kemp doubled down on his belief that students benefitting from DACA should not be allowed to receive in-state tuition for the state's colleges, saying such immigrants do not count as “our own people.\\" He also criticized Abrams's support for Georgia's HOPE scholarship, which can provide financial assistance to undocumented students. Abrams framed her support for the scholarship program in economic terms, saying it can help fuel the state's economy and address its nursing shortage. Medicaid a defining issue in race The two candidates also butted heads over Medicaid, an increasingly contentious issue as Democratic candidates have pushed to expand the government program that provides medical care to some individuals in need. Abrams sought to present Medicaid as a \\"bipartisan\\" program offering Georgia's \\"only\\" health-care solution, while Kemp called her proposal \\"a single-payer radical government takeover of health care.\\" \\"My day-one priority is expansion of Medicaid,\\" Abrams said, later calling it the “only one solution in the state of Georgia.” She added that, having \\"been through 11 legislative sessions,\\" she knows it will take \\"more than a day.\\" Abrams promised her health-care plan would cover half a million Georgians, giving them \\"access to health care they need.” She contrasted her plan with Kemp's, saying his health-care plan consists of nothing \\"other than saying trust your insurance companies.\\" Abrams later in the debate made an appeal for Medicaid expansion directed toward rural voters, who are facing an increasing strain as local hospitals shut down throughout the state. \\"I know that we all care about Georgia families,\\" she said. \\"I know that we do not want to see more rural hospitals close.\\" Candidates did not hold back from personal attacks The debate was marked by personal attacks on all sides, with Abrams and Metz accusing Kemp of shady and unethical behavior while Kemp hit Abrams over her taxes. Kemp throughout the debate made an issue of Abrams's taxes, accusing her of failing to pay them even though she is a tax attorney. “When you put politics over paying the government the taxes you owe, that does make you unfit to be governor,” he said. \\"My wife and I have always paid our taxes,\\" he added. Abrams explained that she had to defer paying her taxes when she was paying for her father's cancer treatment. \\"You can defer taxes but you can't defer cancer treatment,\\" she told Kemp. Abrams also stepped up her criticism of Kemp, accusing him of creating \\"an atmosphere of fear\\" for Georgia voters as she hit him repeatedly over his questionable voting rights record as secretary of state. She brought up a report that found more than 3,000 law enforcement officials in the state were on food stamps due to low wages. Kemp has said it is not the state's responsibility to deal with the issue, referring it to local governments. \\"Why is it not the governor’s responsibility to ensure that law enforcement officers protecting our state are paid a living wage?\\" she asked. Later, she said she would always make sure police officers \\"can put food on their tables while we ask them to protect our families.\\" The two candidates throughout the debate called the other's comments \\"dishonest,\\" \\"cherry-picked\\" or \\"misleading.\\" Metz, who for the most part went ignored by the two candidates, at the end associated Kemp and Abrams with \\"corruption.\\" He said a vote for him was a vote against the \\"oligarchs\\" running the country. Abrams emphasized bipartisanship, Kemp played to his base Throughout the debate, Abrams made more efforts to present herself as a bipartisan, center-of-the-road candidate, while Kemp doubled down on his conservative record. Kemp touted the same positions that endeared him to President Trump Donald John TrumpMeet the lawyer Democrats call when it's recount time Avenatti denies domestic violence allegations: 'I have never struck a woman' Trump names handbag designer as ambassador to South Africa MORE and his loyal base. He raised fears over what he referred to as \\"illegals\\" and pledged to fight for conservative values against socialism. Abrams, on the other hand, mentioned more than once that she \\"reached across the aisle\\" during her time as a state legislator, calling herself the \\"only\\" candidate with a \\"strong record of bipartisan leadership.\\" She touted her unequivocal support for local law enforcement and even invoked Vice President Pence's support for Medicaid expansion when he was governor of Indiana, saying she and Pence agree because it is a proven \\"bipartisan program.\\" During the immigration discussion, Abrams avoided overarching moral arguments and stuck to a discussion of how DACA recipients can contribute to Georgia's economy. Kemp got in the final word of the debate, accusing Abrams of promoting \\"radical\\" and \\"extreme\\" policies. \\"Not even California is that liberal,\\" he said of her stance on immigration, adding that he hopes to \\"fight for our conservative values.\\" ||||| A voter arrives as a worker walks past during early voting at a polling place in Charlotte, N.C., Tuesday, Oct. 23, 2018. (AP Photo/Chuck Burton) (Associated Press) A voter arrives as a worker walks past during early voting at a polling place in Charlotte, N.C., Tuesday, Oct. 23, 2018. (AP Photo/Chuck Burton) (Associated Press) NEW YORK (AP) — In the closing stretch of the 2018 campaign, the question is no longer the size of the Democratic wave. It's whether there will be a wave at all. Top operatives in both political parties concede that Democrats' narrow path to the Senate majority has essentially disappeared, a casualty of surging Republican enthusiasm across GOP strongholds. At the same time, leading Democrats now fear the battle for the House majority will be decided by just a handful of seats. \\"It's always been an inside straight, and it still is,\\" Democratic pollster Paul Maslin said of Democrats' outlook in the Senate, where they need to pick up two seats while holding on to several others in Republican-leaning states to seize the majority. \\"If it had been a different year, with a different map, we might have had a terrific sweep. That would be a long shot.\\" While the trend may be troubling for Democrats, the evolving political landscape remains unsettled two weeks before Election Day, even with millions of votes already cast across 20 states. There are signs that the Democrats' position in the expanding House battlefield may actually be improving. Yet Republican candidates locked in tight races from New York to Nevada find themselves in stronger-than-expected positions because of a bump in President Donald Trump's popularity, the aftermath of a divisive Supreme Court fight and the sudden focus on a caravan of Latin American immigrants seeking asylum at the U.S. border. Democrats say they never assumed it would be easy. \\"It's still much closer than people think, with a surprise or two in the wings,\\" New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, the top Senate Democrat, told The Associated Press. The midterm elections will decide whether Republicans maintain control of Congress for the final two years of Trump's first term. Even if Democrats lose the Senate and win the House, they could block much of Trump's agenda and use subpoena power to investigate his many scandals. Some in the party's far-left wing have also vowed to impeach the president, while others promise to roll back the Republican tax overhaul and expand health care coverage for all Americans. Democrats have enjoyed an overwhelming enthusiasm advantage for much of the Trump era. They hope an explosion of early voting across states like Florida, Texas and Nevada is further proof of their enthusiasm gap. It took voters in the Houston area less than six hours Monday to set a new opening day record for early voting during a midterm election. And in some Florida counties, two and three times as many voters cast ballots on the first day of early voting Monday compared to four years ago. Public and private polling, however, suggests the GOP is getting more excited as Nov. 6 approaches. \\"Republican enthusiasm doesn't quite equal the white-hot enthusiasm of Democratic voters, but the Kavanaugh hearings got it pretty close,\\" said GOP consultant Whit Ayres. He also attributes the party's strong position on an unusual Senate map. Democrats are defending 26 seats of the 35 seats in play, including 10 in states that Trump carried in 2016. Ayres calls it \\"maybe the most Republican-leaning map of our lifetimes.\\" He expects the GOP to maintain the Senate majority, perhaps adding a seat or two to its current 51-49 edge. Others have begun to envision the GOP picking up as many as four or five new seats. Democrats, meanwhile, have effectively protected their Senate candidates in states across the Midwest — Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin — that helped give Trump the presidency in 2016. They are increasingly pessimistic about picking up any seats, however. The Tennessee Senate contest, in particular, has shifted sharply in Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn's direction in recent weeks, while Democratic pickup opportunities in Arizona and Nevada are now considered toss-ups. In a measure of the deep uncertainty that has defined the Trump era, only one Democratic incumbent — North Dakota's Heidi Heitkamp — is seen as most in danger of losing. After Heitkamp, Democrats facing the greatest risk of defeat are Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, and perhaps Bill Nelson of Florida. Texas Democratic Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke has shattered fundraising records and developed a national following, but polls have consistently given Republican Sen. Ted Cruz a significant lead against him. In the race for the House, both sides acknowledge the prospect of a wipeout-style wave is shrinking. It's not that Democrats won't be able to wrestle the House majority. But Republican lawmakers are increasingly optimistic, in part because of Trump's recent performance as the GOP's campaigner in chief. Republicans say the often-volatile president has been surprisingly on-message during his campaign events, touting the strong economy and doubling down on the Kavanaugh fight to promote his efforts to fill courts with conservative jurists. And while Trump has been criticized by members of his own party for his handling of the case of the death of a Saudi journalist working for The Washington Post, operatives say the matter appears to be having little impact on voters. On a conference call last week, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., urged rank-and-file lawmakers to pony up extra cash and help for tough races. They see hopeful signs in Iowa, Florida and Kansas. Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., emerged from the call saying it's going to be a \\"dogfight\\" to the finish. There are signs, however, that Democrats are expanding the House battlefield as Election Day approaches. Republicans in recent days have pumped new money into House districts held by Republicans in Florida, Georgia, Virginia and New York, suggesting they're on the defensive. Already, Democrats invested in nearly 80 races, including more than a dozen legitimate pickup opportunities in districts Trump carried by at least 9 points. Democrats need a net gain of 23 seats to claim the House majority. The massive battlefield remains a problem for Republicans, who have struggled to match Democratic fundraising and face several first-time candidates not yet tainted by Washington. Still, Dan Sena, the executive director of the House Democrats campaign arm, recently predicted Democrats would win the majority by only two seats. The Republican shift is not playing out as planned. The GOP hoped its tax cuts would fuel their midterm message. After they proved unpopular, Republicans largely abandoned their most significant policy achievement in the Trump era in favor of a more familiar message of anger and fear. The super PAC aligned with House Speaker Paul Ryan, which is expected to spend 100 million before Election Day — most of it on attack ads — highlighted the shifting landscape in a memo to donors. \\"The polling momentum that began with the Supreme Court confirmation hearings has continued, and the environment has continued to improve,\\" wrote Corry Bliss, executive director of the Congressional Leadership Fund. Still, he wrote, \\"20 races that will decide the majority remain a coin-flip.\\" ___ Beaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa. Mascaro reported from Washington.

The race has riveted the nation — and the nation’s top donors — pitting Las Vegas casino magnate Sheldon Adelson against liberal billionaires George Soros and Tom Steyer and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The money is pouring in from coast to coast, with checks cut by Hollywood celebrities, hedge fund managers, public employee unions and top business executives. Everyday folk are also kicking in increments of less than 200. “It’s really a proxy battle,” said longtime Republican political strategist Mac Stipanovich. “It’s Donald Trump and his prestige against Democratic progressivism and what they hope is the wave of the future.” At stake is not just the Governor’s Mansion, but a leg up in the battle for the White House in 2020. The leader of the nation’s largest swing state will hold considerable sway. Either Republican Ron DeSantis, who resigned from Congress to pursue his run for governor, or Democrat Andrew Gillum, mayor of Tallahassee, will help shape the political landscape well into the next decade. After the 2020 Census, the state and federal district maps will be redrawn on one or the other’s watch. 20 for 365 Days of Unlimited Digital Access Last chance to take advantage of our best offer of the year! Act now! The two candidates will meet in their final debate Wednesday night. With the ripples potentially so far reaching, Gillum and DeSantis have both attracted the support of billionaires from outside Florida, including Soros and Steyer, who have spent millions backing Gillum, and lllinois Republicans Richard Uihlein and Kenneth C. Griffin, DeSantis backers who collectively have matched them dollar for dollar — and then some. Actor/producer Tyler Perry has given 100,000 to Gillum’s PAC, while the wife of Marvel Entertainment’s chairman has given DeSantis’ PAC 2 million. All told, more than half of the 33 million Gillum has raised for his campaign and political action committees has come from out of state, while roughly one-third of the 44 million DeSantis has brought in to his two committees has originated from outside Florida’s borders, according to a Herald/Times analysis of state campaign finance records. In a state long considered “purple” for its eclectic political mix, this year’s election offers no middle-ground candidate. Each appeals strongly to his party’s base. Gillum, a staunch progressive, has supported a 15 minimum wage and expanding Medicaid. DeSantis, a founding member of the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus in the U.S. House, is endorsed by President Trump and has pledged to veto any bills that raise taxes. The Herald/Times analysis shows that at least 71 percent of DeSantis’ total cash raised has come from donors who gave at least 10,000. The corresponding number for Gillum: 59 percent. Families or couples were grouped together as single “donors” for purposes of this analysis. Florida Republican gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis John Raoux AP No donor has given more to back DeSantis — not even the Republican Party — than the Chicago-based billionaire hedge fund manager Griffin, who has donated a staggering 5.7 million to DeSantis’ PAC. Laura Perlmutter, wife of Marvel Chairman Isaac “Ike” Perlmutter, has given DeSantis 2 million, while Republican megadonor and casino mogul Adelson and his wife, Miriam, have contributed a combined 500,000 to the Republican. Illinois shipping magnate Uihlein wrote a 500,000 check, along with 250,000 to another state committee that has in turn transferred almost all its funding to DeSantis. Many of these donors are also among the biggest backers of the national Republican Governors Association, which has donated 1.5 million to DeSantis’ accounts and poured 7.5 million into the Florida Facts PAC, which has spent millions on television ads aimed at boosting DeSantis. “We are grateful for all of the tremendous support we’ve received. We have the momentum in the race and are working hard toward a big win in two weeks,” said Stephen Lawson, a spokesman for the DeSantis campaign. Andrew Gillum, with his wife, R. Jai Gillum, addresses his supporters after winning the Democratic primary for governor on Tuesday, Aug. 28, 2018, in Tallahassee. Steve Cannon AP Gillum counts many of the biggest Democratic donors among his supporters, contributing to his 32 million total. His Forward Florida PAC has taken in more than 1.3 million from Soros and his family. Hedge fund manager Donald Sussman, who owns a home in Fort Lauderdale, has given 1 million to the PAC. NextGen Climate America, backed by Steyer, the high-profile financier of the impeach-Trump movement, has chipped in 800,000. Former New York City Mayor Bloomberg and his affiliated Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund have collectively given the Gillum PAC 500,000, while two national unions, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and the American Federation of Teachers, have given more than 2 million combined. Gillum’s PAC has also taken in 4 million from the national Democratic Governors Association, which also counts many of Gillum’s biggest backers among its top donors. “This campaign is powered by the people, as evidenced by the nearly 100,000 small-dollar, grassroots donors supporting Mayor Gillum and his vision for Florida. We see it on the ground — in some of the state’s most conservative counties — people are showing up, volunteering and voting for Andrew Gillum because they want a governor who will make Floridians a priority,” said Carlie Waibel, spokeswoman for Gillum’s campaign. While many of these donors aren’t strangers to Florida politics, the giving represents an increase from past gubernatorial campaigns. Soros, for example, gave a total of 1 million to the Florida Democratic Party in 2014, while Adelson and Griffin gave 2 million combined to the Florida Republican Party that year, according to data from the National Institute on Money in Politics. By donating money to the parties, they were effectively boosting Republican Rick Scott and Democrat Charlie Crist, as the parties were more heavily involved in financing the candidates that year. Florida’s gubernatorial race is always a national priority for both parties, said Democratic political strategist Ben Pollara. “We do our governor’s races in years that are not divisible by four, so the results of the governor’s race always have an impact on the presidential race coming down the road,” Pollara said. But in the past decade, it’s become more common to see a large influx of money from national donors, campaign finance experts said. Their influence is exaggerated this year, when the national stakes are high and neither of the parties’ nominees have the personal wealth to self-fund, as Rick Scott did in each of the previous contests. Ciara Torres-Spelliscy, a professor of law at Stetson University with an expertise in campaign finance, said the 2020 election also plays up the outsized interest by national donors. The redistricting fight following the 2020 Census takes on added importance because Florida is expected to add two seats in Congress, according to a study earlier this year by Election Data Services Inc. “Those people who are elected this year could have an enormous impact on the redistricting process in the state of Florida,” she said. In addition to courting large donors, Gillum has tapped individuals who give less than 200, according to the Herald/Times analysis. Since March, he’s attracted about 90,000 small donors, raising about 3.3 million. DeSantis has raised about half as much from about 38,000 small donors. This puts DeSantis on par with former Democratic gubernatorial nominee Crist in small-donor contributions. Scott’s 2014 campaign was largely funded by the Florida Republican Party and donors to his Let’s Get to Work PAC, pulling barely 200,000 from 3,000 small donors. All in all, the differences between the way Gillum and DeSantis have raised funds is reflective of their campaign styles in the “era of big donors,” said Susan McManus, a political science professor at the University of South Florida. “DeSantis is a very different kind of candidate — he’s been more nationalized himself,” she said. “He hardly came to Florida in the primary. But from the get-go the Gillum playbook very much has reflected the Obama playbook in Florida with the small donors, [Bernie] Sanders also.” ||||| The RNC has benefited heavily from President Donald Trump’s fundraising. | Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Imahes RNC moves millions to House and Senate campaign arms The Republican National Committee has transferred 3.5 million apiece to the GOP’s House and Senate campaign arms.

Question: suppose utlise less water happens, how will it affect MORE salt being removed from the water. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","output":"If less water is utilized in the desalination process described above, it may initially appear to have no discernible impact on the overall desalination procedure. However, the effects of this change will influence both the efficiency and potentially the amount of salt being removed from the water, as well as the time the process requires. To understand the implications, let us break down the consequences of utilizing less water in this process: 1. Amount of salt removed: When less water is used in the desalination process, the concentration of salt in the original pot will increase more rapidly. This could cause the salt to begin to crystallize sooner. As the salt content increases, there may be a possibility of more salt being removed from the water due to it reaching its saturation limit, leading to increased precipitation/crystallization of salt. Thus, reducing the amount of water used may lead to a greater percentage of salt being removed from the water. However, this would mean less desalinated water is produced, as a higher concentration of salt in the water could lead to a smaller volume of freshwater collected in the second pot. 2. Efficiency: The efficiency of the desalination process may be affected by reducing the amount of water used. As the concentration of salt in the pot increases, the rate at which it evaporates and condenses on the lid may decrease, since the boiling point of water increases with the salt concentration. This results in a longer time required for the water to evaporate, which in turn requires more energy to heat and maintain the necessary temperature for evaporation. Consequently, the overall efficiency of the process may decrease with the reduction in water used. 3. More energy required: As mentioned earlier, higher salt concentrations can lead to increased boiling points. As a result, you may need to provide more energy in the form of heat to maintain the evaporation process. This could lead to higher energy costs, making the desalination process less economical and less efficient. In conclusion, if less water is used in the desalination process, it may lead to more salt being removed from the remaining water due to the increased concentration of the salt. However, this would come at the cost of reduced efficiency, increased energy requirement, and lower volume of desalinated water produced in the second pot. Therefore, the effect of this perturbation on the salt removal can be considered more significant, but accompanied by challenges that need to be accounted for during the desalination process."},{"instruction":"Translate the following.

Under the watchful eye of Myeong-Je Cho, the director of plant genomics at an institute that's working with food and candy company Mars, the plants will be transformed. If all goes well, these tiny seedlings will soon be capable of surviving — and thriving — in the dryer, warmer climate that is sending chills through the spines of farmers across the globe. It's all thanks to a new technology called CRISPR, which allows for tiny, precise tweaks to DNA that were never possible before. These tweaks are already being used to make crops cheaper and more reliable. But their most important use may be in the developing world, where many of the plants that people rely on to avoid starvation are threatened by the impacts of climate change, including more pests and a lack of water. Cacao plants occupy a precarious position on the globe. They can only grow within a narrow strip of rainforested land roughly 20 degrees north and south of the equator, where temperature, rain, and humidity all stay relatively constant throughout the year. Over half of the world's chocolate now comes from just two countries in West Africa— Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana. But those areas won't be suitable for chocolate in the next few decades. By 2050, rising temperatures will push today's chocolate-growing regions more than 1,000 feet uphill into mountainous terrain — much of which is currently preserved for wildlife, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic Mars, the 35 billion corporation best known for Snickers, is aware of these problems and others presented by climate change. In September, the company pledged 1 billion as part of an effort called \\"Sustainability in a Generation,\\" which aims to reduce the carbon footprint of its business and supply chain by more than 60% by 2050. \\"We're trying to go all in here,\\" Barry Parkin, Mars' chief sustainability officer, told Business Insider. \\"There are obviously commitments the world is leaning into but, frankly, we don't think we're getting there fast enough collectively.\\" Its initiative with Cho at UC Berkeley is another arm of that efforts. If all goes as planned, they could develop cacao plants that don't wilt or rot at their current elevations, doing away with the need to relocate farms or find another approach. Jennifer Doudna, the UC Berkeley geneticist who invented CRISPR, is overseeing the collaboration with Mars. Although her tool has received more attention for its potential to eradicate human diseases and make so-called \\"designer babies,\\" Doudna thinks its most profound applications won't be on humans but rather on the food they eat. Courtney Verrill An avid tomato gardener, Doudna thinks her tool can benefit everyone from large food companies like Mars to individual hobbyists like herself. \\"Personally, I'd love a tomato plant with fruit that stayed on the vine longer,\\" Doudna told Business Insider. The research lab she oversees at UC Berkeley is called the Innovative Genomics Institute. Many of the efforts by graduate students there focus on using CRISPR to benefit small-holder farmers in the developing world. One such project aims to protect cassava — a key crop that prevents millions of people from starving each year — from climate change by tweaking its DNA to produce less of a dangerous toxin that it makes in hotter temperatures. Doudna founded a company called Caribou Biosciences to put CRISPR into practice, and has also licensed the technology to agricultural company DuPont Pioneer for use in crops like corn and mushrooms. Regardless of which crop the public sees CRISPR successfully used in first, the technology will be a key tool in a growing arsenal of techniques we'll need if we plan to continue eating things like chocolate as the planet warms. ||||| Carob is a brown powder made from the pulverized fruit of a Mediterranean evergreen. Some consider carob an adequate substitute for chocolate…because it can, when combined with vegetable fat and sugar, be made to approximate the color and consistency of chocolate. Of course, the same arguments can as persuasively be made in favor of dirt. —Sandra Boynton CHOCOLATE: The Consuming Passion Strawberries dipped in chocolate. Photo by Flickr user kristina. For chocolate lovers, there is simply no substitute, and if cocoa beans could be cultivated anywhere, cocoa (Theobroma cacao) trees might outnumber apple trees in American yards. They would certainly outnumber any plants that produced vegetables. Unfortunately, cacao trees don't thrive in the temperate climate of the continental United States. Chocolate grows best in the places where it would quickly melt in your hands. Over the next several decades, those places may grow warmer, drier, and less suitable to cacao cultivation. But with planning and adaptation, cacao farmers can keep producing our favorite treat. The geography of chocolate Cacao can only grow within about 20° north and south of the equator—south of the Mediterranean home of carob, in fact. Cacao trees only prosper under specific conditions, including fairly uniform temperatures, high humidity, abundant rain, nitrogen-rich soil, and protection from wind. In short, cacao trees thrive in rainforests. Chocolate is now grown around the globe—typically within 10° north and south of the equator. The world's leading producers are Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, and Indonesia. Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana produce over half of the world's chocolate. But research highlighted in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability report indicates that, under a “business as usual” scenario, those countries will experience a 3.8°F (2.1°C) increase in temperature by 2050, and a marked reduction in suitable cultivation area. It’s not the heat, it’s the (lack of) humidity Another staple of American consumption, coffee, suffers direct harm from rising temperatures, but chocolate is different. Rising temperatures alone won’t necessarily hurt cacao production. Cacao cultivation areas in Malaysia, for instance, already endure a warmer climate than in West Africa without any obvious negative effect. Cacao blossoms in the New York Botanical Garden, Bronx. Photo by Flickr user Kerry Woods. The danger to chocolate comes from an increase in evapotranspiration, especially since the higher temperatures projected for West Africa by 2050 are unlikely to be accompanied by an increase in rainfall, according to business-as-usual carbon dioxide emissions scenarios. In other words, as higher temperatures squeeze more water out of soil and plants, it's unlikely that rainfall will increase enough to offset the moisture loss. Some of the research highlighted by the IPCC 2014 report is a 2013 study headed by Peter Läderach. Läderach authored a 2011 paper giving a pretty dire forecast for cacao cultivation; the 2013 study reaches slightly less worrisome conclusions, though challenges to West Africa cacao growers remain. An uphill battle By 2050, rising temperatures will push the suitable cacao cultivation areas uphill. The IPCC reported that Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana’s optimal altitude for cacao cultivation is expected to rise from 350–800 feet (100–250 meters) to 1,500–1,600 feet (450–500 meters) above sea level. These maps show suitability for cacao cultivation at present (left) and projected for 2050 (right). Image adapted from Läderach et al. 2013. Läderach and his team report that areas expected to show improved cultivation conditions are often hilly terrain. One example is Ghana’s Atewa Range. It’s a forest preserve where cultivation isn’t permitted. Cacao-growing countries may have to choose which priority matters more: growing a product to meet a global demand, or preserving natural habitat. In fact, Läderach and coauthors found that, of the 294 locations examined in the study, only 10.5% showed increasing suitability for cacao production; the remaining 89.5% were likely to become less suitable by 2050. The authors continued, “These changes in climatic suitability are predicted to take place over a time period of almost 40 years, so they will mostly impact the next rather than the current generation of cocoa trees and farmers. In other words, there is time for adaptation.” Helping chocolate cope with climate change One adaptation strategy could be providing cacao growers with selectively bred seeds that have superior drought resistance. Another strategy involves a traditional cacao cultivation method that takes advantage of the conditions under which cacao naturally grows. Cacao harvesting in Colombia. Photo by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Known in Brazil as cabruca, this approach involves retaining, or in some cases replanting, other rainforest trees, which provide cacao trees with shade. (Like Northern European tourists in the Mediterranean, cacao trees benefit enormously from shade.) This approach could help decrease both temperature and evapotranspiration. The taller trees also provide protection from wind and soil erosion, and nutrient-rich leaf litter. Cacao trees cultivated in this approach appear less vulnerable to pests, and the soil better retains its ability to support cacao over the long term. Cabruca offers one more advantage: Carbon that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere when forests are cleared isn't. It remains stored in the trees. A study conducted in southern Cameroon and published in 2009 found that cacao forests in that region store on average 243 metric tons per hectare (about 2.5 acres). (For comparison, in 2011–2015, the World Bank reported, U.S. citizens released about 17.0 metric tons of carbon dioxide per person per year.) Another study, conducted in Brazil and published in 2014, concluded that judicious cabruca practices could double cacao production in a climate-friendly manner.

Unless, that is, gene-editing scientists manage to save it. The persnickety cacao plant contains seeds that are the vital ingredient in chocolate. But the plant only grows in narrow bands of land in the rainforest, where the weather stays relatively wet and humid the whole year. Climate change is projected to alter this habitat so drastically in the next 40 years that cacao won’t grow there, according to a report by Business Insider. It might be possible for cacao to grow on steep mountains, but many of those areas are protected as wildlife refuges against agriculture. Matt Cardy/Getty Images Barring the slowing down or reversing of climate change, how can we directly help chocolate withstand it? Perhaps a collaboration between Mars, the world’s top candy company according to CandyIndustry.com, and scientists in the rapidly-advancing field of genetic engineering, can help. Mars pledged 1 billion to an effort to reduce its carbon footprint, and part of that is going to a lab at UC Berkeley’s biosciences building. The director of plant genomics, Myeong-Je Cho, hosts cacao seedlings there, where he will attempt to engineer them to survive different climates. His team will use the revolutionary, emerging genetic engineering technology called CRISPR-Cas9. CRISPR-Cas9 works by finding pieces of DNA, snipping it out, and replacing it with altered DNA. Potentially, it could be used to alter plants and animals to better suit our needs, or to edit humans embryos themselves. The research of Jennifer Doudna, who works at UC Berkeley, was important to the creation of the gene-editing technology (but a heated legal battle concluded that the patent belonged to the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT.) Doudna will be working on the chocolate-preservation project as well. Between Cho, Doudna, and Mars’ immense corporate funding, they intend to isolate genes that make the cacao plant so fragile and to replace them with more formidable genes, specifically ones that can withstand the changing climate that they will soon experience. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Scientists at the University of California are working with the food and candy company Mars to genetically modify cacao plants in order to make them more resistant to the consequences of climate change.

Plato (; Greek: Platon Platon, pronounced [pla.to:n] in Classical Attic; 428/427 or 424/423 - 348/347 BC) was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the Western tradition. Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato's entire work is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years. Others believe that the oldest extant manuscript dates to around AD 895, 1100 years after Plato's death. Although Socrates influenced Plato directly as related in the dialogues, the influence of Pythagoras upon Plato also appears to have significant discussion in the philosophical literature. Pythagoras, or in a broader sense, the Pythagoreans, allegedly exercised an important influence on the work of Plato. According to R. M. Hare, this influence consists of three points: (1) The platonic Republic might be related to the idea of \\"a tightly organized community of like-minded thinkers\\", like the one established by Pythagoras in Croton. (2) There is evidence that Plato possibly took from Pythagoras the idea that mathematics and, generally speaking, abstract thinking is a secure basis for philosophical thinking as well as \\"for substantial theses in science and morals\\". (3) Plato and Pythagoras shared a \\"mystical approach to the soul and its place in the material world\\". It is probable that both were influenced by Orphism. Pythagoras held that all things are number, and the cosmos comes from numerical principles. The physical world of becoming is an imitation of the mathematical world of being. This ideas were very influential in Heraclitus, Parmenides and Plato. Aristotle claimed that the philosophy of Plato closely followed the teachings of the Pythagoreans, and Cicero repeats this claim: \\"They say Plato learned all things Pythagorean\\" (Platonem ferunt didicisse Pythagorea omnia). George Karamanolis notes that Numenius accepted both Pythagoras and Plato as the two authorities one should follow in philosophy, but he regarded Plato's authority as subordinate to that of Pythagoras, whom he considered to be the source of all true philosophy--including Plato's own. For Numenius it is just that Plato wrote so many philosophical works, whereas Pythagoras' views were originally passed on only orally. The precise relationship between Plato and Socrates remains an area of contention among scholars. Plato makes it clear in his Apology of Socrates that he was a devoted young follower of Socrates. In that dialogue, Socrates is presented as mentioning Plato by name as one of those youths close enough to him to have been corrupted, if he were in fact guilty of corrupting the youth, and questioning why their fathers and brothers did not step forward to testify against him if he was indeed guilty of such a crime (33d-34a). Later, Plato is mentioned along with Crito, Critobolus, and Apollodorus as offering to pay a fine of 30 minas on Socrates' behalf, in lieu of the death penalty proposed by Meletus (38b). In the Phaedo, the title character lists those who were in attendance at the prison on Socrates' last day, explaining Plato's absence by saying, \\"Plato was ill\\". (Phaedo 59b) Plato never speaks in his own voice in his dialogues. In the Second Letter, it says, \\"no writing of Plato exists or ever will exist, but those now said to be his are those of a Socrates become beautiful and new\\" (341c); if the Letter is Plato's, the final qualification seems to call into question the dialogues' historical fidelity. In any case, Xenophon and Aristophanes seem to present a somewhat different portrait of Socrates from the one Plato paints. Some have called attention to the problem of taking Plato's Socrates to be his mouthpiece, given Socrates' reputation for irony and the dramatic nature of the dialogue form. Aristotle attributes a different doctrine with respect to Forms to Plato and Socrates (Metaphysics 987b1-11). Aristotle suggests that Socrates' idea of forms can be discovered through investigation of the natural world, unlike Plato's Forms that exist beyond and outside the ordinary range of human understanding. Mythos and logos are terms that evolved along classical Greece history. In the times of Homer and Hesiod (8th century BC) they were quite synonyms, and contained the meaning of tale or history. Later came historians like Herodotus and Thucydides, as well as philosophers as Parmenides and other Presocratics that introduced a distinction between both terms, and mythos became more a nonverifiable account, and logos a rational account. Plato, being a disciple of Socrates, and a strong partisan of philosophy based on logos, it seems that should have avoided the use of myth-telling. Instead he made an abundant use of it. This fact has produced analytical and interpretative work, in order to clarify the reasons and purposes for that use. Plato, in general, distinguished between three types of myth. First there were the false myths, like those based on stories of gods subject to passions and sufferings, because reason teaches that God is perfect. Then came the myths based on true reasoning, and therefore also true. Finally there were those non verifiable because beyond of human reason, but containing some truth in them. Regarding the subjects of Plato's myths they are of two types, those dealing with the origin of the universe, and those about morals and the origin and fate of the soul. It is generally agreed that the main purpose for Plato in using myths was didactic. He considered that only a few people were capable or interested in following a reasoned philosophical discourse, but men in general are attracted by stories and tales. Consequently then, he used the myth to convey the conclusions of the philosophical reasoning. Some of Plato's myths were based in traditional ones, others were modifications of them, and finally he also invented altogether new myths.","output":"This text is about Plato, a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens.

In the text, the influence of Socrates and Pythagoras on Plato's work is addressed. Despite the complexity of their relationships, both thinkers had significant impacts on Plato's ideas, shaping his approach to philosophy, mathematics, and the concept of the soul. The text also discusses how Plato's relationship with Socrates remains an area of contention among scholars, as Plato never speaks in his own voice in his dialogues, and Socrates' reputation for irony complicates the process of determining which ideas can be attributed to him. Furthermore, the text mentions how the concepts of mythos (myth) and logos (reason) evolved in ancient Greece and how Plato incorporated myths in his work. He distinguished between three types of myths - false myths, myths based on true reasoning, and non-verifiable myths containing some truth. Plato's usage of myth was primarily didactic, as he believed that most people were more drawn to stories and tales rather than philosophical discourse. Thus, he employed myths to convey the conclusions resulting from his philosophical reasoning.

Lindsey agreed and they went to the park, where lots of people were walking around, laughing, talking, and playing. Lindsey pointed at a lady walking her dog and said, \\"That lady is happy, look at her big smile and sparkling eyes!\\" Then, she showed Mary a man sitting on a bench, with his eyebrows all scrunched together and lips pressed firmly. \\"That man is worried or maybe upset about something,\\" Lindsey explained. Mary was fascinated by Lindsey's ability to read faces, and wanted to get better at it too. They practiced together every day, learning more and more about what different faces meant. With time, Mary began to notice the subtle changes in people's faces, helping her understand their emotions better. Lindsey and Mary shared their secret talent with their friends, and soon, all the kids in the neighborhood knew about it. They all played together, having fun and learning how to read faces like Lindsey and Mary. Everyone became more understanding of each other's feelings, and it helped them get along even better.

He emerged as the paramount leader of the Indian independence movement under the tutelage of Mahatma Gandhi and ruled India from its establishment as an independent nation in 1947 until his death in 1964. He is considered to be the architect of the modern Indian nation-state: a sovereign, socialist, secular, and democratic republic. He was also known as Pandit Nehru due to his roots with the Kashmiri Pandit community while many Indian children knew him as \\"Uncle Nehru\\" (\\"Chacha\\" Nehru). - India held general elections to the 5th Lok Sabha in March 1971 . This was the fifth election since independence in 1947 . The 27 Indian states and union territories were represented by 518 constituencies , each with a single seat . Under the leadership of Indira Gandhi , the Indian National Congress ( R ) led a campaign which focussed on reducing poverty and won a landslide victory , overcoming a split in the party and regaining many of the seats lost in the previous election . During her previous term , there had been internal divisions in the Indian National Congress between Indira Gandhi and the party establishment , especially Morarji Desai . In 1969 , she was expelled from the party , causing a split . Most of the Congress MPs and grassroots support joined Gandhi 's Indian National Congress ( R ) faction , which was recognized by the Election Commission as being the successor to the previous party . 31 MPs who opposed Gandhi became the Indian National Congress ( Organization ) party . Despite the split , the Ruling faction gained votes and seats to win a strong majority , whereas the Organization faction lost half of their seats . On 12 June 1975 , the Allahabad High Court invalidated the result in Gandhi 's constituency on the grounds of electoral malpractices . Instead of resigning , Indira Gandhi called a state of emergency , suspending democracy and outlawed political opposition . After democracy was restored in 1977 , the opposition Congress faction formed a coalition of parties called the Janata Party , which inflicted the Congress ' first electoral defeat . - Indian National Congress (R) was a split in Indian National Congress, created by Indira Gandhi in 1967 when a united opposition, under the banner of Samyukt Vidhayak Dal, won control over several states in the Hindi belt. Indira Gandhi, the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru, and Congress president, was then challenged by the majority of the party leadership. Initially this party was known as Congress (R), but it soon came to be generally known as the \\"New Congress\\". The letter 'R' stands for 'Requisition'. The official party became the Indian National Congress (Organisation) (INC(O)) led by Kamaraj. It was informally called the \\"Old Congress\\" and retained the party symbol of a pair of bullocks carrying a yoke. Mrs. Gandhi's breakaway faction were given a new symbol of a cow with suckling calf by the Election Commission as the party election symbol. - The Lok Sabha (House of the People) is the Lower house of India's bicameral Parliament, with the Upper house being the Rajya Sabha. Members of the Lok Sabha are elected by adult universal suffrage and a first-past-the-post system to represent their respective constituencies, and they hold their seats for five years or until the body is dissolved by the President on the advice of the council of ministers. The house meets in the Lok Sabha Chambers of the Sansad Bhavan in New Delhi. - Indira Priyadarshini Gandhi (Nehru; 19 November 1917 31 October 1984) was an Indian politician and central figure of the Indian National Congress party, and to date the only female Prime Minister of India. Indira Gandhi was the daughter of India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. She served as Prime Minister from 1966 to 1977 and then again from 1980 until her assassination in 1984, making her the second-longest-serving Prime Minister of India after her father. Gandhi served as her father's personal assistant and hostess during his tenure as prime minister between 1947 and 1964. She was elected Congress President in 1959. Upon her father's death in 1964, Gandhi refused to enter the Congress party leadership contest and instead chose to become a cabinet minister in the government led by Lal Bahadur Shastri. In the Congress Party's parliamentary leadership election held in early 1966, upon the death of Shastri, she defeated her rival, Morarji Desai, to become leader, and thus succeeded Shastri as Prime Minister of India. - Morarji Desai Nishan-e-Pakistan (29 February 1896 10 April 1995) was an Indian independence activist and the Prime Minister of India from 1977 to 1979. He was also the first Prime Minister to head India's first non-Congress Government. He held many important posts in the Government of India such as: Chief Minister of Bombay State, Home Minister, Finance Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of India. On the international scene, Desai holds international fame for his peace activism and made efforts to initiate peace between two rival South Asian states, Pakistan and India. After India's first nuclear explosion in 1974, Desai helped restore friendly relations with China and Pakistan, and vowed to avoid armed conflict such as Indo-Pakistani war of 1971. Domestically, he played a crucial role in the Indian nuclear program after it was targeted by major nuclear powers after conducting a surprise test in 1974. Morarji Desai closed down much of India's premier intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW), and reduced its budget and operations. Desai remains the only Indian national to be conferred with Pakistan's highest civilian award, \\"Nishan-e-Pakistan\\", which was conferred on him by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan in 1990 in a colorful ceremony. Later, his policies promoted social, health and administrative reforms in the country. It is rumored that he was a mole of CIA in Indira Gandhi led cabinet.

A:","output":"The relationship between the Indian general election and the Prime Minister of India lies in the electoral process and formation of the government. General elections in India are held to elect representatives to the Lok Sabha, which is the lower house of the Indian Parliament. Political parties contest the elections, aiming to secure a majority of the seats in the Lok Sabha. Once the general elections are over and the results are announced, the President of India, taking into account the majority party or coalition in the Lok Sabha, invites the leader of that party or coalition to form the government. The leader chosen is then appointed as the Prime Minister of India, who is the head of government and the executive branch.

This undated image provided by Journal shows a Neanderthal rock engraving at Gorham’s Cave in Gibraltar. The series of lines scratched into the rock could be proof that Neanderthals were more intelligent... (Associated Press) The cross-hatched engravings inside Gorham's Cave in Gibraltar are the first known examples of Neanderthal rock art, according to a team of scientists who studied the site. The find is significant because it indicates that modern humans and their extinct cousins shared the capacity for abstract expression. The study, released Monday by the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, examined grooves in a rock that had been covered with sediment. Archaeologists had previously found artifacts associated with Neanderthal culture in the overlying layer, suggesting that the engravings must be older, said Clive Finlayson, one of the study's authors. \\"It is the last nail in the coffin for the hypothesis that Neanderthals were cognitively inferior to modern humans,\\" said Paul Tacon, an expert in rock art at Australia's Griffith University. Tacon, who was not involved in the study, said the research showed that the engravings were made with great effort for ritual purposes, to communicate with others, or both. \\"We will never know the meaning the design held for the maker or the Neanderthals who inhabited the cave but the fact that they were marking their territory in this way before modern humans arrived in the region has huge implications for debates about what it is to be human and the origin of art,\\" said Tacon. Not everyone is convinced: Another recently published study examining the dating of various archaeological sites across Europe raises the possibility that the artifacts may not have been made by Neanderthals but by modern humans. Neanderthals disappeared between 41,030 and 39,260 years ago, while modern humans arrived in Europe about 45,000-43,000 years ago, according to that study, leaving several thousand years of overlap. \\"Any discovery that helps improve the public image of Neanderthals is welcome,\\" said Clive Gamble, an archaeologist at the University of Southampton, England. \\"We know they spoke, lived in large social groups, looked after the sick, buried their dead and were highly successful in the ice age environments of northern latitudes. As a result rock engraving should be entirely within their grasp.\\" \\"What is critical, however, is the dating,\\" said Gamble. \\"While I want Neanderthals to be painting, carving and engraving, I'm reserving judgment.\\" But Finlayson, who is the director of the heritage division at the Gibraltar Museum, is certain that the artifacts, and therefore the engravings, were made by Neanderthals. \\"All European Neanderthal fossil sites from this period, including Devil's Tower Rock Shelter just one mile from Gorham's Cave, have this technology associated,\\" he said in an email. \\"In contrast no modern human site in Europe has this type of technology. So we are confident that the tools were made by Neanderthals.\\" ___ Follow Frank Jordans on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/wirereporter ||||| An engraving found at a cave in Gibraltar may be the most compelling evidence yet for Neanderthal art. The pattern, which bears a passing resemblance to the grid for a game of noughts and crosses, was inscribed on a rock at the back of Gorham's Cave. Image copyright STEWART FINLAYSON Mounting evidence suggests Neanderthals were not the brutes they were characterised as decades ago. But art, a high expression of abstract thought, was long considered to be the exclusive preserve of our own species. The scattered candidates for artistic expression by Neanderthals have not met with universal acceptance. However, the geometric pattern identified in Gibraltar, on the southern tip of Europe, was uncovered beneath undisturbed sediments that have also yielded Neanderthal tools. Details of the discovery by an international team of researchers has been published in the journal PNAS. There is now ample evidence that Neanderthal intellectual abilities may have been underestimated. Recent finds suggest they intentionally buried their dead, adorned themselves with feathers, painted their bodies with black and red pigments, and consumed a more varied diet than had previously been supposed. One of the study's authors, Prof Clive Finlayson, director of the Gibraltar Museum, said the latest find \\"brings the Neanderthals closer to us, yet again\\". Image copyright Stewart & Clive Finlayson, Gibraltar Museum Image caption Gorham's Cave is located on the south-east face of Gibraltar Image copyright Stewart & Clive Finlayson, Gibraltar Museum Image caption Today, the sea is a short distance away, but when the cave was first inhabited, the shore was several kilometres away Previous candidates for Neanderthal cave art exist, including motifs from caves in northern and southern Spain. Possible jewellery has been found at a site in central France, and there are even claims Neanderthals were responsible for an early musical instrument - a bone \\"flute\\" found at Divje Babe in Slovenia. These proposed flickerings of abstract thought among our ancient relatives have all proven controversial. But the authors of the PNAS study went to great lengths to demonstrate the intentional nature of the Gorham's Cave design. In order to understand how the markings were made, experimental grooves were made using different tools and cutting actions on blocks of dolomite rock similar to the one at Gorham's cave. The method that best matched the engraving was one in which a pointed tool or cutting edge was carefully and repeatedly inserted into an existing groove and passed along in the same direction. This, the authors argue, would appear to rule out an accidental origin for the design, such as cutting meat or fur on top of the rock. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'Compelling evidence' for Neanderthal art has been found in cave in Gibraltar Francesco d'Errico is director of research at the French Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) in Bordeaux, and oversaw these experiments. \\"[Dolomite] is a very hard rock, so it requires a lot of effort to produce the lines,\\" he told BBC News. The archaeologist estimates that the full engraving would have required 200-300 strokes with a stone cutting tool, taking at least an hour to create. \\"If you did it in a single session, you would most probably injure your hand, unless you cover your tool with a piece of skin,\\" he said. Prof d'Errico explained that the rock was in a very visible location in the cave and that the engraving would have stood out to any visitors. \\"It does not necessarily mean that it is symbolic - in the sense that it represents something else - but it was done on purpose,\\" he said. Clive Finlayson said team members deliberately avoided speculation in their scientific paper as they wanted it to be a \\"watertight\\" description of the discovery. But, he explained: \\"One intriguing aspect is that the engraving is at the point in the cave where the cave's orientation changes by 90 degrees. Image copyright Stewart & Clive Finlayson, Gibraltar Museum Image caption Team members Prof Joaquin Rodriguez Vidal (L) and Francisco Giles Pacheco (R) inspect the engraving Image copyright Stewart & Clive Finlayson, Gibraltar Museum Image caption The geometric pattern was discovered during excavation work by an international team in July 2012 \\"It's almost like Clapham Junction, like it's showing an intersection. I'm speculating, but it does make you wonder whether it has something to do with mapping, or saying: 'This is where you are'.\\" Prof d'Errico added: \\"It's in a fixed location so, for example, it could be something to indicate to other Neanderthals visiting the cave that somebody was already using it, or that there was a group that owned that cave.\\" The researchers also carried out an analysis of the likely position of the person when they were making the engraving, and whether it was likely to have been made by a left- or right-hander, but they have decided not to publish these results for the time being. The engraving was first spotted in July 2012 by Francisco Giles Pacheco, an eagle-eyed team member who is director of the Archaeological Museum of El Puerto Santa Maria, Spain. Sediments covering the engraving have previously yielded stone tools made in the Mousterian style, which is considered diagnostic of Neanderthals. However, other researchers note that such artefacts turn up in North Africa, where there is no trace of habitation by Neanderthals. They have previously reasoned that if Homo sapiens made the Mousterian tools in Africa, they might also be responsible for the ones in Gibraltar. Some 28km of sea separates Gibraltar from the coast of North Africa, and if you look south from the Rock on a clear day, it's hard to miss Jebel Musa - part of Morocco's Rif mountains - rising above the horizon. However, Prof Finlayson says there is no evidence that modern humans made the crossing until much later. In addition, he points out, Mousterian tools are associated with Neanderthal skeletal remains at the Devil's Tower site in Gibraltar. Another possibility is that Neanderthals were imitating the behaviour of modern humans they'd come into contact with. While Homo sapiens was in Europe by around 45,000 years ago, Prof Finlayson says the moderns reached southern Iberia later than some other regions, casting doubt on the copycat idea. But Dr Matt Pope, a Palaeolithic archaeologist at University College London, who was not involved with the latest study, was less convinced. \\"The engravings do appear intentional and it's hard to easily envisage a purely functional explanation for them. Consequently it's useful to consider these structured scratches as deriving from abstract or symbolic thought,\\" he told BBC News. \\"But linking them directly to Neanderthal populations, or proving Neanderthals made them without any contact with modern humans is harder. The dates presented here are indirect, referring to material from within sediments covering the engravings and not the marks themselves. \\"Given the dates also span a period when we know modern humans have reached Europe, a period where we have unresolved 'transitional' archaeological evidence difficult to attribute to either population, I'd be cautious in accepting Neanderthal authorship.\\" He added: \\"Certainly, the Gibraltar team have provided another piece of compelling, important evidence which will help bring this period into sharper focus and under deeper scrutiny.\\" Follow Paul on Twitter. ||||| NEW YORK (Reuters) - Belying their reputation as the dumb cousins of early modern humans, Neanderthals created cave art, an activity regarded as a major cognitive step in the evolution of humankind, scientists reported on Monday in a paper describing the first discovery of artwork by this extinct species. The discovery is \\"a major contribution to the redefinition of our perception of Neanderthal culture,\\" said prehistorian William Rendu of the French National Centre for Scientific Research, who was not involved in the work. \\"It is a new and even stronger evidence of the Neanderthal capacity for developing complex symbolic thought\\" and \\"abstract expression,\\" abilities long believed exclusive to early modern humans. In recent years researchers have discovered that Neanderthals buried their dead, adorned themselves with black and red pigments, wore shell and feather jewelry and cared for the elderly and infirm, all evidence of complex thought. But no unambiguously Neanderthal art was ever found. The new study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, could change that. Researchers from 11 European institutions reported that deep in Gorham's Cave in Gibraltar, overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, they found carvings that resemble nothing so much as a rococo Twitter hashtag: eight partially crisscrossing lines with three shorter lines on the right and two on the left, incised on a shelf of bedrock jutting out from the wall about 16 inches (40 cm) above the cave floor. The engraving is covered by undisturbed sediment that contains 294 previously discovered stone tools. They are in a style long known as the signature of Neanderthals, who had reached Europe from Africa some 300,000 years ago. Standard techniques had dated the tools at 39,000 years old, about when Neanderthals went extinct, meaning the art below it must be older. Modern humans, who painted the famous caves at Lascaux in France and Altimira in Spain, by then had not reached the region where Gorham's Cave is located. The researchers ruled out the possibility that the engravings were accidental or from cutting meat or animal skins. Instead, they were made by repeatedly and intentionally using a sharp stone tool to etch the rock, reflecting persistence and determination: one line required at least 54 strokes and the entire pattern as many as 317. \\"This engraving represents a deliberate design conceived to be seen by its Neanderthal maker and, considering its size and location, by others in the cave as well,\\" anthropologist Clive Finlayson, director of the Gibraltar Museum, and his colleagues wrote. \\"It follows that the ability for abstract thought was not exclusive\\" to modern humans. Another hint that Neanderthals created art came in 2012, when archaeologists dated simple wall paintings (mostly red dots and hand stencils) in Spain's El Castillo Cave to 41,000 years old. That made them the world's oldest prehistoric art and old enough for it to have been made by Neanderthals. But because no artifacts were found, it was not possible to definitively rule out modern humans as the artists.

The heroic female warrior Britomart (representing both chastity and Elizabeth I) battles through obstacles to reach the chamber in which Amoret is being held, and slays Busirane moments before he is able to kill Amoret.Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret was intended by Etty to illustrate the virtues of chastity and honour. It shows the moment in which Busirane is interrupted by Britomart as he prepares to kill Amoret. Amoret is chained to a gilded Solomonic column, carved with depictions of Venus, and her clothes fall from her shoulders as she struggles. Britomart, clad in armour, enters Busirane's Moorish chamber, and tramples a blood-stained grimoire as she swings her sword. Busirane, naked from the waist up and with Chinese-style trousers and queue, falls to the floor, his blade still pointing at Amoret's heart. Unusually for Etty, Britomart is painted very thinly, with the canvas weave still visible through the paint. Art historian Alison Smith considers that this was likely inspired by Henry Fuseli, who painted a depiction of Britomart using the same style of painting.In the original poem, Busirane had tortured and cut out the heart of the still-living Amoret by the time of her rescue. When he came to paint Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret Etty had created numerous scenes of combat and death, and would later achieve a degree of critical approbation when it became known that he visited mortuaries to sketch cadavers to ensure the accuracy of his depictions of bodies in varying stages of decomposition. However, he had an aversion to \\"the offensive and revolting butchery, some have delighted and even revelled in\\", and disliked the depiction of gratuitous violence.

Is it true that trends come and go? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Available options: (1). no; (2). yes;","output":"Yes, these questions are essentially asking the same thing. They both revolve around the concept of trends coming and going. While the first question focuses on how trends come and go, the second is primarily asking for confirmation about the cyclical nature of trends. Therefore, the answer is (2). yes. Now, let us delve into the topic of trends, specifically how they come and go. A trend refers to a pattern of change or development which gains popularity or becomes a cultural phenomenon within a particular time frame. Trends affect various aspects of our lives, including fashion, technology, arts, entertainment, and even linguistics. The life cycle of a trend comprises several stages, including emergence, growth, maturity, and decline. It is essential to understand that the cycle of trends is inevitable, and this process affects all aspects of our society. 1. Emergence: This stage marks the birth of a trend. It begins with the adoption of a particular style, behavior, or idea by a group or segment of society. In many instances, trends emerge from innovative ideas or inspiration from existing cultural elements. Early adopters and influencers, including celebrities and social media personalities, often play a significant role in promoting new trends. 2. Growth: Following the emergence stage, the trend gradually gains traction and becomes more widespread. During the growth phase, the public becomes more aware of the trend, leading to increased adoption by a broader audience. Media outlets, advertisements, and word of mouth play a significant role in driving the growth of a trend. 3. Maturity: At this stage, the trend reaches its peak in popularity. A significant percentage of the target population has embraced the trend, and it becomes a significant part of mainstream culture. The maturity stage often coincides with mass production and accessibility of products or services associated with the trend. 4. Decline: As the novelty of the trend starts to wane, public interest begins to decline. The oversaturation of the market, the emergence of new or competing trends, or a shift in societal norms may contribute to the decreasing popularity of the trend. This phase signifies the beginning of the end for the trend, with fewer people identifying with or participating in it. 5. Rebirth: In some cases, trends experience a resurgence after a period of decline. This rebirth may occur due to nostalgia, reinterpretation, or adaptation for a new audience. Resurgence can happen in cyclical patterns, such as fashion trends or the revival of classic films and television shows. The life cycle of trends demonstrates how trends come and go, consistently shaping societal norms and preferences. The influence of various factors, including technological advancements, economic factors, cultural shifts, and personal tastes, contributes to the complexity and unpredictability of trends. An understanding of the nature of trends can help businesses, organizations, and individuals adapt to changing environments and stay ahead of the curve."},{"instruction":"This is some data: The Twenty Two eatType pub; The Twenty Two customer rating low; The Twenty Two area riverside; The Twenty Two near Café Sicilia.

Movie title: Attack of the Killer Tomatoes Movie plot: The film opens with a scroll saying that when Alfred Hitchcock's film The Birds (1963) was released, audiences laughed at the notion of birds revolting against humanity, but when an attack perpetrated by birds occurred in 1975, no one laughed. This is followed by a pre-credits sequence of a tomato rising out of a woman's garbage disposal unit. Her puzzlement turns into terror as the tomato draws her into a corner. Following the credits, the police investigate her death. One officer discovers that the red substance she is covered with is not blood, but tomato juice. A series of attacks perpetrated by tomatoes occur (including a man dying by drinking tomato juice made from a killer tomato, a boy heard being gobbled up by a killer tomato, and a sequence where the tomatoes attack innocent swimmers, in a parody of Jaws). While the President's press secretary Jim Richardson tries to convince the public that there is no credible threat, the president puts together a team of specialists to stop the tomatoes led by a man named Mason Dixon. Dixon's team includes Sam Smith, a disguise expert who is seen at various points dressed as, among other things, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Adolf Hitler; Navy diver Greg Colburn; Olympic swimmer Gretta Attenbaum; and parachute-toting soldier Wilbur Finletter. Smith is sent out to infiltrate the tomatoes at a campfire, eventually blowing his cover while eating a hamburger and asking if anyone could \\"pass the ketchup.\\" Colburn and Gretta are sent to sectors, while Finletter stays with Mason.

The young bear is thought to have developed pneumonia and was discovered on its back lying on its mother's chest at Ueno Zoo in Tokyo. It was the first time the zoo's natural breeding programme had led to a birth, and heartwarming photos of proud mother Shin Shin cuddling her new baby had been shown around the world. Scroll down for video. Tragic: Just six after Japan celebrated the birth of its first panda bear in 24 years the newborn cub has been found dead. Heartbroken: It was the first time the zoo's natural breeding programme had been successful, and heartwarming photos of proud mother Shin Shin cuddling her new baby had been shown around the world. The baby had been kept in an incubator earlier this week, but had been returned to its mother on Tuesday. Keepers tried to massaged the panda's heart after it was found at the zoo, but the cub was declared dead an hour later. Experts say pandas often struggle to conceive naturally, particularly when they are on public display. The birth was captured on night. vision webcam and a video showing Shin Shin giving birth and holding the. tiny baby to her chest was released by the zoo. The cub was the first panda to be born after being conceived naturally in Japanese history. The task is extremely difficult task as female pandas are only in heat for 72 hours over the entire year and can only become pregnant during a 24 hour slot. In the wild female pandas normally have a cub every two or three years. Love and care: Shin Shin cuddles her newly born baby holding the cub close to her chest. The unnamed cub was too young to have gained the characteristic black. marks and its size is not living up to the name of Giant Panda. The baby panda was still unnamed when it died, but suggestions for names had caused a stir even before it was born. Shin Shin's pregnancy was only announced by Japanese governor Shintaro Ishihara last month. He said the bear would be called Sen Sen or Kaku Kaku – a wordplay on the disputed Senkaku Islands which are part of Japan but are claimed by both Taiwan and China. The giant panda is threatened by loss of habitat, poaching and a low reproduction rate. Females in the wild normally have a cub once every two to three years. Only about 1,600 pandas live in the wild, mostly in China's southwestern Sichuan province. Around 300 live in captivity mostly in Chinese breeding centres and zoos but also in foreign zoos around the world. China’s policy on panda export is very strict in order to protect their national symbol. A panda is never sold to a foreign country, but is instead on loan for a yearly fee of up to £650,000. There is also a clause that any cubs born during the loan belong to the People's Republic of China and have to be returned within two years. He got a quick response from Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei regarding the islands, known to the Chinese as the Diaoyu. Speaking at a press conference in the capital the spokesman said: ‘Ishihara’s scheme to undermine China-Japan relations is a clumsy performance. It will only tarnish the image of Japan and Tokyo,’ ‘No matter what names the Japanese side gives, it cannot change the fact that the two pandas belong to China. ‘Likewise, what names Japan gives to the Diaoyu Island and the adjacent isles, it cannot change the fact that these islands belong to China.’ The zoo's panda team, comprised of five. workers and four veterinarians, will continue using two cameras to. observe the pair 24 hours a day for about a week, and have been joined. by a breeding expert from Sichuan, China, where Shin Shin grew up. Visitors to the zoo eager to see the. baby will be disappointed as Ueno Zoo, which is the oldest in Japan, has. expressed wishes to keep the cub and mother away from the public for. another six months. Shin Shin and her mate, Ri Ri, are on loan from China for 10 years. Under the terms of the agreement between Japan and China, the cub will be sent back in two years. Sad: Experts say pandas often struggle to conceive naturally, particularly when they are on public display. VIDEO: Staff from the UENO Zoo in Tokyo are visibly upset about the death of the panda... Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"The article discusses the tragic death of a newborn panda cub at Ueno Zoo in Tokyo, just six days after its much-celebrated birth. The cub, which was the first naturally conceived panda in Japan's history, was found lying lifelessly on its mother's chest, likely having developed pneumonia. Ueno Zoo staff placed the cub back with its mother on Tuesday after keeping it in an incubator, but sadly, an hour-long attempt to resuscitate the panda by massaging its heart was unsuccessful. The birth of the panda cub was a significant achievement, as female pandas are only in heat for 72 hours each year, with a mere 24-hour window for successful conception. The birth and first moments of the cub were captured on a night vision webcam and then shared with the public. However, the unnamed cub was too young to have developed the characteristic black and white markings of a panda. The giant panda faces various threats, including habitat loss, poaching, and a low reproduction rate. Approximately 1,600 pandas live in the wild, with the majority being in China's Sichuan province, and around 300 live in captivity across Chinese breeding centers and zoos worldwide. The Chinese government exercises strict export policies for pandas, only permitting loans for a yearly fee and with the stipulation that any cubs born during the loan must be returned within two years.

Nolan's crew is looking for a great white shark for a local aquarium, but a scientist named Ken (Robert Carradine) is targeted by the shark. An orca comes and kills the shark, saving Ken. This switches Nolan's target to the orca. While Nolan is on the journey with his crew, he tries to capture what he believes to be a bull orca, but mistakenly harpoons a pregnant female. Nolan and his crew get the orca on board, where she subsequently miscarries. The captain hoses the dead fetus overboard as the male orca looks on screaming. Seeking release of his near-dead mate, the male orca tries to sink the ship. One of Nolan's crew members, Novak (Keenan Wynn), cuts the female off the ship, but the male leaps up and drags him into the sea, too. The following day, the orca pushes his now dead mate onto shore. Alan Swain (Scott Walker) berates Nolan on his actions after finding the dead whale. Nolan denies responsibility, but Swain and the villagers eventually find out his involvement. The villagers insist that he kill the orca, as his presence is causing the fish vital to the village's economy to migrate. The orca then terrorises the village by sinking fishing boats in broad daylight and then breaking fuel lines, thus destroying the village's fuel reserves. Dr. Rachel Bedford (Charlotte Rampling), a colleague of Ken and a whale expert, shows him how similar whales are to humans and tells Nolan that, \\"If he [the orca] is like a human, what he wants isn't necessarily what he should have.\\" Nolan confesses to Bedford that he empathises with the whale, as his own wife and unborn child had previously been killed in a car crash caused by a drunk driver.
