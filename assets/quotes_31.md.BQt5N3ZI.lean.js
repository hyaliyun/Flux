He attended Brookline High School (a 1991 graduate), and played baseball for the Brookline High School Warriors, but dreamed of working for the Red Sox. Epstein attended Yale University where he lived at Jonathan Edwards College. He served as sports editor of the Yale Daily News. Context: After leaving the position as the Padres' President, Lucchino became president and chief executive officer (CEO) of the Red Sox on November 15, 2001 and hired Epstein to work under him. At the end of the 2002 season, Lucchino appointed Epstein to replace interim general manager (GM) Mike Port. Epstein is credited with initiating the trade of Nomar Garciaparra and making key contract acquisitions including those of Kevin Millar and Curt Schilling during his first tenure as Red Sox GM. The new players were regarded as instrumental in breaking the so-called \\"Curse of the Bambino\\" when the Red Sox defeated the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2004 World Series. It was the Red Sox' first World Series championship since 1918, ending what remains the third longest championship drought in the history of any Major League team, after the Chicago White Sox (1917-2005) and the Chicago Cubs (1908-2016).  On October 31, 2005, Epstein resigned, rejecting a three-year, 1.5-million-per-year contract for personal reasons. According to The Boston Globe, \\"This is a job you have to give your whole heart and soul to\\", he said. \\"In the end, after a long period of reflection about myself and the program, I decided I could no longer put my whole heart and soul into it.\\" Because it was Halloween the night he resigned from the Red Sox, Epstein left Fenway Park wearing a gorilla suit in an attempt to avoid reporters. A witness reported spotting a person wearing a gorilla suit driving a Volvo similar to Epstein's that night. The suit was loaned to him and was later auctioned for 11,000. The money raised was given to The Jimmy Fund and the Foundation to be Named Later (FTBNL).  Epstein remained in contact with the team's front office and on January 12, 2006, he and Red Sox management announced his return. Six days later, the team announced that he would resume the title of general manager and add the title of executive vice president. In November 2007, Epstein announced, at the annual general manager meeting, that he had signed a new contract with the Red Sox but declined to disclose the terms of the deal.  In December 2007, Epstein was mentioned in the Mitchell Report regarding a November 2006 email exchange he had had with Red Sox scout Marc DelPiano on the possible acquisition of closer Eric Gagne. In the email, Epstein asked DelPiano, \\"Have you done any digging on Gagne? I know the Dodgers think he was a steroid guy. Maybe so. What do you hear on his medical?\\" DelPiano replied that \\"steroids IS the issue\\" with Gagne, questioned his \\"poise and commitment\\" and expressed questions about his durability \\"without steroid help.\\" Despite DelPiano's reservations about Gagne, Epstein traded Kason Gabbard and minor league outfielders David Murphy and Engel Beltre to the Texas Rangers for Gagne on July 31, 2007. Question: Was there anything else interesting in this article about the red sox? Answer:","output":"Yes, there are a few more interesting things in this article about the Red Sox.

Another interesting point is Theo Epstein's return to the Red Sox in January 2006. He resumed the title of general manager and added the title of executive vice president. He also signed a new contract with the Red Sox in November 2007 but didn't disclose the terms of the deal. Also, in December 2007, Epstein was mentioned in the Mitchell Report because of an email exchange with a Red Sox scout about the possible acquisition of closer Eric Gagne.

Under U.S. law, all top government officials are required to file annual financial disclosure documents with the agency. In Tuesday's 92-page filing, Trump acknowledged that he'd reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, last year for more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses incurred in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 that Cohen paid to an adult film star to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied having the tryst but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen to stop “false and extortionist accusations” about it. The financial disclosure did not say why Trump had not listed the payment in his previous financial filing, but the ethics agency said the reimbursement constituted a loan that should have been reported. That has set off a firestorm of criticism and calls for an investigation into whether Trump violated federal law by omitting the payment from his 2017 disclosure. The controversy has overshadowed other details in Trump's financial disclosure, which is the only publicly available snapshot into the president's finances — his debts, assets and income from dozens of companies and partnerships around the world. Here are six noteworthy takeaways from the report: Golf losses. Trump, an avid golfer who frequently visits his golf courses, sometimes in the company of world leaders, listed 17 golf companies in his disclosure form, with 13 reporting losses. Overall, golf-related revenue plunged to 210 million from nearly 300 million from the previous reporting period. However, the president's struggling golf courses in Turnberry, Scotland, and Doonbeg, Ireland, improved their earnings, with income at the Turnberry property growing to more than 20 million from 14 million.

The loss of a parent can be overwhelming and life-altering. This was no different for the rapper who confessed that he felt like he had 'nothing to live for' after his mother's passing. In a recent interview, he admitted to frequently putting his life at risk during that dark period. It was during this difficult and tumultuous time that Kim Kardashian entered his life. The tabloid-favorite TV personality and entrepreneur possessed the heart, love, and strength that enabled the rapper to recover. Admitting that their relationship has been far from conventional, the rapper expressed his gratitude for Kim and daughter North, who ultimately saved him and helped him transform his life.

This is accompanied by low levels of fat which have a favourable mix of fatty acids. Chicken meat contains about two to three times as much polyunsaturated fat as most types of red meat when measured by weight. However, for boneless, skinless chicken breast, the amount is much lower. A 100-g serving of baked chicken breast contains 4 g of fat and 31 g of protein, compared to 10 g of fat and 27 g of protein for the same portion of broiled, lean skirt steak. Now answer this question: What is the nutitional value to humans of poultry and poultry products?","output":"Poultry and poultry products offer significant nutritional value to humans, making them an essential part of many diets around the world. Poultry meat, specifically chicken, and eggs are particularly beneficial due to their high-quality protein content. Proteins are essential for the body as they are the building blocks of body tissue and can also serve as a fuel source. They play a vital role in body functions such as the formation of enzymes and hormones, muscle repair, and maintaining immune health. In a 100-gram serving of baked chicken – boneless and skinless – there is roughly 31 grams of protein. This amount of protein would provide approximately 62% of the daily recommended intake for an average female, and about 51% for an average male. This high protein-content can contribute to satiety, weight management, and muscle growth and repair, confirming poultry meat as a beneficial dietary component. In addition to protein, poultry meat also contains low levels of fat, with a favourable mix of fatty acids. Chicken meat contains, on a weight basis, about two to three times as much polyunsaturated fat as most types of red meat. Polyunsaturated fats are considered healthier fats and include omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which are essential for the body. These fats help lower levels of LDL cholesterol (the \\"bad\\" cholesterol), reduce inflammation, and may reduce the risk of heart disease.  However, it is also worth noting that not all parts of the chicken have the same nutritional value. For instance, boneless, skinless chicken breast has much lower fat content, with only 4 grams of fat per 100-gram serving, compared to other parts with skin or cooking methods with added oils or fats. Eggs produced by poultry are also nutritionally rich. They are an affordable, accessible protein source and contain a variety of vitamins and minerals essential for health. These include Vitamin B12, Vitamin D, Vitamin A, and iron. Plus, eggs are one of the few food sources of choline, a nutrient that's essential for brain development. In conclusion, the nutritional value to humans of poultry and poultry products is substantial. Their high-quality protein, low and favourable fat content, and the plethora of vital vitamins and minerals found within them make them an essential part of a balanced diet. They contribute to maintaining and building body tissues, managing weight, supporting brain development and heart health, among other functions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Little do they know the truth about the crater. Walker is a dedicated scientist with a curious mind, but he also has a deep personal connection to the search for extraterrestrial life. His mother, who was his source of inspiration, disappeared while working on a classified government project on extraterrestrial signals. Walker has since been obsessively searching for any clues regarding her disappearance. As the team settles into their research camp near the crater, they are met by Sayida Awad, a local anthropologist, who has knowledge about the crater's history and the unexplained phenomena that have been reported by the natives. Strange stories of missing people and mysterious lights over the crater fascinate and intrigue the team, but they initially dismiss them as superstitions and folklore. Act 2: Walker and the team descend into the depths of the crater equipped with the latest scientific equipment. The deeper the team goes, the stranger things become. Unexplainable magnetic fields, bizarre radio signals, and peculiar luminescent organisms are some of the findings they come across. One night, while examining the anomalous radio signals, Walker starts to receive cryptic messages in his mother's voice, urging him to follow the trail and venture deeper into the crate. The messages leave Walker both distraught and determined. He hides this information from the rest of the team, fearing they may think he is losing his sanity. Despite being warned by Sayida and experiencing the strange occurrences plaguing the team members, Walker becomes obsessed by the quest. His determination to find the truth behind his mother's disappearance forms a fierce internal conflict between his scientific perspective and the unfathomable unknown. Act 3: As the team prepares to leave the crater due to lack of significant findings and continuous inexplicable occurrences, Walker secretly decides to stay behind and investigate further. As night falls, he feels an irresistible pull towards the crater's center. He can no longer resist the calling, and heads towards the source. On reaching the heart of the crater, Walker discovers a concealed and technologically advanced underground alien base. He gathers up his courage and walks inside, trying to unravel the alien technology and understanding their mission. Walker comes across a room where he finds his mother in a state of suspended animation. He realizes that she has been kept alive by the aliens for her knowledge on extraterrestrial signals. The aliens, who have been observing Walker all this time, finally reveal themselves. They explain that they abducted his mother to utilize her expertise to communicate with their home planet. They have been stranded on Earth after their spaceship crash-landed, forming the massive crater. Realizing the sincerity in Walker's quest, the aliens allow his mother to return with him, as they have managed to make contact with their home planet. Epilogue: Upon returning to the surface with his mother, Walker reunites with the shocked team members. They collectively decide to maintain the secret of the alien base to protect the extraterrestrial lifeforms from the world's destructive nature. Walker learns that sometimes, the answers to the universe's biggest mysteries lie in the unexplainable intersection of science and the unknown. The movie ends with Walker and his mother witnessing the alien ship leaving the underground base and ascending into the sky, their mission complete, and the crater once again becoming serene and devoid of its previous mysteries. The mother and son embrace, knowing that they have been a part of something truly extraordinary."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

Is the Madrigal Ocean probably connected to more or less rivers than the Listy Ocean?  The Madrigal Ocean and the Listy Ocean are two bodies of water currently under observation by scientists on a planet nearly identical to Earth. Although the studies have just started, the scientists have already discovered that the salinity of the Madrigal Ocean is much lower than that of the Listy Ocean. This isn't much information, but it's progress and the scientists are not going to stop their studies until they learn all that they can about these waters.  Hint: Located mostly in the Arctic north polar region in the middle of the Northern Hemisphere, the Arctic Ocean is almost completely surrounded by Eurasia and North America. It is partly covered by sea ice throughout the year and almost completely in winter. The Arctic Ocean's surface temperature and salinity vary seasonally as the ice cover melts and freezes; its salinity is the lowest on average of the five major oceans, due to low evaporation, heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities.

Intercept Pharma's Shares Are Spiking After a Key FDA Panel Backing Intercept Pharmaceuticals’ icpt stock rose as much as 11% in after-hours trading on Thursday after an FDA advisory committee unanimously recommended approval of a rare liver disease treatment developed by the company. But shares slumped nearly 7% in early trading Friday after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock. Although Intercept’s shares have surged more than 30% in the past month in anticipation of the FDA ruling, Morgan Stanley analysts concluded that the liver drug may not fulfill its market potential due to safety concerns in some patients with more advanced versions of the disease. Intercept is working on a treatment for primary biliary cirrhosis, or PBC, a chronic liver ailment that can eventually degrade bile ducts to the point of permanent scarring. The disease disproportionately affects women. Thursday’s advisory panel voted 17-0 in favor of approving the drug despite some previously stated safety concerns. The FDA isn’t required to follow independent panel recommendations, but usually does, making the therapy’s approval all but assured. The agency will decide whether or not to approve the treatment by May 29. While an approval for PBC could bring in millions in sales, some analysts have also predicted that number could balloon into the billions if the Intercept drug can win an FDA approval for the more common nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, a condition in which fatty deposits in the liver cause inflammation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The governor of Louisiana and founder of New Orleans, Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville determined to stop Chickasaw trade with the British. In 1721 he was able to incite the Choctaw who began to raid Chickasaw villages, and to ambush pack trains along the Trader's Path leading to Charleston, South Carolina. In response, the Chickasaw regrouped their villages more tightly for defense, and cemented relations with their British source of guns by establishing a settlement at Savannah Town, South Carolina, in 1723. They blocked French traffic on the Mississippi River by occupying Chickasaw Bluff near present day Memphis, and bargained for peace with the Choctaw. Bienville himself was recalled to France in 1724 . On and off over the following years, the French successfully reignited the Indian conflict. The Choctaw pursued their familiar hit and run tactics: ambushing hunting parties, killing trader's horses, devastating croplands after using superior numbers to drive the Chickasaw into their forts, and killing peace emissaries. Illini and Iroquois occasionally pitched in from the north as well. This war of attrition effectively wore the Chickasaw down, reaching a crisis level in the late 1730s and especially the early 1740s. After a lapse due to strife within the Choctaw, the bloody harassment resumed in the 1750s. The Chickasaw remained obstinate, their situation forcing them to adhere even more closely to the British. In 1734, Bienville returned to Louisiana, and waged grand campaigns against the Chickasaw in the European style.

Upon entering the restaurant, we were struck by the warm, elegant ambiance and exceptional attention to detail in the décor. The tasteful, intimate lighting and tastefully arranged tables created a cozy atmosphere that was perfect for our special occasion. Our server, Jane, greeted us promptly and cordially, taking the time to explain the evening's specials and answer any questions we had about the menu. Throughout our meal, she was attentive without being overbearing, striking just the right balance to make us feel well taken care of without feeling rushed or interrupted. The food itself was nothing short of phenomenal. We began our meal with the restaurant's signature appetizer, the Mushroom Brie Soufflé, which featured a rich, creamy, and perfectly seasoned filling encased in a delicate, golden-brown pastry crust. I can honestly say that it was one of the best appetizers I've ever tasted. For our entrees, I chose the Herb-Crusted Lamb Chops while my husband opted for the Seared Scallops and Risotto. Both dishes were flawlessly executed, showcasing the skill and creativity of The Culinary Castle's talented chefs. The Herb-Crusted Lamb Chops were tender and succulent, with just the right amount of pinkness in the center, and the accompanying garlic mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus were the perfect accompaniment. My husband's Seared Scallops were equally impressive, boasting a beautiful sear and a creamy, savory risotto that left us discussing the dish long after we'd finished it. We ended our meal with the Chocolate Decadence Cake and were once again blown away by the impeccable quality of the dessert. Rich, moist, and not too sweet, it was an ideal way to conclude our memorable dining experience. Overall, our time at The Culinary Castle was nothing short of extraordinary, and I cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough. From the warm, inviting atmosphere and flawless service to the outstanding, innovative dishes prepared with the finest ingredients, every aspect of our meal was a testament to the restaurant's commitment to delivering a first-class dining experience. I have no doubt that we will be back to celebrate many more special occasions at The Culinary Castle and can confidently encourage others to do the same."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The following article contains an answer for the question: Who later trains the tomboy? , can you please find it?   In the year 1978, Gracie Bowen, a 15-year-old tomboy who lives in South Orange, New Jersey, is crazy about soccer, as are her three brothers and their former soccer star father. Although Gracie wants to join her brothers and neighbor Kyle in the nightly practices her father runs, she is discouraged by everyone except her older brother, Johnny. Johnny, Gracie and Kyle attend Columbia High School, where Johnny is the captain and star player for the varsity soccer team. After missing a shot at the end of a game, the despondent Johnny drives off with a friend's car and dies in a traffic accident. Struggling with grief, Gracie decides that she wants to replace her brother on the team. Her father does not believe that girls should play soccer, telling her she is neither tough nor talented enough. Her mother is a nurse who lacks the competitive drive of the rest of her family and fears for Gracie's safety. Her mother later tells Gracie that she would have liked to become a surgeon, but that option had not been available to her as a woman. Rejected and depressed, Gracie begins to rebel; she stops doing her schoolwork, is caught cheating on an exam, and experiments with wild and self-destructive behavior. She is finally caught by her father almost having sex with a guy she met near the docks after telling her friend, \\"I want to do something that I've never done before.\\" This serves as a wake-up call for her parents, particularly her father.

The NAACP argued that although schools were not legally segregated, the city of Detroit and its surrounding counties had enacted policies to maintain racial segregation in public schools. The NAACP also suggested a direct relationship between unfair housing practices and educational segregation, which followed segregated neighborhoods. The District Court held all levels of government accountable for the segregation in its ruling. The Sixth Circuit Court affirmed some of the decision, holding that it was the state's responsibility to integrate across the segregated metropolitan area. The U.S. Supreme Court took up the case February 27, 1974. The subsequent Milliken v. Bradley decision had wide national influence. In a narrow decision, the Court found that schools were a subject of local control and that suburbs could not be forced to solve problems in the city's school district.\\". Can you tell me what it is?","output":"In the lawsuit filed by the NAACP on August 18, 1970, against Michigan state officials, the specific person called out was Governor William Milliken. The lawsuit charged him and other officials with de facto public school segregation. The NAACP alleged that even though there was no legal segregation in place, the city of Detroit and surrounding counties had implemented policies that perpetuated racial segregation in public schools. They further argued that this segregation was closely related to unfair housing practices, which led to segregated neighborhoods and, consequently, segregated educational institutions. The District Court's ruling held all levels of government accountable for the segregation, and the Sixth Circuit Court partially agreed, stating that it was the state's responsibility to integrate across the segregated metropolitan area. When the case reached the U.S. Supreme Court as Milliken v. Bradley, the Court ruled in a narrow decision that schools were a matter of local control, and suburban districts could not be forced to resolve problems within the city's school district.

This course of action offers a more reasonable and respectful way of getting to know someone better, as opposed to stalking them on social media (II), which could come across as invasive and creepy, or attending an event they may not be comfortable with (I). Given that Kendall has already expressed interest in continuing to know her match, she may look for ways to initiate a conversation, send them a message or get in touch through mutual acquaintances if they have any. She could also explore the possibility of connecting with them through the platform where the speed dating event was hosted, as it is common for such events to have a follow-up mechanism for successful matches. Once Kendall manages to make contact, she might want to gradually build a rapport with the person. This could involve exchanging messages, engaging in conversations on various topics, and understanding shared interests or values. As the relationship progresses, they could plan to meet up again in person - this time in a more relaxed setting, like at a coffee shop or a casual restaurant, to reduce the pressure of a formal date. During the initial conversations, Kendall should focus on striking a balance between showing genuine interest in getting to know her match and respecting their privacy. By being genuine and attentive, she can demonstrate that she is interested in learning more about them without infringing on their personal boundaries. In turn, this would allow the person to open up at their own pace, creating a solid foundation for potentially forming a strong, long-lasting connection. At the same time, Kendall should make sure to share information about herself as well and express her feelings honestly, ensuring the conversation goes both ways. Mutual understanding and transparency will help in nurturing trust and forging a healthy relationship with the individual. One important aspect Kendall should bear in mind is to always be patient and let the relationship develop naturally. By approaching her match in a respectful and sincere manner, along with giving each other adequate time to gauge the compatibility, Kendall may find herself entering into a meaningful relationship with the person she liked during the speed dating event."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - Alternative metal (also known as alt-metal) is a rock music genre that infuses heavy metal with influences from alternative rock and other genres not normally associated with metal. Alternative metal bands are often characterized by heavily downtuned, mid-paced guitar riffs, a mixture of accessible melodic vocals and harsh vocals and sometimes unconventional sounds within other heavy metal styles. The term has been in use since the 1980s, although it came into prominence in the 1990s.   - The Illusion of Progress is the sixth studio album by American rock band Staind. It was released on August 19, 2008. \\"The Illusion of Progress\\" was produced by Johnny K and recorded in lead singer Aaron Lewis' home studio. It debuted at No. 3 in the \\"Billboard\\" 200 with 91,800 units sold.  - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).  - \`\` King of All Excuses '' is the fourth and final single to be released from American alternative metal band Staind 's fifth studio album Chapter V.  - Staind is an American rock band, formed in 1995 in Springfield, Massachusetts. The original lineup consisted of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Aaron Lewis, lead guitarist Mike Mushok, bassist and backing vocalist Johnny April, and drummer Jon Wysocki (who left in May 2011). To date, the band has recorded seven studio albums: \\"Tormented\\" (1996), \\"Dysfunction\\" (1999), \\"Break the Cycle\\" (2001), \\"14 Shades of Grey\\" (2003), \\"Chapter V\\" (2005), \\"The Illusion of Progress\\" (2008), and their self-titled album (2011). The band has had five chart-topping singles and sold over 15 million records worldwide.   - Break the Cycle is the third studio album by American rock band Staind, released through Elektra Entertainment and Flip Records in 2001. It is Staind's most successful album to date, and was the album that broke them into the mainstream. It was a huge international success for the band, as it spent 3 weeks at number one position in the U.S. album charts and many weeks in the top 10 album charts of the \\"Billboard\\" 200, the UK and New Zealand. It sold at least 4 million copies in 2001. The album was certified 5x platinum by the RIAA.  - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources.  - Aaron Lewis (born April 13, 1972) is an American musician and songwriter, who is the lead vocalist, rhythm guitarist, and founding member of the rock group Staind, with whom he has released seven studio albums. He has since ventured into country music with his debut solo EP \\"Town Line\\", which was released on March 1, 2011 on Stroudavarious Records. Lewis' first full-length solo release, \\"The Road\\", was released by Blaster Records on November 13, 2012.  - 14 Shades of Grey is the fourth studio album by American rock band Staind, released on May 20, 2003. The album continues to develop a post-grunge sound seen on the band's previous album \\"Break the Cycle\\", though the songs on \\"14 Shades of Grey\\" have fewer pop hooks, focusing more on frontman Aaron Lewis's emotions. It is the band's last album to be released from Elektra Records.    Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'record label' with 'elektra records'.

Following the separate fatal police shootings of John Crawford III and Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old boy in Ohio, while each were holding BB guns, where grand juries decided not to indict any of the officers involved, Kasich created the Ohio Collaborative Community-Police Advisory Board \\"to address what he described as frustration and distrust among some Ohioans toward their police departments, particularly among the black community.\\" The 23-member task force (with 18 members appointed by Kasich) was appointed in January 2015 and issued its 629-page final report and recommendations in April 2015. The report recommended greater accountability and oversight for police agencies and officers, further community education and involvement in policing, and new use-of-force and recruitment, hiring, and training standards for police agencies.  In April 2015, Kasich created the Ohio Collaborative Community-Police Advisory Board, a twelve-member board tasked (in conjunction with the Ohio Office of Criminal Justice Services and the Ohio Department of Public Safety) with developing statewide standards for the recruiting, hiring and screening of police officers, and for the use of force (including deadly force) by police. The advisory board, the first of its kind in Ohio, was also tasked by Kasich with developing \\"model policies and best practice recommendations to promote better interaction and communication between law enforcement departments and their home communities.\\" In August 2015, the board issued its recommendations, which placed \\"an emphasis on the preservation of human life and restrict officers to defending themselves or others from death or serious injury.\\"  In August 2015, Kasich said that he was open to the idea of requiring police officers to wear body cameras. What did the report recommend?","output":"The report recommended a few important things to improve the relationship between the police and the community. These included: 1. Making sure police officers and their departments are more responsible and watched carefully. 2. Helping the community learn more about the police and get involved with them. 3. Creating new rules for how the police use force, hire new people, and train them. 4. The report also suggested that maybe police officers should wear body cameras to record what they do."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: How the Economic Recovery Is Leaving Many Behind By Rana Foroohar Monday, Aug. 12, 2013 Job seekers wait in line to meet with a recruiter during the East Bay's HIREvent on July 17, 2013 in Emeryville, Calif. For some time now, the U.S. has been the prettiest house on what is an ugly economic block. Look around: China and many of the other major emerging markets are slowing down, and Europe is in recession. The U.S., on the other hand, finally seems to be moving beyond 2% annual economic growth toward a more robust recovery. The big question is whether it will be a recovery for everyone. The answer so far seems to be a definitive no. The percentage of Americans in the labor force, arguably the most important measure of economic health, dropped to a 34-year low in May. That's as bad as it's been since women entered the labor force en masse in the 1980s, and it speaks to the fact that this recovery is weaker and has taken longer than rebounds of the past. We're 30 months on from when GDP returned to prerecession levels, but even at June's high level of job creation (195,000) it will take 15 months more to replace the jobs that were lost. While the unemployment figure is slowly ticking downward from the crisis' peak of 10%, it remains in double digits for certain groups, such as young people without college degrees and African Americans. Meanwhile, economic inequality has increased, since minorities were disproportionately hit in the housing crisis, and wages have stayed flat. It's hard to envision an inclusive recovery when a majority of Americans simply haven't got more money in their pockets. That puts the American Dream at risk. \\"If young Americans are to live better than their parents did, we have to expand employment, make the workforce more competitive and accelerate productivity growth,\\" which is strongly correlated with rising wages, says Susan Lund, a principal at the McKinsey Global Institute, which just released a report titled \\"Game Changers\\" on how to build a more robust recovery in the U.S. One key challenge will be to create more sustainable demand in an economy that is 70% driven by consumer spending. Yes, Americans have gone a long way toward repairing their balance sheets since 2008. Fewer of us have debt than we did back then. But those who do, including vulnerable groups like students and seniors, have 40% more debt than they did before the financial crisis, according to the Census Bureau. And consumer spending is still spotty. While overall retail sales have grown over the past year, June numbers came in far weaker than expected. Department-store sales were down for the fifth month in a row, and restaurant spending was sharply down as consumers once again ate in to save a dollar. People even bought fewer electronic gadgets for a third month running. The latest GDP figure--1.7%--shows we are still struggling to stay in a 2% economy. \\"To say we're doing better than Europe is meager consolation,\\" says Lund. \\"We need to do much better.\\" Of course, the economy is cyclical, and one bad quarter won't derail a recovery. What you want to see is sustained job growth, and the most recent new-hire numbers were stellar. The question is whether they were a blip or a real directional shift from what we've seen over the past several years. Even before the financial crisis, there were signs that the U.S. jobs engine was sputtering. Job creation from 2000 to 2007 was far weaker than in decades past. This is in part because small and new companies, which do much of the real hiring in the U.S., still have problems getting bank loans. Indeed, Urban Institute senior fellow Gene Steuerle believes that one key reason for the declining number of jobs being created by new businesses is that entrepreneurs have exhausted their personal savings, which most of them use in lieu of loans to fund investment. Banks, which claim they are trying to meet higher capital requirements, won't step in to help. This underscores the fact that five years on from the crisis, finance is still disconnected from the real economy. Sure, banks are recording record profits, but numerous studies show that as finance as a percentage of the economy grows, business creation actually tends to stall. A banking recovery isn't enough to turn the economy around--we need manufacturing and services to grow too. Yes, a manufacturing renaissance is under way. But it isn't your grandfather's manufacturing. Well-paid union jobs have given way to cheaper labor and to robots that do work that people used to do, which is partly why wages have remained flat. That's just another reason that too many Americans won't feel the buoyancy of this divided rebound for many years to come.","output":"The US economic recovery appears to be leaving many people behind, with the percentage of Americans in the labor force dropping to a 34-year low in May 2013. The recovery looks weaker and longer than previous rebounds, with unemployment still high for some groups and economic inequality on the rise. A key challenge for an inclusive recovery is creating sustainable demand in a consumer-driven economy. Banks are recording record profits, but studies show that when finance is a large part of the economy, business creation can stall. Although a manufacturing renaissance is happening, well-paid union jobs have been replaced by cheaper labor and automation, contributing to stagnant wages."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After discovering an antique metal plate near a construction site, Ernest shows it to Dr. Melon who believes that it came from a giant Revolutionary War cannon called \\"Goliath\\", (named after the legendary biblical giant). Dr. Melon had previously been ridiculed by his peers for theorizing that the real Crown Jewels of England were stolen during the Revolutionary War and were actually hidden inside the long-lost cannon.  They begin to search for the artifact near the construction site and eventually locate it inside an abandoned mine. They are ambushed by historical antiquity collector and Dr. Melon's colleague Dr. Glencliff whom they then lead on an action-packed chase through the countryside. Things become more complicated for them when British authorities hear about the incident and send a team of secret agents after them to retrieve the jewels. Dr. Melon's wife, Nan, on the other hand is only after him and Ernest for the jewels. While everyone is hot on their trail, Ernest develops a deep friendship with Dr. Melon.

Q:Given the below context:  In 1951, with secret means of communications established, Wolters sent his first letter to Speer in five years.  He suggested that Speer move ahead with his memoirs.  In January 1953, Speer began work on his draft memoirs, and over the next year lengthy missives, sometimes written on tobacco wrappings or candy wrappers but most often on toilet paper, made their way to Wolters' office in Coesfeld.  Marion Riesser, who had continued as Wolters' secretary as he began private architectural practice, transcribed these notes into as many as forty closely typed pages per missive, and the draft totalled 1,100 pages.  Wolters objected that Speer called Hitler a criminal in the draft, and Speer presciently observed that he would likely lose a good many friends were the memoirs ever to be published.  Wolters had come to believe that reports of Nazi genocide were exaggerated by a factor of at least ten, that Hitler had not been given credit for the things he did right and that Germany had been harshly treated by the Allies.In the mid-1950s, Wolters quarrelled with Kempf who effectively dropped out of the network for a number of years, adding to the burden on Wolters and Riesser.  While Speer's pleas for his former associate and his former secretary to work together eventually brought about a healing of the breach, this was to some degree superficial as Kempf was aware that Wolters, even then, disagreed with Speer's opinions.  Wolters questioned Speer's readiness to accept responsibility for the Nazi regime's excesses and did not believe Speer had anything to apologise for, though the strength of his feelings on this point was kept from Speer—but not from Kempf and Riesser.Wolters was tireless in his efforts on behalf of Speer and his family to such an extent that his son, Fritz, later expressed feelings of neglect.  For Speer's fiftieth birthday in March 1955, Wolters gathered letters from many of Speer's friends and wartime associates, and saw to it that they made their way inside the walls of Spandau in time for...

A: Answer:","output":"The areas located at fixed distances from the nucleus of the atom are known as atomic orbitals or electron shells. These shells are regions in an atom where electrons with a specific energy level are likely to be found, and they are organized into energy levels corresponding to increasing distances from the nucleus. The concept of electron shells is derived from the quantum mechanical model of the atom, which takes into account the wave-like nature of electrons and their discrete energy states. The atomic orbitals can be further classified based on their shapes, which are mathematically described by the wave functions of the electrons. There are four main types of orbitals – s, p, d, and f orbitals – each with a different shape and accommodating different numbers of electrons. 1. S Orbitals: These are spherical orbitals and can be found in all energy levels or principal quantum numbers (n). Every s orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons. The size of the sphere increases with the increase in the principal quantum number, which means the electron is located farther from the nucleus. 2. P Orbitals: These orbitals have a dumbbell shape and can be found in energy levels with a principal quantum number (n) of 2 or higher. The p orbitals are oriented along three axes – x, y, and z – and each is capable of holding a maximum of two electrons. Therefore, a maximum of six electrons can occupy a single p subshell. 3. D Orbitals: The d orbitals are more complex in shape compared to s and p orbitals and can be found in energy levels with a principal quantum number (n) of 3 or higher. There are five d orbitals, and each can hold a maximum of two electrons. Therefore, a single d subshell can accommodate up to 10 electrons. 4. F Orbitals: Having the most complex shape, f orbitals can be found in energy levels with a principal quantum number (n) of 4 or higher. There are seven f orbitals, and each can hold a maximum of two electrons. Therefore, a single f subshell can accommodate up to 14 electrons. Overall, each electronic shell or energy level can hold a significant number of electrons, with the capacity increasing progressively as the distance from the nucleus increases. For example, the first shell (n=1) has only an s orbital and can hold two electrons, the second shell (n=2) can hold up to eight electrons, the third shell (n=3) can hold up to 18 electrons, and so on. It's important to note that the electrons in an atom fill the orbitals according to specific rules, such as the Aufbau principle, the Pauli exclusion principle, and Hund's rule. These rules help to determine the electron configuration of an atom, which in turn affects the atom's chemical properties and reactivity. The distribution of electrons across different orbitals forms the basis of modern chemistry and understanding the behavior of various elements and their compounds."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which Chancellor, executed in 1535, became the patron saint of politicians????","output":"Sir Thomas More, the Chancellor executed in 1535, became the patron saint of politicians. Born in London on February 7, 1478, Thomas More was a renowned lawyer, philosopher, statesman, and writer. His steadfast faith in God and his moral conviction played a significant part in his subsequent veneration as a saint by the Catholic Church. More began his career as a lawyer and eventually became a Member of Parliament. As he progressed further, he attracted the attention of King Henry VIII, who appointed More to various important positions within the government. His most prominent role was the Lord Chancellor of England, a position that he was appointed to in 1529. In this role, More had the highest-ranking office in the land, just below the king. As Chancellor, More remained dedicated to standing up for his beliefs, particularly regarding religious and moral issues. He was a devoted Catholic and believed in the authority of the pope. When King Henry VIII decided to break with the Catholic Church due to their refusal to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, More was put in a difficult position. The king demanded that his subjects accept his new role as the Supreme Head of the Church of England, which subsequently required them to reject the authority of the pope. While many others complied with the king's demands, More refused to renounce his faith and loyalty to the Pope. This defiance led to his arrest, trial, and ultimately, his execution on July 6, 1535. Throughout these events, More maintained his faith and unwavering commitment to his principles. His final words were a testament to his devotion: \\"I die the King's good servant, but God's first.\\" Recognizing the significance of More's unwavering commitment to his faith, the Catholic Church honored him with sainthood. Pope Pius XI canonized Thomas More as a saint on May 19, 1935, and declared him the patron saint of statesmen and politicians. Saint Thomas More is often celebrated for his integrity, wisdom, and moral courage. Today, he stands as an inspiration to many, particularly those in the political sphere, as a reminder that personal convictions should not be compromised, even in the face of great adversity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: In the 1970s I was a student nurse in psychiatry. I was rostered to the brain injury ward in a chronic hospital, where the patients had severe brain damage from tumours, car accidents, strokes, metabolic diseases, degenerative diseases, and alcoholism. Only about half were ambulant. Most had severely impacted recent and long term memories. They could not bathe or feed themselves. The majority sat most of the day in chairs lined along the sides of the day room. They were spoon-fed meals and wheeled into the toilet. One of those patients was Connie S. She was maybe 55 yrs old and she spent a lot of the day screaming in her chair. She could not speak, walk, or cooperate. One nurse was very impatient with her and once I heard that nurse say to her, “You think the water is too hot, do you? Then have it cold!” as she bathed her in cold water. I remember standing up for her to that nurse. I worked that ward for over a year and then, one day, just like that, Connie S. woke up. She suddenly began speaking and walking. She apparently remembered most of the things had had happened to her in the ward. Soon, she walked right out of that ward and never came back. As she left, she appeared dignified and so happy, so relieved. I was too junior at that stage to know what her diagnosis was supposed to have been, but no-one expected her ever to leave. No-one left that ward. It was the end of the line. I remember being really glad that I had stood up for her and thinking how ashamed the nasty nurse must have been. It is now many years later and I often think of this woman and wonder how she fared in her post-hospital life. Her name is not common, but every so often I meet people with the same name and ask them if they know of a relative to whom this happened, but, so far, no-one has known of her.

The language is a mixture of 18th-century English, specifically the dialect spoken by the English settlers who arrived on Norfolk Island, and Tahitian, which was the native language of many of the Polynesian people who also arrived on the island. The origin of the Norfuk language can be traced back to the Pitcairn Islands, where in the late 18th century, a mixture of English sailors and Tahitian companions settled down. It was during this time that the foundations of the Norfuk language were established as the settlers needed a common language to communicate with each other. Most of these settlers were English-speakers, while the wives and descendants of the sailors were largely Tahitian in origin. This blended community inevitably led to the development of a unique language combining elements of both English and Tahitian. Over time, the population of the Pitcairn Islands grew and eventually relocated to Norfolk Island in the mid-19th century, where the ancestors of today's Norfolk Islanders became a distinct community of people. The Norfuk language continued to evolve as a result of various external factors, such as the influence of new English-speaking settlers arriving on the island and the broadening of trade and cultural exchange activities with neighboring islands. Consequently, the Norfuk language has absorbed various linguistic elements from diverse sources. The vocabulary of the Norfuk language is predominantly derived from the 18th-century English dialect spoken by the early settlers, and the grammar has considerable simplification in comparison with the English language. However, there are significant borrowings from the Tahitian language as well, particularly in terms of vocabulary related to the natural environment, cultural practices, and family relationships. The influence of these two languages on the Norfuk language is not limited to vocabulary and grammar alone. Pronunciation and intonation of Norfuk are also interestingly marked by noticeable elements of both English and Tahitian. Additionally, there are some linguistic features in Norfuk that cannot be directly attributed to either English or Tahitian, as they appear to have arisen through the complex process of interaction between these languages over a long period of time. In recent years, the Norfuk language has gained some official recognition and protection, with the Norfolk Island Language (Norf'k) Act 2004 designating Norfuk as one of the two official languages of Norfolk Island, alongside English. However, as mentioned earlier, the act does not mandate the use of Norfuk but simply recognizes and protects it, and when used in official contexts, an accurate English translation has to be provided as well. In conclusion, the Norfuk language is a fascinating amalgamation of 18th-century English and Tahitian that embodies the unique cultural and linguistic history of the Norfolk Island community. Despite facing numerous challenges such as the decline in the number of fluent speakers, efforts to preserve and promote the Norfuk language continue, reflecting the significance of this linguistic treasure to the heritage and identity of the Norfolk Islanders."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Larry Wayne Gatlin (born May 2, 1948) is an American country and Southern gospel singer and songwriter. As part of a trio with his younger brothers Steve and Rudy, he achieved considerable success within the country music genre, performing on thirty-three Top 40 singles (combining his solo recordings and those with his brothers). As their fame grew, the band became known as Larry Gatlin & the Gatlin Brothers. Larry Gatlin is known for his rich falsetto singing style and for the unique pop-inflected songs he wrote and recorded in the 1970s and 1980s. With West's help, Gatlin found work in Nashville as a background singer for Kris Kristofferson. In 1973, Gatlin landed a solo recording contract with Monument Records.  In 1973, Gatlin released his first album, The Pilgrim. Two singles were released from the album: \\"Sweet Becky Walker\\" and \\"Bitter They Are, Harder They Fall\\", though both failed to chart. The latter was recorded by Elvis Presley in 1976 (who had also recorded Gatlin's \\"Help Me\\" in 1973). In 1974 came the release of a new album, Rain/Rainbow, and a new song \\"Delta Dirt\\". The album and single proved more successful. \\"Delta Dirt\\" was a Top 20 Country hit, peaking at No. 14. The song was also Gatlin's only entry on the Pop charts, when it reached No. 84. In 1975, Gatlin had his first major hit with his composition \\"Broken Lady\\", which reached No. 5 on the Hot Country Songs chart in 1976. Gatlin won a Grammy Award for the song in 1977 for Best Country Song. A new album, High Time, was released in 1976. Gatlin is also credited on guitar on Willie Nelson's 1976 album The Troublemaker.  Brothers Steve and Rudy made their first appearance on Larry's 1976 album Larry Gatlin with Family & Friends. They were featured on some of Gatlin's other hits he had during the late 1970s, notably \\"I Don't Wanna Cry\\", \\"Love Is Just a Game\\", and \\"Statues Without Hearts\\". In 1978, Gatlin scored his first number one hit with \\"I Just Wish You Were Someone I Love.\\" Gatlin continued his success as a solo artist up until 1978, when he released his last solo album, Oh Brother, which featured the top 10 hits \\"I've Done Enough Dyin' Today\\" and \\"Night Time Magic\\", the latter of which also made an entry into the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart. Both songs spotlighted Gatlin's soaring falsetto that became a trademark of his vocal style.  In 1977, Gatlin joined entrepreneur Larry Schmittou and other country music stars, such as Conway Twitty, Jerry Reed, Cal Smith, and Richard Sterban, as investors in the Nashville Sounds, a minor league baseball team of the Double-A Southern League that began play in 1978. did any of his songs do well on the charts?","output":"Yes, many of Larry Gatlin's songs did well on the charts.

How much does it cost to replace a street light pole? How is this cost calculated? Do those questions have the same meaning? Choices:  (1). no.  (2). yes.","output":"First, let's address each question individually: 1. How much does it cost to replace rotors? To determine the cost of replacing rotors, I would follow these steps: Step 1: Identify the type of vehicle. Different vehicles have different types of rotors, which can impact the cost of replacement. Step 2: Determine the make, model, and year of the vehicle. This information can help in identifying the correct rotor type and average price range for rotor replacement. Step 3: Research the average cost of rotors for the specified vehicle. This can vary depending on the brand, quality, and location where the rotors are purchased. Additionally, consider whether only the front or rear rotors are being replaced, or both. Step 4: Calculate the labor cost. Labor costs can vary by location and the specific mechanic or automotive shop. The average labor cost for rotor replacement can range from 50 to 150 per rotor, but this may vary. Step 5: Add the cost of the rotors and the labor cost together to arrive at the total cost of replacing rotors. 2. How much does it cost to replace a street light pole? How is this cost calculated? To calculate the cost to replace a street light pole, follow these steps: Step 1: Determine the type of street light pole. The type of pole can impact the cost, as they come in a variety of materials (e.g., steel, aluminum, or concrete) and designs. Step 2: Identify if any additional electrical components need replacement or upgrades. These can include the lamp, wiring, or other electrical components associated with the pole. Step 3: Research the cost of the street light pole. Prices can vary based on the material, height, and design of the pole. Step 4: Estimate the labor costs. This can vary by location, contractor, and level of expertise required for the replacement. Labor costs often include the removal of the old pole and installation of the new one, in addition to any required electrical work. Step 5: Calculate any additional fees or permits. Depending on the location, there may be fees or permits required for the replacement of the street light pole. Step 6: Add the cost of the street light pole, labor, and any additional fees or permits to arrive at the total cost of replacing a street light pole. Now, let's evaluate if both questions have the same meaning: The two questions inquire about the cost of two different things: replacing rotors on a vehicle and replacing a street light pole. However, the underlying principle of the questions, which is to determine the cost of a replacement or repair, is similar. Based on the similarity in the underlying principle, as well as the distinction between the subjects of the questions, the answer would be: (1). No."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Problem: Solve -5*w = -0 - 20 for w.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: When humans dig up and use fossil fuels, we have an impact on the carbon cycle ( Figure below ). This carbon is not recycled until it is used by humans. The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by photosynthesis. So, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere than is coming out of it. Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming or global climate change.  and the situation: Recently a large amount of factories have been built in Illinois using fossil fuels as their main energy source. In Indiana however, many of their factories have been shut down and replaced by parks with many plants and trees.  Answer the following question: Given Illinois adds even more of these fossil fuel burning factories will the levels of carbon dioxide increase or decrease? A:","output":"Based on the given background information, if Illinois adds more fossil fuel burning factories, the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will likely increase.  Let's break this down: 1. The process of burning fossil fuels - which is how the factories in Illinois are producing energy - releases carbon dioxide into the air. 2. More factories burning fossil fuels equates to more carbon dioxide being released. 3. The carbon dioxide isn't recycled back into the environment until it's used by humans or absorbed through processes like photosynthesis. 4. Illinois is adding more factories that burn fossil fuels, meaning more carbon dioxide will be added to the atmosphere. Therefore, the logical conclusion is that the atmospheric carbon dioxide levels in Illinois will increase with the addition of more fossil fuel burning factories."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It had been organised by blogger Indigo Rosee, in collaboration with the store. The evening had been set up to showcase the new limited edition Christmas make-up collection and also promote the huge sale that the store had on. There were some amazing deals! We were welcomed with prosecco and nibbles and then had a few minutes to browse the store and take some photos. I received a great demonstration of the new make-up products which includes a funky black eyeliner pen with a star stamp on one end which EVERYONE tried out! I always really love The Body Shop® Christmas make-up collections, and I think it’s a shame that it’s a brand that is sometimes forgotten when it comes to make-up. Then everyone was treated to a hand spa and massage using some of the Spa Of The World products. They’re truly luxurious, I recently reviewed the new Firming Ritual collection recently and absolutely loved it. I then had a look round some of the offers that the store was promoting, a lot of the Shower Gels and Body Butters were on sale (I just LOVE The Body Shop® Body Butters) and there were lots of gift sets too. It was a great opportunity to chat with the staff too, to ask questions about new products and find out what their favourites are. I also spent a lot of time looking at the 2017 beauty advent calendars. This year The Body Shop® are offering 3 different advent calendars starting from just £45. The larger calendars included some full size products too which I thought was great. There’s also going to be a Countdown to New Year calendar priced at just £50 which I thought was a great fun idea.

Choose from: I. yes. II. it is not possible to tell. III. no.","output":"According to the premise, \\"The techniques for ensuring sufficient comparability and quality and for aggregating the information are what constitute the cumulative part of the methodology.\\" This statement indicates that there are existing techniques in place as part of the cumulative methodology that are designed to ensure sufficient comparability and quality, as well as aggregation of information. Now, let's consider the hypothesis, \\"There is a lack of techniques for sufficient comparability.\\" This hypothesis posits that there may be an absence or insufficiency of techniques focused on comparability. In order to determine whether the premise entails this hypothesis, we must analyze if accepting the truth of the premise necessarily leads to the truth of the hypothesis. Upon careful analysis, it becomes clear that the premise acknowledges the existence of techniques for sufficient comparability and quality. It states that these techniques form a crucial part of the cumulative methodology, which implies that they are integral to the process being discussed. Therefore, since the premise claims the presence of techniques for ensuring sufficient comparability, it actually contradicts the hypothesis, which suggests a lack of such techniques. Based on this reasoning, the correct answer to the question of whether the premise entails the hypothesis \\"There is a lack of techniques for sufficient comparability\\" is III. no. The premise does not support the hypothesis, and in fact, it provides evidence against it by stating that the techniques for sufficient comparability exist and are significant components of the cumulative methodology."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The background to this heart-wrenching story takes us back to the outbreak of the Korean War, which commenced in June 1950 when North Korea, supported by the Soviet Union and China, launched an invasion into South Korea establishing a rigid communist regime. This event set the stage for a brutal and prolonged conflict that lasted for over three years. As the war intensified, Thomas Hudner and Jesse Brown, two brave US Navy pilots, found themselves in the thick of the fight. During one harrowing mission near the Jangjin Reservoir – referred to as the Chosin Reservoir by Americans – Jesse Brown's plane was badly damaged, forcing him to make a devastating crash landing. Witnessing his friend's plight, Hudner heroically took the decision to crash land his own plane in an attempt to save his comrade's life. Despite Hudner's valiant efforts, Brown's injuries ultimately proved fatal, but not before he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his exceptional courage and devotion in the face of harrowing circumstances. Hudner's selflessness and heroism were also duly recognized, as he was later awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions that fateful day. As the years have passed, the sacrifices made by these brave men and countless others during the Korean War have not been forgotten. In a poignant reminder of the bonds forged in battle, Thomas Hudner has expressed his desire to return to the battleground that claimed the life of his friend Jesse Brown. This powerful act of remembrance serves as a lasting tribute to the strength, courage, and resolve displayed by these men, and the countless others who fought alongside them during those dark days of conflict. In facing the painful memories of tragedy and loss, the journey back to the Jangjin Reservoir will serve as a powerful reminder that the enduring bonds of friendship and brotherhood transcend even the most devastating circumstances. It is through this act of remembrance that Hudner, and others like him, can continue to honor the memory of those brave souls who made the ultimate sacrifice in the service of their country."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They win it, however the ship is wrecked, but due to botched laser eye surgery, the Professor only notices that the fuel has been used. As punishment, Leela is fitted with a shock collar to teach her anger management. Meanwhile, Bender finds Cubert and Dwight playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons with their friends, but he cannot join in since, as a robot, he has no imagination. After several tries at imagining things, Bender manages to imagine himself as a medieval knight named \\"Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood\\" and enters the game. Unfortunately, he soon gets lost in his fantasy and goes on a rampage, resulting in his commitment to the Hal Institute for Criminally Insane Robots. The crew learns that Mom, who controls the world's only Dark Matter mine, is restricting the supply in order to drive up profits. The Professor reveals to the crew that while working for her many years ago, he stumbled on a way to turn dark matter from a useless curiosity into starship fuel. The process created two energy crystals, with Mom keeping one for herself and Farnsworth hiding the other, \\"anti-backwards\\" crystal.

Please answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"who's order was amended in 1967?\\" is in \\"Ideas for affirmative action came as early as the Reconstruction Era (1865-1877) in which a former slave population lacked the skills and resources for sustainable living. In 1865, General William Tecumseh Sherman proposed to divide the land and goods from Georgia and grant it to families of color which became the \\"Forty acres and a mule\\" policy. The proposal was never widely adopted due to strong political opposition. Nearly a century later (1950s-1960s), policies to assist classes of individuals reemerged during the Civil Rights Movement. The civil rights guarantees came through the interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The decisions came to be known as affirmative action in which mandatory, as well as voluntary programs, affirmed the civil rights of people of color. Furthermore, these affirmative action programs protected people of color from the present effects stemming from past discrimination. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy became the first to utilize the term \\"affirmative action\\" in Executive Order 10925 to ensure that government contractors \\"take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.\\" This executive order realized the government's intent to create equal opportunities for all qualified people. This executive order was eventually amended and superseded by Lyndon B. Johnson's Executive Order 11246 which prevented discrimination based on race, color, religion, and national origin by organizations which received federal contracts and subcontracts. In 1967, the order was amended to include sex as well. The Reagan administration was opposed to the affirmative action requirements of Executive Order 11246, but these contemplated changes[which?] faced bi-partisan opposition in Congress.\\".

In the beginning, he is married to the hypersexual, demanding, and jealous SuperAngel (Shari Eubank), who constantly harasses him at work. She orders him home at once when she calls Clint and overhears a female customer, SuperLorna (Christy Hartburg), hits on him at work. Clint finds SuperAngel's constant accusations and arguing a turnoff and, back at home, they fight after he rejects her aggressive advances. A neighbor calls the police as Clint leaves for a local bar, where the bartender is the very scantily clad SuperHaji (Haji).Meanwhile, SuperAngel seduces Harry Sledge (Charles Napier), the cop who responded to the police call. He is impotent and unable to perform. She repeatedly taunts and insults him over this, which finally results in him killing her by stomping her brutally in a bathtub, then throwing a radio in the water which was plugged into the wall socket. Sledge burns down the house, then tries to pin the murder on Clint. Clint claims being in the pub all night, but SuperHaji has her revenge on him (from insulting her breast size earlier) by refusing to confirm his alibi.

Monitoring your progress is important when you're losing weight.  Stepping on the scale regularly can help you see how effective your diet program is going and whether or not you need to make any changes.  Remember, safe weight loss is about one to two pounds per week.  Be patient with your progress.  You're more likely to sustain slow and steady weight loss in the long-term.  For the most accurate pattern of results, it's best to weigh yourself at the same time of day, on the same day of the week and in the same clothes (or choose to go without clothes). If your weight loss has plateaued or you've begun to gain weight, recheck your meal plans and food journals and see if you can cut out any more calories to help weight loss. Having friends, family members or co-workers supporting you through your weight loss plan may help you continue to lose weight and maintain it long-term.  Build a support group to help you stay on track.  See if others you know also want to lose weight.  Many times people find it easier to tackle weight loss together as a group. You can also try finding online support groups or support groups that meet in person on a weekly or monthly basis. Get support by working with a registered dietitian; he/she can customize your meal plan and provide on-going support. Having a motivating and enticing reward at the end of your weight loss goals can help push you through to the end.  Set up something exciting for yourself as you meet your goals.  Ideas to try include:  Buying yourself new shoes or clothes. Treating yourself to a round of golf or other favorite sport. Getting a massage or other spa treatment. Avoid food-related rewards, as these can trigger old habits that might not be conducive to weight loss.","output":"Regularly monitoring your weight loss progress, building a support group, and setting motivating rewards can help you effectively and sustainably lose weight at a safe pace of one to two pounds per week."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer based on context: At the June 1983 Consumer Electronics Show, Commodore lowered the retail price of the 64 to 300, and stores sold it for as little as 199. At one point the company was selling as many computers as the rest of the industry combined. Its prices for the VIC-20 and 64 were 50 lower than Ataris prices for the 600XL and 800XL. Commodores strategy was to, according to a spokesman, devote 50% of its efforts to the under-500 market, 30% on the 500–1000 market, and 20% on the over-1000 market. Its vertical integration and Tramiels focus on cost control helped Commodore do well during the price war, with 1 billion in 1983 sales. Although the company and Tramiels focus on cost cutting over product testing caused many hardware defects in the 64, by early 1984 Synapse Software—the largest provider of third-party Atari 8-bit software—received 65% of sales from the Commodore market, and Commodore sold almost three times as many computers as Atari that year. How many percent of sales from Synapse Software were not from sales from teh Commodore market?","output":"Okay, little buddy, let me explain this to you. So, Synapse Software is like a toy store that sells different toys for different types of game machines. They found out that when people bought toys (software) for Commodore machines, it made up 65% of their total sales.  Now, we want to find out how much sales came from other machines, not the Commodore ones. To do that, we think like this: the total sales are 100%. If 65% were from Commodore sales, then we can subtract that from the total, like this: 100% - 65% = 35%.

While the options \\"getting tired\\" and \\"backache\\" could be indirectly related to driving, they are not specific to the act of driving. The option \\"go somewhere\\" is too vague and doesn't necessarily represent a specific event or experience that a driver may have. The option \\"water pollute\\" is unrelated to the subject of driving a car. However, automobile accidents are unfortunate but common occurrences on the road that almost all drivers have either witnessed or experienced. Hence, this would be the reason a human would choose \\"automobile accidents\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:This article: Steven Lee Lukather (born October 21, 1957) is an American guitarist, singer, songwriter, arranger and record producer, best known as a founding member of Toto.

Being clean will help you look and feel your best in front of the camera. Shampoo and condition your hair and create a lather with your soap or body wash. Go over your whole body with the soap from top to bottom. It’s best if you take a shower either the night before or the morning of picture day.  It’s best for your skin to keep your shower short (5-10 minutes) and the water lukewarm or cooler. Pat yourself dry with a towel and moisturize your body with body lotion afterward. At the very least, comb out any tangles so it looks neat and nice and give yourself a straight part. If you want, straighten, curl, or scrunch your hair to make it look a little more special. Clean your face every night, and if you have a foolproof method that prevents acne for you, follow it. This will improve your chances of having a clean, clear, beautiful face on picture day.  Use a gel-based or foamy cleanser if you have normal to oily skin. Use a creamy moisturizing cleanser if you have dry skin. Make sure to floss and brush your teeth every day in the morning and at night. Doing this will remove bacteria from your teeth which will keep them whiter, help prevent gum disease, and keep your teeth from decaying. Make sure to brush for about 2 minutes every time to make your smile look bright. Before taking your picture, you may have some ketchup on your cheek from lunch or some stray hairs sticking up. Pack a comb and hand-held mirror in your backpack the night before so you can give your appearance one last check and touch up before getting in front of the camera. A fresh trim will look great in your school pictures. For a clean-cut, put-together look, get a haircut just a few days or a week before picture day. Make sure you’re drinking enough water and getting enough sleep in the days leading up to picture day. Keeping yourself hydrated and well-rested will give you an energized smile and healthy-looking skin.

In February 1998, the 40-year-old Saudi exile Usama  Bin Laden and a fugitive Egyptian physician, Ayman al Zawahiri, arranged from their Afghan headquarters for an Arabic newspaper in London to publish what they termed a fatwa issued in the name of a \\"World Islamic Front.\\" A fatwa is normally an interpretation of Islamic law by a respected Islamic authority, but neither  Bin Laden, Zawahiri, nor the three others who signed this statement were scholars of Islamic law. Claiming that America had declared war against God and his messenger, they called for the murder of any American, anywhere on earth, as the \\"individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it.\\" Three months later, when interviewed in Afghanistan by ABC-TV,  Bin Laden enlarged on these themes. He claimed it was more important for Muslims to kill Americans than to kill other infidels.\\" It is far better for anyone to kill a single American soldier than to squander his efforts on other activities,\\" he said. Asked whether he approved of terrorism and of attacks on civilians, he replied:\\"We believe that the worst thieves in the world today and the worst terrorists are the Americans. Nothing could stop you except perhaps retaliation in kind. We do not have to differentiate between military or civilian. As far as we are concerned, they are all targets.\\" Note: Islamic names often do not follow the Western practice of the consistent use of surnames. Given the variety of names we mention, we chose to refer to individuals by the last word in the names by which they are known: Nawaf al Hazmi as Hazmi, for instance, omitting the article \\"al\\" that would be part of their name in their own societies. We generally make an exception for the more familiar English usage of \\"Bin\\" as part of a last name, as in  Bin Laden. Further, there is no universally accepted way to transliterate Arabic words and names into English. We have relied on a mix of common sense, the sound of the name in Arabic, and common usage in source materials, the press, or government documents. When we quote from a source document, we use its transliteration, e.g.,\\"al Qida\\" instead of al Qaeda. Though novel for its open endorsement of indiscriminate killing,  Bin Laden's 1998 declaration was only the latest in the long series of his public and private calls since 1992 that singled out the United States for attack. In August 1996,  Bin Laden had issued his own self-styled fatwa calling on Muslims to drive American soldiers out of Saudi Arabia.  What question would one ask from this paragraph?","output":"One possible question to ask from this paragraph could be: What factors or events led to Usama Bin Laden and Ayman al Zawahiri issuing a fatwa calling for the murder of any American, and how did their views and statements evolve over time in regards to targeting the United States?"},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Without support from the Europeans, some Franks in Outremer, particularly the Knights Hospitaller of the fortress of Marqab, and to some extent the Franks of Cyprus and Antioch, attempted to join in combined operations with the Mongols in 1280–1281. The death of the Egyptian leader Baibars in 1277 led to disorganization in the Muslim territories, making conditions ripe for a new action by other factions in the Holy Land. The Mongols seized the opportunity, organized a new invasion of Syria, and in September 1280 occupied Bagras and Darbsak, followed by Aleppo on October 20. The Mongol leader Abaqa, taking advantage of his momentum, sent envoys to Edward I of England, the Franks of Acre, King Hugh of Cyprus, and Bohemond VII of Tripoli (son of Bohemond VI), requesting their support for the campaign. But the Crusaders were not organized enough themselves to be of much help. In Acre, the Patriarch's Vicar replied that the city was suffering from hunger, and that the king of Jerusalem was already embroiled in another war. Local Knights Hospitaller from Marqab (in the area which had previously been Antioch/Tripoli) were able to make raids into the Beqaa Valley, as far as the Mamluk-held Krak des Chevaliers in 1280 and 1281. Hugh and Bohemond of Antioch mobilized their armies, but their forces were prevented from joining those of the Mongols by Baibars' successor, the new Egyptian Sultan Qalawun. He advanced north from Egypt in March 1281, positioned his own army between the Franks and Mongols, and then further divided the potential allies by renewing a truce with the Barons of Acre on May 3, 1281, extending it for another ten years and ten months (a truce he would later breach). He also renewed a second 10-year truce with Bohemond VII of Tripoli on July 16, 1281, and affirmed pilgrim access to Jerusalem.In September 1281 the Mongols returned, with 50,000 of their own troops, plus 30,000 others including Armenians under Leo III, Georgians, and 200 Knights Hospitaller from Marqab, who sent a contingent even though...

This may require researching which California governor said the quote and the circumstance they said it in. 2. Interpret the statement: After determining the context, try to analyze the meaning of the statement. \\"Inaction may be the highest form of action\\" can be understood as sometimes not taking any action might be the best action or decision in a given situation.

One man, farmer David Cundall, was determined to uncover the truth behind this mysterious buried treasure, investing nearly two decades of his life exploring the Southeast Asian country in search of answers. This is the intriguing tale of Cundall's relentless pursuit, and the Spitfires that lay beneath the earth, waiting to be found. For nearly 70 years, the tale of the buried Spitfires in Burma seemed like nothing more than a myth. It was said that at the conclusion of World War II, as the British military prepared to depart the Southeast Asian nation, they were faced with a surplus of unused Spitfire aircraft. As a last-ditch effort to ensure these planes would not fall into the wrong hands, the British forces were believed to have buried them in hastily dug trenches, covering them with large crates which protected these artifacts from the elements. In the years following the war, this story persisted but only as a whispered legend – until David Cundall, a British farmer and amateur aviation historian, came across the tale in the 1990s. Fascinated by the idea of unearthing such a historically significant find, Cundall embarked on a challenging quest to discover the truth. To fund his initial adventures, he sold off personal belongings, reinvesting the proceeds into his mission. Between 1996 and 2012, Cundall conducted a series of reconnaissance trips to Burma, using a combination of old military records, aerial photographs, and testimonies from locals to pinpoint potential burial sites. Over the years, he became increasingly confident that the Spitfires' resting place was located near the modern Yangon International Airport, previously known as RAF Mingaladon - a British airbase during the war. In his quest for the Spitfires, Cundall faced numerous obstacles, including bureaucratic hurdles, complex negotiations with the Myanmar government, and skepticism from fellow aviation enthusiasts and experts. Despite these challenges, he remained dedicated to the cause, driven by the tantalizing prospect of discovering a fleet of nearly pristine Spitfire planes that had been buried for decades. Following nearly two decades of tireless searching, David Cundall enlisted the help of a team of experts, including academics, engineers, and archaeologists. Armed with advanced ground-penetrating radar technology, the team was finally able to announce in 2013 that they had located large unidentified metal objects in the area where the Spitfires were believed to have been buried. Even as controversy and doubt surrounding the existence of the buried planes persisted, a special ceremony was held in Myanmar to celebrate the anticipated recovery of the first buried Spitfire, attended by over two hundred veterans and international journalists. However, disappointment quickly followed, as the initial excavation efforts yielded no results. The team returned in 2014 and continued their search, but to this day, the planes have yet to be uncovered. Farmer David Cundall's unwavering dedication to the search for the buried Spitfires of Burma is a testament to the importance of history and the pursuit of knowledge. Whether his quest eventually uncovers these rumored aircraft or not, Cundall's story serves as an inspiring reminder that sometimes, the journey is just as valuable as the destination, and the truth behind this mysterious legend will continue to captivate imaginations for generations to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The packaging that your eggs come in when you first buy them is also the best place for them to remain while in storage. The composite material of the carton prevents the eggshells from absorbing odors from the other items in the refrigerator. It also serves to keep them safely spaced and covered so that they won’t be cracked or crushed.  Built-in refrigerator egg compartments often require you to dump all your eggs in unprotected, which can lead to big messes and wasted eggs. Leaving the eggs in their original carton also ensures that the expiration date remains in plain sight. Eggs are situated in the carton with the bulbous end on top for a reason. This keeps the yolk centered inside, which protects it from breaking. A balanced, intact yolk will taste fresher and yields better results when used in miscellaneous recipes. Avoid moving or repositioning eggs too much, as this may damage the yolk or the natural air pockets inside. Many people think stashing their eggs on the inside of the door is more convenient. However, the main body of the refrigerator is superior for preserving eggs because it allows them to maintain a more consistent temperature. To maximize their lifespan, keep your eggs at around 40 degrees F (7 degrees C) or cooler.  Frequent opening and closing of the refrigerator makes for more rapid changes in temperature around the door. Processed eggs should always be refrigerated, while it may be okay to store raw, freshly laid eggs at room temperature.","output":"The original packaging of eggs is the optimal storage location due to its composite material that prevents odor absorption, safe spacing to avoid cracking or crushing, and the visibility of expiration dates, while the arrangement of eggs in the carton, with the bulbous end on top, preserves the yolk and taste.

Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"The questions you have asked are quite distinct, so let me address them one by one. 1. Difference between 高铁 (gaotie) and 动车 (dong che) 高铁 (gaotie) and 动车 (dong che) are two terms used in China to refer to different types of high-speed trains. Both are amongst China's most advanced railway systems and engineering achievements. Here is a detailed comparison between the two: 高铁 (gaotie) - Gaotie literally translates to \\"high-speed rail\\" in English. - Gaotie operates at speeds of 250 km/h (155 mph) or more. - These trains generally have a \\"G\\" or \\"C\\" prefix in their train numbers, where \\"G\\" stands for \\"High-Speed\\" and \\"C\\" stands for \\"Intercity High-Speed.\\" - Gaotie trains have better facilities, comfort, and technology compared to other trains in China. - The fare for Gaotie trains is higher than that of 动车 (dong che). - Gaotie lines have been designed exclusively for high-speed trains, resulting in reduced travel times and enhanced passenger experience. 动车 (dong che) - Dong che, short for 动力集中型列车 (dònglì jízhōngxíng lièchē), can be translated as \\"electric multiple unit\\" (EMU) trains. - The operating speeds of dong che trains range from 120 to 250 km/h (75 to 155 mph). - These trains have \\"D\\" or \\"G\\" prefixes in their train numbers, depending on the service pattern and the speed. - Dong che trains are faster than conventional trains and offer more comfort and facilities than regular trains but may not be as advanced or comfortable as gaotie. - The tickets for dong che trains are more economical compared to gaotie, making them more affordable for a larger audience. - 动车 (dong che) trains may share tracks with regular passenger trains, thus potentially having longer travel times compared to gaotie. 2. How many kids read newspapers in India? It is difficult to provide an exact number of children in India who read newspapers. However, it can be inferred that the number is declining due to a shift from print to digital media. With the rise of internet penetration and smartphone usage in India, young people are more inclined to access information and news through online platforms, social media, and apps. Print media is still prevalent in India, and many school children are encouraged to read newspapers for educational purposes. However, the overall number is dwindling as digital media becomes increasingly popular among the youth. It is also worth mentioning that the literacy rate in India plays a role in determining the number of children who read newspapers. 3. Do those questions have the same meaning? The questions you have asked do not share the same meaning. The first question pertains to the differences between two types of high-speed trains in China, while the second question inquires about the number of children in India who read newspapers. These questions are entirely different in nature and focus on separate subjects."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? To stay awake without drugs.","output":"Staying awake without drugs can be challenging, especially if you're fighting off sleepiness, boredom, or fatigue. However, it's entirely possible to keep yourself alert and awake through natural and healthy methods. Here are several strategies you can adopt to stay awake without relying on drugs or stimulants: 1. Get sufficient sleep: Ensure that you're getting enough rest every night. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep to help prevent daytime drowsiness and improve mental clarity. 2. Establish a consistent sleep schedule: Try to maintain a consistent sleep and wake pattern, even during weekends, to help regulate your body's internal clock. 3. Avoid heavy meals: Eating large meals can make you drowsy. Instead, consume smaller meals or snacks throughout the day to maintain your energy levels. 4. Stay hydrated: Dehydration can lead to fatigue. Drink plenty of water throughout the day to improve your energy levels and help you stay awake. 5. Take brief naps: If you're feeling sleepy during the day, take short power naps (20-30 minutes) to recharge your energy. Avoid napping too close to bedtime, as it may affect your nighttime sleep quality. 6. Engage in physical activity: Exercise can help you stay alert and focused. Consider exercising in the morning or during your lunch break for an energy boost. Plus, as little as a 10-minute walk can help revive you when you're feeling drowsy. 7. Adjust your environment: Make sure your surroundings promote alertness. Keep the room well-lit, use a comfortable chair, and maintain a comfortable temperature. Cool temperatures can help keep you awake and focused. 8. Stimulate your senses: Utilize the power of your senses to stay awake. Listen to upbeat, energizing music, try aromatherapy with invigorating scents like peppermint or citrus, and use bright, vibrant colors in your work area to keep you alert. 9. Practice good posture: Sitting up straight with your shoulders back and head elevated can help improve circulation and keep you more alert. 10. Take regular breaks: Make it a habit to stand up, stretch, or walk around every hour to decrease your chances of sitting-related fatigue. 11. Utilize mental stimulation: Keep your mind engaged and alert by tackling challenging tasks, puzzles, or games. Break larger tasks into smaller, manageable chunks to stay focused and maintain your motivation. 12. Maintain a healthy lifestyle: Eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly, and practice stress-reducing techniques such as deep breathing or meditation to boost your energy levels and overall well-being. 13. Consume natural stimulants in moderation: Although the goal is to stay away from drugs, you can still opt for natural stimulants like caffeine, found in coffee or tea, without going overboard. Limit your consumption and avoid drinking caffeine late in the day to minimize sleep disturbances. By incorporating these tips and habits into your daily routine, you'll be well on your way to staying awake and alert without relying on drugs or stimulants. Just remember to pay attention to your body, and if extreme fatigue or sleepiness persists, consult a medical professional for further evaluation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it? Not including Neidpath, who owned the other castle that Sir Simon Fraser had for most of its existence? Answer:","output":"To answer this question, we first need to gather information about Sir Simon Fraser and the castles he owned. Here's a step-by-step approach to finding the answer: Step 1: Identify the castles owned by Sir Simon Fraser. Research and data compilation from historical sources will reveal the castles owned by Sir Simon Fraser. It is already mentioned that Neidpath should not be considered, so we shall only focus on the remaining castles associated with him. Step 2: Determine the timeframe of Sir Simon Fraser's ownership. By investigating historical records and timelines, we can establish the period in which Sir Simon Fraser owned and controlled these castles. This would help in identifying the \\"most of its existence\\" criterion mentioned in the question. Step 3: Examine the ownership history of the other castle(s). Once we establish the castle(s) owned by Sir Simon Fraser for most of its existence, we can look at its ownership history and analyze the data to find out who owned the castle before and after Sir Simon Fraser's ownership period. Step 4: Identify the owner of the other castle. After analyzing the castle's ownership history and its connection to Sir Simon Fraser, we can deduce who specifically owned the castle for the time period excluding Sir Simon Fraser's ownership. After thoroughly researching and analyzing historical records, we find out that: 1. Sir Simon Fraser owned Oliver Castle for most of its existence. 2. Hugh de Balliol was the owner of Oliver Castle before Sir Simon Fraser. In conclusion, the answer is Hugh de Balliol."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It would have to be this… Donald Trump once cashed a 0.13 check… In 1990, writer from a “Spy Magazine” had a great idea for a prank: “What would happen if you sent checks for small amounts to celebrities and saw who cashed them, putting to test the theory that every man (and woman) has a price? In their words: \\"We could however, send them checks for minuscule sums of money—sums so small they couldn’t fund as much as a minute of the recipients’ existence—and see who would bother to bank these teensy amounts of money.\\" Spy thought \\"some subterfuge\\" would be necessary—it'd be suspicious to get a check from the magazine that lampooned so many of the intended recipients. This was specifically true for Trump, who Spy once famously referred to as a \\"short-fingered vulgarian.\\" So, they created a fully funded and incorporated company called National Refund Clearinghouse, which allowed them to open a checking account. Then they drafted a letter explaining that the check was a refund for a small overcharge that had occurred in 1988—what the celebrities had been overcharged for was never mentioned. They sent the checks out (initially for 1.11) to 58 well-known people like Cher, Henry Kissinger, and, of course, Donald Trump. Of the 58, 26 cashed the checks—Donald included. The magazine drafted a followup letter and checks for 0.64 to those 26 people to see who would take more free money. Thirteen—including Donald Trump—deposited the checks worth two quarters, a dime, and four pennies into their banks. Then they went for one last score: in honor of those 13 people, 13 more checks for 0.13. Two people cashed them: a Saudi arms dealer named Adnan Khashoggi, and Donald Trump.

When a man in a collared shirt and tie placed her carry-on luggage in an overhead compartment and pointed her in the direction of her seat, she didn't give it a second thought.  She assumed he must have been an off-duty pilot. \\"As the plane descended into Atlanta, the flight attendant announced that there was a special guest on board,\\" wrote Frank, in a letter to Delta Air Lines CEO Richard Anderson. \\"He was riding in a jump seat, because he had given up his place to allow one more person on that flight.

Bill used mycorrizal fungi compost for the garden, while Hank used regular top soil. Bill was very happy with the harvest.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which gardener observed more improved water absorption from the soil?  Hint: A mycorrhiza (Greek for \\"fungus roots\\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil. The answer to this question is:","output":"Based on the provided information, the answer to this question is Bill. This is because Bill used mycorrhizal fungi compost for his garden, and the mycorrhiza association helps to increase the surface area of the plant's root system, which in turn improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

From the early centuries of the Common Era, the Greeks identified as Romaioi (\\"Romans\\"), by that time the name ‘Hellenes’ denoted pagans. While ethnic distinctions still existed in the Roman Empire, they became secondary to religious considerations and the renewed empire used Christianity as a tool to support its cohesion and promoted a robust Roman national identity. Concurrently the secular, urban civilization of late antiquity survived in the Eastern Mediterranean along with Greco-Roman educational system, although it was from Christianity that the culture's essential values were drawn. What did the label of  Hellenes come to stand for during the Common Era of Greece ?","output":"During the Common Era of Greece, the label of 'Hellenes' came to stand for pagans. This shift in meaning occurred as the Greek people started identifying themselves as Romaioi (\\"Romans\\") following the introduction of new eastern religions into the Greek world, with Christianity being the most successful among them. Under the Roman Empire, ethnic distinctions still existed but they became secondary to religious considerations. The empire saw the importance of using Christianity as a tool to support its cohesion and foster a strong Roman national identity. As a result, the term 'Hellenes,' which was once associated with ancient Greek culture and ethnicity, gradually took on a different connotation. It began to denote those who adhered to the older pagan traditions and beliefs, distinguishing them from the Christians who embraced the new faith. Despite this transformation in the meaning of 'Hellenes,' the secular, urban civilization of late antiquity persevered in the Eastern Mediterranean. The Greco-Roman educational system remained intact, and the essence of Greek culture and its values continued to have a significant impact. However, it was through Christianity that the fundamental values of this new society were predominantly derived, leading to a fusion of Greek and Roman elements in a Christian context. Ultimately, the label of 'Hellenes' came to represent those who clung to pagan beliefs and practices, illustrating the shift in religious and cultural dynamics during the Common Era of Greece."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It was devised, produced and directed by Ned Sherrin and presented by David Frost. An American version by the same name aired on NBC from 1964 to 1965, also featuring Frost. The programme is considered a significant element of the satire boom in the UK in the early 1960s. An American version was on NBC, initially as a pilot episode on 10 November 1963, then as a series from 10 January 1964 to May 1965. The pilot featured Henry Fonda and Henry Morgan, guests Mike Nichols and Elaine May, and supporting performers including Gene Hackman. The recurring cast included Frost, Morgan, Buck Henry and Alan Alda, with Nancy Ames singing the opening song and Stanley Grover and Ames performing solos and duets; regular contributors included Gloria Steinem, William F. Brown, Tom Lehrer and Calvin Trillin. The announcer was Jerry Damon. Also a guest was Woody Allen, performing stand-up comedy; the guest star on the final broadcast was Steve Allen. A running gag was a mock feud with Jack Paar, whose own programme followed TW3 on the NBC Friday schedule; Paar repeatedly referred to TW3 as \\"Henry Morgan's Amateur Hour.\\"  The American version is largely a lost program, although the pilot survives and was donated to the Library of Congress by a collector. Amateur audio recordings of most episodes also survive. After the series' cancellation, Lehrer recorded a collection of his songs used on the show, That Was The Year That Was, released by Reprise Records in September 1965.  In the American version, an episode showed a smiling U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson contemplating an easy 1964 campaign against the Republican nominee, U.S. Senator Barry M. Goldwater of Arizona. The satirists sang that Goldwater could not win because he \\"does not know the dance of the liberal Republicans\\", then a substantial component of the GOP, many of whose members had supported Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York for the Republican nomination.  On April 21, 1985 in the United States, the ABC network aired That Was The Week That Was as a special, hosted by David Frost (also serving as an executive producer) and Anne Bancroft, and featuring future Saturday Night Live cast members Jan Hooks and A. Whitney Brown and puppetry from Spitting Image.  Kristy Glass and Kevin Ruf starred in a remake of TW3 for ABC's Primetime Live in the fall of 2004. Soon after its premiere, Shelley Ross, the executive producer, was fired and TW3 ended with her dismissal.

She starts to but then receives a call from George, who is on a flight home from a business trip. During a talk with her mother that evening, she asks her if they could try to make their Christmas \\"Dickens-Style\\"; however her mother is reluctant to do this. Another neighbor's daughter, Amber Mottola, is a supermodel, and her mother harps on how Melody's sister is married, and so Melody storms out, saying that she's sorry she's not anything that makes her mother proud, missing her mother saying that she is proud. The next day at work, Melody is passed over for a promotion to the head of the perfume department at the department store where she works for a younger, less skilled co-worker, April May, whose main objective is to sell, not to serve. Melody finally decides to finish her Christmas list, and the next day, she takes it to work and (after some playfulness with Naomi) Naomi puts it in Santa's Mailbox at the department store. Then, things begin to change. She meets Danny Skylar, a boy who wants to buy a perfume that was similar to the smell of his late mother's, and when he can't pay the full amount, Melody loans him the rest, and he puts her name, along with his, on the entry form in a sweepstakes at the store to win a new Ford Mustang convertible. contains an answer for the question: Who plays the part of the woman who asks for a \\"Dickens-Style\\" Christmas?, what is it ?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I can use this background: Gibberellins are hormones that cause the plant to grow. When gibberellins are applied to plants by scientists, the stems grow longer. Some gardeners or horticulture scientists add gibberellins to increase the growth of plants. Dwarf plants (small plants), on the other hand, have low levels of gibberellins ( Figure below ). Another function of gibberellins is to stop dormancy (resting time) of seeds and buds. Gibberellins signal that it’s time for a seed to germinate (sprout) or for a bud to open.  Now, I have a new situation: Keith has four plants in his backyard, plant A, plant B, plant C, and plant D. Plant A is very large, but plant B is smaller. Plant C and D are the same size. He applied some gibberellins to plant C, but didn't apply anything to plant D. He got curious about why some plants are bigger, while others are not.  Answer this question please: Which plant would not see increase in growth, plant C or plant D? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided about gibberellins and the situation Keith is in with his four plants, plant D would not see an increase in growth after the application of gibberellins. Firstly, let's review the roles of gibberellins in plant growth. Gibberellins are plant hormones that are known to have a direct effect on the growth and development of plants. They play a crucial role in promoting stem elongation and can also help bring an end to dormancy in seeds and buds, allowing them to germinate and grow. In Keith's situation, he has four plants, with plant A being the largest, plant B being smaller, and plants C and D having the same size. He decided to apply gibberellins to plant C and did not apply anything to plant D. As explained earlier, gibberellins have a direct impact on the growth of plants, specifically in promoting stem elongation. Therefore, we can infer that plant C, which was treated with gibberellins, will likely see an increase in its growth due to the presence of these growth-promoting hormones.  On the other hand, plant D, which did not receive any gibberellins treatment, is less likely to experience the same growth increase as plant C. Although plants naturally produce gibberellins, the absence of additional gibberellins means that plant D will be relying solely on its endogenous levels of these hormones for growth. As a result, plant D would not see the same increase in growth as plant C, which received the external application of gibberellins. In conclusion, it is plant D that would not see an increase in growth when compared to plant C, since it did not receive any gibberellins treatment. Keith's curiosity about the differences in plant size could be addressed by considering factors such as genetics, environmental factors, and the presence of growth-promoting hormones like gibberellins. By understanding how these factors interact and contribute to plant growth, Keith could potentially adjust conditions and treatments to optimize the growth of his plants."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Suppose Jack and Jill don't care about fairness, just about accumulating cash.Then Jack can offer Jill as little as he likes and Jill will still accept.After all, a little money is more than no money.But imagine, instead, that Jack and Jill both care only about fairness and that the fairest outcome is equality.Then Jack would offer Jill half the money; and Jill wouldn't accept otherwise. What happens when we ask people to play this game for real? It turns out that people value fairness a lot.Anyone offered less than 20-30% of the money is likely to reject it.Receiving an unfair offers makes us feel sick.Happily, most offers are pretty equitable; indeed, by far the most common is a 50-50 split.

The detection of SARS-CoV-2 is important for the prevention of the outbreak and management of patients. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay detected the virus in clinical laboratory. This study utilized primers and single-quencher probes in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the USA and the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) in Japan. Moreover, we designed the double-quencher probes (YCH assay) according to the oligonucleotide sequence established by NIID. Using these assays, we conducted a one-step real-time RT-PCR with serial DNA positive control to assess the detection sensitivity. The threshold cycle (Ct) value of RT-PCR was relatively low in CDC and YCH assays compared to NIID assay. Serial dilution assay showed that both CDC and YCH assays could detect a low-copy number of DNA positive control. The background fluorescent signal at the baseline was lower in YCH than that of NIID.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: After reading the previous comments, I'm just glad that I wasn't the only person left confused, especially by the last 20 minutes. John Carradine is shown twice walking down into a grave and pulling the lid shut after him. I anxiously awaited some kind of explanation for this odd behavior...naturally I assumed he had something to do with the evil goings-on at the house, but since he got killed off by the first rising corpse (hereafter referred to as Zombie #1), these scenes made absolutely no sense. Please, if someone out there knows why Carradine kept climbing down into graves -- let the rest of us in on it!!  All the action is confined to the last 20 minutes so I'll attempt a synopsis. John Carradine comes out to the cemetery to investigate, and is throttled by Zombie #1. So far, so good. But then we get the confusing scene where John Ireland and Jerry Strickler, out for a little moonlight filming in the graveyard, discover Carradine's dead body. Strickler repeatedly tries to push Ireland into the open grave from whence Zombie #1 had emerged, but Ireland succeeds in flipping him into the open grave instead, and PRESTO! Strickler comes out as Zombie #2! Yeah, I guess we can infer that Strickler was dead all-along (a witch?), but why he changed from normal appearance into rotting-flesh version by flying into Zombie #1's grave is never explained. (Considering how excruciatingly slow-moving these zombies are, I'd of thought he would have preferred to stay in his \\"normal\\" form until his business was concluded). This scene also brings a question to mind -- just who the heck IS Zombie #1 ??? We can only assume Zombie #1 is one of the original murder victims shown during the movie's opening credits, but who knows which one, nor why he has a particular grudge against the film crew. Anyway, after Ireland sees this transformation and runs away, we see the EXACT SAME SHOT of Zombie #2 shambling through the trees as we saw for Zombie #1. (This leads to momentary confusion over just how MANY zombies there really are). Then in best 1950's horror-movie fashion Ireland manages to trip while fleeing. He conveniently knocks his head on the small headstone of Faith Domergue's dead cat (wasn't that nice of John Carradine to chisel a tombstone for a cat that he barely knew?) Meanwhile, Zombie #1 has been wrecking havoc up at the house. He easily dispatches three film-crew members, then starts up the stairs. Faith Domergue hears him, and thinking it's lover John Ireland back from his night-shoot, goes out. Upon seeing it's only Zombie #1, she lets out a scream and retreats into a bedroom where she retrieves Ireland's revolver. While starlet Carole Wells is showering at this point and can't hear the scream, her co-star Charles Macauley (who's boozing and hamming it up at a mirror in his bedroom) does. Taking his sweet time (and only after some more swigs from his hip-flask) he finally decides to investigate. (One thing that strikes the viewer during the last quarter of this movie is how SLOW TO REACT the stars are to screams and gunshots). Domergue comes back out into the hallway armed and ready, but mistakes Macauley for Zombie #1 and shoots him six times! He does a nice acrobatic flip over the railing, then a horrified Domergue backs up, right into the waiting arms of Zombie #1. Carole Wells is by now out of her shower and drying off when she hears gunshots and Domergue's screams; she too feels no great urgency in running out to investigate. So during this time Zombie #1 has time to string Domergue up from the neck with a rope. Wells sees Domergue's hanging corpse and faints dead-away. The next time we see her is in a stream outside the house (???) -- but more on that later. Meantime, Ireland has recovered his senses and stumbles into the house where he discovers Zombie #1's bloody carnage. Though Ireland has just stumbled upon 3 murdered people he's more concerned that his film has been exposed and ruined! Mercifully for him (and the audience), Zombie #1 throws some movie equipment down on his head from the 2nd floor. That's the last we see of Zombie #1. At this point the audience is treated to a montage of all the deaths, showing that the new ones \\"mirror\\" the old ones. How profound. Zombie #2, meanwhile, has gotten near the house (remember, these zombies move as slow as molasses in January) where he happens to see Carole Wells floating by in a stream, and fishes her out. How did she get there? Did Zombie #1 carry her down, throw her in, then zoom back upstairs just in time to crush John Ireland? Apparently one of the original victims was drowned in the tub, so Wells has to drown too (but why outside in a stream, instead of in the tub, is never explained). Zombie #2 never makes it into the house himself (everyone's dead by now, anyways, thanks to Zombie #1) but instead he carries Carol Wells back to the graveyard. As the end credits flash on screen, we see Zombie #2 with his dead love still in his arms, descending into the open grave. The viewer is left wondering: Yes, but wasn't this Zombie #1's grave? Why is Zombie #2 taking up residence? And what if Zombie #1 comes along and wants to climb back in -- is Zombie #2 gonna let him, or will there be a zombie fight? Will the zombies share both the grave and the newly deceased Carole Wells? And what about now-dead John Carradine -- where's he gonna stay? After all, from the earlier scenes we know he's clearly at home in the grave...

Ascending colon: This section starts at the cecum (a pouch marking the beginning of the large intestine) and travels upward along the right side of the abdominal cavity. 2. Transverse colon: This part extends horizontally from the ascending colon, crossing the upper abdomen from right to left. 3. Descending colon: This part goes downward from the end of the transverse colon, following the left side of the abdominal cavity. 4.

If operating a touchscreen device is too complicated for you, a Danish company has worked out something even simpler -- a system that lets you issue commands with a glance. The Eye Tribe Tracker is a 99 device that attaches to the edge of an iPad or Android laptop. It uses infrared light and an optical camera to precisely track the position of the user’s eyes. The user can now activate on-screen features of the tablet simply by looking at them. Calibrating the Eye Tribe device was remarkably easy. I gave it a try, and within about two minutes I was playing the popular game “Fruit Ninja,” and slicing up watermelons with my eyes. “What you see here is a new way of interacting with your computer,” said Eye Tribe partner Anders Bo Pedersen. “Imagine being able to press buttons, follow links in a browser, even type letters on the keyboard, just by looking at your screen.” But Pedersen’s Eye Tribe device is merely a prototype, to help software developers build compatible apps. The company’s goal is to persuade tablet makers to integrate the technology inside their devices. Pedersen said that manufacturers would only need to add an infrared beacon alongside the standard front-facing camera, and some Eye Tribe software.

Paragraph: In Hamburg, Jarrah had a succession of living accommodations, but he apparently never resided with his future co-conspirators. It is not clear how and when he became part of Atta's circle. He became particularly friendly with Binalshibh after meeting him at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, which Jarrah began attending regularly in late 1997. The worshippers at this mosque featured an outspoken, flamboyant Islamist named Mohammed Haydar Zammar. A well-known figure in the Muslim community (and to German and U.S. intelligence agencies by the late 1990s), Zammar had fought in Afghanistan and relished any opportunity to extol the virtues of violent jihad. Indeed, a witness has reported hearing Zammar press Binalshibh to fulfill his duty to wage jihad. Moreover, after 9/11, Zammar reportedly took credit for influencing not just Binalshibh but the rest of the Hamburg group. In 1998, Zammar encouraged them to participate in jihad and even convinced them to go to Afghanistan. Owing to Zammar's persuasion or some other source of inspiration, Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah eventually prepared themselves to translate their extremist beliefs into action. By late 1999, they were ready to abandon their student lives in Germany in favor of violent jihad. This final stage in their evolution toward embracing Islamist extremism did not entirely escape the notice of the people around them. The foursome became core members of a group of radical Muslims, often hosting sessions at their Marienstrasse apartment that involved extremely anti-American discussions. Meeting three to four times a week, the group became something of a \\"sect\\" whose members, according to one participant in the meetings, tended to deal only with each other. Atta's rent checks for the apartment provide evidence of the importance that the apartment assumed as a center for the group, as he would write on them the notation \\"Dar el Ansar,\\" or \\"house of the followers.\\" In addition to Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah, the group included other extremists, some of whom also would attend al Qaeda training camps and, in some instances, would help the 9/11 hijackers as they executed the plot: Said Bahaji, son of a Moroccan immigrant, was the only German citizen in the group. Educated in Morocco, Bahaji returned to Germany to study electrical engineering at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg. He spent five months in the German army before obtaining a medical discharge, and lived with Atta and Binalshibh at 54 Marienstrasse for eight months between November 1998 and July 1999. Described as an insecure follower with no personality and with limited knowledge of Islam, Bahaji nonetheless professed his readiness to engage in violence.

Three men and three women will spend eight months living in a special place on the side of a volcano in Hawaii. They are part of an experiment that is designed to mimic life on Mars. Their mission began on October 15, 2014. NASA says it could send astronauts to Mars as early as the 2030s. The mission would take more than two years, so NASA needs to know how people would react to living in a small group, isolated from the rest of the world, for such a long time. Some people may become depressed or bored living under those conditions. By studying people living in similar conditions here on Eares NASA hopes to learn how to choose the most suitable people for a space mission, and how to help them get along. They will live in a two-story building. The ground floor is about 86 square meters, roughly the size of a small two-bedroom apartment. It includes shared areas like kitchen, dining room, bathroom, laboratory and an exercise room. The upstairs is less than half the size of the downstairs. It contains another bathroom and six small bedrooms. The building is located in an abandoned quarry about 2,400 meters up the side of Mauna Loa, the second biggest volcano in the world. It is constantly monitored for signs of volcanic activity. NASA chose the location because the appearance looks very similar to Mars. To make it more like being on Mars in the future, they are only able to communicate by email during the experiment. Meanwhile, there will be a 20-minute delay between the time when a message is sent and that when it is received. When they go outside, they will have to suit up in full spacesuits, just as if they were on Mars. The commander is Martha Lenio, a 34-year-old Canadian. During the mission, she will run experiments on growing food. The other members have backgrounds in physics and so on. None of them are astronauts. When will the six volunteers end their mission about mimicking life on Mars? A) On June 15, 2015. B) On October 15, 2015. C) On October 15, 2030. D) On June 15, 2032. A:","output":"The six volunteers began their mission on October 15, 2014, and were supposed to spend eight months living in a special place on the side of a volcano in Hawaii.

The mechanical advantage is the factor by which a machine changes the input force. The ideal mechanical advantage is the increase or decrease in force that would occur if there were no friction to overcome in the use of the machine. Because all machines must overcome some friction, the ideal mechanical advantage is always somewhat greater than the actual mechanical advantage of the machine as it is used in the real world.  John designed a hypothetical lever that would have ideal mechanical advantage. He labeled the lever as lever A.

Which lever would have less friction, lever A or lever B? A:","output":"Lever A, the hypothetical lever designed by John with ideal mechanical advantage, would have less friction as compared to Lever B, the real-world lever. In the ideal scenario of Lever A, it is assumed that there is no friction to overcome, which results in a higher mechanical advantage.

I’d feel aware right before it would occur and I would rush to look in a mirror only to discover my eyes were not crossing. I informed my OB who blamed it on the blood vessels in my eyes enlarging due to pregnancy. Ummm ok. You know more than me. Later I was told by a surgeon what I was experiencing was ‘textbook’ for the passing of blood clots through my occipital area of the brain! The feeling would eventually subside. I awoke one morning feeling ‘kind of fuzzy’ headed. Like I had slept too hard. I sat with my husband at the kitchen table for our morning coffee and newspaper and for no reason I could imagine I was unable to swallow my coffee and it dribbled out the left side of my mouth. My husband asked me what was going on and I apparently told him, I was ‘stroking’ out. He got up from the table assuming I was OK and went off to take his morning shower.

The eighth-grader was inspired to kick off his creation on a recent morning, when his mother was driving him to school. Their car was damaged as it went over a huge pothole in the middle of the street in their hometown of Jackson, Mississippi. He decided to do something about the pothole problem in his city. Chokwe developed the app with his friends Rodriguez Ratliff and Emmanuel Brooks. When the app detects a pothole, it is highlighted in red. And if you get close to the pothole, your phone will warn you with a beep. Drivers can also use the app to report any potholes and look for other routes they can take to avoid roads that have them. The app relies on current available information about the streets of Jackson, already stored in a database of the city's 311 call system. Through the call system, citizens dial 3-1-1 to report non-emergency problems which include potholes. Chokwe and his friends determined that focusing on the 10 busiest streets in Jackson would give them a large enough sample size to test the prototype. While developing the app, the boys took part in a Minority Male Makers Program sponsored by Verizon and held at Jackson State University. They learned 3D printing and design, and how to create apps. Through the program Chokwe and his friends received encouragement and guidance. Although the app isn't yet available for sale, Chokwe is already looking for ways to improve the app. He hopes to add more to it until it spreads all over the country. Question: Which can be Chokwe's future target? Options: A: Encouraging more kids to create apps. B: Taking part in more learning programs. C: Making the app available for sale online.

Please answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: -  Wind or water breaks small pieces off of a rock - The wind or water deposits tiny rocks - The rocks become known as sediment - The layers of sediment are pressed together by other layers of sediment on top - Minerals from the rocks in the sediment dissolve Answer:","output":"The final step of the given process, which essentially describes the formation of sedimentary rocks, is the lithification of the sediment. After the wind or water breaks small pieces off a rock, deposits tiny rocks, and they become known as sediment, the layers of sediment are pressed together by other layers of sediment on top. This pressure compacts the layers and forces out water, reducing the volume of the sediments. Meanwhile, minerals from the rocks in the sediment dissolve in the water that is being pushed out. This dissolved mineral solution acts as a natural cement that binds the sediment particles together.  The final stage, lithification, is when this process of compaction and cementation leads to the formation of a solid rock. During lithification, the sediment layers undergo a transformation as the compaction forces the grains closer together, eliminating any remaining water between the grains. The dissolved minerals from the rock sediments then crystallize around the particles and on the surfaces of the contacts between those particles. This means that the sediment layers now become interconnected, and solidify to form a coherent rock mass.  This new rock formed from the compacted and cemented layers of sediment is known as sedimentary rock. Sedimentary rocks are diverse and can be made up of different minerals or organic materials, such as sandstone, limestone, or coal. Each type of sedimentary rock is formed under specific conditions, and their composition and appearance can provide valuable information about the geological history and environmental conditions of the area in which they were formed. Over time, these sedimentary rocks may also become a part of the rock cycle, where they will eventually be transformed into metamorphic or igneous rocks, or be weathered and eroded to form new sediments, repeating the process all over again."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Revere -- whose birth name was Paul Revere Dick, according to a biography on the Internet Movie Database -- was frontman for the band that often performed in three-cornered hats and other clothing harking back to the Ameican Revolution. Revere was born in Nebraska and played in bands in Idaho and Oregon, according to a tribute on the band website written by Roger Hart, who managed the group in the early days. Hart said he took the band to Hollywood and signed them to a deal with CBS/Columbia Records. The band recorded a string of hits in the 1960s and early 1970s, including \\"Kicks,\\" \\"Hungry\\" and \\"Indian Reservation.\\" Revere, the band's organist, had a hyperactive effervescent stage personality and came to be known as \\"the madman of rock 'n' roll.\\" In a tribute on the band's website, a fan remembered seeing the band for the first time. \\"My dad took me to a Paul Revere and the Raiders concert in Buffalo NY in April of 1967,\\" she wrote. \\"I think other than the male acts he was the ONLY man there.

The wisdom of that decision will long be debated, but having made it, the United States is now understandably reluctant to undo it. Even as the Obama administration sorts through a galaxy of unattractive options, none of which is guaranteed to provide stability, it would be well-advised not to overlook one of the biggest strategic lessons of the Iraqi deterioration.

Mountain Jews speak Judeo-Tat, also called Juhuri, a form of Persian, it belongs to the southwestern group of the Iranian division of the Indo-European languages. Judeo-Tat has Semitic (Hebrew/Aramaic/Arabic) elements on all linguistic levels. Among other Semitic elements, Judeo-Tat has the Hebrew sound \\"ayin\\" (\`), whereas no neighboring languages have it. Until the early Soviet period, the language was written with semi-cursive Hebrew alphabet. Later, Judeo-Tat books, newspapers, textbooks, and other materials were printed with a Latin alphabet and finally in Cyrillic, which is still most common today. The first Judeo-Tat-language newspaper, Zakhmetkesh (Working People), was published in 1928 and operated until the second half of the twentieth century.  Originally, only boys were educated through synagogue schools. Starting from the 1860s, many well-off families switched to home-schooling, hiring private tutors, who taught their sons not only Hebrew, but also Russian and Yiddish. In the early 20th century, with advance of sovietization, Judeo-Tat became the language of instruction at newly founded elementary schools attended by both Mountain Jewish boys and girls. This policy continued until the beginning of World War II, when schools switched to Russian as the central government emphasized acquisition of Russian as the official language of the Soviet Union.  The Mountain Jewish community has had notable figures in public health, education, culture, and art.  In the 21st century, the government is encouraging the cultural life of minorities. In Dagestan and Kabardino-Balkaria, Judeo-Tat and Hebrew courses have been introduced in traditionally Mountain Jewish schools. In Dagestan, there is support for the revival of the Judeo-Tat-language theater and the publication of newspapers in that language.

Read this article and answer this question In 1616 the Venetians besieged Farra and Gradisca, and the archduke attacked from Gorizia and Lucinico. With three large culverins, four guns and three small culverins, Farra  repulsed the enemy artillery with heavy losses. The Venetians launched another futile assault before Giustiniani lifted the siege and retreated to Mariano. In September, Johan Ernst van Nassau-Siegen agreed to raise 3,000 men from the Dutch Republic for Venetian service. They arrived in May 1617, followed six months later by another 2,000 . Spanish support was blocked at sea by a flotilla of 12 Dutch and 10 English warships and on land by the war in Mantua. Although Archduke Ferdinand had only 4,000 soldiers to defend Gradisca, he received military, political and financial support from the Spanish as part of a larger agreement: Philip agreed to fight the Venetians and support Ferdinand as the next Holy Roman Emperor in return for the cession of Alsace, Finale Ligure and Piombino. This led to a negotiated settlement between Ferdinand and the Venetians in which many Uskok pirates were executed or exiled, and a permanent Austrian garrison was installed in Senj.

Question: Question: \\"Why would an owl have a better depth of field than another type of bird?\\"  Context: \\"Many birds show plumage patterns in ultraviolet that are invisible to the human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers. Male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers. Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. The eyelids of a bird are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten. Most birds cannot move their eyes, although there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. Birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field. The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears. The inner ear has a cochlea, but it is not spiral as in mammals.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"An owl has a better depth of field than other types of birds due to a combination of factors including its unique eye and head structure, as well as its specific hunting and foraging needs. In general, birds have different vision characteristics depending on their ecological requirements and behaviors. Owls, being nocturnal predators, possess adaptations that enable them to have a greater depth of field in comparison to other birds, which significantly benefits their hunting abilities. Firstly, the position of the owl's eyes plays a crucial role in enhancing its depth of field. Unlike many birds that have eyes on the sides of their heads providing a wider visual field, owls have eyes positioned at the front of their heads. This frontal eye placement results in binocular vision, which refers to the overlapping of visual fields from both eyes. This overlap enables owls to perceive depth more effectively and estimate the distance to objects, such as their prey, with a higher degree of accuracy. Secondly, the anatomy of an owl's eyes contributes to its superior depth of field. Owls' eyes are large and tubular, with a high density of cells called photoreceptors in their retinas. These photoreceptors are particularly sensitive to low-light conditions, allowing owls to see clearly even in near-darkness. This acute night vision is crucial for owls as they primarily hunt during the night when the ability to perceive depth and distance plays a vital role in successfully capturing prey. In addition to their unique eye structure, owls have an enhanced focusing ability due to their flexible corneas and lenses, which further contributes to their improved depth of field. This flexibility allows owls to rapidly focus on objects at varying distances, from close-up objects to those further away in their surroundings. This quick focusing ability is essential for owls as they have limited eye movement and rely on their heads to direct their gaze. Another factor that contributes to owls' better depth of field is their specialized hunting behavior. Owls are highly adapted to a sit-and-wait hunting strategy, where they perch silently, scanning their surroundings for prey. In this context, the ability to accurately judge distances and depth is crucial for efficient hunting and capturing moving prey in low-light environments. Furthermore, owls' neck structure enables them to rotate their head up to 270 degrees, giving them an extensive field of view without moving their bodies. This increased range of motion allows owls to maintain their exceptional depth perception across a wide area, further improving their hunting capabilities. In conclusion, owls have a better depth of field than other types of birds due to their frontal eye positioning, unique eye anatomy, enhanced focusing ability, specialized hunting behaviors, and neck flexibility. These adaptations work together to provide owls with the necessary depth perception to excel in their nocturnal predatory roles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Office Chair Designed to Restore Your Focus at Work Workers are having trouble staying on task. Crammed together with colleagues in open floor plans, lured into procrastination by social media, and inundated by emails, the modern corporate workday for many is an eight-hour parade of distractions, punctuated by lunch. The length of time office workers focus on a computer screen before shifting their attention dropped to 1 minute, 15 seconds in 2012—down from 2 minutes, 18 seconds in 2008, according to research from Gloria Mark, a professor in the department of Informatics at the University of California, Irvine. Another study published by Mark this year tracked workers for five days, discovering that, on average, they visited Facebook 21 times a day and checked email 74 times. That has left some companies struggling to keep workers’ eyes on their work. But one firm’s misfortune is another’s business opportunity. Enter Steelcase Inc., which claims its new line of office furniture can eliminate distractions and keep workers focused. Called Brody – a play on the words “body” and “brain” – the pod-like workstation is shielded from view by screens on about three sides, depending on the model. With its visible power outlet and dedicated space for a person’s bag, the design is intended to calm anxiety in workers, according to Mark McKenna, a Steelcase designer who worked on the project. Everything from a low charge on a laptop to a handbag that’s not within arms’ reach can spark “latent anxiety” in employees, he said, making them uncomfortable and unable to keep their minds on their to-do list. “When we can just get rid of all of that worry, what you’re left with is you and your work,” he said. Steelcase conducted research in a library, observing how individuals settled down with their work. Many withdrew – finding a quiet place, putting their backs to a wall or just slouching down. The researchers noted that people switched postures frequently. Some people prefer to recline when they focus, but they can end up looking at their screens from a strange angle, straining their neck and shoulders. So Steelcase designed the workstation with a wide, soft seat to support a new posture they call the “alert recline,” which keeps workers upper bodies’ slightly more vertical. The result, McKenna says, is an “escape,” crafted from wood, aluminum and plastic and then covered in an array of fabrics. The units, which start at 2700, are 42 inches wide and about 60 inches long, but they can be attached to each other and configured in a variety of shapes. McKenna hopes the work stations will help users reach “flow,” a state in which individuals become completely absorbed in an activity that uses their skills and challenges them. But Mark is skeptical that a piece of furniture can accomplish that goal. Office workers are plagued more by digital distractions than physical ones, she said. So while the Steelcase furniture might shut out colleagues, unless it can also shut off workers’ phones or Twitter feeds, interruptions will persist. What’s more, she said, isolating workers can result in more random interruptions. When workers are in close quarters with one another, they can see when coworkers are on a call or hammering out a project on deadline, and may be less likely to interrupt those busy workers, Mark’s work has found. When employees are out of sight, colleagues may assume they’re free to answer email. The employee, even cocooned in a Brody, might find responding irresistible. Still, McKenna says his team was able to create “a kind of micro-environment that helps people get into flow,” he said. “We wanted a product that allowed people to escape and focus.” What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"1. Modern work environment problems: Workers are struggling to stay focused due to open floor plans, social media, and constant email checking.

Options: - silence - choir - song - radio - telephone  Explain why a human would choose \\"song\\" to answer the question above:","output":"A human would choose \\"song\\" as the answer to the question because out of the given options, it represents the most creative and expressive use of the human voice. A song is a musical composition typically featuring lyrics and melodies that is performed using the voice, often accompanied by musical instruments. Creating and performing songs allows humans to express themselves artistically, emotionally, and culturally in ways that the other options may not fully capture. Here's a closer look at each option and why \\"song\\" stands out as the ideal choice: 1. Silence: This option would involve not using the voice at all. While silence can have its own merits in certain situations, such as promoting relaxation or focusing the mind, it does not showcase the capabilities of the human voice and is not inherently creative. 2. Choir: A choir is a group of singers who perform together, usually in a choral or classical setting. While singing in a choir can be a fulfilling and enjoyable activity, this option is more limited than \\"song\\" as it focuses on a specific type of vocal performance and typically does not involve creating original compositions. 3. Song: As previously mentioned, this option involves creating and performing music using the human voice, often in combination with other instruments. Songs can range from simple, heartfelt tunes to elaborate, orchestral compositions. They often tell stories, convey emotions, or express cultural ideas, making them a versatile and powerful form of self-expression. Songs can be enjoyed by both the creator and the listener, making them an important aspect of human connection and communication. 4. Radio: Radio refers to the medium of broadcasting audio content via electromagnetic waves. While radio hosts and personalities use their voices as they broadcast, the focus is on delivering news, opinions, or relevant information rather than creative self-expression. Additionally, the human voice is only one small aspect of radio, as it often includes pre-recorded content, such as commercials and music. 5. Telephone: The telephone is a communication tool that enables two individuals to have a conversation using their voices from different locations. While the human voice is certainly an essential aspect of telephone communication, it primarily facilitates everyday conversations rather than promoting artistic or emotional expression. Ultimately, a human would choose \\"song\\" as the answer to the question because it encapsulates the unique ability of the human voice to create and convey art, emotion, and cultural meaning. Singing is an inherently human form of expression that has endured throughout history, resonating with people across continents and generations. This makes \\"song\\" the most fitting choice for showcasing the remarkable capabilities of the human voice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Different photographs are needed for different reasons, such as a show or a shoot for an album insert, magazine, or press kit. Find out the requirements for the shoot, so you know if the photograph needs to be a certain shape or size, or if the band or public relations team has any special requests. Photo passes for concerts often have limits. Many do not allow you to have flash and only allow photos for the first 3 songs. Find out any rules and restrictions ahead of time so you can be prepared and get the best possible shots. Knowing what to expect before the concert can help you determine the best location to take your photographs. Learn the band's music as well as what actions they take on stage. Some bands are very active during a performance and dance around or get into the crowd. Others may have a more mellow style and simply sit or stand while singing. Many concerts take place late at night, so you may be working until the wee hours of the morning. If you are touring with a band, you’ll have to follow the call times and curfews as well. Be prepared to work long hours at a show in addition to spending time editing your photographs. When taking photos for press kits or publications, you’ll be able to choose the location. You must know the band and their music well in order to find a place that is suitable. For example, urban locations might be great for a punk band, while rural locations could be better suited for a country artist. You don’t just want generic shots of band members or performances. It’s essential that you capture the mood of the music and the personality of the band. Wait for that moment when a band member’s personality shines through in their performance to take your shot.  If you’re doing a photo shoot, don’t be afraid to ask the band members to move or position themselves differently. Make sure you take into consideration the differences between members, as some may be more outgoing than others.

Therefore, my translation in French would be:  \\"Pour ceux d'entre vous qui sont réticents à commander en ligne, il est désormais disponible en tant que magasin concept Furniturebox.\\" Let's break this down a little to justify the translation: 1. \\"For those of you who are reluctant\\" translates to \\"Pour ceux d'entre vous qui sont réticents\\". French treats plural forms and pronouns differently so \\"you\\" becomes \\"d'entre vous\\" instead of simple \\"vous\\". 2. \\"about ordering online\\" translates to \\"à commander en ligne\\". In French, the preposition \\"about\\" is translated to 'à' when referencing a particular subject or topic. 3. \\"is now available\\" translates to \\"est désormais disponible\\". The phrase \\"is now available\\" changes to \\"est désormais disponible\\", shifting the 'now' to be more formal ('désormais') than the literal translation of 'now' ('maintenant') in French to sound more natural. 4. \\"as Furniturebox concept store\\" it's translated to the natural phrase \\"en tant que magasin concept Furniturebox\\". The preposition 'as' translate to 'en tant que' in this context in French.

The Transylvanian city of Brasov is usually just a day trip from Bucharest. People spend maybe an hour or so to wandering around the town square, and buy a drink before hopping back on their transport back to the capital city of Romania. But, thanks to an epic tip-off from the travel ninja Shikha at Why Waste Annual Leave and a few other Brasov devotees, instead of following the crowds, we booked a couple of leisurely nights there. At the end of our day trip, instead of returning to Bucharest and getting stuck in the Sunday evening traffic, we checked into our hotel and waved our guide off.  Yes, you can easily ‘do’ Brasov in an afternoon – it’s a popular stop off at the end of a day trip after visiting the “home” of Dracula – Bran castle, and the beautiful Peles castle – but having the leisure to linger was exquisite. In addition to trying local dishes, we also ate lunch at McDonalds. Yes, yes, as a blogger we shouldn’t pretend to eat anything other than caviar washed down with champagne and unicorn tears, but we were hungry and couldn’t be bothered to find somewhere.

Question: Background: When soil is flooded, hypoxia develops, as soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma.  Paragraph: Two farmers are having a conversation at a bar about how their soil is doing. Jeff takes a sip of his beer and says that he just discovered that his soil is hypoxic. Brandon is trying to get the attention of the bartender so he can order another martini. Upon hearing Jeff's remark about his soil, Brandon states that the soil on his own farm is not hypoxic. Brandon is relieved when he notices the bartender is finally walking over to them.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Does Brandon's soil have more or less toxic compounds than Jeff's? Answer:","output":"Brandon's soil has less toxic compounds than Jeff's soil. This is because Jeff's soil is hypoxic, which leads to the formation of toxic compounds as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. Since Brandon's soil is not hypoxic, it is less likely to have these toxic compounds formed under low oxygen conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Tittle, was a professional American football quarterback. He played in the National Football League (NFL) for the San Francisco 49ers, New York Giants, and Baltimore Colts, after spending two seasons with the Colts in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Known for his competitiveness, leadership, and striking profile, Tittle was the centerpiece of several prolific offenses throughout his seventeen-year professional career from 1948 to 1964. Tittle played college football for Louisiana State University, where he was a two-time All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) quarterback for the LSU Tigers football team. Context: A photo of a dazed Tittle in the end zone taken by Morris Berman of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on September 20, 1964, is regarded among the most iconic images in the history of American sports and journalism. Tittle, in his 17th and final season, was photographed helmet-less, bloodied and kneeling immediately after having been knocked to the ground by John Baker of the Pittsburgh Steelers and throwing an interception that was returned for a touchdown at the old Pitt Stadium. He suffered a concussion and cracked sternum on the play, but went on to play the rest of the season.  Post-Gazette editors declined to publish the photo, looking for \\"action shots\\" instead, but Berman entered the image into contests where it took on a life of its own, winning a National Headliner Award. The photo was published in the October 2, 1964, issue of Life magazine. It is regarded as having changed the way that photographers look at sports, having shown the power of capturing a moment of reaction. It became one of three photos to hang in the lobby of the National Press Photographers Association headquarters, alongside Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima and the Hindenburg disaster. A copy now hangs in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.  After at first having failed to see the appeal of the image, Tittle eventually grew to embrace it, putting it on the back cover of his 2009 autobiography. \\"That was the end of the road,\\" he told the Los Angeles Times in 2008. \\"It was the end of my dream. It was over.\\" Pittsburgh player John Baker, who hit Tittle right before the picture was taken, ran for sheriff in his native Wake County, North Carolina in 1978, and used the photo as a campaign tool. He was elected and went on to serve for 24 years. Tittle also held a fundraiser to assist Baker in his bid for a fourth term in 1989. Question: Was there any other memorable moments from this particular game Answer:","output":"In this football game, a very special moment happened that many people remember. Y.A. Tittle, a famous quarterback, got hit really hard by another player named John Baker. A photographer named Morris Berman took a picture of Tittle right after the hit. In the photo, Tittle looked very tired, hurt, and sad. This photo became very famous because it showed a different side of sports - not just the exciting action, but also the tough moments that players go through. Even though Tittle was hurt in that game, he still played the rest of the season. The famous photo is now in a special place called the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and people remember it as an important moment in sports history."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article:A directive to shut the Dadaab camp and forcibly repatriate about 260,000 Somali refugees living there was issued last year. The deadline for its closure had been extended until May, but a high court judge ruled the decision was tantamount to an act of group persecution. The government says it will appeal against the ruling on security grounds. It said that attacks on its soil by the Somalia-based al-Shabab group had been planned in the camp. \\"The camp had lost its humanitarian nature and had become a haven for terrorism and other illegal activities,\\" Kenyan government spokesman Eric Kiraithe said. \\"The lives of Kenyans matter. Our interest in this case, and in the closure of Dadaab refugee camp, remains to protect the lives of Kenyans,\\" he added. Dadaab was set up in 1991 to house families fleeing conflict in Somalia, and some people have been living there for more than 20 years. The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights and lobby group Kituo Cha Sheria challenged the decision in court, saying it was discriminatory and contrary to international law. \\"The government's decision specifically targeting Somali refugees is an act of group persecution, illegal discriminatory and therefore unconstitutional,\\" Judge John Mativo said. The orders are excessive, arbitrary and disproportionate, he said. The BBC's Nancy Kacungira in the capital, Nairobi, says the ruling means the government has to start putting in place mechanisms that will restore regular operations at the camp even though it will launch an appeal. Kenya's refugee department had already been shut, which meant that new-born babies were not being registered as refugees, Said Abuka, a community leader and refugee in Nairobi, told the Associated Press news agency. Amnesty International welcomed the ruling, saying it affirmed Kenya's legal obligation to protect people who seek safety from harm and persecution. \\"Today is a historic day for more than a quarter of a million refugees who were at risk of being forcefully returned to Somalia, where they would have been at serious risk of human rights abuses,\\" the rights group's Muthoni Wanyeki said in a statement. Mr Kiraithe said since the closure of Dadaab was announced, more than 51,000 Somalis had voluntarily returned to Somalia. \\"We are encouraged that Somalia continues to stabilise politically more so with the election of a new president,\\" he added. Somalia's 'Mr Cheese' president has a lot on his plate Somalia's UN-backed government, with the help of a 22,000-strong African Union force, is battling Islamist group al-Shabab to regain control of the country. But it has only managed to secure major towns. The militants, who impose a strict version of Islam in the areas they control, still mount deadly bombings and have carried out a string of attacks in neighbouring Kenya. Kenya is currently building a fence along its 700km (435-mile) border with Somalia, but has completed only 4km so far. A summary of the above article is?","output":"Last year, a directive was issued to shut the Dadaab camp and forcibly repatriate around 260,000 Somali refugees in the camp. The deadline for the closure was extended until May, but a high court judge decided the decision to close the camp was an act of group persecution.

Informed Decision-Making: Statistical surveys provide essential data that can be used to make informed decisions. By understanding the distribution, trends, and patterns within the data, colleagues can develop new strategies, improve existing practices, and even identify any potential problems that may need to be addressed urgently. 2. Encouraging Collaboration: Conducting a statistical survey requires teamwork and coordination among the group members. This process fosters cooperation and collaboration, as members must rely on each other's skills, knowledge, and capabilities to gather accurate data and insights. 3. Enhanced Understanding: Statistical surveys can reveal surprising or non-intuitive insights about the subject being studied. This new information can help to refine existing knowledge, challenge assumptions, or perhaps aid in generating novel ideas or approaches. 4. Benchmarking Progress: Once the initial survey is completed, the data can serve as a benchmark for future surveys, allowing the team to track progress over time. Monitoring changes and progress is crucial in evaluating the effectiveness of implemented strategies or pinpointing any areas that need improvement. 5. Efficient Allocation of Resources: The data obtained from statistical surveys can help identify where resources should be better allocated, ensuring that time, personnel, and funding are directed towards the most promising projects or tasks.

Antenna (radio) The polarization of an antenna refers to the orientation of the electric field (E-plane) of the radio wave with respect to the Earth's surface and is determined by the physical structure of the antenna and by its orientation; note that this designation is totally distinct from the antenna's directionality. Thus, a simple straight wire antenna will have one polarization when mounted vertically, and a different polarization when mounted horizontally. As a transverse wave, the magnetic field of a radio wave is at right angles to that of the electric field, but by convention, talk of an antenna's \\"polarization\\" is understood to refer to the direction of the electric field. Q: What is another name for electric-field?","output":"The electric field is also sometimes called the E-field or electric field strength.

Question: what does a silver dollar 1873 coin look like I found the following answer on Google: In modern times, dollar coins have not been very popular in the United States. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","output":"No, the answer you found on Google is not directly related to the appearance of an 1873 silver dollar coin. Let me provide a detailed description of the 1873 silver dollar for you. The 1873 silver dollar coin, also known as the Morgan Dollar or Trade Dollar, was minted in the United States between 1873 and 1885. The Trade Dollar was specifically designed for international trade, especially with the far East, while the Morgan Dollar was intended for domestic circulation. Both the 1873 Morgan Dollar and the 1873 Trade Dollar share some common features. They are both made of 90% silver and 10% copper, and have a diameter of 38.1 millimeters. However, their appearances differ in terms of design and weight. Here is a description of both coins: 1. 1873 Morgan Dollar: - Obverse (front): The Morgan Dollar features a profiled portrait of Lady Liberty facing left, designed by English engraver George T. Morgan. Around the border of the coin, you'll find the inscription \\"E PLURIBUS UNUM,\\" which means \\"Out of Many, One\\" in Latin, along with 13 stars representing the original 13 colonies. The minting year \\"1873\\" is located at the bottom. - Reverse (back): The reverse side of the Morgan Dollar showcases a beautifully detailed heraldic eagle with outspread wings, grasping arrows and an olive branch in its talons. The eagle is surrounded by a wreath, with the words \\"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\\" and \\"ONE DOLLAR\\" inscribed around the border. Some of the coins also have a mint mark letter ('S', 'CC', or 'O') to indicate the mint at which they were produced - San Francisco, Carson City, or New Orleans, respectively. 2. 1873 Trade Dollar - Obverse (front): The obverse of the 1873 Trade Dollar, designed by William Barber, also features Lady Liberty but, in this case, she is seated and facing the viewer's right. She is holding a shield with the inscription \\"LIBERTY\\" and an olive branch in her left hand, while her right hand is extended over a small globe. The words \\"IN GOD WE TRUST\\" appear above her head, and the minting year \\"1873\\" is inscribed below her. - Reverse (back): The reverse side of the Trade Dollar depicts a majestic eagle holding an olive branch and three arrows, surrounded by the words \\"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\\" and \\"420 GRAINS .900 FINE\\". The denomination of \\"ONE DOLLAR\\" is found at the bottom of the coin. As with the Morgan Dollar, a mint mark appears on certain coins, depending on where they were minted. In summary, the 1873 silver dollar coin is available in two different designs: the Morgan Dollar and the Trade Dollar. While they share some similarities, they have distinct appearances and were intended for different uses."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: Little Big Man Context: In the present day 1970, 121-year-old Jack Crabb (Dustin Hoffman), who resides in a hospice, is recounting his long and colorful life story to a curious historian (William Hickey). Among other things, Crabb claims to have been a captive of the Cheyenne, a gunslinger, an associate of Wild Bill Hickok, a scout for General George Armstrong Custer, and the sole survivor of Custer's force at the 1876 Battle of Little Bighorn. Having been adopted by the Cheyenne and reared in their culture, Crabb has perspective on both Caucasian and Native American life in the 19th century.Flashing back to 1859, the 10-year-old Jack and his older sister Caroline (Carole Androsky) survive the massacre of their parents' wagon train by the hostile Pawnee. Found by a Cheyenne warrior, Jack and his sister are taken back to a Cheyenne village. Caroline manages to escape on horseback, but Jack is reared by good-hearted tribal leader Old Lodge Skins (Chief Dan George). Life among the Cheyenne proves to be idyllic, though Jack unwittingly makes an enemy of another boy, Younger Bear (Cal Bellini). However, Younger Bear eventually owes his life to Jack, who saves him from a Pawnee warrior. Jack is given the name \\"Little Big Man\\" because he's short but very brave.In 1865, when Jack is 16, he is captured by U.S. cavalry troopers after skirmish between them and the local Cheyenne. Jack then renounces his Native American upbringing in order to save himself from being killed. After his interrogation and debriefing, and being that he is still a minor, he is put in the care of Reverend Silas Pendrake (Thayer David) and his sexually frustrated wife, Louise (Faye Dunaway), who tries to seduce Jack. Jack cannot accept the contradiction between Louise's piety and sexual appetite.

If your dog looks pleased to see you - it is probably because it loves the particular way you smell. The odour of a familiar human apparently lingers like perfume in the animal's brain - where it triggers an instinctive emotional response, research published yesterday reveals. Our scent acts on a part of the canine brain associated with reward and the strongest reactions are produced by humans that pets know best, say scientists in America. Gregory Berns, of Emory University in Atlanta, said: 'While we might expect that dogs should be highly tuned to the smell of other dogs, it seems that the \\"reward response\\" is reserved for their humans. 'When humans smell the perfume or cologne of someone they love, they may have an immediate, emotional reaction that's not necessarily cognitive. 'Our experiment may be showing the same process in dogs. But since dogs are so much more olfactory  than humans, their responses would likely be even more powerful than the ones we might have. 'It's one thing when you come home and your dog sees you and jumps on you and licks you and knows that good things are about to happen. 'In our experiment, however, the scent donors were not physically present. Why do animals avoid pylons? Because they emit terrifying flashes of light that are INVISIBLE to humans. Dolphins use sponges to protect their sensitive noses while foraging for food on the sea floor 'That means the canine brain responses were being triggered by something distant in space and time. It shows that dogs' brains have these mental representations of us that persist when we're not there.' The university's experiment - the first of its type - involved 12 dogs of various breeds who underwent brain scans while five different scents were placed in front of them. The scent samples came from the subject itself, a dog the subject had never met, a dog that lived in the subject's household, a human the dog had never met, and a human that lived in the subject's household.

Mexi-Casa has got to be the \\"Whitest\\" Mexican restaurant I've ever been to.  Typically Mexican joints that aren't run by people of Mexican Heritage are surfer food, big fat burritos stuffed with everything but the kitchen sink.

The Beatles on iTunes was a big deal -- so big, in fact, that the band carried music sales to a rare year-over-year increase. Music sales in the United States were up 1.6 percent through May 8, according to Nielsen Soundscan. More than half of those sales went to digital retailers, as physical album sales continued to plummet. Although Nielsen doesn't have specific sales figures for digital Beatles tracks, the patterns are pretty obvious. Sales of catalog music -- old stuff, that is -- shot up immediately in November, when The Beatles hit iTunes, and has continued to see year-over-year growth in every month since. The Beatles' catalog landed on iTunes November 16, after years of rumors, speculation and drama. The deal between Apple, Apple Corps (The Beatles' publisher) and record label EMI is reportedly exclusive through some time this year. When Apple announced the news, skeptics wondered whether there were any Beatles fans left in the world who hadn't already purchased physical albums or resorted to piracy. This is silly. There are plenty of people who don't want to go the illegal route, either for reasons of morality or convenience, and the fact that these people could suddenly buy their favorite Beatles tracks from a smattering of albums was a huge development. It just goes to show that if you give people what they want and make it easy to buy, they will hand over their money. That's something for other digital music holdouts -- AC/DC, Garth Brooks and Bob Seger among them -- to consider. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The Beatles' arrival on iTunes has significantly impacted music sales, leading to a rare year-over-year increase in the United States. The increase in sales can be observed after the Beatles' catalog was made available on iTunes in November. This has led to a growth in catalog music sales, which consist of older music. Digital retailers gained more than half of the sales, while physical album sales continued to decline. This indicates that there is still a significant number of fans who prefer to acquire their music legally and conveniently. The success of the Beatles on iTunes suggests that providing easy access to sought-after music can drive sales and should be considered by other digital music holdouts, such as AC/DC, Garth Brooks, and Bob Seger."},{"instruction":"Information:  - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe.  - The Schutzstaffel (SS; also stylized as with Armanen runes literally \\"Protection Squadron\\") was a major paramilitary organization under Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP; Nazi Party) in Nazi Germany. It began with a small guard unit known as the \\"Saal-Schutz\\" (Hall-Protection) made up of NSDAP volunteers to provide security for party meetings in Munich. In 1925, Heinrich Himmler joined the unit, which had by then been reformed and given its final name. Under his direction (192945), it grew from a small paramilitary formation to one of the most powerful organizations in Nazi Germany. From 1929 until the regime's collapse in 1945, the SS was the foremost agency of surveillance and terror within Germany and German-occupied Europe.  - Joachim Peiper ( German pronunciation : ( joaxm pap ) ; 30 January 1915 -- 14 July 1976 ) , also known as Jochen Peiper , was a field officer in the Waffen - SS during World War II and personal adjutant to Reichsführer - SS Heinrich Himmler between November 1940 and August 1941 . Peiper fought on both the Eastern Front against the Red Army and the Western Front against the Western Allies , and he won the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords for extreme battlefield bravery and outstanding military leadership . By 1945 , he was an SS - Standartenführer and the Waffen - SS 's youngest regimental colonel . Peiper was convicted of war crimes committed in Belgium and imprisoned for almost 12 years . He was accused of war crimes in Italy , but Italian and German courts concluded that there was insufficient evidence to warrant prosecution . After his release from prison , Peiper worked for both Porsche and Volkswagen , before moving to France , where he translated books from English to German under the nom de plume Rainer Buschmann . Peiper was murdered in France in July 1976 , when he was shot by unknown assailants who then burned his house to the ground using Molotov cocktails .  - Adjutant is a military rank or appointment. In some armies, including most English-speaking ones, it is an officer who assists a more senior officer, while in other armies, especially Francophone ones, it is an NCO (non-commissioned officer), normally corresponding roughly to a staff sergeant or warrant officer.  - Reichsführer-SS was a special title and rank that existed between the years of 1925 and 1945 for the commander of the Schutzstaffel (SS). \\"Reichsführer-SS\\" was a title from 1925 to 1933, and from 1934 to 1945 it was the highest rank of the SS. The longest serving and by far most noteworthy \\"Reichsführer-SS\\" was Heinrich Himmler.  - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II.  - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany.  - The National Socialist German Workers' Party (abbreviated NSDAP), commonly referred to in English as the Nazi Party, was a political party in Germany that was active between 1920 and 1945 and practised the ideology of Nazism. Its precursor, the German Workers' Party (\\"Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; DAP), existed from 1919 to 1920.   - Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889  30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (\\"Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and Führer (\\"Leader\\") of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. As dictator of the German Reich, he initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and was central to the Holocaust.  - Sergeant (abbreviated to Sgt and capitalised when used as a named person's title) is a rank in many uniformed organizations, principally military and policing forces. Its origin is the Latin \\"serviens\\", \\"one who serves\\", through the French term \\"sergent\\".  - In politics and military planning, a war effort refers to a coordinated mobilization of society's resourcesboth industrial and humantowards the support of a military force. Depending on the militarization of the culture, the relative size of the armed forces and the society supporting them, the style of government, and the popular support for the military objectives, such war effort can range from a small industry to complete command of society.  - The Waffen-SS (Armed SS) was the armed wing of the Nazi Party's SS organisation. Its formations included men from Nazi Germany, along with volunteers and conscripts from both occupied and un-occupied lands.  - Heinrich Luitpold Himmler (7 October 1900  23 May 1945) was \\"Reichsführer\\" of the \\"Schutzstaffel\\" (Protection Squadron; SS), and a leading member of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) of Nazi Germany. Nazi leader Adolf Hitler briefly appointed him a military commander and later Commander of the Replacement (Home) Army and General Plenipotentiary for the administration of the entire Third Reich (\\"Generalbevollmächtigter für die Verwaltung\\"). Himmler was one of the most powerful men in Nazi Germany and one of the people most directly responsible for the Holocaust.  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - Strategic bombing is a military strategy used in a total war with the goal of defeating the enemy by destroying its morale or its economic ability to produce and transport materiel to the theatres of military operations, or both. It is a systematically organized and executed attack from the air which can utilize strategic bombers, long- or medium-range missiles, or nuclear-armed fighter-bomber aircraft to attack targets deemed vital to the enemy's war-making capability.

Pseudonyms include stage names and user names (both called \\"screen names\\"), ring names, pen names, nicknames, aliases, superhero identities and code names, gamer identifications, and regnal names of emperors, popes, and other monarchs. Historically, they have often taken the form of anagrams, Graecisms, and Latinisations, although there are many other methods of choosing a pseudonym.  - A regnal name, or reign name, is a name used by some monarchs and popes during their reigns, and used subsequently to refer to them. The term is simply the adjective \\"regnal\\", of or relating to a reign, monarch, or kingdom, modifying \\"name\\". Since ancient times, monarchs have frequently, but not always, chosen to use a different name from their original name when they accede to the monarchy. The regnal name is usually followed by a regnal number (ordinal), usually written as a Roman numeral (VI rather than 6), to provide a unique identification for that monarch among other monarchs of that realm. In some cases, the monarch has more than one regnal name, but the regnal number is based on only one of those names, for example Charles X Gustav of Sweden, George Tupou V of Tonga. If a monarch reigns in more than one realm, he or she may carry different ordinals in each one, as they are each assigned chronologically, and some realms may have had different numbers of rulers of the same regnal name previously. For example, the same person was both King James I of England (along with Ireland) and King James VI of Scotland.    What is the relationship between 'bob mendes' and 'belgium'?

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? To paint a doll with something that resembles blood, you can Pick your answer from: --Use red paint on the doll to create something resembling blood --Use blue paint on the doll to create something resembling blood","output":"To paint a doll with something that resembles blood, it is recommended to use red paint on the doll as this will create a much more convincing and realistic depiction of blood. Using blue paint would not be an accurate representation of blood and may not look as believable. Below are detailed steps to achieve a blood-like effect using red paint on a doll. 1. Gather materials: To begin, you'll need to gather the required materials. You'll need a doll, red paint (preferably acrylic), a paintbrush, a disposable plate or palette to mix the paint, water, a tissue or paper towel, and a work surface covered with a drop cloth or newspaper. 2. Choose the right shade: To make a realistic blood color, choose a deep red shade of paint. An optional step to make it appear more realistic is to mix in a small amount of black or brown paint to create a slightly darker and richer hue. 3. Test the paint: Before applying the paint to the doll, test it on a small piece of paper or fabric to ensure that you're satisfied with the color and consistency of the paint. The paint should be thick and dark, resembling real blood. If necessary, adjust the mixture accordingly. 4. Prepare the doll: Ensure the doll is clean and free of any dirt or dust. This will help the paint adhere better to the surface. If the doll has any clothing or accessories, it's best to remove them to avoid getting paint on these items. 5. Apply the paint: To create a realistic blood effect, use a paintbrush to apply the mixture to the areas of the doll where you want the blood to appear. Begin by dabbing the paintbrush on the surface to create an irregular, dripping, or splattered effect. Blood is not always evenly distributed, so adding some splatters, smudges, and drips can enhance the overall visual impact. 6. Use varying techniques: To achieve different blood effects, like dried blood, use a slightly darker shade of red, and apply it using a more controlled, dabbing motion. For fresh, wet blood, use a brighter red shade and create generous amounts of paint in select areas. This will give the appearance of freshly spilled blood. 7. Blend the paint: If needed, use water and a clean brush to gently blend the paint on the doll. This will help create softer edges and ensure the paint appears natural on the surface. Be careful not to over-blend, as this may cause the paint to lose its intended effect. 8. Add final touches: Using a small detail brush or a toothpick, you can further enhance the blood effect by carefully drawing thin blood trails or additional splatter patterns. 9. Let the paint dry: Allow the paint to fully dry before touching or moving the doll. Acrylic paint usually takes between 20 to 30 minutes to fully dry, but it might take longer depending on the thickness of the paint layers. 10. Seal the paint: If you want to protect and preserve the paint job, you can finish the process by applying a clear, matte or satin varnish on the painted areas. This will prevent the paint from chipping or rubbing off over time. By using red paint to create a blood-like effect on the doll, you can achieve a striking and realistic appearance that resembles actual blood."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? OPT: 1). yes 2). no","output":"2). no The name of China's oldest stage art is \\"Peking Opera\\" or \\"Beijing Opera\\" (Jīngjù in Chinese). Peking Opera is a performing art form that combines music, vocal performance, mime, dance, and acrobatics. It originated in the late 18th century and became fully developed and recognized by the mid-19th century. This art form is unique because it combines multiple cultural elements, including ancient legends, folktales, and various regional dialects. Peking Opera is characterized by its elaborate makeup, colorful facial patterns, intricate costumes, and distinctive singing style, which differs from the Western operatic tradition. Performers use exaggerated gestures and movements to convey emotions and stories, making it an art form that is both visually and audibly engaging. The development of Peking Opera traces back to the Qing Dynasty, when different opera troupes from Anhui and Hubei provinces came together to perform for Emperor Qianlong's birthday celebration. Over time, they absorbed elements from other forms of Chinese performance arts, such as the Han Opera and Kunqu, eventually evolving into the Peking Opera style known today. Peking Opera is a significant aspect of Chinese culture, as it reflects the country's history, social customs, and artistic values. There are four main types of roles in a Peking Opera performance: Shēng (male roles), Dàn (female roles), Jìng (painted face roles, usually depicting powerful or supernatural characters), and Chǒu (clown or comic roles). Each role type has its own particular performance style, vocal technique, and distinct facial makeup patterns. In modern times, there has been a decline in the popularity of Peking Opera due to the increasing influence of Western culture and entertainment options, such as movies and television shows. However, efforts are being made by the Chinese government and cultural institutions to preserve and promote the art form, ensuring that Peking Opera remains a vital part of China's cultural heritage. For example, the Peking Opera has been included in UNESCO’s Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2010, highlighting its significance not only to China but also to the world's cultural landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Adam wants to show his little brother a trick.  He gets a bucket of water and says to him \\"I bet i can turn this bucket upside down and no water will fall out\\". His brother doesn't believe him of course. So Adam takes the bucket by the handle and quickly starts spinning it in a circle.  Will the centripetal force on the bucket increase or decrease as Adam spins it faster? Answer:","output":"To answer this question, let's go through the concept of centripetal force step by step: 1. When an object moves in a circular path, it experiences a force that's directed towards the center of the circle, called centripetal force. 2. Centripetal force is necessary to keep the object moving in a circle and is given by the equation Fc = mv^2/r, where Fc is centripetal force, m is mass, v is tangential velocity, and r is the radius of the circle. Now, let's apply these concepts to Adam's spinning bucket experiment: 1. As Adam spins the bucket, the water inside it moves in a circular path. The centripetal force Fc acts on the water to maintain its circular motion. 2. When Adam spins the bucket faster, the tangential velocity (v) of the water increases. 3. According to the centripetal force equation, if the mass (m) and radius (r) remain constant, but the tangential velocity (v) increases, then centripetal force (Fc) will increase as well (since Fc ∝ v^2). In conclusion, the centripetal force on the bucket will increase as Adam spins it faster. This increased force helps to keep the water inside the bucket, preventing it from falling out even when the bucket is turned upside down at the top of the circular path."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Liam started reading about apex predators, while Fox read about grazers and large herbivores.  and a hint : An apex predator, also known as an alpha predator or top predator, is a predator at the top of a food chain, with no natural predators.Apex predators are usually defined in terms of trophic dynamics, meaning that they occupy the highest trophic levels. Food chains are often far shorter on land, usually limited to being secondary consumers – for example, wolves prey mostly upon large herbivores (primary consumers), which eat plants (primary producers). The apex predator concept is applied in wildlife management, conservation and ecotourism.  Please answer this question : Which cousin learned more about predators with no natural predators? Answer:","output":"Liam learned more about predators with no natural predators. He focused his research on apex predators, which are animals at the top of the food chain, with no natural predators of their own. These predators occupy the highest trophic levels in their ecosystems and play a significant role in maintaining balance among other populations of species. Apex predators are important subjects of study in the fields of wildlife management, conservation, and ecotourism because of their influence on ecosystem health and dynamics. Fox, on the other hand, concentrated on the study of grazers and large herbivores, which are usually primary consumers in the food chain and prey for the predators, including apex predators. Understanding the relationship between apex predators, such as wolves, and their prey, like large herbivores, allows researchers to better comprehend the interactions between species and their ecosystems. This knowledge helps inform strategies for protecting and preserving natural habitats and promoting biodiversity. In summary, Liam gained more knowledge about predators with no natural predators by studying apex predators, while Fox focused on grazers and large herbivores, which are typically the prey for apex predators and other predatory species within the food chain. Both cousins' investigations contribute to a greater understanding of food chain dynamics and the importance of each species' role in maintaining balance within ecosystems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In office from 1969 to 1973 who was Richard Nixon’s first Vice President????","output":"Richard Nixon's first Vice President during his first term in office from 1969 to 1973 was Spiro T. Agnew, a Republican politician who had served as the Governor of Maryland prior to becoming Vice President. Spiro Theodore Agnew was born on November 9, 1918, in Baltimore, Maryland, to Theodore Spiros Agnew, a Greek immigrant, and Margaret Marian Pollard Agnew, an American-born woman of German and English descent. He graduated from Johns Hopkins University in 1942 with a B.A. in Chemistry and later obtained a law degree from the University of Baltimore School of Law in 1947. Agnew began his political career in 1957 when he was appointed to the Baltimore County Board of Appeals. He then went on to serve as the County Executive of Baltimore County (1962-1966) and was elected as the Governor of Maryland in 1966, serving until 1969. As Governor, Agnew was known for his efforts to reform local government, address social and environmental issues, and combat racial discrimination and civil unrest. Richard Nixon selected Spiro Agnew as his running mate for the 1968 presidential election, primarily due to Agnew's appeal to conservative, working-class voters and the growing \\"silent majority\\" in the United States. The Nixon-Agnew ticket won the 1968 election against the Democratic candidates, Hubert H. Humphrey and Edmund S. Muskie. As Vice President, Agnew developed a reputation for his outspoken and controversial statements, which gained both support and criticism from different ends of the political spectrum. He was an advocate for the Nixon administration's policies, particularly on law and order, and frequently attacked the political opposition and the media in his speeches. However, Agnew's time in office was plagued by legal troubles. In 1973, he was investigated for allegations of extortion, bribery, and income tax evasion during his tenure as Baltimore County Executive and Governor of Maryland, activities that had continued secretly during his vice presidency. Under increasing pressure from both political parties and the public, Agnew negotiated a plea deal and resigned from office on October 10, 1973. Upon Agnew's resignation, he pleaded no contest to a single charge of tax evasion, leaving the vice presidency vacant until Gerald Ford was nominated and confirmed by Congress to fill the position. Agnew's resignation marked the first time in U.S. history that a Vice President left office due to criminal charges and remains a significant event in American political history. After leaving office, Agnew largely retreated from public life, working as an international business consultant and occasionally writing and making public appearances. Spiro T. Agnew passed away on September 17, 1996, at the age of 77."},{"instruction":"Question: James wanted to add space for an extra guest, so he bought a hide bed sofa.

What is the answer for the question: What is it that Frank Culpepper will have none of and, instead, decide to kill the rustlers? from the following article ?  Ben Mockridge is a young man proud of his 4 handgun and enamored of \\"cowboyin'\\". He asks Frank Culpepper if he can join his cattle drive to Fort Lewis, Colorado. Culpepper (a reformed gunslinger) reluctantly agrees and sends Ben to the cook to be his \\"little Mary\\". Ben quickly discovers that the adults have little interest in young'ns, and no interest in \\"showing him the ropes\\". Culpepper nevertheless assigns Ben tasks the greenhorn handles poorly—or simply fails at—repeatedly causing serious trouble. After rustlers stampede the herd, Culpepper tracks them to a box canyon. When the rustlers' leader demands 50 cents a head for having rounded up and taken care of the cattle, Culpepper will have none of it. He and his hands kill the rustlers, not hesitating to gun down disarmed men, or repeatedly shoot anyone still moving. They lose four of their own in the fight. Culpepper directs Ben to a cantina a day's ride off, to find Russ Caldwell. Before he can reach the cantina, Ben is accosted by trappers who take his horse and gun. Once Ben finds Caldwell, he and three of his buddies agree to join the drive. When they cross the trappers' path, there is no parlaying—they immediately kill the trappers and take their possessions. When Ben stands night watch, he's unprepared for a one-eyed man trying to steal the horses. Instead of immediately shooting him, Ben lets the man distract him with his talk, and is overcome by another thief. Culpepper is outraged at Ben's stupidity.

Dr. Amusa seeks a valuable gem in the Brooklyn Museum that is of great significance to his people in his country in Africa, stolen during colonial times and then re-stolen by various African nations. Dortmunder and Kelp are joined by driver Stan Murch and explosives expert Allan Greenberg, concocting an elaborate plan to steal the gem. Although the scheme (and each subsequent one) is carefully planned—and keeps increasing in cost—something always goes awry, and the quartet has to steal the diamond again and again. First off, the diamond is swallowed by Greenberg when he alone gets caught by the museum guards during the initial heist. Dortmunder, Kelp, and Murch, at the urging of Greenberg's rotund father Abe, a lawyer, help Greenberg escape from state prison, but they then find he does not have the diamond. After Greenberg tells his partners he hid the rock in the police station (after bodily evacuating it), the quartet break into the precinct jail by helicopter, but the rock is not where Greenberg hid it. Greenberg discloses that his father Abe was the only other person who knew where it was.

The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles. The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering.  Paragraph: Rob is an environmental scientist. He is looking at two samples of soil, sample A and sample B.

Answer the following question: Process:  - An organism dies - Water seeps into the remains - Minerals dissolved in the water form crystals - Crystalized minerals cause the remains to harden - The minerals form a fossil.  suppose there is a drought happens, how will it affect more water seeps into the remains.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The supposed perturbation in the given scenario can be classified as directly impacting a step of the process. To elaborate further, let's take a closer look at each step of the fossilization process and how a drought would affect it: 1. An organism dies: The drought would not directly impact this step, as it does not have a direct influence on the death of the organism. The organism may die from various reasons, such as predation, disease or old age. 2. Water seeps into the remains: This is the step that would be directly impacted by a drought. Due to the lack of water during a drought, the water seepage into the organism's remains would be significantly reduced. The limited water availability would make it more difficult for the necessary minerals to make their way into the remains, which is an essential part of the fossilization process. Therefore, the drought directly affects this step by reducing the water seepage. 3. Minerals dissolved in the water form crystals: As the water seepage is directly affected by the drought, this step would also be impacted, but in an indirect manner. Since less water seeps into the remains, the chances of minerals dissolving in the water are lower, leading to fewer crystal formations. 4. Crystallized minerals cause the remains to harden: This step is also indirectly affected, as fewer crystals are formed due to the reduced mineral dissolution in the previous step. Consequently, the remains would not fully harden, and the fossilization process would be less successful. 5. The minerals form a fossil: Ultimately, the formation of a fossil would be indirectly impacted, as the previous steps in the process have been negatively affected. The reduced water seepage, along with the limited crystals and hardening of the remains, would hinder the success of a complete fossil. In summary, the drought can be classified as a perturbation that directly impacts the water seepage step of the fossilization process. This direct impact on water seepage subsequently has a cascading effect, indirectly influencing the subsequent steps, ultimately affecting the successful formation of a fossil."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question:   If you were trying to push a box and wanted the one with the most friction which would you push light box or Heavy box?    Paragraph :  Its harder to overcome friction between heavier objects and the floor than it is between lighter objects and the floor. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, if you were trying to push a box and wanted the one with the most friction, you would choose to push the heavy box. The paragraph states that it is harder to overcome friction between heavier objects and the floor than it is between lighter objects and the floor.  Friction is a force that opposes the relative motion or tendency of such motion of two surfaces in contact. It acts as a resisting force that makes it difficult for objects to slide or move against each other. In the case of pushing a box, the frictional force exists between the bottom surface of the box and the floor. The amount of friction between two surfaces is related to the normal force acting on them, which is the force exerted perpendicular to the surfaces in contact. In general, the greater the normal force, the greater the friction between the surfaces. Heavier objects exert a larger normal force on the surfaces they are in contact with, as compared to lighter objects. Thus, when a heavier object is in contact with the floor, it experiences a higher frictional force that opposes its motion as compared to a lighter object in a similar situation. In conclusion, if you want to push a box and experience the most friction, you should select the heavy box, as the frictional force opposing its motion would be greater as compared to a lighter box. This increased friction would make it more difficult for you to push the heavy box, but it would also provide you with a better understanding of the effects of friction on the motion of objects."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Emiliano Zapata Salazar (Spanish pronunciation: [emi'ljano sa'pata]; 8 August 1879 - 10 April 1919) was a leading figure in the Mexican Revolution, the main leader of the peasant revolution in the state of Morelos, and the inspiration of the agrarian movement called Zapatismo. Zapata was born in the rural village of Anenecuilco in Morelos State, where peasant communities were under increasing pressure from the small landowning class who monopolized land and water resources for sugar cane production with the support of dictator Porfirio Diaz. Zapata early on participated in political movements against Diaz and the landowning hacendados, and when the Revolution broke out in 1910 he was positioned as a central leader of the peasant revolt in Morelos. Cooperating with a number of other peasant leaders he formed the Liberation Army of the South of which he soon became the undisputed leader. In mid-March 1919, Gen. Pablo Gonzalez ordered his subordinate Col. Jesus Guajardo to commence operations against the Zapatistas in the mountains around Huautla. But when Gonzalez later discovered Guajardo carousing in a cantina, he had him arrested, and a public scandal ensued. On March 21st, Zapata attempted to smuggle in a note to Guajardo, inviting him to switch sides. The note, however, never reached Guajardo but instead wound up on Gonzalez's desk. Gonzalez devised a plan to use this note to his advantage. He accused Guajardo of not only being a drunk, but of being a traitor. After reducing Guajardo to tears, Gonzalez explained to him that he could recover from this disgrace if he feigned a defection to Zapata. So Guajardo wrote to Zapata telling him that he would bring over his men and supplies if certain guarantees were promised. Zapata answered Guajardo's letter on April 1, 1919, agreeing to all of Guajardo's terms. Zapata suggested a mutiny on April 4. Guajardo replied that his defection should wait until a new shipment of arms and ammunition arrived sometime between the 6th and the 10th. By the 7th, the plans were set: Zapata ordered Guajardo to attack the Federal garrison at Jonacatepec because the garrison included troops who had defected from Zapata. Pablo Gonzalez and Guajardo notified the Jonacatepec garrison ahead of time, and a mock battle was staged on April 9. At the conclusion of the mock battle, the former Zapatistas were arrested and shot. Convinced that Guajardo was sincere, Zapata agreed to a final meeting where Guajardo would defect.  On April 10, 1919, Guajardo invited Zapata to a meeting, intimating that he intended to defect to the revolutionaries. However, when Zapata arrived at the Hacienda de San Juan, in Chinameca, Ayala municipality, Guajardo's men riddled him with bullets.  After he was gunned down, they then took his body to Cuautla to claim the bounty, where they are reputed to have been given only half of what was promised. Zapata's body was photographed, displayed for 24 hours, and then buried in Cuautla. Pablo Gonzalez wanted the body photographed, so that there would be no doubt that Zapata was dead: \\"it was an actual fact that the famous jefe of the southern region had died.\\" Although Mexico City newspapers had called for Zapata's body to be brought to the capital, Carranza did not do so. However, Zapata's clothing was displayed outside a newspaper's office across from the Alameda Park in the capital. Did he try to take over other places?","output":"Yes, Emiliano Zapata did attempt to take over other places during the Mexican Revolution. One example can be found in the article provided: \\"Zapata ordered Guajardo to attack the Federal garrison at Jonacatepec because the garrison included troops who had defected from Zapata.\\" This quote shows that Zapata tried to take control of the Federal garrison at Jonacatepec as part of his revolutionary efforts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"The questions are not the same, but they are related. The first question focuses on overcoming an existing obsession, while the second question concerns the development of obsessions. 1. Best way to stop being obsessed with something: Step 1: Recognize the obsession The first step to overcoming an obsession is to become aware of it. Acknowledge that you are having obsessive thoughts about a particular subject or person. Step 2: Identify the triggers Try to identify what causes the obsession to resurface. Triggers could be environmental, emotional, or related to your daily routine. Recognizing these triggers can help you avoid them or learn to cope with them more effectively. Step 3: Implement healthy coping strategies Develop healthy coping strategies to deal with obsession, such as engaging in mindfulness techniques, deep breathing exercises, and physical activities that can help redirect your focus. Step 4: Replace the obsession with healthier alternatives Find alternative activities, interests, or hobbies that will fill the void left by the obsession. By investing in activities that stimulate the mind or body, you can redirect your thoughts and energy away from the obsession. Step 5: Seek professional help if necessary If the obsession is causing significant distress or interfering with daily life, it might be helpful to consult with a mental health professional. 2. How do obsessions develop: Obsessions can develop due to a combination of biological, psychological, and environmental factors. Some possible causes are: a. Genetics and neurobiology: A predisposition to develop obsessions might be influenced by genetic factors and brain chemistry. b. Personality traits: People with certain personality traits like perfectionism, excessive responsibility, and high levels of anxiety are more prone to develop obsessions. c. Life experiences: Stressful life events, trauma, or significant changes in personal circumstances can trigger the development of obsessions. d. Fear of losing control: Sometimes, people develop obsessions to cope with fears of losing control in certain areas of their lives. e. Coping mechanism: In some cases, obsessions develop as a coping mechanism for dealing with unpleasant emotions or a difficult situation. Overall, the two questions focus on different aspects of obsessions, but understanding both aspects can provide valuable insight into the nature of obsessions and how to overcome them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What Blockbuster Video Can Teach Us About Economics The great Austrian School economist Ludwig Von Mises once wrote that the entrepreneur who fails to use his capital to the \\"best possible satisfaction of consumers\\" is \\"relegated to a place in which his ineptitude no longer hurts people's well-being.\\" Von Mises meant that successful businesses are successful because they fill an unmet need. If they're unsuccessful, it is often because they have failed the consumer. In that case bankruptcy is an economic good for relieving those the market has left for dead of any further capital to destroy. The demise of Blockbuster ( BBI - news - people ) Video offers some lessons about Schumpeterian creative destruction, the necessary role of short-sellers in making markets transparent and the role of capital in rewarding winners and losers. Once a popular growth stock among investors, Blockbuster is now a sick company teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. While it would be foolish to cheer Blockbuster's decline, its descent speaks to the importance of allowing companies no longer fulfilling market needs to go bankrupt. In better days Blockbuster was popular among investors. Its share price reached a modern high of 19 in 1999, and with good reason. Just as Wal-Mart's ( WMT - news - people ) customers benefit from the volume discounts secured by the world's largest retailer, so did Blockbuster's movie-fan customers gain from the lower prices for movie rentals that this volume buyer could command. This was certainly an improvement on the fractured video-store industry of the past, populated by local owners with no pull with the big studios. But as often happens as companies grow, Blockbuster concentrated on perfecting its existing service while beating competitors offering the same instead of looking into ways that outsiders might destroy its business model altogether. Schumpeter long ago noted that entrepreneurs disrupt: For Blockbuster, the \\"disrupter\\" in question was Netflix ( NFLX - news - people ). Indeed, popular as the Blockbuster brand was, getting to the video store in order to take advantage of its services was a hassle for customers--as was returning videos on time to avoid paying late fees. The rise of Netflix from well outside the traditional retail space meant these problems were solved in one fell swoop. Netflix entered the market offering a monthly fee for movies, DVDs by mail and no limits on how long its customers could keep the movies in question. With no retail spaces of its own to drive up costs, Netflix out-innovated a former innovator with a service that licked the late-fee problem and didn't require customers to leave their houses. Blockbuster ultimately copied the Netflix model with a mail-order service with the added benefit of dropping already-watched DVDs at its retail locations, but, as evidenced by the share prices of both companies, its actions were too little, too late. Netflix shares are presently trading in the 70 range vs. Blockbuster's shares that are now 30 cents. As it always does, creative destruction has given customers what they want. And with video-on-demand increasingly prevalent, what's unknown is whether Netflix will be out-innovated on the way to oblivion as the market for movies perhaps shifts again. What was this article about?","output":"This article is about how Blockbuster Video, a once popular and successful business, failed to adapt to changes in the market and is now close to bankruptcy. It talks about how Blockbuster was once able to offer customers a good service due to the lower prices it could command. However, they did not evolve when Netflix introduced a new and more convenient way of renting movies, making Blockbuster's service seem outdated. This shows us the importance of businesses adapting to changes in the market and the effect of creative destruction on companies that do not meet the consumers' needs."},{"instruction":"Process: - A tree produces seeds - The seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, etc - The seeds reach the ground - Grow into new trees - These new trees produce seeds - The process repeats itself over and over -   Question: suppose more boilers are added happens, how will it affect MORE forest formation.

He believes strongly in his mentor and the ways of the church but loses faith when he catches Cumberland strangling a man to death for calling him impotent.

This film contains very strong graphic torture including a woman's tongue being ripped out of her head, nuns being raped, and multitudes of beatings.

One of the essential services that a library offers is providing information to the community, and this includes maintaining a telephone directory for public use.  In a library, a telephone book is accessible to anyone who needs to look up a phone number or address. This makes it an ideal place for a single telephone book that many people can use. Libraries promote easy access to information for all community members, making them the perfect location for a shared resource like a telephone directory. Additionally, librarians are present to help individuals locate the required information or assist with other inquiries. In comparing the other options provided: 1. Desk - A desk is a piece of furniture typically used in an individual workspace, such as an office or home. A telephone book on a desk is not easily accessible to many people since it would be situated in a private area meant for a single person. 2. House - A house is a private residence, and the telephone book would only be readily available to the occupants of the house. This does not allow for widespread use by many people outside the household. 3. At the hotel - A hotel can potentially have some shared resources for guests, such as a telephone book in the lobby or at the front desk. However, as hotels primarily serve the guests staying there, access to a telephone book may be limited to those guests. Public access may not be granted for non-guests, reducing the number of people who can use it. 4. Bedroom - A bedroom is a room within a private residence that serves as a sleeping area. Like a house, a bedroom is not meant for public access, making a telephone book kept in a bedroom unlikely to be available to many people. In conclusion, a library is the most suitable place for a telephone book that many people can use as it is a public institution designed to provide resources and information to the community. Other options have limited access or are intended for private use and are not suitable for a shared resource like a telephone book."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

During this period, the Osiris funerary cult rose to dominate Egyptian popular religion.

The unified kingdom was previously considered to comprise the 11th and 12th Dynasties, but historians now at least partially consider the 13th Dynasty to belong to the Middle Kingdom.

It is best known for the Hyksos, whose reign comprised the 15th and 16th dynasties.

U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki addresses reporters after testifying before a Senate Veterans Affairs Committee hearing on VA health care, on Capitol Hill in Washington May 15, 2014.      WASHINGTON The top health official at the Department of Veterans Affairs resigned on Friday amid a scandal over allegations of deadly healthcare delays, but critics dismissed the gesture as \\"damage control\\" because he planned to retire this year anyway.      VA Secretary Eric Shinseki said in a statement he accepted the resignation of Dr. Robert Petzel, VA undersecretary for health, and acknowledged the need to ensure more timely treatment of America's military veterans. The White House said President Barack Obama supported Shinseki's decision.      Petzel's resignation, which came a day after he and Shinseki testified before Congress, appeared unlikely to calm the anger over the scandal, with one critic rejecting the move as \\"damage control\\" and the American Legion renewing its call for Shinseki himself to step down.      \\"Characterizing this as a 'resignation' just doesn't pass the smell test,\\" said Republican Congressman Jeff Miller, the chairman of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs.      Tom Tarantino, the policy chief for Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said: \\"We don't need the VA to find a scapegoat. We need an actual plan to restore a culture of accountability throughout the VA.\\"      American Legion National Commander Daniel Dellinger said the resignation \\"is not a corrective action but a continuation of business as usual,\\" adding the organization wanted Shinseki and Allison Hickey, the undersecretary for benefits, to resign.      \\"Dr. Petzel was already scheduled to retire this year so his resignation now won't really make that much of a difference,\\" Dellinger added. \\"VA needs a fundamental shift in leadership if it is to defeat its systemic lack of accountability.\\"      Republican Senator Jerry Moran of Kansas described Petzel's resignation as \\"damage control\\" and said the Veterans Health Administration chief \\"should not shoulder the blame for VA's failure.\\"      Petzel's resignation came a day after he appeared alongside Shinseki at a hearing about accusations that VA medical facilities in Phoenix covered up long wait times for patients, including 40 who died while awaiting care.      In announcing the decision, Shinseki stopped short of blaming Petzel for delays and did not explicitly say why he resigned. In a statement last September, the VA said Petzel planned to retire in 2014 and the department was taking steps to find candidates to replace him.      Two VA officials declined to elaborate on the reason for Petzel's resignation.      The VA has put three senior officials in Phoenix on administrative leave after doctors there said they were ordered to hold veterans' names for months on a secret waiting list until a spot opened up on an official list that met the agency's two-week waiting time goals.      Allegations have been reported about similar cover-up schemes at VA medical facilities in at least seven other cities. The agency runs the largest U.S. healthcare group, overseeing some 1,700 hospitals, clinics, nursing homes and other facilities.      Shinseki has ordered a nationwide audit of appointment and scheduling practices at all VA hospitals and clinics.      (Additional reporting by David Lawder and Thomas Ferraro; editing by Bill Trott and Diane Craft) ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) — The top official for veterans' health care resigned Friday amid a firestorm over delays in care and falsified records at veteran hospitals.      Veterans Secretary Eric Shinseki says he has accepted the resignation of Robert Petzel, the department's undersecretary for health care. Shinseki had asked for the resignation, a department official later said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak for attribution.      The announcement came a day after both men were grilled at a four-hour hearing of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, where lawmakers and veteran groups expressed exasperation of long-standing problems at the department.      Meanwhile, House Republicans scheduled a vote for Wednesday on legislation that would give Shinseki more authority to fire or demote senior executives and administrators at the agency and its 152 medical centers.      When senior leaders in the VA \\"fail the men and women who have put their lives on the line for our country, they deserve a pink slip - not a bonus,\\" House Speaker John Boehner said Friday. While some Republicans in Congress have called for Shinseki to resign, Boehner is not among them.      Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, wrote the bill before a former VA clinic director told his committee last month that up to 40 veterans may have died while awaiting treatment at the Phoenix VA center. The whistleblower also said the hospital kept a secret list of patients waiting for appointments to hide delays in care.      \\"VA's widespread and systemic lack of accountability is exacerbating all of its most pressing problems, including the department's stubborn disability benefits backlog and a mounting toll of at least 31 recent preventable veteran deaths at VA medical centers across the country,\\" Miller said.      Reports of long waits for appointments and processing benefit applications have plagued VA for years. The agency has shortened backlogs but the Phoenix problems have triggered an election-year firestorm. President Barack Obama on Wednesday tasked his deputy White House chief of staff, Rob Nabors, to review VA health care policies and procedures in light of new reports about Phoenix and other VA facilities.      \\"As we know from the veteran community, most veterans are satisfied with the quality of their VA health care, but we must do more to improve timely access to that care,\\" Shinseski said in a statement Friday. He thanked Petzel for four decades of service to veterans.      Petzel was scheduled to retire this year, and Shinseki last fall had convened a commission to recommend candidates for presidential appointment to be the new undersecretary. VA is required by law to convene a commission to seek and review candidates for the position. It was unclear what Petzel's exact retirement date was to be.      In his position, Petzel oversaw what officials say is the largest health care delivery system in the U.S. The VA operates 1700 hospitals, clinics and other facilities around the country. They employ about 300,000 people and serve about 6.5 million veterans and other beneficiaries each year.      Shinseki on Thursday told senators he was \\"mad as hell\\" about allegations of severe problems and said he was looking for quick results from a nationwide audit. He has rejected calls for him to resign. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"The top health official at the Department of Veterans Affairs, Dr. Robert Petzel, resigned in 2014 amid a scandal over allegations of deadly healthcare delays.

The Browns tied it up when Zane Gonzalez kicked a 31-yard field goal to make it 3-3.  The Titans retook the lead with Succop's 23-yard field goal to make it 6-3 at halftime.  The Browns then tied it up when Zane Gonzalez nailed 47-yard field goal to make it 6-6 for the only points in the third quarter.  The Titans then moved ahead in the fourth quarter after Succop kicked another field goal from 46 yards out to make it 9-6.  The Browns forced overtime when Gonzalez nailed a 54-yard field goal to make it 9-9.  In overtime, the Titans scored the eventual game-winning field goal when Succop nailed it from 47 yards out to make the final score 12-9. With the overtime loss, the Browns fell to 0-7.  The loss led to Browns starting 0-7 for only the 4th time in franchise history (1975, 1999, and 2016).  It was the first time in 23 games under Hue Jackson that the Browns failed to score a touchdown.  This game was the first such occurrence since Week 17 of the 2015 season.  During the third quarter, star left tackle Joe Thomas suffered an injury to his arm and was knocked out of the rest of the game, making this the first time since joining the Browns in 2007 that he had missed an offensive play.  The day after the game, it was announced that Thomas had torn his triceps and would likely miss the rest of the season.

Sentence: \\"Mary loves him.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?","output":"A linguist would likely rate the sentence \\"Mary loves him\\" as acceptable linguistically, based on several linguistic principles and components. To provide a detailed explanation, let's breakdown the key linguistic aspects that contribute to the acceptability of this sentence. 1. Syntax: Syntax refers to the rules that govern the structure of sentences in a language. In English, the typical word order follows a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) pattern. In the sentence \\"Mary loves him,\\" the subject (Mary) is followed by the verb (loves) and the object (him). This structure adheres to the SVO pattern, making the sentence syntactically acceptable. 2. Grammar: Grammar encompasses the rules governing the construction of phrases, clauses, and sentences in a language. When examining the grammar of this sentence, we observe that the verb \\"loves\\" agrees with the subject \\"Mary\\" in both number (singular) and person (third person). The verb is also in the present tense, which is appropriate for describing an ongoing action or state. The pronoun \\"him\\" serves as the direct object, and it is used correctly to refer to a male person. Thus, the sentence is grammatically acceptable. 3. Semantics: Semantics deals with the meanings of words, phrases, and sentences in a language. In this sentence, \\"Mary\\" is a proper noun and denotes a particular person. The verb \\"loves\\" carries a clear meaning, expressing a strong affection or emotional bond between the subject and object. The pronoun \\"him\\" is used to refer to a male person, and its meaning is context-dependent; it relies on the presence of an antecedent, which is not provided in this sentence. However, this is common in standalone sentences and does not make it unacceptable linguistically. The semantics of the sentence are therefore understandable and convey a clear message. 4. Morphology: Morphology pertains to the study of the internal structure of words and how they are formed in a language. In this sentence, all the words are well-formed and appropriate for their respective roles. \\"Mary\\" is a proper noun, \\"loves\\" is formed by attaching the regular third-person singular suffix \\"-s\\" to the base form of the verb \\"love,\\" and \\"him\\" is the correct form of the masculine pronoun used in the object position. Consequently, the sentence is morphologically acceptable. 5. Pragmatics: Pragmatics is concerned with the ways in which context influences the interpretation of meaning in a language. Although the sentence \\"Mary loves him\\" does not provide the broader context, such as whom \\"him\\" refers to or why Mary loves him, the sentence remains functionally communicative. Pragmatically, it allows the interlocutor to infer some specific information (Mary's feelings) and introduce further questions or conversation points to seek clarification of the missing context. Taking into account these linguistic aspects, a linguist would generally rate the sentence \\"Mary loves him\\" as acceptable linguistically, as it adheres to the key principles of syntax, grammar, semantics, morphology, and basic pragmatic understanding."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Emily Nagoski is a badass Ph.D. who teaches human sexuality. She wrote a book – Come As You Are. Here’s a secret: the entire sexology community was eager to get their mitts on her book, it was very exciting. I can’t recall the last time there was that much hullabaloo about one book. In this important book, Dr Nagoski explains the interplay between sexual desire and stress — a concept that gives us a unique insight into what is going on in women’s sex lives. THE ACCELERATOR AND THE BRAKES This concept is a big deal. Think of the accelerator and the brake of a car. Each pedal acts independently from one another; you can press on the accelerator and you can stomp on the brakes. You can even press both at the same time. We don’t often press them at the same time – in fact, I was specifically told NOT to do that in driver’s ed – but anyhow, pretend you do. If you press both pedals all the way to the floor of the car, do you stop or go? That’s right, you STOP! Ok, now get this, your brake pedal is all the stress you have and your accelerator is your sexual desire. In the same way that the brake and accelerator of a car are two separate pedals yet also inextricably linked, so are your stress and your arousal. They are not the same things, yet have everything to do with one another. If your stress level is high, the majority of women have brakes that turn on, meaning, no matter how much sexy stuff is going on around her, she does not want sex at all. It is like she is pressing down the brakes and the accelerator at the same time. This isn’t the case for all women; some women have extremely sensitive brakes or extremely sensitive accelerators. And as Nagoski has found, while this correlation between stress and sexual desire is more common for women, men experience it too (just not quite as often).

Here are possible answers to this question: - sing songs - lay eggs - falling down - reproduce - spread wings  I believe the correct choice is \\"spread wings\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"Indeed, the correct choice is \\"spread wings,\\" as it best describes the process of how birds leave the nest for the first time. Bird nests serve as a shelter for the eggs and a safe space for the baby birds, also known as fledglings, to grow and develop. As fledglings mature, they eventually become capable of leaving the nest and living independently. This event is called fledging. Their journey out of the nest involves several stages, some of which include learning and practicing essential skills for survival. Here is a more detailed explanation of the process: 1. Nestling stage: After hatching, baby birds are referred to as nestlings. During this stage, they are usually blind, featherless, and rely entirely on their parents for food, warmth, and protection. They stay within the confines of the nest as they develop their muscles and grow feathers. 2. Growing feathers: Over time, nestlings develop feathers, first as downy fluff and eventually as proper contour and flight feathers. Feathers are essential for insulation, protection, camouflage, and, most importantly, flight. 3. Developing muscles: While still in the nest, nestlings start to exercise their muscles by stretching and flapping their wings. This helps them build the strength necessary for flight. 4. Perching and hopping: As their muscles and feathers develop, fledglings start practicing perching on the edge of the nest or tree branches. They might also attempt short hops between close branches or within the nest to further improve their balance and coordination. 5. Food begging and exploration: During this stage, fledglings begin to associate their parents' arrival with food. They may venture out of the nest to be closer to the parents and beg for food more effectively. This behavior also encourages them to become more confident in leaving the nest. 6. Taking flight: Finally, after all the preparation and practice, a fledgling will spread its wings and take its first flight. The initial flights are often shaky and may involve a lot of falling or gliding, but fledglings gradually gain confidence and improve their flying capabilities. Parents continue to feed and supervise their young ones for a few days or weeks after they fledge, ensuring they learn essential skills such as finding food and avoiding predators. In summary, leaving the nest is more than just a simple act of spreading wings. It is a complex and gradual process involving the development of feathers and muscles, practicing essential skills, gaining confidence, and the fledgling's first attempts at flight. Spreading wings is perhaps the most critical aspect of this process, as it ultimately allows fledglings to become independent, self-sufficient birds."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

England physio Gary Lewin was carried off on a stretcher with a dislocated ankle in bizarre circumstances after Daniel Sturridge's equaliser. Lewin, a former member of Arsenal's physio staff, picked up the injury after standing on a water bottle while celebrating England's 37th-minute leveller - and was even carried off on the stretcher usually reserved for his players and will fly back to England. Roy Hodgson's staff jumped off the bench in celebration but Lewin, who will be replaced by Steve Kemp for the remainder of the tournament, immediately fell to the floor and repeatedly banged the ground with his fist. Sore one: Gary Lewin was taken off in the fist half after hurting his ankle in the dugout. Lewin was left in pain after standing on the water bottle in Manaus and needed urgent medical treatment. England manager Roy Hodgson and Italy coach Cesare Prandelli talk while Lewin is treated. The physio was said to be 'gutted' after being stretchered off from the side of the pitch in Manaus on Saturday night. Attention: Lewin injured himself while celebrating Sturridge's equalising goal against Italy. Concern: It was a mystery initially who had gone down after Sturridge's goal in the 2-1 loss to Italy. The 37th minute incident saw Lewin receiving medical treatment from both FIFA officials and players before he was ushered down the tunnel. Lad-up: The physio left the playing area on a stretcher after slipping while celebrating Daniel Sturridge's goal. Lewin was stretchered off after he dislocated his ankle by standing on a water bottle while celebrating. 'That was a very sad moment for us,' England boss Roy Hodgson said. 'In celebrating the goal he jumped up, landed on a water bottle and dislocated his ankle. 'It was very painful. He was taken to hospital. The doctor set it, put it back in at the side of the field, but it's the end of the World Cup for Gary.' Lewin left the field on a stretcher after a short break in play, with the team's Twitter official feed, @england, swiftly confirming the severity of the injury. 'England physio Gary Lewin was injured during celebrations for @england's goal,' the post said. 'He has dislocated his ankle. Get well soon Gary #3Lions' The Football Association later said the 50-year-old Londoner had suffered a fracture and dislocation. An FA spokesperson added: 'We do have another physio with us - Steve Kemp.' With little known about the protocol for injured medical staff, given the rarity of the situation, Lewin was quickly surrounded by a crowd of around a dozen staff from both sides and FIFA. Lewin was first team physio at Arsenal for 22 years and became an England physio in 1996 alongside his job at the North London club. But in 2008 he quit the Gunners to become Head of Physiotherapy for the national side. In 2007, Lewin was credited with possibly saving John Terry's life in the League Cup Final after the Chelsea captain swallowed his tounge and Lewin, then Arsenal physio, was first off the bench to assist him. During his time at Arsenal he was also credited with saving striker Eduardo's career after he suffered a horror leg break. Hodgson’s staff haven’t had much luck with injuries recently – assistant manager Ray Lewington is on crutches after emergency knee surgery 24 hours before the team’s final friendly against Honduras. England manager Roy Hodgson confirmed Lewin (pictured at the airport ready to fly home) had suffered a fractured and dislocated ankle. He said: 'It is the end of the World Cup for him I'm afraid' On the mend: Lewin was put in a wheelchair after having his ankle tended to.

While Ender's Game touched on the mindset of alien creatures, and focused mostly on human beings, Speaker for the Dead digs deep into both. Ender is much older in the story, and has a very different standing with society. His siblings play an interesting part that is also very different from Ender's Game. The thing that will stick with you about any Ender story though isn't the action or the strange aliens: its the reality of human behavior, and the incredible \\"what if\\"s presented throughout each story.

Movie plot title: Alien Abduction: Incident in Lake County Movie plot: The footage, interspersed with \\"expert\\" interviews, begins with the McPherson family gathered for Thanksgiving dinner. The power goes out, so Kurt and Brian go outside to check the fuses; Tommy follows with his camera. After finding the fuses charred and partially melted, they head into the woods to investigate a transformer which is throwing sparks. They find a UFO in a nearby field. As they watch from the treeline, two aliens exit the ship and use a ray-gun on a cow. Despite their attempt to remain hidden, the three men are spotted. One of the aliens raises its weapon and burns Brian's hand. They rush back to the house and try to convince their incredulous family to flee while there is still time. They see lights in the sky and a furtive figure outside a window, but the family refuses to believe the brothers' story until Tommy plays them the tape. Suddenly, a high-frequency screech incapacitates everyone but five-year-old Rose. When it stops, Kurt straps a flashlight to his shotgun and decides to get everyone in his truck and leave. The truck will not start. The battery has melted so they return to the house. As they take stock of the situation they hear scrabbling sounds from the roof and discover that an alien has made its way in through an open window. Kurt leads the way up the stairs and begins to search. Tommy takes the opportunity to go into his bedroom and change his soiled pants when he is ambushed by an alienâit (apparently) puts him in a trance, investigates his camera, and slips away, leaving Tommy with no memory of the encounter. Tommy is awakened by the shouts of Kurt, who has trapped an alien in an adjacent room. They are greeted by a laser shot and Kurt responds with his shotgun. Everyone retreats downstairs. A ball of light floats into the house and puts Renee into a coma. Kurt and Brian go outside to try to swap out the truck battery in a final attempt to get the family to safety and take Renee to a hospital.

We have this equation: 1034 = 82*x - 38*x - 138*x Now, let's look at the x parts: 82*x, -38*x, and -138*x. All the x's are friends that we can add or subtract together. Let's do that! 82*x - 38*x - 138*x = (82 - 38 - 138) * x Now, we'll do the math inside the parentheses: 44 - 138 = -94 So now the equation looks like this: 1034 = -94*x Now we need to find out what x is. We do this by dividing 1034 by -94. Imagine we have 1034 candies, and we need to divide them into equal groups of -94 (even though we can't have negative candies, but it's just to understand the idea). 1034 ÷ -94 = -11 So, x is equal to -11!

I've been playing a lot lately, and two of the most immersive games that come to mind are Resident Evil 7 and Battlefield 5. Both of these games would look amazing on your new setup, and they're a blast to play. Aliana: Resident Evil 7... hmm, isn't that a survival-horror game? I've never really tried any horror games before. What's it like? Damari: It is a survival horror game, but I think you'd love it. The gameplay is intense, and the atmosphere they've built around the game is incredibly immersive. There's a lot of exploration, puzzle-solving to find your way through the game, and, of course, some creepy monsters to deal with. It's a part of the famous Resident Evil series, so if you're willing to dive into something new, I strongly recommend giving it a go. Aliana: Sounds interesting! I'm a little scared, but at the same time, I'm intrigued. So, what about Battlefield 5? I've heard that series is well-known for its intense action and amazing graphics. Damari: Oh, absolutely. Battlefield 5 is a first-person shooter set during World War II, and it's visually stunning. The game offers a gripping single-player campaign as well as epic multiplayer battles. You'll engage in intense firefights, use a variety of historically accurate weapons, and pilot various types of vehicles. The game's massive, detailed maps and destructible environments make for an unforgettable gaming experience. Aliana: Sounds epic! I've played other first-person shooters before, so this might be right up my alley. And trying out a horror game could be a fun new challenge. Thanks for the suggestions, Damari! Damari: No problem, Aliana! I'm sure you'll love both of those games. Just let me know if you need any tips or whatever. And if you want to team up in Battlefield 5, I'm just a message away. Aliana: That's awesome! I'll be sure to take you up on that once I get more comfortable with the controls. And if Resident Evil 7 ends up terrifying me too much, I'll know who to blame! *laughs* Damari: Haha, I'll gladly take the blame for that!

Solve this problem.","output":"To solve the equation 40*r - 26629 + 93527 = -766*r for r, we will follow these steps: 1. Combine like terms on both sides of the equation 2. Add or subtract terms to isolate the variable (r) 3. Divide both sides by the coefficient of the variable to solve for the variable Here is the step-by-step solution: 1. Combine like terms:    The given equation is: 40*r - 26629 + 93527 = -766*r    There are no like terms on the left side of the equation but we can combine the constants:    40*r + 66898 = -766*r 2. Add or subtract terms to isolate the variable (r):    In order to isolate r, we need to get rid of the r values on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 766*r to both sides of the equation:    40*r + 66898 + 766*r = -766*r + 766*r    This simplifies to:    806*r + 66898 = 0 3. Subtract the constant term from both sides of the equation:    806*r = -66898 4. Divide both sides by the coefficient of the variable to solve for the variable:    To solve for r, we need to isolate it by dividing both sides of the equation by 806:    r = -66898 / 806 5.

Test your internet connection.\\" Article:","output":"Title: A Step-by-Step Guide to Set Up and Optimize Your DSL Modem Introduction Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) technology provides broadband internet services through existing phone lines, making it a popular and cost-effective option for many homes and businesses. By using a DSL modem, you can access the internet through your phone line without interrupting your landline connection. In this article, we will walk you through the process of setting up and optimizing your DSL modem, ensuring a smooth and efficient internet experience with minimal downtime. 1. Choose the right DSL modem Before you can set up your DSL modem, make sure you have the appropriate hardware for your network. You can either purchase a standalone modem or a modem-router combo, depending on your needs and preferences. A modem-router combo unit provides the functionality of both a modem and a router in one device, simplifying the setup process and reducing clutter. 2. Plug the DSL modem into your computer Once you have your DSL modem, it's time to connect it to your computer. Locate the Ethernet port at the back of your modem and connect an Ethernet cable to it. Plug the other end of the cable into the Ethernet port on your computer. This will establish a direct line of communication between your modem and computer, allowing you to configure the modem settings and access the internet through the device. 3. Plug the DSL modem into the wall cable socket Next, locate the telephone jack in your wall and connect the DSL modem to it using a DSL cable or a phone cord provided with your modem. Make sure that the cable you use is compatible with DSL service, as a regular telephone cable may not work. This connection will enable the transmission of DSL signals from your telecommunication provider to your modem. 4. Plug in the DSL modem's power cord Connect the power adapter provided with your modem to the power port on the device. Plug the other end into an electrical outlet. Turn the modem on by pressing the power button, if applicable. Wait for the modem to initialize and establish a connection with your DSL provider. This process may take a few minutes, and you should see various indicator lights on the modem light up as the connection is established. 5. Log in to the modem's administrative screen Once your modem is connected and powered on, you need to access its administrative interface to configure the settings. Open a web browser on your computer and enter the modem's default IP address in the address bar. Common IP addresses for modems include 192.168.1.1, 192.168.0.1, and 10.0.0.1. You can find your specific modem's IP address in the user manual or on a label attached to the device. 6. Enter your DSL account username and password After navigating to the modem's IP address, you will be prompted to enter a username and password. By default, most modems are configured with \\"admin\\" as the username and \\"password\\" as the password. If these credentials don't work, consult your modem's manual or contact your ISP for assistance. Once logged in, locate the internet or WAN settings page. Enter the DSL account username and password provided by your internet service provider (ISP). This information is crucial for establishing a connection to the internet, so make sure you enter the details correctly. If you are unsure about your DSL account credentials, contact your ISP for assistance. 7. Save your settings After entering your DSL account information, review your modem settings, and apply any necessary changes. Save the updated settings and your modem will apply the new configuration. You may need to restart the modem for the changes to take effect. 8. Test your internet connection Once your modem settings have been updated and the device has restarted, check your internet connection by opening a web browser and visiting a website. If you can access the site without any issues, your DSL modem setup is complete. 9. Optimize your modem settings (optional) To improve the performance of your DSL connection, you may want to optimize your modem settings. Consult your modem's user manual for recommended settings to ensure the best possible internet experience. Conclusion Setting up a DSL modem is relatively simple, even for those without technical expertise. By carefully following these steps and consulting your modem's user manual, you can enjoy a stable and fast internet connection with minimal downtime. Additionally, optimizing your modem settings can help maximize your internet performance and provide a hassle-free online experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Trump administration's decision to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census divided Capitol Hill on Tuesday, with Democrats saying the addition could skew the results and alter millions in government funding, while some Republicans praised it as a \\"commonsense\\" move. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced late Monday the next effort to count every resident in the country will include a question about citizenship status. The U.S. Census Bureau conducts the survey every 10 years, with the next set for 2020. The deadline for finalizing the questions is Saturday. In a memo late Monday, Ross said he chose to include the query at the urging of the Department of Justice, which said it needed the citizenship data to better enforce a law protecting minority voting rights. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders defended the addition of the question, rejecting the notion that it might result in less federal aid to immigrant communities in the U.S. if immigrants are undercounted. Republicans on Capitol Hill welcomed the decision, which revives a practice that was abandoned in 1950, after being in place for more than 100 years, according to the Commerce Department. \\"It is imperative that the data gathered in the census is reliable, given the wide-ranging impacts it will have on U.S. policy. A question on citizenship is a reasonable, commonsense addition to the census,\\" Senator Ted Cruz said in a statement Tuesday. But Democrats said the question would have the opposite effect — discouraging undocumented immigrants and citizen family members from responding to the census, undermining the accuracy of the results. \\"We cannot accept an incomplete or unfair count in 2020 — too much is at stake,\\" Rep. Carolyn Maloney, co-chair of the Congressional Census Caucus, told VOA. \\"The census mandated by the [U.S.] Constitution affects the way that Federal and state funds are distributed and how district lines are drawn for both the city, state and Federal level.\\" After the end of this story, Maloney is probably  A. not enough information  B. chairing another committee  C. still co-chair of the committee  D. not chairing any committee A:","output":"C. still co-chair of the committee"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The conversation begins with Alan asking Joan when she will be home. Joan responds by saying she has plans to study with her friend, Laura, after classes. At this point, Alan inquires if she'll be home by 7 pm, possibly because he wants to spend some quality time with her or ensure that she's there for dinner. He mentions that he is making his famous chicken wings, which could be an attempt to entice her to come home early or to simply let her know that there is something special for dinner. Joan then brings up the importance of her grades and subtly hints that she might prioritize her studies over being home by 7 pm. She might be questioning whether her father values her studies or subtly seeking his approval and understanding. Alan, in a light-hearted manner, responds by seemingly expressing mock disappointment that his chicken wings are not as important as Joan's grades. He then clarifies that he is only joking and fully supports her decision to prioritize her studies. His playful, supportive response demonstrates an understanding of Joan's concerns and reassures her that her education is indeed essential. Overall, this conversation reflects the loving relationship between a parent and a child, as they balance family time, academic priorities, and a shared sense of humor. Alan is both a caring and understanding father who wants to ensure his daughter's well-being and academic success while also retaining a fun, lighthearted dynamic."},{"instruction":"Q: Jordan eventually asked everyone at the party to leave his house.

In India, the two main philosophical schools of the Mahayana were the Madhyamaka and the later Yogacara.

There were no great Indian teachers associated with tathagatagarbha thought. A:","output":"The one school of thought that is different from the others in an educational sense is Tathagatagarbha. This is because, unlike Madhyamaka and Yogacara which were the two main philosophical schools of Mahayana Buddhism in India and had a great deal in common, Tathagatagarbha did not have any great Indian teachers associated with it.

The American Civil War boosted the local economy with wartime purchases of industrial goods, including that of the New Haven Arms Company, which would later become the Winchester Repeating Arms Company. (Winchester would continue to produce arms in New Haven until 2006, and many of the buildings that were a part of the Winchester plant are now a part of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company Historic District.) After the war, population grew and doubled by the start of the 20th century, most notably due to the influx of immigrants from southern Europe, particularly Italy. Today, roughly half the populations of East Haven, West Haven, and North Haven are Italian-American. Jewish immigration to New Haven has left an enduring mark on the city.

One of them was glace fruit. He showed the class how to prepare glace fruit and kept some of the glace fruits on bowl A. To compare glace fruits with non glace fruits he kept some non glace fruits on bowl B.  Which fruits had most probably gone through heated sugar syrup, bowl A or bowl B?  Hint: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2]  The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] Answer:","output":"The fruits that had most probably gone through heated sugar syrup are in bowl A, as these are the glace fruits prepared by the instructor."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Personal money-management website Mint.com suggests recently that responsible parents should give their kids credit cards--possibly starting as young as middle school. The website says a credit card will help children master responsible spending habits and give parents the chance to teach them some valuable lessons. It's absolutely true that kids should learn about how a credit card works and how to use it responsibly. But the idea that they need a card of their own to practise this is questionable. Yes, credit cards are a teaching tool, but it's the time you spend educating them about money management that does the teaching, not the piece of plastic. Sit down with your child--here we are referring to teens and walk them through your credit card statements. Point out important things like the due date, late fee warning, and APR  . If you have good credit, adding a child as an authorized user onto one of your credit cards also provides teachable moments. Allow kids to use the card to make specific purchases and require their participation in payment. Since the card is still in your name, you can take them off it at any point and cut off their access if they're not able to handle the responsibility. Another option is to set them up with an account at a local bank that offers free use of a debit card  . Unlike credit card, the debit card has no overdraft   function. Children can only use the card to pay for things and the money is taken directly from their bank account. If the account is empty, the worst that will happen is the card being declined at a cash register. Question: What is the purpose of adding kids as credit card authorized users?

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\".  Question: What is Lewis' first name in the future? Movie plot title: Meet the Robinsons Movie plot: Lewis is an aspiring 12-year-old inventor at an orphanage whose inventions have been scaring off potential parents. He decides that his mother, who abandoned him at the orphanage as an infant, is the only one who ever truly loved him and works on a machine to scan his memory to locate her. Taking his memory scanner to his school's science fair, Lewis meets 13-year-old Wilbur Robinson, a mysterious boy claiming to be a time cop from the future. Wilbur needs to recover a time machine that a man wearing a bowler hat has stolen. Lewis tries to demonstrate the scanner, but it falls apart, throwing the science fair into chaos. Upset, Lewis leaves while the Bowler Hat Guy, with the help of a robotic bowler hat named Doris, repairs and steals the scanner. Wilbur meets Lewis at the orphanage and asks him to repair the scanner. Lewis agrees to do so only if Wilbur can prove he is telling the truth, which Wilbur does by taking them to the year 2037 in a second time machine. When they arrive, however, Lewis says he can use the time machine instead of the scanner, and he and Wilbur get into an argument and crash. Wilbur then asks Lewis to fix the time machine, but Lewis has another condition: Wilbur has to take him to visit his mother afterwards. Reluctantly, Wilbur agrees and hides Lewis in the garage. Lewis doesn't stay there for long, however, and ends up meeting the rest of the Robinsons except for Cornelius, Wilbur's father, who is away on a business trip. Following Lewis, the Bowler Hat Guy and Doris unsuccessfully try to kidnap him. Meanwhile, the Robinsons offer to adopt Lewis, but change their mind when they learn that he's from the past. Wilbur admits to lying to Lewis about taking him back to see his mom, causing Lewis to run off in disgust. Lewis then discovers that Cornelius Robinson is, in fact, a future version of himself, and Wilbur is his future son. Lewis also finds out that the Bowler Hat Guy is a grown-up version of Lewis' roommate, Michael \\"Goob\\" Yagoobian. Because he was always kept awake by Lewis...

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer is:","output":"directly impacting a step of the process To explain further, if we suppose that better materials are discovered or produced that can help the liver function more efficiently, this would directly impact one or more steps in the liver's process of detoxification and metabolism. These better materials could come in the form of enhanced enzymes, improved cellular structures, or advanced chemical compounds that could aid the liver in performing its functions. When better materials are found that can affect the liver's functions, it can lead to the liver working \\"softer,\\" as it would require less effort to perform the same tasks. Some potential outcomes of this improvement could include: 1. Enhanced detoxification: The liver's ability to remove toxins from the blood might be improved, allowing the liver to work more efficiently and potentially reducing the risk of liver-related health issues. 2. Improved metabolic processing: The liver's ability to process vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients, as well as storing carbohydrates as glycogen, could be optimized. This may lead to better overall body functions, as nutrients would be more readily available throughout the body. 3. Efficient bile production: If the better materials impact bile production or the constituents of bile itself, it may result in more efficient digestion and absorption of fats. This could lead to better utilization of nutrients and reduced strain on the liver. 4. Reduced workload: When the liver functions more efficiently, it could lead to a reduced workload on the organ, potentially reducing the risk of liver damage or disease. It is important to note that while the introduction of better materials can have a direct impact on one or more steps of the liver's process, these changes could simultaneously have indirect impacts on other aspects of liver function or overall health.

Upon correcting the spacing, we get the following: \\"Specifying the size of the reservoir, the weight load on the coastal zone, and picked up materials for the registration of the coast (sand, pebbles, boulders), we come to the choice of the construction of the reservoir.\\" It seems that the sentence is related to the construction of a reservoir along a coastal area, taking into consideration various factors. In order to better understand each aspect, let's break down the sentence and discuss each element: 1. Specifying the size of the reservoir: Before constructing the reservoir, it is essential to determine its size, capacity, and physical dimensions (length, width, and depth). This information will help the engineers and experts to design a reservoir capable of meeting the water management, storage, or distribution needs of the intended region. 2. The weight load on the coastal zone: Understanding the weight load supported by the coastal zone is important, as it directly affects how the reservoir will be constructed. This weight load includes the reservoir's mass, the water it holds, and any added structures like gates and spillways. Engineers need to account for the coastal zones' existing sediments and geology to ensure that the reservoir's weight can be adequately distributed or managed without causing erosion or other stability issues. 3. Picked up materials for the registration of the coast (sand, pebbles, boulders): Gathering information about the materials found along the coast, such as sand, pebbles, and boulders, will help in the planning and execution of the reservoir construction. These materials can not only impact the stability and structural integrity of the reservoir but might also be utilized as resources during the construction process. Furthermore, the presence of these materials affects the wave action and coastal erosion, which could impact the overall success and longevity of the reservoir.  4. The choice of the construction of the reservoir: After considering all of the above factors – the size of the reservoir, the weight load on the coastal zone, and the materials found along the coast – the engineers, contractors, and decision-makers involved in the project can make informed choices about the design, construction materials, methods, and overall feasibility of the reservoir construction. This process is crucial for ensuring that the reservoir effectively serves its intended purpose while minimizing any negative impacts on the surrounding environment and coastal region. In conclusion, when constructing a coastal reservoir, it is vital to consider various factors such as the reservoir's size, the weight load on the coastal zone, and the materials found along the coast to make informed decisions about the design and construction process. These factors ultimately contribute to the success and longevity of the reservoir, as well as its ability to support the intended water management goals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person in whose place Hugh Robertson was appointed complex manager at Rockefeller Center?  The management of Rockefeller Center shifted around this time. In November 1936, John Todd was featured in two New Yorker articles that emphasized his role in the complex's construction. At the same time, Nelson was gaining clout within Rockefeller Center Inc., and he disagreed with nearly all of Todd's suggestions. Nelson's father, John, was relinquishing his responsibilities, since the Rockefeller family's youngest son David had moved out of the family home at 10 West 54th Street, and John was now focusing on his own personal life. By April 1937, Todd regretted his decision to be featured in The New Yorker. In March 1938, Nelson became the president of Rockefeller Center Inc. He then fired Todd as the complex's manager and appointed Hugh Robertson in his place. Nelson and Robertson wanted to avoid workers' strikes, which would delay the completion of construction. Nelson, Robertson, and the workers' unions agreed to a contract in which the unions would not strike, Robertson would not lock out union workers, and both would agree to arbitration if a labor dispute arose. Rockefeller Center was one of Nelson's primary business ventures until 1958, when he was elected Governor of New York.Public relations officials were hired to advertise the different parts of the complex, such as the gardens and the plaza. Merle Crowell set up a viewing platform on the east side of Rockefeller Center and founded the facetious \\"Sidewalk Superintendents' Club\\" so the public could view construction.

A military source told the Yonhap news agency every part of Pyongyang \\"will be completely destroyed by ballistic missiles and high-explosives shells\\". Yonhap has close ties to South Korea's government and is publicly funded. On Friday North Korea carried out what it said was its fifth, and largest, nuclear test. The international community is considering its response. The US says it is considering its own sanctions, in addition to any imposed by the UN Security Council, Japan and South Korea. Pyongyang responded on Sunday by calling the threats of \\"meaningless sanctions... highly laughable\\". The South Korean military official told Yonhap that Pyongyang districts thought to be hiding the North's leadership would be particularly targeted in any attack. The city, the source said, \\"will be reduced to ashes and removed from the map\\". The BBC's Korea correspondent Steve Evans says the South is using the same bloodcurdling rhetoric that the North frequently uses about the South Korean government in Seoul. He says there has been rising criticism within South Korea of the government as its attempts to isolate the North have failed to deter leader Kim Jong-un's nuclear ambitions. News of South Korea's attack plan for the North is believed to have been revealed to parliament following Friday's nuclear test. Meanwhile, the US's special envoy for North Korea says Washington is considering taking unilateral action against Pyongyang. \\"North Korea continues to present a growing threat to the region, to our allies, to ourselves, and we will do everything possible to defend against that growing threat,\\" Sung Kim said. \\"In addition to sanctions in the Security Council, both the US and Japan, together with [South Korea], will be looking at any unilateral measures as well as bilateral measures as well as possible trilateral cooperation.\\" North Korea is banned by the UN from any tests of nuclear or missile technology and has been hit by five sets of UN sanctions since its first test in 2006. The North said Friday's test had been of a \\"nuclear warhead that has been standardised to be able to be mounted on strategic ballistic rockets\\". Estimates of the explosive yield of the latest blast have varied. South Korea's military said it was about 10 kilotonnes, enough to make it the North's \\"strongest nuclear test ever\\". Other experts say initial indications suggest 20 kilotonnes or more. The nuclear bomb dropped by the US on Hiroshima in 1945 had a yield of about 15 kilotonnes.","output":"Following North Korea's fifth and most substantial nuclear test yet, South Korea, supported by the United States and Japan, have threatened destructive retaliation, indicating that Pyongyang could be completely leveled by ballistic missiles and high-explosive shells especially targeting areas believed to be hiding North Korean leadership; the threat is the latest escalation in an ongoing conflict between the North, South, and their global allies in response to North Korea's continued development of nuclear weapons, a pursuit banned by the United Nations and previously resulting in five sets of sanctions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Second question: This is an algebra problem. To solve it, we need to simplify the expression given. Here's how we do it step by step: a^2b(xa^2b+a^4b) First, let's distribute a^2b to each term inside the parentheses: a^2b * xa^2b + a^2b * a^4b This becomes: (ax^1 * a^2 * b^2) + (a^2 * a^4 * b^2) Now, let's combine the a's and b's: a^(1+2) * b^2 + a^(2+4) * b^2 This simplifies to: a^3b^2 + a^6b^2 We can see that both terms have a common factor, which is a^3b^2.

Context: For active people, regular training is as important part of maintaining and increasing fitness. About the only real downside to regular exercise is the transient toll it takes on the body after a hard training session. The pain and soreness after training needs sufficient time to recover from before another hard session can be performed. A very plausible theory pushed for many years is that the post-exercise oxidative stress in the body is the primary cause of the muscle damage and fatigue experienced. If you could reduce this oxidative stress, then it would allow quicker recovery, and then more time spent training. What this theory ignores though is that oxidative damage is a natural part of how the body adapts to stressful exercise, allowing the body to repair and grow stronger to allow higher levels of performance in the future. A small scale study has previously found that trained and untrained individuals who dose up on antioxidant supplements impair important exercise training adaptations such as improved insulin sensitivity and production of oxidative stress defence proteins. Now researchers have extended this study by looking at the effect of antioxidants in trained female runners, and published their findings in the European Journal of Sports Science. Twenty-three well trained female runners took part in three separate 3-week training blocks where they took either 1 gram of vitamin C, blackcurrant juice, or a placebo drink for each of the training blocks. Each of the dietary interventions involved drinking a similar volume of fruit drink of a total of half a litre per day split over the morning and evening. The training performance of each runner was carefully measured at the beginning and end of each 3-week treatment period. The runners stuck to a set training schedule which allowed a more accurate assessment of any changes in performance over the training period. Question: Why was a set training schedule used in a study of training performance of runners?

Please answer the following question: This is a correct answer to the following question about H.264/MPEG-4 AVC. Yes or no? Answer: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC is a block-oriented motion-compensation -based codec standard developed by the ITU-T Video Coding Experts Group (VCEG) together with the ISO/IEC JTC1 Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG). Question: what is mpeg4  avc or sp/asp A:","output":"Yes, your answer about H.264/MPEG-4 AVC being a block-oriented motion-compensation-based codec standard developed by the ITU-T Video Coding Experts Group (VCEG) together with the ISO/IEC JTC1 Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) is correct.  Now, let me address the question you asked: \\"what is MPEG-4 AVC or SP/ASP?\\" MPEG-4 AVC, also known as H.264, is a video compression standard that provides good video quality at low bit rates. It is widely used in various applications, including video streaming, videoconferencing, and Blu-ray discs. The standard was jointly developed by the ITU-T Video Coding Experts Group (VCEG) and the ISO/IEC Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG), as you correctly mentioned. SP (Simple Profile) and ASP (Advanced Simple Profile) are two profiles under the MPEG-4 Part 2 video compression standard, which is also known as MPEG-4 Visual. These profiles define different sets of encoding tools and compression capabilities to cater to different video applications and devices. Simple Profile (SP) is designed for low-complexity video encoding. It supports mainly progressive video with resolutions up to 352x288 pixels and is suitable for applications like videoconferencing and streaming on the internet. Advanced Simple Profile (ASP), on the other hand, includes more advanced encoding tools and supports interlaced as well as progressive video. This profile is aimed at providing better compression efficiency and video quality for a wide range of applications, including high-quality video streaming and broadcasting. In summary, MPEG-4 AVC (H.264) is a highly efficient video compression standard with widespread adoption, while MPEG-4 SP/ASP are profiles under the MPEG-4 Part 2 standard, aimed at different video encoding complexity levels and various applications."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When it was sold recently in New York for  27000, the seller, Mr. Oliver Pitt, was asked to explain how the picture had come into his possession. Pitt said, \\"I didn't know it was so valuable. I'm not an art expert. Photography is my hobby. I bought 'Fisherman' in Italy in 1970 for 140.the picture was dirty, and I couldn't see the artist's signature.

I told him that I had paid 140 for it but admitted I didn't know its actual worth. The customs man valued it at  140, and I was asked to pay duty on that value. I did so, there and then.\\" \\"Later, I took off the frame, and that uncovered Maveleone's signature. My wife suggested in fun that the painting might be a valuable one, so I cleaned it and put it up for sale.\\" As a result of his explanation, Oliver Pitt had to appear in court. He was accused of   knowingly making a false statement of the value of a picture so as to cheat the Customs Department. Pitt was not happy. \\"I told the truth as I knew it then,\\" he said, \\"What else could I say?\\" And then the judge agreed with him. \\"The Customs Department is to be responsible (blame),\\" he said, \\"for making a true valuation of goods bought into the country, so that the correct amount of duty may be charged.

Q:Given the following context:  Lancaster's career designing for the theatre began and ended with Gilbert and Sullivan. His first costumes and scenery were for the Sadler's Wells Ballet's Pineapple Poll (1951), John Cranko's ballet with a story based on a Gilbert poem and music by Sullivan. His last were for the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's revival of The Sorcerer (1973). In between, he designed more productions for the Royal Ballet, as well as for Glyndebourne Festival Opera, the Old Vic and the West End. It was a matter of mild regret to him that of the twenty plays, operas and ballets that he designed between the two, only one was for a thoroughly serious piece, Britten's Peter Grimes, for the Bulgarian National Opera in Sofia in 1964.Only two of Lancaster's theatre designs have remained in use in 21st-century productions, both by the Royal Ballet: Pineapple Poll and La fille mal gardée. In an article on the latter in 2016, Danielle Buckley wrote, \\"Lancaster's surrealist and stylized designs for Fille amplify the story's pantomime quality, and the exaggerated burlesque of its comedy – but the backdrops of fields that roll into the distance, bundles of hay, dreamy skies and village cottages provide the idealized, pastoral context that the story needs\\". Buckley adds that Lancaster’s designs have been criticised for locating the ballet in no particular time or place – \\"except, that is, of a 1960s London view of idyllic country life\\".Lancaster's stated view was that stage sets and costumes should reflect reality, but \\"through a lens, magnifying and slightly over-emphasising everything which it reflects\\". Sir Geraint Evans commented on how Lancaster's designs helped the performer: \\"[His] design for Falstaff was superb: it gave me clues to understanding the character, and reflected that marvellous, subtle sense of humour which was present in all his work.\\"  answer the following question:  What was the last year Lancaster created costumes and scenery?

Soon afterward, in April 1993, Albini remarked to the Chicago Tribune that he doubted Geffen would release the completed album.  Albini commented years later that in a sense he felt he spoke about the situation \\"from a position of ignorance, because I wasn't there when the band was having their discussions with the record label.  All I know is ... we made a record, everybody was happy with it.  A few weeks later I hear that it's unreleasable and it's all got to be redone\\".  While Albini's remarks in the article drew no immediate reply from the group or its label, Newsweek ran a similar article soon afterwards that did.  Nirvana denied there was any pressure from its label to change the album's sound, sending a letter to Newsweek that said that the article's author \\"ridiculed our relationship with our label based on totally erronous  [sic] information\\"; the band also reprinted the letter in a full-page ad in Billboard.  Rosenblatt insisted in a press release that Geffen would release anything the band submitted, and label founder David Geffen made the unusual move of personally calling Newsweek to complain about the article.Nirvana wanted to do further work on the recorded tracks, and considered working with producer Scott Litt and remixing some tracks with Andy Wallace (who had mixed Nevermind).  Albini vehemently disagreed, and claimed he had an agreement with the band that it would not modify the tracks without his involvement.  Albini initially refused to give the album master tapes to Gold Mountain, but relented after a phone call from Novoselic.

What about someone saying \\"Don't worry, just have one little sip\\"? Most people have their first drink by the time they're 13. That first drink can be the start of a troubled life. Drinking can make teens feel good, but that lasts only a short time. Alcohol clouds your brain and limits your ability to make decisions. Excessive drinking gradually makes your brain shrink and can cause serious damage. Over-drinking can cause learning disabilities and damage your memory. It distorts your vision and leads to blackouts. Teenagers often think that drinking will give you more energy, but alcohol isn't an energy drink; it's a depressant. Drinking and driving is one of the top causes of death for teen boys. An alcohol-related motor vehicle crash kills one person every 33 minutes and injures someone every two minutes. The rate of teenagers driving drunk is so high that the government is trying to pass new laws restricting teen driving. When we get to high school, friends start pressuring us to drink. High school students see alcohol as glamorous and a way to become popular. I created a survey at my school. Twenty-four of the 63 respondents predicted they would drink in high school. Eleven said maybe, and 28 said they don't plan on drinking. Regardless of what they say now, things can change. Teens starting high school want to fit in. Some people will do anything to be accepted, including potentially(,) hurting themselves. They think that one drink won't do anything. A little bit of alcohol probably won't kill you, but it can lead to poor decisions. High school is the time to experiment with what you want to do in life, but if you're experimenting with alcohol you could hurt someone, including yourself.

Early humans lived in small populations of nomadic hunters and gatherers. Human beings remained in Africa until about 40,000 years ago. After that, they spread throughout Europe, Asia, and Australia. By 10,000 years ago, the first human beings colonized the Americas. During this long period of time, the total number of human beings increased very slowly. Birth rates were fairly high but so were death rates, producing low rates of population growth.  and the situation: Archaeologists studied data about human settlements. One was 100,000 years old called village R, and the other one was about 9,000 years old called village N. The older settlement was located in Africa, the other one wasn't.  Answer the following question: Which village had more people that were hunters? A:","output":"Based on the background information provided, it is likely that Village R, the older settlement located in Africa 100,000 years ago, had more people who were hunters compared to Village N, the 9,000-year-old settlement. The reason behind this is that the earliest members of the human species evolved around 200,000 years ago in Africa, and they primarily lived as nomadic hunters and gatherers in small population groups. As humans spread and settled in different continents, their ways of living changed, leading to adaptations in their lifestyle and food practices. By the time of Village N's existence (9,000 years ago), humans had already reached America, suggesting that other regions of the world underwent several cultural and technological advancements. During this period, the Neolithic Revolution was taking place, which led to the development of agriculture, animal domestication, and sedentary lifestyles. This would mean that the inhabitants of Village N were more likely to engage in farming and raising livestock as opposed to hunting and gathering. Therefore, Village R most likely had more people engaged in hunting compared to Village N."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The building was sold in 1549 by Buonaccorso Pitti, a descendant of Luca Pitti, to Eleonora di Toledo.  Raised at the luxurious court of Naples, Eleonora was the wife of Cosimo I de' Medici of Tuscany, later the Grand Duke.  On moving into the palace, Cosimo had Vasari enlarge the structure to fit his tastes; the palace was more than doubled by the addition of a new block along the rear.  Vasari also built the Vasari Corridor, an above-ground walkway from Cosimo's old palace and the seat of government, the Palazzo Vecchio, through the Uffizi, above the Ponte Vecchio to the Palazzo Pitti. This enabled the Grand Duke and his family to move easily and safely from their official residence to the Palazzo Pitti. Initially the Palazzo Pitti was used mostly for lodging official guests and for occasional functions of the court, while the Medicis' principal residence remained the Palazzo Vecchio. It was not until the reign of Eleonora's son Francesco I and his wife Johanna of Austria that the palazzo was occupied on a permanent basis and became home to the Medicis' art collection.Land on the Boboli hill at the rear of the palazzo was acquired in order to create a large formal park and gardens, today known as the Boboli Gardens. The landscape architect employed for this was the Medici court artist Niccolò Tribolo, who died the following year; he was quickly succeeded by Bartolommeo Ammanati. The original design of the gardens centred on an amphitheatre, behind the corps de logis of the palazzo. The first play recorded as performed there was Andria by Terence in 1476. It was followed by many classically inspired plays of Florentine playwrights such as Giovan Battista Cini. Performed for the amusement of the cultivated Medici court, they featured elaborate sets designed by the court architect Baldassarre Lanci.

Plot title: Yellow Submarine Movie plot: Pepperland is a cheerful, music-loving paradise under the sea, protected by Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The titular Yellow Submarine rests on an Aztec-like pyramid on a hill. At the edge of the land is a range of high blue mountains. The land falls under a surprise attack from the music-hating Blue Meanies, who live in or beyond the blue mountains. The attack starts with magical projectiles fired from big artillery stationed in the blue mountains. The Blue Meanies seal the band inside a music-proof blue glass globe, they render the Pepperlanders immobile as statues by shooting arrows and dropping giant green apples upon them (a reference to the Apple Records music label), and drain the countryside of colour. In the last minute before his capture, Pepperland's elderly Lord Mayor sends Old Fred, an aging sailor (whom the mayor calls \\"Young Fred\\"), to get help; he runs to the Yellow Submarine and takes off in it (\\"Yellow Submarine\\"). Old Fred travels to Liverpool (\\"Eleanor Rigby\\"), where he follows the depressed and aimless Ringo and persuades him to return to Pepperland with him. Ringo collects his \\"mates\\" John, George, and finally Paul in The Pier, a house-like building on the top of a hill. The five journey back to Pepperland in the yellow submarine.

He points out a technicality that would allow MacElroy to re-enter the National Figure Skating Assocation, not in the men's division, but in the pair's division. The only problem is he needs to find a partner.A short time later MacElroy and Michaels end up encountering one another during MacElroy's search for a partner and proceed to have another televised brawl.

They are present mainly as positively charged ions dissolved in water. The sodium-potassium pump moves sodium ions (Na + ) out of the cell and potassium ions (K + ) into the cell. In both cases, the ions are moving from an area of lower to higher concentration. Energy in ATP is needed for this \\"uphill\\" process. Figure below shows how this pump works. Trace these steps from left to right in the figure  Now, I have a new situation: Ben and Andy studied minerals and micro-nutrients. Ben studied more about magnesium, zinc and molybdenum, while his buddy Andy studied about sodium and potassium.  Answer this question please: Which person studied less about Energy in ATP ? Answer:","output":"Both Ben and Andy focused on studying different minerals and micronutrients, with Ben studying magnesium, zinc, and molybdenum, and Andy studying sodium and potassium. It is important to note that ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is not directly related to these minerals and micronutrients, but rather serves as the energy currency in cells, including the energy needed for the sodium-potassium pump to function. The sodium-potassium pump, which is vital for maintaining an appropriate balance of ions within cells and facilitating numerous cellular processes, relies on the energy provided by ATP to move the sodium and potassium ions against their gradients. As the energy required for the sodium-potassium pump is derived from ATP, it can be assumed that Andy, who studied sodium and potassium, would have more exposure to the role of ATP in providing the necessary energy for this process. On the other hand, Ben's focus on magnesium, zinc, and molybdenum would likely involve studying their various roles and functions within biological systems, including their contributions to enzyme reactions, cellular structure, and overall health. While ATP and its role in energy transfer may be relevant to some of these topics, it is not the central focus of Ben's studies. Therefore, in comparison, it can be deduced that Ben studied less about energy in ATP compared to Andy. This is because Andy's research topic, involving sodium and potassium, would directly require an understanding of the role of ATP in the \\"uphill\\" process of moving these ions against their concentration gradients, while Ben's research focus on magnesium, zinc, and molybdenum would be less directly related to ATP's role in providing cellular energy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

My two year old knocked it off my desk top. I was very disappointed. Dont waste your money. Wish that I could give it zero stars Answer: Answer:","output":"The product review provided has a negative tone. Several factors contribute to this interpretation, indicating that the reviewer is not satisfied with their purchase and would not recommend it to others. First, the title \\"zero stars\\" itself implies strong dissatisfaction as the reviewer wishes they could rate the product even lower than the minimum allowable rating. Notably, many platforms use a star-based rating system, with one star typically being the lowest score and representing a very unfavorable evaluation of a product or service. By asserting that they would like to give zero stars, the reviewer emphasizes the extent of their disappointment and frustration. Second, the review discusses specific issues with the product and highlights its failure to meet basic requirements or expectations. Particularly, the reviewer states that the item \\"won't stay put when you punch it,\\" which conveys a sense of irritation as the product does not perform its intended function. This exacerbates the negative tone when paired with the fact that a small child could easily knock it off a desktop. As a result, this outcome undermines the product's quality and its potential reliability in the eyes of the reviewer. Furthermore, the reviewer explicitly advises potential consumers against purchasing this product, stating, \\"Don't waste your money.\\" This direct warning serves to underline the negative tone of the review, as the reviewer wants to deter others from experiencing the same disappointment they did. Lastly, the general sentiment of the review consistently focuses on disappointment and frustration. Using phrases like \\"I was very disappointed\\" and \\"Wish that I could give it zero stars\\" serve to reinforce the overall negative tone of the review. Consequently, the reviewer suggests that potential buyers seek alternative products or entirely disregard this one. In summary, this product review features a distinctly negative tone, driven by the reviewer's dissatisfaction with its performance and overall experience. By detailing specific issues, explicitly discouraging others from buying the product, and wishing to give \\"zero stars,\\" the reviewer emphasizes their frustration and the magnitude of the product's drawbacks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who had an ongoing revival? , can you please find it?   Agrippina (HWV 6) is an opera seria in three acts by George Frideric Handel with a libretto by Cardinal Vincenzo Grimani. Composed for the 1709–10 Venice Carnevale season, the opera tells the story of Agrippina, the mother of Nero, as she plots the downfall of the Roman Emperor Claudius and the installation of her son as emperor. Grimani's libretto, considered one of the best that Handel set, is an \\"anti-heroic satirical comedy\\", full of topical political allusions. Some analysts believe that it reflects Grimani's political and diplomatic rivalry with Pope Clement XI. Handel composed Agrippina at the end of a three-year sojourn in Italy. It premiered in Venice at the Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo on 26 December 1709. It proved an immediate success and an unprecedented series of 27 consecutive performances followed. Observers praised  the quality of the music—much of which, in keeping with the contemporary custom, had been borrowed and adapted from other works, including the works of other composers. Despite the evident public enthusiasm for the work, Handel did not promote further stagings. There were occasional productions in the years following its premiere but Handel's operas, including Agrippina, fell out of fashion in the mid-18th century. In the 20th century Agrippina was revived in Germany and premiered in Britain and America. Performances of the work have become ever more common, with innovative stagings at the New York City Opera and the London Coliseum in 2007. Modern critical opinion is that Agrippina is Handel's first operatic masterpiece, full of freshness and musical invention which have made it one of the most popular operas of the ongoing Handel revival. A:","output":"The first name of the person who had an ongoing revival is George. This is in reference to George Frideric Handel, the composer of Agrippina (HWV 6) mentioned in the article.

As the wider Open Source community grows, it becomes more of an issue every day, and something we all need to be aware of. While in Brazil I made a promise to Sulamita that I would be blogging about the issue of discrimination against women, and I have been holding off writing an entry until I had some real, practical, implementable steps that I can advise people to take to help make the situation better. Although I will never fully understand how some women are made to feel at the hands of such discrimination, I have been hoping my contribution could be to help contribute to an awareness of the issue, and for that to happen I felt I needed to construct some doable steps that people can execute. Solving social problems is hard though, which ain’t all that surprising, so I had held off on a blog post until I had some such action points. I have since discovered that there is really one key step that we all need take – don’t accept or allow discrimination in your community. In my mind all discrimination is bad.

In May 2014, Oklahoma Director of Corrections, Robert Patton, recommended an indefinite hold on executions in the state after the botched execution of African-American Clayton Lockett. The prisoner had to be tasered to restrain him prior to the execution, and the lethal injection missed a vein in his groin, resulting in Lockett regaining consciousness, trying to get up, and to speak, before dying of a heart attack 43 minutes later, after the attempted execution had been called off. In 2015, the state approved nitrogen asphyxiation as a method of execution.

Article: The 11 billion self-help industry is built on the idea that you should turn negative thoughts like \\"I never do anything right\\" into positive ones like \\"I can succeed.\\" But was positive thinking advocate Norman Vincent Peale right? Is there power in positive thinking? Researchers in Canada just published a study in the journal Psychological Science that says trying to get people to think more positively can actually have the opposite effect: it can simply highlight how unhappy they are. The study's authors, Joanne Wood and John Lee of the University of Waterloo and Elaine Perunovic of the University of New Brunswick, begin by citing   older research showing that when people get feedback which they believe is overly positive, they actually feel worse, not better. If you tell your friend who is slow to learn that he has the potential of an Einstein, _ . In one 1990s experiment, a team including psychologist Joel Cooper of Princeton asked participants to write essays opposing funding for the disabled. When the essayists were later praised for their sympathy, they felt even worse about what they had written. In this experiment, Wood, Lee and Perunovic measured 68 students' self-esteem. The participants were then asked to write down their thoughts and feelings for four minutes. Every 15 seconds, one group of students heard a bell. When it rang, they were supposed to tell themselves, \\"I am lovable.\\" Those with low self-esteem didn't feel better after the forced self-affirmation  . In fact, their moods turned significantly darker than those of members of the control group, who weren't urged to think positive thoughts. The paper provides support for newer forms of psychotherapy   that urge people to accept their negative thoughts and feelings rather than fight them. In the fighting, we not only often fail but can make things worse. Meditation   techniques, in contrast, can teach people to put their shortcomings into a larger, more realistic viewpoint. Call it the power of negative thinking. Question: According to the study of the Canadian researchers,   _  .

SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — Some people in Seoul on Tuesday said they are happy just to see U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un talking to each other rather than trading threats of war. “I am very happy because it is an epoch breakthrough after 70 years of division,” said Lee Jun-keun, a salesman working for a retail business. Last year the two leaders traded insults, with Trump calling Kim “rocket man,” and the North Korean leader calling the U.S. president a “dotard,” and they both threatened military action as tension rose over the North’s accelerated weapons testing to develop an operational nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile capability. But after North Korea successfully test-fired missiles it claimed could carry nuclear warheads capable of reaching the United States, Pyongyang pivoted to diplomacy by suspending further provocations and indicating a willingness to engage in denuclearization talks. Trump surprised allies and adversaries alike by immediately agreeing to meet with Kim, long before the specifics of a nuclear deal could be negotiated. Tuesday’s first meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader produced a broad declaration to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and develop a peace treaty to end the long standing hostiles between the U.S. and North Korea. Trump called the agreement “very comprehensive,” but it will be left to negotiators to later resolve differences between Washington’s call for complete and verifiable nuclear dismantlement before any sanctions relief is provided, and Pyongyang’s demand that concessions be linked to incremental progress. Some in South Korea remain skeptical that the broad commitment reached at the U.S.-North Korean summit in Singapore will lead to North Korea giving up its nuclear weapons program. “North Korea did not keep its promise in the past, even after signing the agreement. This is what I am disappointed and doubtful about,” said Shim Jae-yeon, a housewife who lives in Seoul. Others...

On his return to Nuremberg in 1495, Durer opened his own workshop (being married was a requirement for this). Over the next five years his style increasingly integrated Italian influences into underlying Northern forms. Durer's father died in 1502, and his mother died in 1513. His best works in the first years of the workshop were his woodcut prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as The Men's Bath House (ca. 1496). These were larger and more finely cut than the great majority of German woodcuts hitherto, and far more complex and balanced in composition. It is now thought unlikely that Durer cut any of the woodblocks himself; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman. However, his training in Wolgemut's studio, which made many carved and painted altarpieces and both designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut, evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce, and how to work with block cutters. Durer either drew his design directly onto the woodblock itself, or glued a paper drawing to the block. Either way, his drawings were destroyed during the cutting of the block.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Judy Chicago (born Judith Sylvia Cohen, July 20, 1939) is an American feminist artist, art educator, and writer known for her large collaborative art installation pieces about birth and creation images, which examine the role of women in history and culture. By the 1970s, Chicago had founded the first feminist art program in the United States. Chicago's work incorporates a variety of artistic skills, such as needlework, counterbalanced with labor-intensive skills such as welding and pyrotechnics. Chicago's most well known work is The Dinner Party, which is permanently installed in the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum. In 1970, Chicago decided to teach full-time at Fresno State College, hoping to teach women the skills needed to express the female perspective in their work. At Fresno, she planned a class that would consist only of women, and she decided to teach off campus to escape \\"the presence and hence, the expectations of men.\\" She taught the first women's art class in the fall of 1970 at Fresno State College. It became the Feminist Art Program, a full 15-unit program, in the spring of 1971. This was the first feminist art program in the United States. Fifteen students studied under Chicago at Fresno State College: Dori Atlantis, Susan Boud, Gail Escola, Vanalyne Green, Suzanne Lacy, Cay Lang, Karen LeCocq, Jan Lester, Chris Rush, Judy Schaefer, Henrietta Sparkman, Faith Wilding, Shawnee Wollenman, Nancy Youdelman, and Cheryl Zurilgen. Together, as the Feminist Art Program, these women rented and refurbished an off-campus studio at 1275 Maple Avenue in downtown Fresno. Here they collaborated on art, held reading groups, and discussion groups about their life experiences which then influenced their art. All of the students and Chicago contributed 25 per month to rent the space and to pay for materials. Later, Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro reestablished the Feminist Art Program at California Institute of the Arts. After Chicago left for Cal Arts, the class at Fresno State College was continued by Rita Yokoi from 1971 to 1973, and then by Joyce Aiken in 1973, until her retirement in 1992.  Chicago is considered one of the \\"first-generation feminist artists,\\" a group that also includes Mary Beth Edelson, Carolee Schneeman, and Rachel Rosenthal. They were part of the Feminist art movement in Europe and the United States in the early 1970s to develop feminist writing and art.  Chicago became a teacher at the California Institute for the Arts, and was a leader for their Feminist Art Program. In 1972, the program created Womanhouse, alongside Miriam Schapiro, which was the first art exhibition space to display a female point of view in art. With Arlene Raven and Sheila Levrant de Bretteville, Chicago co-founded the Los Angeles Woman's Building in 1973. This art school and exhibition space was in a structure named after a pavilion at the 1893 World's Colombian Exhibition that featured art made by women from around the world. This housed the Feminist Studio Workshop, described by the founders as \\"an experimental program in female education in the arts. Our purpose is to develop a new concept of art, a new kind of artist and a new art community built from the lives, feelings, and needs of women.\\" During this period, Chicago began creating spray-painted canvas, primarily abstract, with geometric forms on them. These works evolved, using the same medium, to become more centered around the meaning of the \\"feminine\\". Chicago was strongly influenced by Gerda Lerner, whose writings convinced her that women who continued to be unaware and ignorant of women's history would continue to struggle independently and collectively. was chicago the leader of the feminist movement","output":"Though this article does not directly state that Judy Chicago was the leader of the feminist movement, it does mention that she is considered one of the \\"first-generation feminist artists,\\" and was a key figure in the development of feminist writing and art. Chicago also founded the first feminist art program in the United States and co-founded the Los Angeles Woman's Building, further showcasing her significant contributions to the feminist movement within the art world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Fill the baking dish with boiling water halfway up the sides of the dishes, then bake.;  *Place the ramekins filled with cream batter into a baking dish.Fill the garlic press with boiling water halfway up the sides of the dishes, then bake.;","output":"The better solution for preparing ramekins to bake creme brulee is: *Place the ramekins filled with cream batter into a baking dish. Fill the baking dish with boiling water halfway up the sides of the dishes, then bake. This method is the best approach for baking creme brulee for a few reasons: 1. Uniform heat distribution: Placing the ramekins filled with the cream batter into a baking dish allows for even heat distribution during the baking process. This ensures that the creme brulee cooks evenly and achieves its characteristic smooth and creamy texture. 2. Water bath method: Filling the baking dish with boiling water halfway up the sides of the ramekins is a technique called a \\"bain-marie\\" or \\"water bath.\\" The purpose of using a water bath is to provide a gentle, indirect heat source that ensures even cooking. As water can only reach a maximum temperature of 212°F (100°C) before it turns into steam, it helps to prevent the delicate creme brulee from overheating, curdling, or cracking, which could ruin the dessert's texture. 3. Easy handling: By placing the ramekins within a baking dish, it becomes easier to transfer them in and out of the oven. Instead of individually handling each ramekin, you could simply grasp the sides of the baking dish to move all ramekins at once. Moreover, the higher walls of the baking dish can prevent any sloshing or spilling of the hot water during transportation. The second option mentioned: *Place the ramekins filled with cream batter into a baking dish. Fill the garlic press with boiling water halfway up the sides of the dishes, then bake. This method doesn't make sense, as the garlic press has nothing to do with the process of baking creme brulee. It seems to be an error in the description. In fact, a garlic press is a kitchen gadget used for mincing or pressing garlic cloves - it's unrelated to the process of baking or preparing ramekins for creme brulee.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which student learned less about ants that manage large herds of aphids ?  Hint: Some species of ants farm aphids, protecting them on the plants where they are feeding, and consuming the honeydew the aphids release from the terminations of their alimentary canals. This is a mutualistic relationship, with these dairying ants milking the aphids by stroking them with their antennae. Although mutualistic, the feeding behaviour of aphids is altered by ant attendance. Aphids attended by ants tend to increase the production of honeydew in smaller drops with a greater concentration of amino acids.Some farming ant species gather and store the aphid eggs in their nests over the winter. In the spring, the ants carry the newly hatched aphids back to the plants. Some species of dairying ants (such as the European yellow meadow ant, Lasius flavus) manage large herds of aphids that feed on roots of plants in the ant colony.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: European Golden Boy Award Announces 40-Man Shortlist, Five English Players Make the List The prestigious European Golden Boy award, which recognizes the brightest young talents in football, has recently announced its 40-man shortlist for this year's award. Among the nominees are five English players, including Raheem Sterling, Luke Shaw, John Stones, Eric Dier, and Calum Chambers. This award, handed out annually, is reserved for players under the age of 21 who standout in Europe's top leagues. Since its inception in 2003, the European Golden Boy award has helped highlight the future stars of the football world, with illustrious past winners such as Wayne Rooney, Lionel Messi, Sergio Aguero, and Paul Pogba, among others. Rooney remains the only previous English winner of the prestigious award, having claimed it in 2004 during his time at Everton. Manchester City's Raheem Sterling, who joined the club from Liverpool in 2015, is arguably the most well-known of the English nominees. The winger has seen a meteoric rise in his playing career, becoming an instrumental figure for both his club and the England national team. His impressive performances in recent seasons have made him one of the top contenders for this year's award. Luke Shaw, the Manchester United left-back, has also earned his place among the nominees, following his resurgence under current United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Shaw's relentless dedication and hard work have seen him transform into one of the league's best fullbacks, overcoming injury obstacles and receiving praise from both fans and experts alike. Everton's commanding center-back, John Stones, has also been making waves in the Premier League, earning himself a spot on the Golden Boy shortlist. Despite facing some criticism early in his career, Stones has continued to develop into an intelligent and composed defender, becoming an important figure for both the Toffees and the England national team. Tottenham Hotspur's Eric Dier has been a consistent and versatile performer for his club, playing both in the midfield and as a center-back. His commitment to the team and flexibility in multiple positions make him a valuable asset for Tottenham, which has ultimately led to his nomination for the Golden Boy award. Finally, Arsenal's Calum Chambers has shown his potential as a versatile defender since joining the Gunners in 2014 from Southampton. Though his Arsenal career has experienced ups and downs, including loan spells at Middlesbrough and Fulham, Chambers has managed to establish himself as a strong and reliable option in the defensive line. It is clear that the quality of young English talent is on the rise, as evidenced by the European Golden Boy award nominees. With Raheem Sterling, Luke Shaw, John Stones, Eric Dier, and Calum Chambers making the 40-man shortlist, the future indeed looks promising for English football as these young stars continue their development. The winner of the prestigious award will be announced later this year, and could potentially mark the second time an English player receives the honor since its origination in 2003."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:Media playback is not supported on this device With the Dons and Celtic the only clubs never to have lost top flight status, it is the longest supporters have waited for one to come along. When Maurice Edu cancelled out a Kari Arnason opener at Ibrox 56 months ago, no one foresaw the length of time that would elapse without one of Scotland's headline matches. A powder-keg head-to-head that is, according to some Ibrox legends, as intense as anything a Rangers-Celtic game conjures up. Rangers captains of the past Terry Butcher and Barry Ferguson talk of \\"hatred\\" and \\"nastiness\\" but, with the game a sell-out, Aberdeen fans are clearly relishing a return. Many in light blue have accused the Dons of \\"raising their game\\" against Rangers but the men in red prevailed just once in the last 13 games against them before the Ibrox club's 2012 financial implosion. However, those matches came before manager Derek McInnes arrived at Pittodrie to steer the club to the upper echelons of the table with Aberdeen a very different animal under the former Ibrox midfielder. Despite Walter Smith's presence, Pittodrie tended to be an unhappy hunting ground throughout his second spell in charge with the Ibrox legend winning just once in the Granite City after replacing Paul le Guen. \\"Aberdeen always have a good attitude towards games against Rangers,\\" Smith declared after a 1-0 loss in the north east in 2009. No doubt a thinly-veiled barb given they had won just twice in their previous 12 league games that season. Pittodrie has been a struggle for many Rangers teams, but in particular the ones that came up against Alex Ferguson's all-conquering side. Incredibly, during Ferguson's eight-year tenure at Aberdeen, Rangers could only muster one single victory at Pittodrie. Ferguson would lose just five times to Rangers in league games, with four of those at Ibrox. If Rangers' Pittodrie record in the late 1970s and early 80s was dreadful, Aberdeen's record at Ibrox since the early 90s has been atrocious. Brian Grant and Eoin Jess were the heroes in a 2-0 win in Govan in September 1991. It was Aberdeen's first visit to Ibrox since they lost by the same score-line four months earlier, costing them the Premier Division title. But they haven't won there since. That's 42 visits, 0 victories. And it's not just against Rangers they have struggled against at Ibrox as that figure includes a League Cup semi-final loss to Celtic and in the last four of the Scottish Cup to St Johnstone. Ferguson led Aberdeen to 17 league victories over the Ibrox club and since his departure, almost exactly 30 years ago, the Dons have beaten Rangers on 18 occasions in top flight matches, with 11 different managers. When seeking the answer to the why this fixture is so heated, one of the main reasons is simple and sporting, very few head-to-heads between the pair have been meaningless over the years. From the 1970s, this has been a heavyweight clash, with silverware often up for grabs. The list of on-pitch incidents are lengthy. Particularly those involving John McMaster and Willie Johnston and Neil Simpson and Ian Durrant. Robbie Winters being pelted with coins, Fernando Ricksen's kung-fu kick on Darren Young, Kyle Lafferty feigning a head-butt from Charlie Mulgrew. It is a game that requires vigilance and cool heads on and off the pitch. During Rangers' four-year rise to the Premiership they faced many top flight opponents along the way. Aberdeen were not one of them. And despite the headlines and goading that will continue in the build-up to this eagerly-awaited meeting, it is worth noting that it is an important league game. Both have designs on challenging Celtic for the title yet they both find themselves four points off the pace having played a game more than the champions. Regardless of the sub-plots, this may be a game neither can afford to lose even this early in the campaign with a potential 10 point deficit on the cards for the loser. A summary of the above article is?","output":"This article discusses the intense rivalry between Scottish football clubs Aberdeen and Rangers, highlighting historical matches, records, and on-pitch incidents that have fueled tensions between the two teams over the years. Both clubs have ambitious plans to challenge Celtic for the league title, but currently find themselves trailing by four points despite having played one more game than the reigning champions. The upcoming match between Aberdeen and Rangers is crucial for both teams, as the losing side could face a potential 10-point deficit early in the campaign."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a news article: MANHATTAN, Kan. (AP) — Kansas State says it will pay a 5,000 fine after its marching band shaped itself into the rival Jayhawk mascot and what appeared to be a large phallus during a halftime show.      The school said Tuesday that band director Frank Tracz (trays) will miss the Nov. 28 game against Kansas and that university officials must approval future halftime shows.      The university says it decided to pay the self-imposed fine after the Big 12 Conference warned of potential sportsmanship and ethical conduct violations.      The controversy erupted after Saturday's space-themed halftime show during the team's home opener against South Dakota. One formation featured the Kansas State band forming the University of Kansas mascot and a phallic looking Starship Enterprise crashing into it.      Tracz has apologized for what he described as a \\"misinterpretation.\\" ||||| Kansas State officials have apologized for a marching band routine during Saturday night's season opener that involved the rival Jayhawks and appeared to be adult-oriented in nature.      The Kansas State marching band's director will meet with university administrators Tuesday afternoon.      The Pride of Wildcat Land marching band's halftime performance Saturday night included a routine where the band created the image of a University of Kansas Jayhawk and what the band's announcer said was the \\"starship Enterprise.\\"      The Enterprise then approached the Jayhawk, which then broke up, with band members marching in different directions. Some saw something other than the starship Enterprise, claiming that the image was \\"obscene.\\"      Jayhawk fans immediately voiced their complaints about the show on social media.      Band leaders announced that the whole thing was a misunderstanding, and that the show was simply \\"the starship Enterprise attacking the beak of the bird.\\"      But Kansas State President Kirk Schultz issued an apology following the performance.      The story immediately went viral and has been picked up by People Magazine, The Chicago Tribune, London's Daily Mail and many other publications.      Band members say their show has been misinterpreted, and Lawrence Journal World sports editor Tom Keegan says that is possible.      \\"Maybe they're so nerdy they didn't realize how it looked (to fans)\\" Keegan said while appearing on KCTV5's Off the Bench Sunday night.      Keegan also suggested that Kansas State football coach Bill Snyder would not be happy about the situation.      \\"Can you imagine at Bill Snyder Family Stadium that went on?\\" Keegan said. \\"Can you imagine how livid, how embarrassed, how ashamed that Bill Snyder must be?\\"      Whether Keegan's correct, and the band leaders and members are just too \\"nerdy\\" to understand how their show looked to some others, or whether they're just making excuses for a decision to make fun of their arch rivals, their show has certainly attracted worldwide attention and energized the KU-Kansas State rivalry.      The meeting between leaders of the marching band and university administrators will be at 2 p.m. Tuesday.      Copyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.) All rights reserved. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Kansas State University's marching band performed a halftime show during a football game, and they made shapes with their bodies. They made a shape that looked like a rival team's mascot, the Jayhawk, and another shape that some people thought looked like a Starship Enterprise spaceship crashing into it. However, some people thought it looked like a large inappropriate body part. Because of this, the school was fined 5,000, and the band director will not be at a future game against the rival team. The school must also have their future halftime shows approved by university officials. Many people talked about this event on social media and in newspapers.

I was rostered to the brain injury ward in a chronic hospital, where the patients had severe brain damage from tumours, car accidents, strokes, metabolic diseases, degenerative diseases, and alcoholism. Only about half were ambulant. Most had severely impacted recent and long term memories. They could not bathe or feed themselves. The majority sat most of the day in chairs lined along the sides of the day room. They were spoon-fed meals and wheeled into the toilet. One of those patients was Connie S. She was maybe 55 yrs old and she spent a lot of the day screaming in her chair. She could not speak, walk, or cooperate. One nurse was very impatient with her and once I heard that nurse say to her, “You think the water is too hot, do you? Then have it cold!” as she bathed her in cold water. I remember standing up for her to that nurse. I worked that ward for over a year and then, one day, just like that, Connie S. woke up. She suddenly began speaking and walking. She apparently remembered most of the things had had happened to her in the ward. Soon, she walked right out of that ward and never came back. As she left, she appeared dignified and so happy, so relieved. I was too junior at that stage to know what her diagnosis was supposed to have been, but no-one expected her ever to leave. No-one left that ward. It was the end of the line. I remember being really glad that I had stood up for her and thinking how ashamed the nasty nurse must have been. It is now many years later and I often think of this woman and wonder how she fared in her post-hospital life.

Article: Tony Burke, Australia's environment minister, says he won't decide until next year whether the koala should be protected as an endangered species. He was expected to make his decision by the end of October. But that decision has been put off. Burke said he needed more time to go over the latest information about the koala's population. In September, an Australian Senate committee reported that there was no question the koala's population is on the decrease. \\"But they may not yet be eligible   for listing as a threatened species,\\" said Senator Doug Cameron. \\"To have such a significant Australian icon  included on the threatened species list would be a national shame.\\" The koala is found only in the eucalyptus   forests of Australia. And its population is reported to have fallen sharply for many reasons, including the cutting down of forests to make way for human beings' development, their own illness, climate change and killings by other animals such as wild dogs. And every year many koalas are hit by cars as they are trying to cross the busy roads. Putting off the decision on protection for the koala \\"is really bad news,\\" said Debbie Pointing, the president of the Koala Action Group. \\"We've worked tirelessly for many years to gather data on the populations,\\" Pointing said. \\"That data should be enough to make a decision.\\" However, Burke pointed out that the Australian government had spent at least 6.3 million on koala conservation efforts since 1996. senators listed efforts that are already underway in Queensland - the construction of special koala bridges as well as fences along roads, to keep the animals out of harm's way. Some people say that is not enough. \\"What we're doing at the moment is likely to drive this species to extinction,\\" Queensland University zoologist Bill Ellis said. \\"Koalas are an iconic Australian animal,\\" Burke told Australians. \\"They hold a special place in the hearts of Australians.\\" But it is a fact that if more isn't done to protect the koala, they might soon hold a place only in...

Given the question: Title: drying Review: found this to be rather drying and the scent isnt great.Iwas hoping the green tea scent would come thru more.used it once and wont again. Is the review positive or negative? The answer is:","output":"The review is negative.  The review provides several clues that point towards a negative sentiment. Firstly, the reviewer describes the product as \\"rather drying\\". In most contexts, especially in beauty, personal care, and cleaning products, 'drying' has a negative connotation. It often implies that the product makes the user's skin feel dry, which is usually an undesirable effect. Next, the reviewer describes the scent of the product, stating that it \\"isn't great.\\" This is also an indicator of their dissatisfaction with the product. A 'great' smell is typically essential to a good user experience, particularly in sectors like beauty, personal care, and cleaning products. Thus, not having a satisfactory scent contributes to their negative sentiment. The reviewer then expresses disappointment because they were expecting the \\"green tea scent would come thru more\\". This demonstrates the product did not meet their expectations in terms of fragrance intensity or quality, adding to the negative sentiment. Finally, the statement \\"used it once and won't again\\" clearly expresses the reviewer's unwillingness to reuse the product, suggesting they were extremely dissatisfied with it. Therefore, given these factors, this can be concluded as a negative review. The reviewer's language and feedback do not indicate any positive feelings or satisfaction with the product, and they express disappointment and dissatisfaction in multiple ways. Hence, this review is negative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Review title: ENERGY POURING FROM THE SCREEN Product review: The reviews I've read only confirm my belief that most great works are either adored or loathed. Either you got the whole message and loved every minute or you couldn't wait for it to be over. It would definitly help to read and enjoy the book before watching the movie. I doubt anyone could have hoped for a better transfer from book to screen. There is so much energy in this movie if your eyes are pointed the right way.Some fans only seem to appreciate F&L as a drug-culture flick, but it really goes alot deeper than that. It's about two guys desperatly searching for the world they once knew and attempts to tear down alot of the \\"hippie\\" ideologies that many were stuck with after the summer of love. A real masterpiece from both Thompson and Gilliam. Answer:","output":"The review seems to be quite positive despite acknowledging that the perceived quality of the product can vary depending on viewer's preference. The reviewer states their belief that the movie is a \\"real masterpiece\\" from the creators. They also mention that it is a strong adaptation from the book which indicates that the story's essence may have been well-captured.  The reviewer also tips potential viewers on ways to enhance their viewing experience, suggesting that reading and enjoying the book before watching the movie would likely increase appreciation of the film. Despite recognizing that some fans may appreciate the film primarily as a \\"drug-culture flick,\\" the reviewer argues that the film goes deeper than that, painting a complex picture of two individuals searching desperately for their old world and challenging prevailing ideologies.  Given these points, the review would likely increase the chances of someone buying or investing time into this product, provided they have either a favourable view of the book or an interest in the themes the reviewer mentions. However, the statement \\"Either you got the whole message and loved every minute or you couldn't wait for it to be over,\\" signals a polarizing reaction; people may either love or hate it based on their personal preferences.  So overall, if the potential buyer aligns with the tastes of the reviewer or is intrigued by the challenge of fully \\"getting the message,\\" this review likely increases the chances of purchase. Conversely, buyers who are discouraged by complexities or perceived challenges in understanding may be less likely to purchase based on this review. Nevertheless, the overall tone of the review is overwhelmingly positive, which on balance leans towards increasing the chances of purchasing the product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plans by Labour to charge visitors from the US and 55 other countries who don't require a visa to enter the UK have been met with dismay by airlines. Under the proposals, nationals in countries enjoying a 'visa waiver' system of fast-track permission to enter the UK will be hit with a charge of around £10 per visit, which the party said would more than cover the £45 million cost of 1,000 extra border guards. That is a similar sum as the US charges for its equivalent service and Labour said tourism experts did not anticipate it would have any impact on the numbers choosing to travel to Britain. Under Labour's plans, passengers who don't require a visa to enter the UK could be met with a £10 entry fee (File Photo) But Nathan Stower, chief executive of the British Air Transport Association (BATA), voiced serious concerns over the proposals. 'While we welcome the desire to improve the customer experience for passengers arriving at the UK border, airlines have significant concerns about this proposal,' he said. 'Visitors from countries like the USA and Australia already pay the highest air passenger tax in the world to fly to the UK – £71 from next April – contributing billions of pounds to the Treasury. Adding yet another charge will make the UK more uncompetitive in attracting tourists, businesses and inbound investment. 'It is not clear how this proposed charge would be collected. The vast majority of visitors from those countries that are not required to obtain a visa to enter the UK, such as the USA, do not currently provide information to UK authorities ahead of their visit. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper believes changes need to be made on the UK's immigration policy. It might not just be your passport you need to show to enter the UK, but also an extra £10. 'Furthermore, if more money were to be raised from airline passengers alone, it would only fair for this to fund improvements in the border at airports and not at other ports of entry such as Calais.' Regular increases in the cost of general visas since 2010 - from £68 to £83 - had not resulted in reduced visitor numbers from countries not benefiting from waiver arrangements, aides said. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced the plan as part of a wider program of wider reforms she believe needs to be introduced to the UK's policy on immigration. As many as 5.5 million travellers a year will be subject to the new fee - more than two in five of those from America, with Australians and Canadians the next largest groups. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"This article reports on plans from the Labour party in the UK to implement a fee for visitors from the United States and 55 other countries who do not require a visa to enter the UK. This proposal has been met with objections, particularly from airlines. The plan involves a proposed charge of around £10 per visit, a measure intended to offset the cost of 1,000 additional border guards, which is estimated at £45 million. The Labour party has compared this proposed charge to a similar one in the United States and has stated that they anticipate no major impacts on tourism numbers.  Nathan Stower, the chief executive of the British Air Transport Association (BATA), has expressed significant concerns regarding this proposal. He points out that visitors, particularly from countries like the U.S and Australia, already contribute substantial amounts through air passenger taxes, and adding another charge could potentially discourage tourism, business, and investment in the UK.  Furthermore, Stower raises questions about the methods of collecting this proposed charge, as many visitors, especially those not required to obtain a visa, do not currently share their information with UK authorities prior to their visit. He also suggests that if an extra fee is collected from airline passengers, it should be used to improve the airport borders, not other points of entry. The article also mentions that there were regular increases in the cost of general visas from £68 to £83 since 2010, which did not affect the inbound passenger traffic much. Labour's Shadow Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, unveiled this plan as part of a broader reform initiative she believes needs to be integrated within the UK’s immigration policy.

Choices:  - ground - finger - petri dish - water - soap  The rationale to choose \\"water\\" as the answer is that: The answer to this question is:","output":"Water is the most likely place for bacteria to be slimy among the choices provided. The rationale behind choosing water as the answer can be explained from multiple perspectives including bacterial survival, growth, and biofilm formation. These aspects are discussed below for all the mentioned options: 1. Ground: Although the ground can house various types of bacteria, it is not the most conducive environment for bacterial growth when it comes to being slimy. The soil may contain moisture, which supports bacterial growth, but the bacterial colonies present on the ground are often localized and not slimy. 2. Finger: Our skin contains a diverse bacterial population, including hands and fingers. However, our fingers are not an ideal location for bacterial growth in terms of sliminess either. The surface of the skin, which is constantly subjected to friction, exposure to various surfaces, and handwashing, does not provide a favorable environment for slimy bacterial growth. Additionally, the constant use of our fingers would deter any biofilm formation or slimy bacterial colonies. 3. Petri Dish: A petri dish can maintain a slimy bacterial culture if it contains the appropriate growth media for the bacteria and if the dish is left undisturbed for an extended period. However, the sliminess of the bacterial growth depends on the particular species. Some bacterial colonies may become slimy, while others may remain dry. So, although a petri dish can potentially support slimy bacterial growth, it is not the most likely option since it is highly determined by the laboratory conditions and specific bacterial species. 4. Water: Water provides an environment that is ideal for bacterial growth and sliminess. The presence of moisture and nutrients in the water support the rapid growth and reproduction of bacteria, leading to the formation of biofilms. Bacterial biofilms are slimy structures formed by bacterial communities that adhere to each other and to surfaces, protecting the bacteria within from external factors, such as chemicals and predators. The abundant presence of moisture in water allows bacteria to grow and spread, ultimately creating a slimy surface or mass. Sliminess is a typical characteristic of bacterial growth in water pipes, lakes, streams, and moist surfaces where water is present. Therefore, water is the most likely place to find slimy bacteria among the given options. 5. Soap: Although soap can become contaminated with bacteria, it is not a suitable environment for the growth of slimy bacteria. Soap is designed to remove dirt, grease, and bacteria from surfaces, and its chemical composition can often inhibit bacterial growth. Additionally, soap is predominantly used in the presence of water, so any slimy bacteria growing on soap would likely be washed away during use. To conclude, water is the most favorable environment for bacteria to be slimy due to the nurturing and protective conditions that support bacterial growth and biofilm formation. The other options provided may contain bacteria, but they do not foster the ideal conditions for the formation of slimy bacterial colonies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The first one she is calling Glubber, and the second she has named Malk. To try to figure out what type of products these new materials may be used for, Nelly is performing various tests. The first test she is doing is securing one end of the material to a table and then pulling on it and letting it go. When she performs this test on some Glubber, the material quickly snaps back toward the table. Performing the same process with some Malk, the material slowly crawls along the floor as it makes its way back to the table.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which material is less resistant to changing shape?  Hint: Something that is elastic can return to its original shape after being stretched or compressed. This property is called elasticity . As you stretch or compress an elastic material like a bungee cord, it resists the change in shape. It exerts a counter force in the opposite direction. This force is called elastic force . The farther the material is stretched or compressed, the greater the elastic force becomes. As soon as the stretching or compressing force is released, elastic force causes the material to spring back to its original shape. You can watch a demonstration of elastic force at this URL: The answer to this question is:","output":"Malk is less resistant to changing shape.  In the paragraph above, it is described that when Nelly performs a test by securing one end of the material to a table and pulling on it, Glubber quickly snaps back toward the table. This suggests that Glubber has a higher elasticity, as it can return to its original shape quickly after being stretched. It exerts a stronger elastic force that allows it to spring back to its original shape, indicating its resistance to shape change. On the other hand, when Nelly performs the same test with Malk, the material slowly crawls along the floor as it makes its way back to the table. This suggests that Malk has a lower elasticity than Glubber, as it takes a longer amount of time for it to return to its original shape after being stretched. This slower response implies that Malk is less resistant to changing shape when compared to Glubber. In summary, based on the tests performed by Nelly and the information provided in the paragraph, Malk appears to be less resistant to changing shape compared to Glubber. It has a lower elasticity, meaning it exerts a weaker elastic force and takes more time to return to its original shape after being stretched."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Do these two sentences mean the same thing? Possible answers: [a]. no; [b]. yes;","output":"[b]. yes; Both sentences convey the same central idea, which is that during MacDonald's retirement, he wrote/compiled a resource called the \\"Macdonald dictionary of Canterbury biographies,\\" consisting of 12,000 biographies, now held or managed by the Canterbury Museum.  In Sentence 1, the term \\"compiled\\" is used, while in Sentence 2, the term \\"wrote\\" is used. Although these words have slightly different connotations, in this context, they essentially describe the same process of creating this dictionary of biographies. \\"Compiled\\" suggests that MacDonald gathered these biographies, potentially from other sources or works, whereas \\"wrote\\" implies that he authored the biographies himself. Regardless, both words indicate that MacDonald was behind the creation of this collection. Additionally, Sentence 1 uses the phrase \\"held by,\\" while Sentence 2 uses \\"run by\\" to describe the relationship between the biographies collection and the Canterbury Museum. The phrases differ ever so slightly in meaning: \\"held by\\" implies that the museum possesses and stores the biographies, whereas \\"run by\\" suggests that the museum actively manages or curates the collection. Despite the nuanced difference between the two phrases, it is clear that the Canterbury Museum is responsible for the 12,000 biographies in question. In both sentences, the key elements remain consistent: MacDonald's retirement, the creation of the \\"Macdonald dictionary of Canterbury biographies,\\" the presence of 12,000 biographies, and the Canterbury Museum's involvement with the collection.

Options: - feel relieved - cross street - learn to swim - walk - act responsibly  Explain why a human would choose \\"feel relieved\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"feel relieved\\" as the answer to the question above because ibuprofen is a common over-the-counter medication that is widely used to help relieve pain, such as headaches. When taken in appropriate doses, it can effectively reduce inflammation and alleviate pain, providing a sense of relief for the person experiencing the headache. The other options presented in the question do not directly relate to the act of taking ibuprofen for a headache. These options include: - Cross street: This is an unrelated action to taking medication for a headache and does not describe the possible outcome of taking ibuprofen. - Learn to swim: This is also an unrelated action and does not explain the possible effects of taking ibuprofen for a headache. - Walk: While taking a walk can sometimes help alleviate a headache, it does not directly relate to the specific action of taking ibuprofen. - Act responsibly: This option could be interpreted in various ways and does not specifically address the outcome of taking ibuprofen for a headache. Given the context of taking ibuprofen to treat a headache, \\"feel relieved\\" is the most appropriate answer as it directly addresses the intended result of the action, which is to reduce pain and discomfort."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Trivia question: What is the geographical term for a ring-shaped coral island And the answer is?","output":"The answer to the trivia question is \\"atoll.\\" An atoll is a ring-shaped coral island, or a collection of small islets, surrounding a central lagoon. This geographical term is often associated with the coral reefs that form in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Atolls are formed over millions of years through the process of coral reef development around underwater volcanic islands. It begins with a fringing reef, which forms close to the shore of an island. As the volcanic island sinks back into the ocean due to erosion and subsidence (the process where an island gradually lowers due to the weight of the volcanic rocks and the cooling of the Earth's crust), the corals continue to grow upward and outward to reach sunlight, thereby forming a barrier reef. The barrier reef encircles a lagoon that eventually replaces the volcanic island, which has sunk entirely beneath the water's surface. The atoll is the final stage of this process, characterized by a ring-like shape with a central lagoon and small islets or islands formed by the rim of coral reefs. In some cases, these lagoons may be connected to the open ocean through channels. Atolls are home to an array of marine life, including various species of fish, invertebrates, and other sea creatures. They provide essential habitat and feeding grounds for these organisms, and their rich biodiversity makes them vital ecosystems in our planet's oceans. The Maldives, found in the Indian Ocean, and the Marshall Islands and Tuvalu in the Pacific are well-known examples of atoll formations. Charles Darwin, the renowned naturalist, was the first to present a detailed theory on the formation of atolls and the coral reef development process during his voyage around the world aboard the HMS Beagle in the 19th century. His observations and discoveries led to a deeper understanding of the geological and ecological processes at work in creating these unique structures. In conclusion, the geographical term for a ring-shaped coral island is an atoll. These fascinating and ecologically significant formations are the result of coral reefs growing around sinking volcanic islands over millions of years, eventually creating a ring-like structure with a central lagoon and small islets. Atolls play a crucial role in supporting marine life and contribute to the incredible biodiversity found in our planet's oceans."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

All have the same characteristics: they are tolerant of salt, brackish, and fresh water; they grow in oxygen-poor soil; and they can survive drastic water-level changes. Black and white mangroves excrete salt from under their leaves, and red mangroves filter the salinity of sea water. All species are integral to coastline protection during severe storms. Red mangroves, for example, have far-reaching roots that trap sediments. The trees not only stabilize coastlines, but add land as more sand and decaying vegetation is trapped in the root systems. All three mangroves also absorb the energy of waves and storm surges. The estuaries act as fisheries for fry and nurseries for crustaceans. Shrimp, oysters, crabs, whelks, cockles, and snails thrive in these waters, as do primordial horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus). The region supports a 59 million-a-year Tortugas pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus duorarum) industry, and a 22 million-a-year stone crab (Menippe mercenaria) industry.  Between 80 and 90 percent of species that are harvested commercially in Florida are born or spend time in the shallow waters near the Everglades. Oysters and mangroves work in tandem to build up the coastline. The sand around the coastline has minute white particles of quartz and fine shells. When currents are right, oysters grow in colonies or beds, and deposit their shells, reinforcing the bed. Mangrove seeds, called propagules, are full embryos and float in water until they reach a favorable location and take root, often on oyster beds. They shed skin and litter, ensuring other trees will not compete for space and nutrients.Mangroves also serve as excellent rookeries for birds. Wading birds, such as roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), egrets, and tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor) use the mangroves as a nursery, due to the proximity of food sources...

Article: The Gunpowder Plot was conspiracy   to kill King James I, as well as the members of the House of Lords and Commons at the re-opening of Parliament. It was designed by a group of Catholics in protest against the anti-Catholic laws that were being introduced by the king. Robert Catesby was the leader of the group. It was he and his cousin, Thomas Wintour, and two other friends, Thomas Percy and John Wright, who formed the center of the group. They were joined by nine more men; among them was Guy Fawkes, from the city of York in the north of England. Fawkes found a store room directly under the House of Lords and rented it out under the false name of John Johnson. The conspirators stored thirty-six barrels of gunpowder there, and Fawkes, who was an explosives expert, was to light the fuses   on 5th November 1605. The plot failed because one of the conspirators, Francis Tresham, sent a letter to his relative, who was a member of the House of Lords. The letter warned him not to attend the opening ceremony of Parliament. The letter was passed on to the authorities, who took action. Guy Fawkes was found in the cellar on the night of 4th November with the thirty-six barrels and a number of fuses. He was imprisoned and ill-treated, eventually giving away the names of the conspirators. Soldiers of the king surrounded Holbeach House, in the Midlands, where they knew the conspirators to be hiding. In the fight that followed, four of them were shot dead, including Catesby and Percy, who were actually killed by the same bullet. The others were imprisoned and hanged along with Guy Fawkes on 31st January 1606. These days, on 5th November, children all over Britain celebrate Guy Fawkes Night by building huge bonfires and lighting fireworks. It's a family tradition and an occasion to eat potatoes baked by the flames. There is always a 'guy' on top of the fire, a model of Guy Fawkes, dressed in the clothes of the 17th century.

Step 1: Choose Your Background The first step in video production involves identifying a suitable background. This aspect is paramount since the background can significantly influence the mood and tone of the video. It helps to ensure that the background complements the subject or topic of your video, rather than being a distraction. This could be a solid, neutral colour for a professional look, a natural setting for more relaxed videos, or an environment relevant to the theme of your content. Choosing the right background not only improves the aesthetic appeal of the video but also increases viewer engagement. Step 2: Place Your Camera Once you have chosen the ideal background, the next step requires the strategic positioning of your camera. Camera placement can have a profound effect on viewer interpretation. It is crucial that the camera is placed at eye level to establish a relatable and genuine connection with the viewer. It’s also vital to contemplate the framing and positioning based on the type of shot you need. Always ensure you have a tripod or a property camera setup to reduce shake and provide a better viewing experience. Step 3: Light it Up Good lighting is vital to produce high-quality video content. Lighting sets the scene’s mood and greatly impacts the perception and professionalism of the video. Soft, natural lighting is often best, but in spaces where lighting is poor, using professional lighting kits can hugely enhance the video's quality. Ensure lighting is placed strategically to illuminate the subject properly without causing harsh shadows or overexposure. Step 4: Use the Rule of Thirds When composing your shot, the 'Rule of Thirds' is a useful guideline to consider. Imagine your scene divided into nine equal parts by two equally spaced horizontal lines and two equally spaced vertical lines. Placing your subject along these lines or at their intersection can add balance and interest to your composition, making it more engaging for the viewers. Step 5: Ensure a Quiet Location for Filming This step often gets neglected in the preparation for video production, yet it is one of the most crucial aspects. Ensuring a quiet location for filming is key to capturing clear audio without disruptions. Audio quality is as important as video quality, and background noise can adversely affect the viewing experience.  Step 6: Edit Your Video Lastly, after successfully shooting the video, the task is not over yet. Your raw footage requires fine-tuning and polishing through video editing. This phase can totally transform the appearance and quality of your video. Video editing allows you to adjust colour balance, add special effects, sound, and text overlays, crop out unnecessary parts, merge clips, and much more.  In conclusion, the journey to producing high-quality videos may seem daunting at first glance, but with careful preparation and the right techniques, you'll be on your way to creating stunning, impactful video content. Remember to exercise creativity - this realm has no hard-set rules. What's outlined in this article are guidelines, the rest is up to your artistic interpretation and your audience's preference."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

St. John Richardson Liddell (September 6, 1815 – February 14, 1870) was a prominent Louisiana planter who served as a general in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. He was an outspoken proponent of Southern emancipation of slaves. Liddell was murdered by a former Confederate Officer near his home in 1870. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"St. John Richardson Liddell wanted to keep slaves locked up\\"?","output":"To analyze whether the conclusion \\"St. John Richardson Liddell wanted to keep slaves locked up\\" is true based on the given paragraph, let's break down the key information in the text: 1. St. John Richardson Liddell was a Louisiana planter and a general in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. 2. He was an outspoken proponent of Southern emancipation of slaves. 3. Liddell was murdered by a former Confederate Officer in 1870. Step 1: Identify the topic of interest, which is St. John Richardson Liddell's stance on slavery. Step 2: Look for information in the paragraph that is directly related to slavery. We find that he was an \\"outspoken proponent of Southern emancipation of slaves.\\" Step 3: Determine if the conclusion aligns with the information provided. The statement \\"St. John Richardson Liddell wanted to keep slaves locked up\\" contradicts the fact that he supported Southern emancipation of slaves. Based on the information provided, we cannot conclude that \\"St. John Richardson Liddell wanted to keep slaves locked up\\"; rather, the paragraph suggests the opposite – that he was a supporter of Southern emancipation of slaves."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

First question: This question is asking for the limit of the function when x gets closer and closer to 0. Imagine a point moving closer and closer to zero along the line. To find this limit, we can use something called L'Hôpital's Rule. After applying this rule twice, we find that the answer to this question is 1/2.

Here is a question about this article: In the early stages of the First Punic War (264 BC) the first known Roman gladiatorial munus was held, described as a funeral blood-rite to the manes of a Roman military aristocrat. The gladiator munus was never explicitly acknowledged as a human sacrifice, probably because death was not its inevitable outcome or purpose. Even so, the gladiators swore their lives to the infernal gods, and the combat was dedicated as an offering to the di manes or other gods. The event was therefore a sacrificium in the strict sense of the term, and Christian writers later condemned it as human sacrifice.

This article: Makeba married Carmichael in March 1968; this caused her popularity in the US to decline markedly. Conservatives came to regard her as a militant and an extremist, an image which alienated much of her fanbase. Her performances were cancelled and her coverage in the press declined despite her efforts to portray her marriage as apolitical. White American audiences stopped supporting her, and the US government took an interest in her activities. The Central Intelligence Agency began following her, and placed hidden microphones in her apartment; the Federal Bureau of Investigation also placed her under surveillance. While she and her husband were travelling in the Bahamas, she was banned from returning to the US, and was refused a visa. As a result, the couple moved to Guinea, where Carmichael changed his name to Kwame Touré. Makeba did not return to the US until 1987.Guinea remained Makeba's home for the next 15 years, and she and her husband became close to President Ahmed Sékou Touré and his wife, Andrée. Touré wanted to create a new style of African music, and all musicians received a minimum wage if they practised for several hours every day. Makeba later stated that \\"I've never seen a country that did what Sékou Touré did for artists.\\" After her rejection from the US she began to write music more directly critical of the US government's racial policies, recording and singing songs such as \\"Lumumba\\" in 1970, (referring to Patrice Lumumba, the assassinated Prime Minister of the Congo), and \\"Malcolm X\\" in 1974. contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person whose popularity declined markedly in the US after her marriage?, what is it ?","output":"The name of the person whose popularity declined markedly in the US after her marriage is Makeba."},{"instruction":"Q:Given the following passage  \\"Since the Carnation Revolution of 1974, which culminated in the end of one of Portugal's most notable phases of economic expansion (that started in the 1960s), a significant change has occurred in the nation's annual economic growth.[citation needed] After the turmoil of the 1974 revolution and the PREC period, Portugal tried to adapt to a changing modern global economy, a process that continues in 2013.

Barcelona face Arsenal in the Champions League on Tuesday. Luis Enrique's side go into the first leg of the last-16 tie at the Emirates unbeaten in 32 league and cup games and aiming for unprecedented back-to-back Champions League titles. Spain's top two teams - Barca and Real - previously negotiated their own TV deals, but have now been stopped from doing so under a new Spanish law. It means new rules will see rights to show La Liga pooled and sold collectively, bringing it more in line with the Premier League - which will see the bottom club still earn £99m next season. He added: \\"The Premier League is the best football competition. It has the most interest for fans and most revenues. They are doing things good and keeping teams in the competition where everyone being equal is of interest for everybody. \\"We have different budgets in Spain and it would be difficult for someone like [current Premier League leaders] Leicester to be top of the league. \\"Our rivals are the Premier League, they are the big adversaries. We have to do our best to increase our revenues and our financial situation to make the talent of our teams stay with us. \\"That is why I am so worried and we are working on this. We want to keep the talent at home. \\"I know our players are in touch with other clubs, it's normal. None of our players said they want to leave. Most get better economical offers, but our players are not in Barcelona for the money, they are there because of the football and the fans' commitment.\\" This summer, ex-Barcelona boss Pep Guardiola will take over at Manchester City. The Spaniard won 14 trophies in four years at the Nou Camp. City's chief executive officer Ferran Soriano and director of football Txiki Begiristain both previously worked at Barcelona. \\"I don't think City are replicating anything,\\" said Bartomeu. \\"Like a lot of clubs in the world, they have a project to make the club grow. \\"Some of their people used to be with us at Barcelona and they are bringing their experience to the club. This is normal because in Europe there is the movement of professionals from one to another. \\"Pep will do well at any club, he is a very good coach and did a fantastic job at Barcelona. He was in the playing arena for years and I had the privilege of working with him for two years.

Argentine Messi has 27, Brazilian Neymar 23 and Uruguayan Suarez has notched 41. Barcelona are currently top of La Liga, eight points clear of Atletico Madrid in second. \\"Right now, we are happy because we have the best players in the world,\\" said Bartomeu. \\"Messi is with us, Neymar is an incredible player of the future but Suarez brought the balance to them. Together, this trident is incredible. \\"The fans of Barcelona have never seen players do this: how they enjoy playing, the friendship they have between them and the locker room.

Real's 577m euros earnings (£439m) put Barcelona into second place with 560.8m euros (£426m), with Manchester United in third on 519.5m euros (£395m). But Bartomeu said his goal is to reach 1,000m euros (£780m) annual revenue to \\"develop our club and make it bigger\\". He said that in the next 12 months, Barcelona may decide to have \\"title rights holders\\" for the Nou Camp to help raise 420m euros (£327m) to refurbish the famous stadium and increase its 99,750 capacity. Bartomeu said there \\"may be controversy\\", but that all key decisions \\"would be voted on\\". One off-field issue which has led to speculation that Barcelona's top stars will leave Spain is problems with tax. Defender Javier Mascherano is expected to avoid jail despite admitting tax fraud, while fellow Argentina international and world player of the year Messi faces trial alongside his father in the summer over tax fraud charges. Team-mate Neymar has denied any connection with allegations of corruption and fraud surrounding his transfer to Barcelona. In a separate tax fraud case in his native Brazil, the striker has had 50m (£34.5m) of assets frozen by a court.

He claimed most of the players in Spain had been \\"in tax review\\" in the last few years and had paid extra taxes, but argued it was the \\"responsibility of their tax advisors if they do things correctly or incorrectly\\". Barcelona won their fifth Champions League crown last season, but what would happen if they didn't qualify for the competition one season? \\"Sometimes, for the interest of football, why not give wildcards like in tennis,\\" says Bartomeu. \\"Sometimes the top players don't qualify and are given wildcards for the interest.

After his accession to the throne in 1820, King George IV continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small, comfortable home. While the work was in progress, in 1826, the King decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect John Nash. Some furnishings were transferred from Carlton House, and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution. The external façade was designed keeping in mind the French neo-classical influence preferred by George IV. The cost of the renovations grew dramatically, and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash's designs resulted in his removal as architect. On the death of George IV in 1830, his younger brother King William IV hired Edward Blore to finish the work.

You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task. Given the prompt and a response, classify the them to \\"yes\\" if response is \\"yes, and\\" type. Otherwise classify it as \\"no\\". \\"Yes, and\\" is a rule-of-thumb in improvisational comedy that suggests that a participant in a dialogue should accept what another participant has stated (\\"Yes\\") and then expand on that line of thought or context (\\"and...\\"). 1 In short, a \\"Yes, and\\" is a dialogue exchange in which a speaker responds by adding new information on top of the information/setting that was constructed by another speaker. Note that a \\"Yes, and\\" does not require someone explicitly saying 'yes, and...' as part of a dialogue exchange, although it could be the case if it agrees with the description above. There are many ways in which a response could implicitly/explicitly agree to the prompt without specifically saying 'yes, and...'.  Prompt: I mean, I don't want to brag, but I know a lot about cars.  That's my passion; that's my love right there, and you've got a beautiful Passat.   Response: Yeah, it's not easy to get out of here. It is hard as hell. Output:","output":"Part #1: Definition of a \\"Yes, and\\" response. Usage: A \\"Yes, and\\" response should accept the information given in the prompt and then build upon it with additional information or context. The response does not have to explicitly say \\"Yes, and,\\" but it should align with the general principle. Example: Prompt: I mean, I don't want to brag, but I know a lot about cars.  That's my passion; that's my love right there, and you've got a beautiful Passat. Response: Thanks! I actually got it customized last week to have some additional features. Do you have any recommendations for maintenance?  Explanation: The response acknowledges the prompt by thanking the speaker, and then adds new information about the car (customization) and asks a question about maintenance, which builds on the shared topic of cars. Part #2: Definition of a \\"No\\" response. Usage: A \\"No\\" response is one that does not accept or build upon the information in the prompt. It could be a response that ignores the context, contradicts the statement, or does not add any new information on the presented topic. Example: Prompt: I mean, I don't want to brag, but I know a lot about cars.  That's my passion; that's my love right there, and you've got a beautiful Passat. Response: Yeah, it's not easy to get out of here. It is hard as hell. Explanation: The response does not address the topic of cars, the speaker's passion, or the compliment about the Passat. Instead, it offers a separate statement about difficulty in getting out of a place, not building on the provided context. Thus, it is classified as a \\"No\\" response."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

Manowar is an American heavy metal band from Auburn, New York. Formed in 1980, the group is known for lyrics based on fantasy (particularly sword and sorcery) and mythology (particularly Norse mythology and Greco-Roman mythology). The band is also known for a loud and bombastic sound. In an interview for MTV in February 2007, bassist Joey DeMaio lamented that \\"these days, there's a real lack of big, epic metal that is drenched with crushing guitars and choirs and orchestras... By 1983, the band left Liberty Records and struck a deal with Megaforce Records in the US and Music for Nations in Europe--signing the contract in their own blood. The signing was a cover story in the 1983 July-August issue No. 47 of Kerrang!.  When Manowar returned home, they immediately went into a recording studio to produce what, in the intentions of the group, would have been a simple EP, but came out instead, due to the quantity and quality of the tracks made in that period, as the band's second album, Into Glory Ride. An EP was actually published in 1983 with the title Defender containing, as its main track, the eponymous song, which included more work by Orson Welles. The atmosphere of the album evoked classical heroic fantasy and mythology, and served as a predecessor to Viking metal. It contained several innovative features, both in style and sound, and led to a huge increase in the number of fans of the group, particularly in the United Kingdom, where the band planned a long tour that was ultimately canceled. The song \\"Defender\\" was later re-recorded and included in the Fighting the World album of 1987.  To apologize for the failure of their UK tour, Manowar decided to dedicate their next album to the United Kingdom. The album, Hail to England, was recorded and mixed in just six days and was released in early 1984. Its promotional tour, \\"Spectacle of Might\\", had a large number of dates in England. The tour saw Manowar initially as support band for Mercyful Fate, but soon the group led by DeMaio was put in the headline slot.  Manowar soon returned to work in the recording studio. After leaving Music for Nations, the quartet released Sign of the Hammer ten months after their previous album. The new record presented stark changes in rhythm, with very technical tracks characterized by a slow pace, like the epic \\"Mountains\\", and quick ones, as the eponymous \\"Sign of the Hammer\\". Its success enabled band to embark on a two-year world tour, after which they took 1986 off.  Following further disagreements with their new label, the group changed record label to Atlantic Records in 1987. Via Atlantic, they released Fighting the World, which enjoyed more extensive distribution and increased the band's prominence in the international heavy metal scene. Album art was designed by Ken Kelly.

Most researchers believe that the HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century. HIV is transmitted by sexual contact and by contact with infected bodily fluids, such as blood, semen, breast milk, and vaginal secretions. It is also passed from mother to fetus. HIV is now a pandemic , with an estimated (as of 2008) 38.6 million people now living with the disease worldwide.

Problem:['7749', 'b', '6537', '6253', '7763', '629', '5375', 'V', '2703'] Solution:","output":"Part #1: Understand the given input list A. Usage: The list given as input is ['7749', 'b', '6537', '6253', '7763', '629', '5375', 'V', '2703']. This list contains a mix of elements in the form of alphabets and numbers presented as strings. This part requires understating the structure of this list. It has numbers and alphabets arranged in no particular order. Part #2: Identifying the elements of the list that are alphabets. Usage: In the given input list ['7749', 'b', '6537', '6253', '7763', '629', '5375', 'V', '2703'], the alphabets are 'b' and 'V'. This task involves filtering out the alphabetic elements and ignoring the numeric ones. Part #3: Retaining the same order in which alphabets appear in List A. Usage: In the given list, the alphabet 'b' appears before 'V'. So, in the output list also, 'b' should appear before 'V'. Here the requirement is to maintain the same order of alphabet elements as they appear in the input. Part #4: Do not change their case/capitalization. Usage: 'b' is in lower case and 'V' is in upper case in the input list, so the same should be reflected in the output. The output must retain the same case for the alphabetic elements as they were in the input, i.e., 'b' remains in lower case and 'V' in upper case. So applying these parts to the problem, the solution will be to filter out 'b' and 'V' from the input and present them in the same order and capitalization as they appeared, which results in ['b', 'V']."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Ever thought of moving to a new country? How about starting a new country? Patri Friedman is planning to do just that. He left Google years ago to set up the Seasteading Institute. And his dream is to build seasteads-----floating micro-nations in the middle of the ocean. So, what will life on a seastead be like? Probably a bit like life on a cruise liner  , but much larger, with shops, gyms, swimming pools, schools and other areas. In fact, the early seasteads may actually be specially-rebuilt cruise liners. But as science advances, Friedman believes they'll become more like floating cities, with several hundred people. Seasteading raises a lot of questions. First of all, how will the new countries make money? The Seasteading Institute has suggested several money-making ideas, including ocean-based theme parks, casinos   and fish farming. There's also the questions of safety. With storms, typhoons and pirates   , the high seas are a dangerous place. However, the Institute says that it can stand bad weather and prevent crimes with its well-designed systems. So, is this just a day dream? Well, maybe not. One of the people behind the project is Peter Thiel. He founded PayPal and was one of the first investors   in Facebook. So far, he's donated  500,000 to the project. And Friedman isn't wasting any time. He recently announced the creation of the Poseidon Award. This will be given to the first seastead with fifty people. Friedman is hoping to hand out the award in 2015. Question: Which of the following can be the best titles of this passage? Options: A: Seasteading: a new idea of living B: Seasteading: a wild way of farming C: Peter Thiel: a man behind the project D: Patri Friedman: a crazy day dreamer The answer is:","output":"A: Seasteading: a new idea of living.  This title encapsulates the overarching idea presented in the article. The main concept discussed was the concept of seasteading, which is creating floating micro-nations in the middle of the ocean as a new way of living. It is focused on the vision of Patri Friedman, the founder of the Seasteading Institute, who dreams of establishing seasteads as bustling microcosms of life with accommodations like shops, gyms, swimming pools, and schools. The title also connects to other aspects touched on in the article like the issues of finance, safety and infrastructure of these new sea-based communities. Option B: \\"Seasteading: a wild way of farming\\" misrepresents the main theme of the article. While fish farming was mentioned as a potential source of income for these floating utopias, it was not the key focus of the article and doesn't capture the main idea of creating an entirely new societal structure on the ocean. Option C: \\"Peter Thiel: a man behind the project\\", while not necessarily incorrect, is too narrow. Peter Thiel's role as a financial supporter of the Seasteading Institute and its projects is important, but the text mostly emphasizes on the ideas and goals of Patri Friedman, the founder. The article provides more coverage to the broader concept of seasteading rather than just focusing on Peter Thiel's involvement. Option D: \\"Patri Friedman: a crazy day dreamer\\" although it includes Patri Friedman, it negatively characterizes him and the seasteading idea as a crazy day dream, which undermines the serious planning, investment, and consideration for safety and logistics detailed throughout the article. Thus, it doesn't convey the full scope of the article's content.  Hence, by covering the main theme and content of the article without reducing or misrepresenting any of it, Option A: \\"Seasteading: a new idea of living\\" can stand as the most appropriate title for this passage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Guatemala's government has declared a state of siege and sent hundreds of troops to a northern province where officials say a Mexican drug gang is overtaking towns and threatening residents. President Alvaro Colom announced the 30-day emergency rule in Alta Verapaz on Sunday. The rule allows the military to order anyone suspected of conspiring against the government to be arrested and imprisoned without a warrant, the state-run AGN news agency said. \\"Starting today, combined forces will retake the streets of Alta Verapaz,\\" a government statement released Sunday morning said. Government data shows cells of the drug gang known as Los Zetas are in the area to protect drug trafficking paths between Honduras and Mexico, \\"intimidating the population with their heavy weapons and threatening farmers to give up their land for criminal activities,\\" AGN reported. The state of siege also allows the government to place greater restrictions on public gatherings, travel visas and gun licenses, among other things, according to AGN. \\"The population should be calm. What we are doing is not intended to persecute honest, working people,\\" Interior Minister Carlos Menocal told reporters. Menocal said operations in the coming days would aim to boost regional security, regain control of territory, identify criminal gangs and capture their members. In an interview with CNN en Espanol last month, Menocal said his country needed more help from the United States to combat cartels, which were increasingly carving out new drug transport paths. \\"In the end, the large majority of drugs travel through Central America, and the assignment of resources or the financial support of the United States government is not the same as Colombia and Mexico receive,\\" he said.

A crash is heard as someone runs over their flower pot outside. Amina is the exact opposite of what a woman is supposed to be, wearing trousers, a button down shirt, and a worn hat, with her hair down and unkempt. She owns her own cafe, serves blacks and whites in the same area, and stands up to men of all sorts; In short, Amina is by no means typical. She runs her cafe with Jacob (David Dennis), an older black man who is very timid, and very quick to follow the rules. But when two policemen come to threaten the cafe for serving blacks along with whites, he bravely shields Madeleine (Grethe Fox), the white postmistress, from their unrestrained violent behavior. Madeleine thanks Jacob, and the first romance is kindled.Meanwhile, Miriam (Lisa Ray), is a typical Indian housewife having recently emigrated from India. She performs her duty of caring for her two children, and one on the way, while also taking dismissive comments and abusive tendencies from men, including her husband Omar (Parvin Dabas).

Show that we can select two disjoint subsets of these numbers such that their sums are the same.","output":"1. **Calculate the range of possible sums:**    The smallest possible sum is 1 (if we chose the number 1).        The largest possible sum is the sum of the largest ten numbers between 1 and 100:    [    100 + 99 + 98 + cdots + 91    ]    We calculate this sum as follows:    [    S = sum_{k=91}^{100} k = 91 + 92 + 93 + cdots + 100    ]    Using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series ( S = frac{n}{2} (a + l) ), where ( n ) is the number of terms, ( a ) is the first term, and ( l ) is the last term:    [    S = frac{10}{2} (91 + 100) = 5 times 191 = 955    ]    Thus, the possible sums range from 1 to 955. 2. **Determine the number of ways to make sums:**    With 10 numbers, each number can either be included in a subset or not, so there are ( 2^{10} ) possible ways to form such subsets.    [    2^{10} = 1024    ] 3. **Apply the pigeonhole principle:**    The pigeonhole principle states that if ( n ) items are put into ( m ) containers and ( n > m ), then at least one container must contain more than one item.        Here, we have 1024 different possible configurations of sums (subsets for which we compute sums), and the range of possible distinct sums is from 1 to 955, which gives us 955 distinct sums.        Since ( 1024 > 955 ), by the pigeonhole principle, at least two of these 1024 subsets must have the same sum.     4. **Form disjoint subsets:**    Suppose we identify two subsets ( A ) and ( B ) that have the same sum:    [    sum_{a in A} a = sum_{b in B} b    ]        To form two disjoint subsets with the same sum, consider the intersection ( A cap B ). By subtracting this intersection from both subsets, we obtain two disjoint sublists ( A' = A - (A cap B) ) and ( B' = B - (A cap B) ) which will still satisfy the equal sum condition, given that:    [    sum_{a in A'} a = sum_{b in B'} b    ]    since the elements accounted for in ( A cap B ) are removed from both sums equally. # Conclusion: Hence, we construct two disjoint subsets with an equal sum, confirming that such subsets always exist.

Hence, the answer is: boxed{frac{30}{97}}. By simplifying frac{a-b}{a^{2}+b^{2}} = frac{a-b}{(a-b)^{2}+2ab} = frac{1}{(a-b)+ frac{2}{a-b}} and determining the range of a-b, we find the maximum value of frac{a-b}{a^{2}+b^{2}}. This problem tests the application of basic inequalities.

To get the minimum of ( left(k^2 - frac{1991}{2}right)^2 ), we need to minimize ( |k^2 - frac{1991}{2}| ).

Since the 300th term in a less restricted sequence might be around 300, let's consider squares up to higher numbers to ensure we encompass all necessary omissions. Squares up to 30^2 = 900 should be more than sufficient for the initial estimate. **Step 2: Count multiples of 3 up to the same limit** Similarly, count multiples of 3 up to 900. **Step 3: Remove overlap (numbers that are both)** We should also subtract the numbers that are both perfect squares and multiples of 3, such as 3^2, 6^2, 9^2, dots, 27^2 since each of these squares is also a multiple of 3. Calculation: - Perfect squares ≤ 900: 30 (from 1^2 to 30^2) - Multiples of 3 ≤ 900: frac{900}{3} = 300 - Overlapping numbers (perfect squares that are multiples of 3): 3^2, 6^2, 9^2, 12^2, 15^2, 18^2, 21^2, 24^2, 27^2, which are 9, 36, 81, 144, 225, 324, 441, 576, 729 respectively or 9 numbers.

Each step further enforces the issue with the pinwheel arrangement and causes conflicts in square placements, ultimately making the configuration impossible.    - **Case for 2 times 2 neighboring 1 times 1:**      - If a 2 times 2 square is placed next to a 1 times 1, the remaining spaces further escalate the conflict through subsequent placements of larger squares (Figure 3), leading to unsatisfiable space filler issues.    - **Alternate arrangement for 1 times 1:**      - The 1 times 1 must be surrounded by alternating 3 times 3 and 4 times 4 (Figure 4), which leads to contradictions in filling the surrounding space as we try to keep the pinwheel-like placements unharmed.

Since the function opens downward and has an axis of symmetry at n = 2, the function reaches its maximum value at n = 2. 5.

Knowing that the parity (even or odd nature) of any number is different from the parity of its immediate neighbors helps us to analyze the problem better. 2. **Evaluating Parity Conditions:**    We first demonstrate that in any block of four consecutive numbers, there are exactly two even numbers and two odd numbers. Let's consider any arbitrary block of four numbers. If it were not the case, implying there are three numbers of the same parity (either all even or all odd), we run into a contradiction since:    - Suppose there are three odd numbers in the block, say positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 are filled as (OOOE) (O stands for odd and E stands for even). Then the 4th number must be even.    - The 2nd odd number would have both neighbors as odd, violating the given condition (since neighbors must be of different parity).    Thus, there cannot be three numbers with the same parity in any block of four consecutive numbers. 3. **Parity Distribution Over the Entire Range:**    Let's break the range from 2 to 2021 into blocks of four numbers. If we apply the proved thought, each block satisfying (2 E : 2 O) distribution hints that moving through the blocks ensures equal evens and odds throughout the range. 4. **Odd and Even Number Distribution in Full Range:**    However, counting the total numbers from 1 to 2021:        ( frac{{2021 + 1}}{2} = 1011 text{odd numbers} )    and    ( frac{{2020}}{2} = 1010 text{even numbers} ).    It is clear that there is one more odd number than even numbers in the full list from 1 to 2021, necessitating that the first number in the sequence must be an odd number in order to maintain the alternating parity sequence throughout. 5. **Arrangement to Satisfy Problem’s Condition:**    Given the ordering ( N CCEC CCNE , ldots  CCEN ), where ( N ) is an odd number, ( C )-even, ( E)-even numbers, illustrates one manual check ensuring the parity of any first, middle, and last number in a sequence, confirming how an odd number suitably fits the condition.    This schema confirms that putting any odd number ( N ) at the first position ensures compliance with the condition set by the problem. # Conclusion: Therefore, the number that can appear in the first position is any odd number.

The sum of the interior angles of the convex 1000-gon itself (with 1000 vertices) is calculated by the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon, which is:    [    (1000 - 2) times 180^circ = 998 times 180^circ    ]    This sum comes solely from the angles at the 1000 vertices of the polygon. 3. Besides the original vertices of the 1000-gon, we have 500 additional points, which contribute to the formation of the triangles.

Can the gears in such a system rotate?","output":"1. Let's consider the properties of rotational motion in a system with ( n ) identical gears arranged in a plane such that each gear is meshed with its adjacent gears, forming a closed loop. 2. When two adjacent gears mesh together, they rotate in opposite directions. For instance, if the first gear rotates clockwise, the second gear must rotate counterclockwise to mesh correctly. 3. To visualize this, consider labeling the gears in the chain from 1 through ( n ). If gear 1 rotates clockwise, then gear 2 will rotate counterclockwise, gear 3 will rotate clockwise, and so on. Generally, if gear ( i ) rotates clockwise, then gear ( i+1 ) must rotate counterclockwise, and vice versa. 4. This alternating pattern of rotational directions continues for all ( n ) gears in the system. Mathematically, if we denote a clockwise rotation by ( C ) and a counterclockwise rotation by ( CC ), then the sequence of rotations can be represented as ( C, CC, C, CC, ldots ). 5. Now, consider the closed-loop configuration where gear ( n ) is also meshed with gear 1. For meshing to occur properly, the rotational direction of gear ( n ) must be opposite to that of gear 1. 6. Let's analyze the parity of ( n ):    - If ( n ) is an even number, gear ( n ) will have the same rotational direction as gear 1. Specifically, if gears follow the sequence ( C, CC, C, CC, ldots, C ) for even ( n ), the last gear ( n ) will rotate clockwise if gear 1 also rotates clockwise.    - If ( n ) is an odd number, gear ( n ) will end up rotating in the same direction as gear 1, which leads to a contradiction because they are meshed together and must rotate in opposite directions. 7. Therefore, the system of gears can only function without contradiction if ( n ) is even. This ensures that the first gear and the last gear have opposite rotational directions, satisfying the meshing conditions. # Conclusion: Thus, the gears in such a system can rotate if and only if the number of gears ( n ) is even.

Let's consider another function gleft(xright) defined as the difference between fleft(xright) and x^{2}: gleft(xright) = fleft(xright) - x^{2} = 1 + 2ln x - x^{2}. To understand the behavior of gleft(xright), we take its derivative:  begin{align*} {g'}left(xright) &= frac{d}{dx} (1 + 2ln x - x^{2})  &= frac{2}{x} - 2x  &= frac{2 - 2x^{2}}{x}. end{align*}  Observing the derivative {g'}left(xright): - For x in (0,1), since 2 - 2x^{2} > 0, we have {g'}left(xright) > 0, indicating that gleft(xright) is monotonically increasing in the interval (0,1). - For x in (1,+infty), since 2 - 2x^{2} < 0, we have {g'}left(xright) < 0, indicating that gleft(xright) is monotonically decreasing in the interval (1,+infty).

Taking the derivative of hleft(xright), we get:  begin{align*} {h'}left(xright) &= frac{d}{dx} (2ln x - 2x + 1 - c)  &= frac{2}{x} - 2. end{align*}  Evaluating the derivative {h'}left(xright): - For 0 < x < 1, {h'}left(xright) > 0, indicating hleft(xright) is monotonically increasing in (0,1). - For x > 1, {h'}left(xright) < 0, indicating hleft(xright) is monotonically decreasing in (1,+infty). Therefore, hleft(xright) reaches its maximum at x=1, and we calculate this maximum value as:  begin{align*} hleft(1right) &= 2ln 1 - 2cdot 1 + 1 - c  &= 0 - 2 + 1 - c  &= -1 - c. end{align*}  For the inequality fleft(xright) leqslant 2x + c to hold, the maximum value of hleft(xright) must be less than or equal to 0.

The balanced chemical equation is: CaCO3 + 2HCl → CaCl2 + H2O + CO2 From the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of CaCO3 reacts with 2 moles of HCl to produce 1 mole of CaCl2. Given that we have 3 moles of CaCO3 reacting, we can set up a ratio based on the stoichiometry of the reaction: (1 mole CaCl2 / 1 mole CaCO3) = x moles CaCl2 / 3 moles CaCO3 Solving for x gives us: x moles CaCl2 = (1 mole CaCl2 / 1 mole CaCO3) * 3 moles CaCO3 x moles CaCl2 = 3 moles CaCl2 However, we must also consider the amount of HCl present. We have 6 moles of HCl, and according to the balanced equation, 2 moles of HCl are required to react with 1 mole of CaCO3.

When all p persons are present, each person has to do W/p amount of work. Now, let's say a fraction x of the members are absent. This means that the number of persons present is p - xp = p(1 - x). Since the total amount of work W remains the same, the work that each present person has to do increases. According to the problem, the work increased for each person is 20%. This means that each person now has to do 120% of the work they would normally do if all members were present. So, the new amount of work for each person is (W/p) * 1.2. Since the number of persons present is p(1 - x), the total work divided by the number of present persons is W / [p(1 - x)]. Setting these two expressions for the new amount of work equal to each other, we get: (W/p) * 1.2 = W / [p(1 - x)] Now, we can solve for x: 1.2 = 1 / (1 - x) 1.2(1 - x) = 1 1.2 - 1.2x = 1 1.2x = 1.2 - 1 1.2x = 0.2 x = 0.2 / 1.2 x = 1/6 So, the fraction of members that are absent is boxed{1/6} ."},{"instruction":"w many integers N less than 2000 can be written as the sum of j consecutive positive integers (not necessarily odd) from exactly 4 values of jge 1?","output":"Let the first integer in the sequence be k (where kgeq 1), and let there be j consecutive integers. The last integer is k+j-1. These numbers form an arithmetic sequence, so sum N can be represented by N = jleft(frac{k + (k+j-1)}{2}right) = frac{j(2k+j-1)}{2}. Since N must be an integer, 2k+j - 1 also needs to be divisible by 2, indicating 2k+j-1 is even. Thus, j must be odd for N to be integer. For N to have exactly 4 possible values of j, N needs to have exactly 8 factors (since each j corresponds to a pair of factors). Thus, N could be of the form p^7, p^3q, or pqr. Considering only N < 2000, let's inspect possible forms: 1. p^7: The only primes possible are 2^7 = 128 and 3^7 = 2187 (too large). 2. p^3q: Plausible cases are 2^3 cdot 5 = 40 or 2^3 cdot 7 = 56 (and other similar small primes). 3. pqr: Combining small primes like 2, 3, 5 yields values like 2 cdot 3 cdot 5 = 30, 2 cdot 3 cdot 7 = 42 etc. The above cases need to be checked if they can form exactly 4 valid sequences, considering that j must be odd.  For example, checking N = 40: - Possible j = 1, 5, 8, 10. All are valid since each provides an integer k from frac{j(2k+j-1)}{2} = 40. Doing similar checks for other potential N values will yield the total number of integers satisfying the condition. Conclusion: If we verify each potential N following the outlined process and find those that successfully result in exactly 4 sequences, we note these cases.

In order for this to occur, the discriminant of the quadratic expression must be negative, so that the parabola does not cross the x-axis. Let's calculate the discriminant Delta: Delta = m^2 - 4m. The discriminant must be less than zero: Delta < 0, m^2 - 4m < 0. To solve this inequality, we factor out m: m(m - 4) < 0. For the product of two factors to be negative, one of the factors must be positive, and the other must be negative. We can interpret this by considering the intervals in which each factor changes sign: - The first factor m is positive for m > 0 and negative for m < 0. - The second factor (m - 4) is positive for m > 4 and negative for m < 4. Given this, the inequality m(m - 4) < 0 is satisfied in the interval where m > 0 but m < 4. Therefore, the range of values for m is (0, 4).

Since each milkshake requires 4 ounces of milk, we can find out how many milkshakes he made by dividing the total amount of milk used by the amount of milk per milkshake: 64 ounces of milk used ÷ 4 ounces of milk per milkshake = 16 milkshakes. Now that we know Blake made 16 milkshakes, we can calculate how much ice cream he used in total.

Now, let's calculate g(x_{0}): g(x_{0})=1+ frac {1}{2}sin 2x_{0}=1+ frac {1}{2}sin (kπ- frac {π}{6}). If k is even, then g(x_{0})=1+ frac {1}{2}sin (- frac {π}{6})=boxed{frac {3}{4}}. If k is odd, then g(x_{0})=1+ frac {1}{2}sin frac {π}{6}=boxed{frac {5}{4}}.

Since h'(x) is a linear combination of sine and cosine functions, it is strictly positive when their arguments lie in specific intervals.

The line XS is the angle bisector of angle AXB. Therefore, XS also bisects angle GXE. 5. By the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:    [    frac{CD}{AB} = frac{XG}{XE} = frac{GS}{SE}    ] 6. Similarly, the line YT is the angle bisector of angle AYD. Therefore, YT bisects angle FYH. 7. By the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:    [    frac{BC}{AD} = frac{YF}{YH} = frac{FT}{TH}    ] 8. Given that frac{CD}{AB} = frac{BC}{AD}, we can equate the ratios:    [    frac{GS}{SE} = frac{FT}{TH}    ] 9.

Substituting x=1 into these conditions, we get: 1. f'(1) = 3(1)^{2} - 2a(1) - b = 3 - 2a - b = 0 2. f(1) = (1)^{3} - a(1)^{2} - b(1) + a^{2} = 1 - a - b + a^{2} = 10 Solving the system of equations left{begin{array}{l}3 - 2a - b = 0 1 - a - b + a^{2} = 10end{array}right., we find two sets of solutions: - For the first set: left{begin{array}{l}a=3 b=-3end{array}right. - For the second set: left{begin{array}{l}a=-4 b=11end{array}right.

This indicates that f(x) is monotonically increasing on (-infty, -frac{11}{3}) and (1, +infty), and monotonically decreasing on (-frac{11}{3}, 1). Therefore, f(x) has a local minimum at x=1, which satisfies the condition of the problem.

This is analogous to lining them up in a row, which can be done in 5! ways but since the table is round, we account for circular permutations (i.e., only rotating positions count as different), reducing the permutations by a factor of 5 to (5-1)! = 4! = 24.

This can be calculated by finding the number of ways to pick consecutive seats among a circular arrangement.  There are 12 distinct sets of consecutive seats for the five math majors (since after choosing a starting point, the next four seats are fixed), and each set identifies a unique arrangement.

The ball is dropped from a 16-meter platform. 2. It bounces back up to half the height from which it fell each time. We can set up a series to represent the distance the ball travels with each bounce: First drop: 16 meters (down) First bounce: 16/2 = 8 meters (up) Second drop: 8 meters (down) Second bounce: 8/2 = 4 meters (up) Third drop: 4 meters (down) Third bounce: 4/2 = 2 meters (up) Fourth drop: 2 meters (down) Fourth bounce: 2/2 = 1 meter (up) ... and so on. The total distance traveled by the ball is the sum of all these distances. We can see that the series is a geometric series with the first term a = 16 (the first drop) and the common ratio r = 1/2 (because each bounce is half the height of the previous drop). The sum of an infinite geometric series can be calculated using the formula: S = a / (1 - r) However, in this case, we are not looking for an infinite sum because the engineer catches the ball after it has traveled 45 meters. So we need to find the finite sum of the series up to the point where the total distance is 45 meters. Let's calculate the total distance traveled after each complete bounce (up and down): After 1st bounce: 16 (down) + 8 (up) = 24 meters After 2nd bounce: 24 + 8 (down) + 4 (up) = 36 meters After 3rd bounce: 36 + 4 (down) + 2 (up) = 42 meters After 4th bounce: 42 + 2 (down) + 1 (up) = 45 meters So, after the fourth bounce, the ball has traveled exactly 45 meters, which is when the engineer catches it.

That means Nia's time is 2 * 13.5 = 27 hours. 5. Eliza takes 1/5 times less time to complete the marathon than Dean. So, Eliza's time is Dean's time minus 1/5 of Dean's time. That is 9 - (1/5 * 9) = 9 - 1.8 = 7.2 hours. Now, let's calculate the average time taken by all five runners: Average time = (Dean's time + Micah's time + Jake's time + Nia's time + Eliza's time) / 5 Average time = (9 + 13.5 + 18 + 27 + 7.2) / 5 Average time = (75.7) / 5 Average time = 15.14 hours The average time taken by all five runners to complete the marathon is boxed{15.14}  hours."},{"instruction":"Tickets for a play at the community theater cost 12 dollars for an adult and 4 dollars for a child.

(blacksquare) 3. **Claim 2: Tiling a ( 2^m times x ) Dented Rectangle:**    - If we have the correct sized blocks for a ( 2^m times x ) dented rectangle ( R ), there must be a sequence of parallel ( 2^m times -- ) vertical blocks starting from the leftmost edge.    - **Proof:**      - Similar logic to Claim 1 shows that the largest block must be a ( 2^m times -- ) block somewhere in the middle of ( R ).      - This splits ( R ) into a rectangle on the left and a dented rectangle on the right.      - The left rectangle must tile with vertical strips by Claim 1, proving the claim. (blacksquare) 4. **Key Claim: Full Tiling Classification:**    - There is a sequence of red vertical ( 2^m times -- ) tiles for some distance, then a sequence of blue horizontal ( -- times 2^n ) tiles from the bottom up to some distance, then a sequence of maximally vertical red tiles from the left to some distance, and so on.    - **Proof:**      - By Claim 2, there must be a sequence of ( 2^m times -- ) red rectangles starting from the left edge.      - Consider the maximal sequence of these ( 2^m times -- ) tiles, and chop them off.      - We are left with a ( 2^m times x ) dented rectangle for some ( x ).      - Since the sequence was maximal, there cannot be another ( 2^m times -- ) tile on the leftmost edge.      - Hence by Claim 2, ( x ) must be a power of 2, say ( x = 2^k ).      - Rotate by ( 90^circ ) and we now have a ( 2^k times 2^m ) dented rectangle, and finish by induction. (blacksquare) 5. **Counting the Number of Ways:**    - Suppose we have placed ( k ) tiles in the ( 2^m times 2^n ) dented rectangle in the order mentioned in the Key Claim.    - We will show that there are at most ( m+n-k ) choices for the next block.    - Say the non-tiled dented rectangle in the top right is ( x times y ). At least one of ( x, y ) must be a power of 2.    - Suppose only one is, say ( x ). Then by Claim 2, the next rectangle in the order must be placed as an ( x times -- ) rectangle on the left edge.    - Its location is fixed, and there are ( m+n-k ) blocks left, so there are at most ( m+n-k ) options.    - If ( x ) and ( y ) are powers of 2, then the area left is ( A = xy - 1 ), which is 1 less than a power of 2.    - So ( A = 2^0 + cdots + 2^ell ) for some ( ell ). Then there are ( ell+1 ) blocks used, so ( ell = m+n-k-1 ), and hence ( xy = 2^{m+n-k} ).    - If the block is horizontal, then the height must be a power of 2, so there are at most ( log_2 x ) options.    - Similarly, if it's vertical, there are ( log_2 y ) options for the block.    - In total, there are at most:      [      log_2 x + log_2 y = log_2 (xy) = m+n-k      ]      options, as claimed.

The critical points, where f'(x) = 0, are at x = -1 and x = 1.

Let us evaluate f(x) at the critical points: f(-1) = (-1)^3 - 3(-1) + 1 = -1 + 3 + 1 = 3 > 0, f(1) = 1^3 - 3(1) + 1 = 1 - 3 + 1 = -1 < 0.

Among these, 1/4 are roosters. So, the number of roosters can be calculated as: [80 times frac{1}{4} = 20] This means there are 20 roosters. Next, we find out how many hens there are. Since the rest of the chickens are hens, we subtract the number of roosters from the total number of chickens: [80 - 20 = 60] So, there are 60 hens. Out of these hens, only three-fourths lay eggs. The number of hens that lay eggs is: [60 times frac{3}{4} = 45] Therefore, 45 hens lay eggs. To find out how many hens do not lay eggs, we subtract the number of hens that lay eggs from the total number of hens: [60 - 45 = 15] So, 15 hens do not lay eggs.

Each point in ( P ) can be associated with the sets ( P_i ) that contain it. Since there are 100 sets ( P_i ) and each set ( P_i ) has at least 20 points, the total number of incidences (point-set pairs) is at least:    [    100 times 20 = 2000    ]    Since there are only 200 points in ( P ), by the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least one point in ( P ) that is contained in at least:    [    frac{2000}{200} = 10    ]    sets ( P_i ). 6. **Conclusion:**    Therefore, there exists a point in ( P ) which meets at least 10 sets among all ( P_i ).

We have two cases to analyze:     - **Case 1**: If (0 leq alpha + beta < 1):         [         lfloor 2 alpha rfloor + lfloor 2 beta rfloor ]          As (lfloor alpha rfloor + lfloor beta rfloor = 0) and (lfloor alpha + beta rfloor = 0), we have:         [         lfloor 2 alpha rfloor + lfloor 2 beta rfloor geq 0 + 0 + 0 implies lfloor 2 alpha rfloor + lfloor 2 beta rfloor geq 0         ]     - **Case 2**: If (1 leq alpha + beta < 2):         - Then (lfloor alpha + beta rfloor = 1).         - We need:         [         lfloor 2 alpha rfloor + lfloor 2 beta rfloor geq 1         ]         - Since ( lfloor 2 alpha rfloor ) and ( lfloor 2 beta rfloor ) can either be 0, 1, or 2, the sum will at least be 1 ( Longrightarrow text{inequality holds} ). Hence, the inequality is always satisfied: [ lfloor 2 alpharfloor + lfloor 2 beta rfloor geqslant lfloor alpha rfloor + lfloor beta rfloor + lfloor alpha + beta rfloor ]  Part 2: 1. We want to show that      [     frac{(2m)!(2n)!}{m!n!(m+n)!}      ]     is an integer for all integers (m) and (n). 2. For this to hold, it suffices to show that for any prime number (p):     [     v_p((2m)!(2n)!) geq v_p(m! n! (m+n)!)     ]     where ( v_p(k!) ) represents the exponent of prime (p) in the prime factorization of (k!). 3. Using Legendre's formula:     [     v_p(N!) = sum_{k=1}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{N}{p^k} rightrfloor     ] 4. We must compute the (v_p) values:     [     v_p((2m)!) = sum_{k=1}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{2m}{p^k} rightrfloor      ]     [     v_p((2n)!) = sum_{k=1}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{2n}{p^k} rightrfloor      ]     Thus,     [     v_p((2m)!(2n)!) = sum_{k=1}^{infty} left( leftlfloor frac{2m}{p^k} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{2n}{p^k} rightrfloor right)     ] 5. Similarly, for the right-hand side:     [     v_p(m! n! (m+n)!) = sum_{k=1}^{infty} left( leftlfloor frac{m}{p^k} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{n}{p^k} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{m+n}{p^k} rightrfloor right)     ] 6. Applying the result from Part 1:     [     leftlfloor frac{2m}{p^k} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{2n}{p^k} rightrfloor geq leftlfloor frac{m}{p^k} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{n}{p^k} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{m+n}{p^k} rightrfloor     ] 7. Summing over all (k) gives the desired inequality:     [     v_p((2m)!(2n)!) geq v_p(m! n! (m+n)!)     ] Thus,     [     frac{(2m)!(2n)!}{m!n!(m+n)!}     ]     is an integer.

Paul can dig the well in 24 days, so his work rate is ( frac{1}{24} ) of the well per day.

Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Total Capacity Calculation:**     The total number of students in the school is (920). Each bus has (71) seats, and there are (16) buses. We calculate the total capacity of the buses:     [     text{Total Capacity} = 71 times 16 = 1136 quad text{seats}     ]     Thus, there are enough seats to accommodate all students since (1136 > 920). 2. **Formulation with Constraints:**     We need to ensure that students from each class can sit in one bus.

Following the similar steps:     [     frac{920}{71} = 12.96 quad (approx 13 text{ buses})     ]     We then assign seats in a threaded manner:     - Number the seats consecutively across buses.     - Distribute students such that each class fills succeeding seats.     Every bus can fit approximately four classes of 17:     [     4 times 17 = 68 quad text{students}     ]     Ensuring:     [     text{Max buses required} approx lceil frac{920}{68} rceil = 14 quad text{buses}     ]     Which fits within the available 16 buses. 6. **Conclusion:**    Since at k = 17 there will always be a possibility to correctly allocate students within the available bus capacity:    [    k = 17    ] Thus, the maximum number of students per class that ensures all students from one class can sit in one bus is: [ boxed{17} ]"},{"instruction":"Rebecca wants to split a collection of marbles into groups of a certain size.
