You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: Try convincing yourself of the value of overcoming this fear. Make a list of advantages and disadvantages to spending time alone. Remember to consider the cost of this fear on your relationships, your own passions, and your self-development. For instance, you may decide that you will spend fifteen minutes alone without calling, texting, or messaging anyone, and as long as you need to process those fifteen minutes. This process might take place four times a week.  Make exposure gradual and take into consideration how bad your fear is. This process takes time and should not be rushed. Plan to be alone for short spurts. Little by little, you will want to plan increased amounts of time alone until you don’t feel overcome with panic. Try making an exposure hierarchy in which you rank feared situations on a scale of 0-100 according to how afraid you anticipate being when exposed to it. For example, you may rank spending an hour alone at home at 100, but going to a movie alone a 70. By ranking you can work up to overcoming gradually greater fears only once fear subsides for the less threatening fears. Try exposing yourself to a lower-ranked fear. At first you’ll feel incredibly nervous and anxious, and this is normal. In time, your body will relax. After a few highly uncomfortable attempts, this will be a way to signal to yourself that you are capable of spending time alone. Exposing yourself to your fear will also help you think more deeply about the fears behind the initial panic.  Don't become overly preoccupied with how panicked you feel and how stressed your body becomes. Because you are purposely exposing yourself to something you fear, shallow breathing, increased heart rate, and other physical symptoms of anxiety are normal. The longer the alone time, the greater the anxiety you will feel. But, with exposure, anxiety is expected and will dissipate with time. Gently push your limits until you are happy with how much alone time you can handle. Imagine you are going swimming--dipping your toes in the water can be exciting, but it won't adjust you to the temperature of the water. Another option is FearFighter, a computerized program of self-help methods that treat phobias.It is endorsed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and proven effective. Because exposure can be so stressful, you may want a reliable way to distract yourself in the moment. Try reciting a few lines of a poem to yourself, doing arithmetic in your head, or whispering encouraging phrases to yourself, like \\"this feeling will pass, I have handled it before\\". Remember, the less often you use your crutch, the more intensive the exposure sessions will be. During and after your exposure sessions, record your level of fear on a scale from 0 to 10. 0 is fully relaxed and 10 is as fearful as you can imagine being. Doing this will show you how desensitized you have become to being alone and how much fear you were safely able to handle.  Note trends in the sessions when anxiety seems especially high or low. Do you see any other factors that affect your fear, like the weather, or who you spent time with earlier in the day? You can also use the journal to write encouraging thoughts, difficulties, and anything else that \\"comes up\\" related to the fear. This will help you know yourself and your underlying patterns better. Summary:","output":"The article highlights the importance of overcoming the fear of spending time alone and provides a detailed approach to tackling this fear. Creating a list of advantages and disadvantages of spending time alone can be helpful in understanding its impact on relationships, passions, and self-development. The key is to start with gradual exposure to alone time, planning and increasing the duration incrementally until the fear subsides. An exposure hierarchy can be utilized, where one ranks different situations on a scale of 0-100 based on the anticipated level of fear. Starting with lower-ranked fears and progressively moving to higher-ranked ones allows individuals to slowly adapt and feel more comfortable in such situations. Physical symptoms of anxiety, such as shallow breathing or increased heart rate, are normal when purposely exposing oneself to fear. With time, anxiety is expected to decrease as the exposure increases. Some people may need distraction techniques, like reciting a poem or doing arithmetic, to help cope with the stress. It is essential to record and track one's progress using a fear scale ranging from 0 (fully relaxed) to 10 (highest fear). This helps in understanding the level of desensitization achieved and any specific trends that affect the anxiety. Other options, such as the FearFighter program, can also be helpful in overcoming the fear of spending time alone. The ultimate goal is to understand oneself better, recognize the underlying patterns and thoughts, and ultimately develop the confidence to comfortably spend time alone without fear."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Ideally, the daytime temperature while the cauliflower is maturing will be around 60ºF (15.5ºC). This means that the proper planting time depends on your climate:  Cool climates: If your late summer temperatures are below 80ºF (27ºC), you can plant cauliflower for a fall harvest. Start the seeds 8 to 12 weeks before the first fall frost.  Warm climates: If you have frost-free winters, you can plant cauliflower seeds later in autumn, once temperatures have dropped below 80ºF (27ºC). Harvest in winter or early spring.  Temperate climates: Spring-planted cauliflower is difficult to grow in most climates. The coastal valleys of California are the only major exception, and can support year-round crops. Cauliflower is one of the most temperature-sensitive vegetables around. If the temperature requirements above seem difficult to achieve in your area, you can make the job easier with one or more of these tactics:  Look for \\"summer\\" or \\"tropical\\" varieties that can handle warmer temperatures than most. Wait about a month after the recommended seed-starting date and buy a transplant from a garden store.  Plant a new batch every week for 4–6 weeks to see which works best. Though they require cool weather, paradoxically, cauliflower also require a fair amount of full sun during the day. Choose a spot for planting in your garden that receives full sun and isn't shaded by trees, tall grass, or other crops. You'll also want to make sure that your growing site has ample room for your cauliflower crop. Generally, cauliflower plants will need to be spaced about 18-24 inches apart. For a good cauliflower crop, the plant's growth must be completely uninterrupted. This means that the plant must receive consistent moisture and have access to sufficient nutrients as it matures. A good soil makes meeting both of these requirements much easier. Ideally, your cauliflower's soil should have the following qualities:  High organic matter content. This enhances the soil's ability to hold moisture. High potassium and nitrogen content. Potassium and nitrogen are nutrients vital for the cauliflower's development. If these are not present in the soil, it may be necessary to use fertilizer. A pH of between 6.5 and 7. This \\"sweet\\" pH range minimizes the danger of a cauliflower disease called clubroot and maximizes nutrient availability. Cauliflower has a reputation for being somewhat fragile. Many people start with seedlings from a local garden store to transplant into their garden. If you have seeds instead, plant them indoors to protect the young plants from weather:  Plant each seed in its own peat or paper cup. The biodegradable container lets you \\"plant\\" the whole pot in your garden later without damaging the cauliflower's roots.  Press the seed about 1/4–1/2 inch (0.6–1.25 cm) deep and cover it with dirt. Water regularly so the soil is moist but not waterlogged. In cold weather, keep the soil at 70º F (21º C) with bottom heat from a warming plate.  If you must plant your seeds directly in the garden, plant them in rows 3 to 6 inches (7.5 to 15 cm) apart. Whether you grew the plants from seed or bought them from a garden nursery, you'll need to move them outdoors once they have three or four true leaves:  Before transplanting, move the seedlings outside for one hour a day. Gradually increase this time over the course of a week to \\"harden off\\" the seedlings, adapting them to outdoor conditions. If you used a biodegradable container, bury the container in the ground so the soil level is even with the rest of the garden. If you used a non-biodegradable container, remove the seedling carefully to avoid breaking its roots. Make a small hole in the ground and bury the seedling up to its stem. You may want to make a shallow, saucer-like depression around the seedling to help the surrounding soil retain water. Firm the soil and water the seedling.","output":"Cauliflower needs cool weather and lots of sunlight to grow properly. It takes about 1.5-3 months to grow and should be planted depending on the climate where you live. It needs good soil, with lots of nutrients, and the plants should be spaced about 18-24 inches apart. People usually start growing cauliflower from seeds inside their homes and then move the little plants outside when they have 3 or 4 leaves. The plants need constant care, like watering, so they can grow strong and healthy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The Texas Republican, who is considering a 2016 run in hopes of heading his own White House administration, called the unusually high turnover at the helm of the Defense Department emblematic of a White House that puts politics above U.S. national security.  \\"It seems what the administration is looking for is a defense secretary who will follow the orders of a political White House rather than focus on defending the national security interests of this country,\\" Cruz said. \\"At a time when the threats are this grave, we shouldn't see turnover at the Defense Department than one has at a typical Burger King.\\"  Cruz said he did not know Ashton Carter, the former No. 2 man at the Pentagon who is expected to be Obama's nominee to succeed Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, but Cruz said he looks forward to learning more about Carter and his \\"good reputation.\\"  But Cruz emphasized he was unsettled to see several potential picks pull their names out of the running to head the department, including former Pentagon official Michele Flournoy and Sen. Jack Reed.  \\"It says something that so many people are saying, 'No, thank you, I don't want to serve in an administration that overrides the Defense Department, that treats the defense secretary as subservient to political lackeys in the White House,\\" Cruz said.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Centuries ago, man discovered that removing moisture from food helps to store it, and that the easiest way to do this is to expose the food to sun and wind. In this way the North American Indians produce pemmican(dried meat ground into powder and made into cakes), the Scandinavians make stockfish and the Arabs dried dates. All foods include water--cabbage and other leaf vegetables contains as much as 93% water, potatoes and other root vegetables 80%, lean meat 75% and fish, anything from 80% to 60%, depending on how fatty it is. If this water is removed, the activity of the bacteria which cause food to go bad is checked. Fruit is sun-dried in Asia Minor, Greece, Spain and other Mediterranean countries, and also in California, South Africa and Australia. Various methods are used, but in general, the fruit is spread out on trays in drying yards in the hot sun. Nowadays most foods are dried mechanically. The method of such dehydration is to put food in chambers through which hot air is blown at temperatures of about 110degC at entry to about 43degC at exit. This is the usual method for drying such things as vegetables, minced meat, and fish. Dried foods take up less room and weigh less than the same food packed in cans or frozen, and they do not need to be stored in special conditions. For these reasons they are invaluable to the climbers, explorers and soldiers in battle, who have little storage space. They are also popular with housewives because it takes so little time to cook them. Usually it is just a case of replacing the dried-out moisture with boiling water. Question: Bacteria which cause food to go bad  _  . Answer: A:","output":"Bacteria which cause food to go bad have their activity checked when the water content in the food is removed. This is because bacteria rely on moisture to thrive and reproduce. Dehydrating food through various methods, such as sun-drying or mechanical drying, reduces the amount of water present, inhibiting bacterial growth and extending the shelf life of the food."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information:  - The Luna programme (from the Russian word  \\"Luna\\" meaning \\"Moon\\"), occasionally called \\"Lunik\\" or \\"Lunnik\\" by western media, was a series of robotic spacecraft missions sent to the Moon by the Soviet Union between 1959 and 1976. Fifteen were successful, each designed as either an orbiter or lander, and accomplished many firsts in space exploration. They also performed many experiments, studying the Moon's chemical composition, gravity, temperature, and radiation.  - A spacecraft is a vehicle, or machine designed to fly in outer space. Spacecraft are used for a variety of purposes, including communications, earth observation, meteorology, navigation, space colonization, planetary exploration, and transportation of humans and cargo.  - The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets, with the remainder being significantly smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.  - In physics, an orbit is the gravitationally curved path of an object around a point in space, for example the orbit of a planet about a star or a natural satellite around a planet. Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating path around a body, although it may occasionally be used for a non recurring trajectory or a path around a point in space. To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptical orbits, with the central mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse, as described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion.  - Luna 3, or E-2A No.1 was a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1959 as part of the Luna programme. It was the first-ever mission to photograph the far side of the Moon. It was also the third space probe to be sent to the neighborhood of the Moon. Though it returned rather poor pictures by later standards, the historic, never-before-seen views of the far side of the Moon caused excitement and interest when they were published around the world, and a tentative \\"Atlas of the Far Side of the Moon\\" was created after image processing improved the pictures.  - A circumlunar trajectory, trans-lunar trajectory or lunar free return is a type of free return trajectory which takes a spacecraft from Earth, around the far side of the Moon, and back to Earth using only gravity once the initial trajectory is set.  - The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth, being Earth's only permanent natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary). Following Jupiter's satellite Io, the Moon is second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known.   - Luna E- 3 No.1 , sometimes identified by NASA as Luna 1960A , was a Soviet spacecraft which was lost in a launch failure in 1960 . It was a 279 - kilogram ( 615 lb ) Luna E- 3 spacecraft , the first of two to be launched , both of which were lost in launch failures . It was intended to fly around the Moon on a circumlunar trajectory in order to image the surface of the Moon , including the far side . The E- 3 spacecraft were similar in design to the E- 2A which had been used for the earlier Luna 3 mission . However , they carried higher resolution cameras , and were intended to make closer flybys .  - The far side of the Moon is the hemisphere of the Moon that always faces away from Earth. The far side's terrain is rugged, with a multitude of impact craters and relatively few flat lunar maria. It has one of the largest craters in the Solar System, the South PoleAitken basin. Although both sides of the moon experience two weeks of sunlight followed by two weeks of night, the far side is also referred to as the dark side of the Moon, originally in the sense of \\"unknown\\" rather than lack of light.  - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such.  - A free-return trajectory is a trajectory of a spacecraft traveling away from a primary body (for example, the Earth) where gravity due to a secondary body (for example, the Moon) causes the spacecraft to return to the primary body without propulsion (hence the term \\"free\\").  - Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is a gas giant, along with Saturn, with the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, being ice giants. Jupiter was known to astronomers of ancient times. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of 2.94, bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.

Choices:  - sea world - tomales bay - great oceans - the key - tropical waters  The rationale to choose \\"great oceans\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","output":"The shark was sick of the confines of its tank because it was longing for the vast expanse and freedom offered by the \\"great oceans.\\" As a magnificent creature naturally adapted to life in the open ocean, the shark was feeling trapped and restrained within the limited boundaries of its tank. The other options presented do not offer the same level of fulfillment and satisfaction to the shark's inherent nature. Here's a detailed breakdown of each choice and why \\"great oceans\\" is the most appropriate answer: 1. Sea World: While Sea World is larger than a simple aquarium tank, it still represents confinement within an artificial environment designed for entertainment and education purposes. Although it may be better than its current situation, the shark would still not experience the freedom and natural environment that the great oceans provide, where they can roam vast distances, follow migration paths, and engage in natural behaviors. 2. Tomales Bay: Tomales Bay is a relatively small, shallow body of water located in Marin County, California. Although it is a natural environment, its size and geographical limitations would still restrict the shark's movements and activities. Tomales Bay does not provide the vast open spaces and rich biodiversity found in the great oceans that the shark yearns for. 3. Great Oceans: The great oceans aptly represent the vast expanses of open water that our planet has to offer. They provide the shark with a truly unrestricted environment, where it can pursue its natural instincts, feed on a balanced and varied diet, interact with other marine life, and engage in reproductive behaviors essential for the survival of its species. The shark's longing for the great oceans is a reflection of its inherent need to thrive in a habitat that allows it to live a full and healthy life, unrestricted by artificial confines. 4. The Key: The key here seems to represent a metaphorical concept or a tangible object required for escaping the tank. Although it may be a necessary component for the shark's liberation, obtaining the key does not directly address the shark's underlying desire for the vastness and freedom provided by the great oceans. The key simply isn't a destination or environment that the shark is looking for. 5. Tropical Waters: While tropical waters offer a diverse and vibrant ecosystem, they still represent only a specific and limited type of environment. The shark's discontent with its tank suggests that it longs for a broader range of habitats and greater freedom to roam. The great oceans contain not only tropical waters but also temperate and polar environments, offering the shark a much greater diversity of experiences than a single type of habitat. In conclusion, the shark's yearning for the great oceans stems from its inherent desire to live in an unrestricted, natural environment abundant with diverse marine life and ecosystems. This option offers the shark the greatest opportunity for a fulfilling life, complete with opportunities to engage in natural behaviors essential for its overall well-being and the continuation of its species."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Which of the following is not a grammatical mood: conditional, second-person or imperative?\\" is in \\"The infinitive form ends in t (archaically, ti). It is the form found in dictionaries and the form that follows auxiliary verbs (for example, můžu tě slyšet—\\"I can hear you\\"). Czech verbs have three grammatical moods: indicative, imperative and conditional. The imperative mood adds specific endings for each of three person (or number) categories: -Ø/-i/-ej for second-person singular, -te/-ete/-ejte for second-person plural and -me/-eme/-ejme for first-person plural. The conditional mood is formed with a particle after the past-tense verb. This mood indicates possible events, expressed in English as \\"I would\\" or \\"I wish\\".\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","output":"Based on the information you provided, the answer to the question \\"Which of the following is not a grammatical mood: conditional, second-person or imperative?\\" is \\"second-person.\\" The second-person is not a grammatical mood but rather a grammatical person. In the context of grammar, a person refers to the distinction in the verb form due to the identity of the person performing or represented by its argument, and it includes first person, second person and third person. On the other hand, grammatical moods, like conditional and imperative, refer to the mode or manner in which the action of a verb is represented. As mentioned in the text you provided, Czech verbs have three grammatical moods: indicative, imperative, and conditional. The imperative mood is used for issuing commands, while the conditional mood expresses possible events or hypothetical or imagined situations.

Until its acceptance by the National Trust, Belton House was always in the ownership of the family of its builder, though the failure of three generations to produce a son and heir caused the ownership to pass sideways and sometimes through the female line. The owners of Belton are buried in the village of Belton's parish church close to the house. Their tombs are collectively one of the most complete sets of family memorials in England—continuous generation to generation for almost 350 years.

The ritual is unknowingly witnessed by Sylvia, a young girl who has been observing them from the trees. Sylvia is eventually spotted by one of the members and is dragged in front of the group. She manages to run away but is soon caught and raped by several of the cult members. The next morning, Sylvia emerges from the woods beaten and apparently raped. She is found by Mildred, the woman who runs the local bakery, and Pete, Sylvia's younger brother. They return Sylvia home to her grandfather, Doc Banner. Mildred seeks help from her boyfriend, leader of the construction crew working on the nearby dam which has bought up most of the town leaving it deserted. The cult members' van breaks down so they elect to remain in the town. They buy pies from Mildred who explains that as most of the town is deserted and awaiting demolition they can stay in any vacant building they wish. Learning of the assault on Sylvia, Doc confronts the cult but they assault him and force him to take LSD. Pete intervenes and Doc is released. Enraged by the incident, Pete takes a shotgun to get revenge but encounters a rabid dog which he shoots. He takes blood from the dog and the next morning injects it into meat pies at the bakery, and sells them to the cult members. Back at their house, Horace and the others eat the meat pies. The others begin to show signs of infection, and eventually they lapse into animalistic behavior. The infected members then proceed to attack and kill each other in a feral rage. One of the female members of the group, Molly becomes terrified and rushes off into the night. Construction workers sent there by Mildred's boyfriend find Molly and take her with them.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the full name of the person that was abroad for much of the intervening period of Nuffield? , can you please find it?   Administration of Nuffield's donation was the responsibility of the University, as the college did not become an independent body until after the Second World War. A sub-committee, consisting of three heads of Oxford colleges (Sir William Beveridge from University College; Alfred Emden from St Edmund Hall; and Linda Grier from Lady Margaret Hall), was appointed to choose the architect; Emden appears to have played the major part in the group's work. Eight architects were initially asked to compete, including Louis de Soissons, Vincent Harris, Austen Harrison, Charles Holden, Edward Maufe, and Hubert Worthington. All but Holden and Maufe submitted photographs of their work, and the sub-committee then recommended Harrison, a decision confirmed after he was interviewed on 17 June 1938. At that time, Harrison had never worked in Britain: although he had qualified there, he had practised in Greece and Palestine.  Indeed, the college seems to have been his only project in the country, and remains his best known work, along with his later University of Ghana.  Harrison was not given any restrictions or limitations on style; Nuffield agreed to Harrison's appointment, but was not consulted on the architectural style of the college before Harrison started work. When Nuffield's donation was announced, it was reported that the \\"general idea\\" was that the college buildings should be sited behind gardens, similar to the memorial gardens at Christ Church, Oxford, so that those entering Oxford from the west would be faced with a \\"beautiful vista of well-planned gardens seen through railings\\"; this idea did not form part of Harrison's designs. After Harrison's preliminary studies, it became clear that the proposed site could not contain a college and an institute for social science research as planned; Nuffield agreed to provide an additional plot of land on the opposite side of Worcester Street. Harrison proposed to build the college on the main site, with the institute on the second site. The hall was to be at the east end...

Sir Henry Joseph Wood  (3 March 1869 – 19 August 1944) was an English conductor best known for his association with London's annual series of promenade concerts, known as the Proms.  He conducted them for nearly half a century, introducing hundreds of new works to British audiences. After his death, the concerts were officially renamed in his honour as the \\"Henry Wood Promenade Concerts\\", although they continued to be generally referred to as \\"the Proms\\". Born in modest circumstances to parents who encouraged his musical talent, Wood started his career as an organist. During his studies at the Royal Academy of Music, he came under the influence of the voice teacher Manuel Garcia and became his accompanist. After similar work for Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera companies on the works of Arthur Sullivan and others, Wood became the conductor of a small operatic touring company.  He was soon engaged by the larger Carl Rosa Opera Company. One notable event in his operatic career was conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin in 1892. From the mid-1890s until his death, Wood focused on concert conducting. He was engaged by the impresario Robert Newman to conduct a series of promenade concerts at the Queen's Hall, offering a mixture of classical and popular music at low prices. The series was successful, and Wood conducted annual promenade series until his death in 1944. By the 1920s, Wood had steered the repertoire entirely to classical music.  When the Queen's Hall was destroyed by bombing in 1941, the Proms moved to the Royal Albert Hall. Wood declined the chief conductorships of the New York Philharmonic and Boston Symphony Orchestras, believing it his duty to serve music in the United Kingdom. In addition to the Proms, he conducted concerts and festivals throughout the country and also trained the student orchestra at the Royal Academy of Music. He had an enormous influence on the musical life of Britain over his long career: he and Newman greatly improved access to classical music, and Wood...

She became known as \\"Mumbet\\" or \\"Mum Bett.\\" For nearly 30 years Mumbet served the Ashley family. One day, Ashley's wife tried to strike Mumbet's sister with a spade. Mumbet protected her sister and took the blow instead. Furious, she left the house and refused to come back. When the Ashleys tried to make her return, Mumbet consulted a lawyer, Theodore Sedgewick. With his help, Mumbet sued  for her freedom. While serving the Ashleys, Mumbet had listened to many discussions of the new Massachusetts constitution. If the constitution said that all people were free and equal, then she thought it should apply to her. Eventually, Mumbet won her freedom---- the first slave in Massachusetts to do so under the new constitution. Strangely enough, after the trial, the Ashleys asked Mumbet to come back and work for them as a paid employee. She declined and instead went to work for Segdewick.

It is a work of social commentary, and condemns rural depopulation and the pursuit of excessive wealth.  - Trinity College is the sole constituent college of the University of Dublin, a research university in Ireland. The college was founded in 1592 as the \\"mother\\" of a new university, modelled after the collegiate universities of Oxford and of Cambridge, but, unlike these, only one college was ever established; as such, the designations \\"Trinity College\\" and \\"University of Dublin\\" are usually synonymous for practical purposes. It is one of the seven ancient universities of Britain and Ireland, as well as Ireland's oldest university.  - The Vicar of Wakefield  subtitled A Tale, Supposed to be written by Himself  is a novel by Irish writer Oliver Goldsmith (17281774). It was written from 1761 to 1762 and published in 1766. It was one of the most popular and widely read 18th-century novels among Victorians.  - The Good-Natur'd Man is a play written by Oliver Goldsmith in 1768. The play was written in the form of a comedy and staged at the Covent Garden Theatre. It was a middling success for Goldsmith, and the printed version of the play became popular with the reading public. It was released at the same time as Hugh Kelly's \\"False Delicacy\\" was staged at Drury Lane Theatre and the two plays went head to head with Kelly's proving the more popular. Garrick rejected \\"The Good-Natur'd Man\\", possibly because the story is an antidote of \\"False Delicasy\\".  - She Stoops to Conquer is a comedy by Anglo-Irish author Oliver Goldsmith that was first performed in London in 1773. The play is a favourite for study by English literature and theatre classes in the English-speaking world. It is one of the few plays from the 18th century to have an enduring appeal, and is still regularly performed today. It has been adapted into a film several times, including in 1914 and 1923. Initially the play was titled \\"Mistakes of a Night\\", and indeed, the events within the play take place in one long night. In 1778 John O'Keeffe wrote a loose sequel, \\"Tony Lumpkin in Town\\".  - A university (\\"a whole\\", \\"a corporation\\") is an institution of higher (or tertiary) education and research which grants academic degrees in various subjects.  Universities typically provide undergraduate education and postgraduate education.  - The University of Dublin, corporately designated the Chancellor, Doctors and Masters of the University of Dublin, is a university located in Dublin, Ireland. It was founded in 1592 when Queen Elizabeth I issued a charter for Trinity College, as \\"the mother of a university\\", thereby making it Ireland's oldest operating university. It was modelled after the collegiate universities of Oxford and of Cambridge, but unlike these only one college was established; as such, the designations \\"Trinity College\\" and \\"University of Dublin\\" are usually synonymous for practical purposes.  - Theaker Wilder ( 1717 -- 1778 ) DD , was the first Regius Professor of Greek , Senior Register and Senior Fellow at Trinity College , Dublin . He is remembered for being Oliver Goldsmith 's ' learned savage ' of a tutor .  - Oliver Goldsmith (10 November 1728  4 April 1774) was an Irish novelist, playwright and poet, who is best known for his novel \\"The Vicar of Wakefield\\" (1766), his pastoral poem \\"The Deserted Village\\" (1770), and his plays \\"The Good-Natur'd Man\\" (1768) and \\"She Stoops to Conquer\\" (1771, first performed in 1773). He is thought to have written the classic children's tale \\"The History of Little Goody Two-Shoes\\" (1765).    What entity does 'theaker wilder' has the relation 'occupation' with? Answer:","output":"The entity that 'Theaker Wilder' has the 'occupation' relation with is 'Trinity College, Dublin'. In this context, 'occupation' refers to the role, job, or profession that Theaker Wilder held. Theaker Wilder served as the first Regius Professor of Greek, Senior Register and Senior Fellow at Trinity College in Dublin. His responsibilities likely included teaching Greek, conducting scholarly research, and carrying out administrative duties within the college. His connection to Trinity College Dublin also extends to his mentoring role with Oliver Goldsmith, one of the notable figures in Irish literary history. Despite being perceived as a 'learned savage' by Goldsmith, Wilder's influence and teachings may likely have had an impact on Goldsmith's works and intellectual development. Therefore, it can be concluded that Theaker Wilder's occupation was closely tied to Trinity College in Dublin, and this role represented an essential facet of his professional life and identity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Ho lavorato con le piante, i batteri, le seppie, le mosche della frutta. A:","output":"He trabajado con las plantas, las bacterias, los calamares, las moscas de la fruta. Step 1: Identify the similarities and differences between Italian and Spanish. Both Italian and Spanish are Romance languages, which means they share similarities in vocabulary, grammar, and sentence structure. These similarities make the translation process easier, as many words may be cognates or have similar meanings. Step 2: Translate each word or phrase from Italian to Spanish. - Ho lavorato: This phrase means \\"I have worked\\" in Italian. In Spanish, we keep the same idea by saying \\"He trabajado.\\" - con: This word means \\"with\\" in both Italian and Spanish, so we can leave it as it is. - le piante: In Italian, this means \\"the plants.\\" In Spanish, we use \\"las plantas\\" to express the same idea. - i batteri: This means \\"the bacteria\\" in Italian. In Spanish, the translation is \\"las bacterias.\\" - le seppie: This translates to \\"the cuttlefish\\" in Italian, but since \\"cuttlefish\\" and \\"squid\\" share similarities, we can use \\"los calamares\\" in Spanish for a more familiar term. - le mosche della frutta: This phrase means \\"the fruit flies\\" in Italian. The Spanish equivalent is \\"las moscas de la fruta.\\" Step 3: Combine the translated words and phrases to form the complete sentence in Spanish.

Look out for a cameo from Bob of Bob's Burgers, too. What do you make of the footage so far? Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"The Simpsons and Family Guy had a special crossover episode, and they shared a funny five-minute trailer with jokes about the characters and their differences. Some people were not happy about the crossover, but the trailer includes jokes that make fun of the criticisms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. I can use this background: A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants.  Now, I have a new situation: Danny went camping and made a fire in the woods. he used large logs he fell a few months back. Bob was camping 300 yards away and he made a fire using small sticks, kindlings and sawdust he had left over. Bob's fire burned fast and bright.  Answer this question please: Which person made a fire that burned less bright? The answer to this question is:","output":"Danny made a fire that burned less bright. His large logs, although they burned for a longer period of time, did not burn as quickly or as brightly as Bob's kindling and sawdust, which had more surface area exposed to the heat and therefore burned faster and brighter."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As he explains: They held a tryout for 5-year-old boys and my father took me there. I didn't even have real skates. I had those blades that you screwed onto the soles of your shoes, but I was tall, and the 9-year-olds didn't have a goalie, so they put me in with them and thats where I fell in love with the game of hockey. Hasek's most memorable international performance came in the 1998 Winter Olympics, where he led the Czech national team to the gold medal. He allowed six goals in total, with only two of them coming in the medal round. Against Team Canada in the semifinals, Hasek stopped Theoren Fleury, Ray Bourque, Joe Nieuwendyk, Eric Lindros and Brendan Shanahan in a dramatic shootout win. He then shut out the Russian team 1-0 in the final game, stopping 20 shots. He was later announced as the best goaltender in the Olympics. After he won the gold, he was quoted as saying:  \\"When the game ended, I just threw my stick. I was so happy. When I saw the flag go up, I saw my whole career flash before my eyes from the first time my parents took me to a game until now.\\"  His play made him one of the most popular figures in the Czech Republic, so much so that residents chanted \\"Hasek to the castle!\\" in the streets, referring to the Prague Castle, the seat of the President of the Czech Republic. In response to this, Hasek called the president Vaclav Havel and jokingly told him that his job was not in jeopardy. He also helped to inspire an opera (titled Nagano) about the Czech team's gold medal victory, and in 2003, Petr Pravec and Lenka Sarounova named an asteroid (8217 Dominikhasek) in his honour.  In the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, Hasek played for just nine minutes and twenty-five seconds, until he injured his right adductor muscle. Despite his absence, the Czechs managed to earn the bronze medal with backup goaltender Tomas Vokoun, which Hasek received as well.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Was the 1998 Olympic games the only games he played in?","output":"No, the 1998 Olympic games were not the only games he played in.

It came as something of a surprise when Diana, Princess of Wales, made a trip to Angola in 1997, to support the Red Cross's campaign for a total ban on all anti-personnel landmines. Within hours of arriving in Angola, television screens around the world were filled with images of her comforting victims injured in explosions caused by landmines. \\"I knew the statistics,\\"she said. \\"But putting a face to those figures brought the reality home to me; like when I met Sandra, a 13- year-old girl who had lost her leg, and people like her. \\"  The Princess concluded with a simple message. \\"We must stop landmines.\\" And she used every opportunity during her visit to repeat this message.  But, back in London, her views were not shared by some members of the British government, which refused to support a ban on these weapons. Angry politicians launched an attack on the Princess in the press. They described her as very \\"ill-informed\\"and \\" a loose cannon .\\"  The Princess responded by brushing aside the criticisms,\\" This is a distraction we do not need. All I'm trying to do is help.\\"  Opposition parties, the media and the public immediately voiced their support for the Princess. To make matters worse for the government, it soon emerged that the Princess's trip had been approved by the Foreign Office, and that she was in fact very well-informed about both the situation in Angola and the British government's policy regarding landmines. The result was a severe embarrassment for the government.  To try and limit the damage, the Foreign Secretary, Malcolm Rifkidnd, claimed that the Princess's views on landmines were not very different from government policy, and that it was working towards a worldwide ban. The Defence Secretary, Michael Portillo, claimed the matter was a misinterpretation or misunderstanding.  For the Princess, the trip to this war-torn country was an excellent opportunity to use her popularity to show the world how much destruction and suffering landmines can cause.

Perhaps you have complained about it because you thought it took you much playtime. But now you'd better thank your parents for their time and money spent on your musical training. A recent study suggests music lessons can make children have better memories than their peers  . The Canadian study showed that after one year of musical training, children did better on a memory test than those who didn't take music lessons. The researchers made the children aged between 4 and 6 into two groups -- one group of children took music lessons outside school, and the other didn't take any musical training. In one year, they took four tests in different times. The results showed brain development changes at least every four months. The children taking music lessons not only did better in musical listening but also made faster progress in other ways, such as reading, writing, math and IQ. People say music is the good medicine for a broken heart. Now it seems music can also help us to improve our memories. We are sure to find more and more in the wonderful world of music.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the acronym for the the name of the strike committee?  On August 16, delegations from other strike committees arrived at the shipyard. Delegates (Bogdan Lis, Andrzej Gwiazda and others) together with shipyard strikers agreed to create an Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee (Międzyzakładowy Komitet Strajkowy, or MKS). On August 17 a priest, Henryk Jankowski, performed a mass outside the shipyard's gate, at which 21 demands of the MKS were put forward. The list went beyond purely local matters, beginning with a demand for new, independent trade unions and going on to call for a relaxation of the censorship, a right to strike, new rights for the Church, the freeing of political prisoners, and improvements in the national health service.Next day, a delegation of KOR intelligentsia, including Tadeusz Mazowiecki, arrived to offer their assistance with negotiations. A bibuła news-sheet, Solidarność, produced on the shipyard's printing press with KOR assistance, reached a daily print run of 30,000 copies. Meanwhile, Jacek Kaczmarski's protest song, Mury (Walls), gained popularity with the workers.On August 18, the Szczecin Shipyard joined the strike, under the leadership of Marian Jurczyk. A tidal wave of strikes swept the coast, closing ports and bringing the economy to a halt. With KOR assistance and support from many intellectuals, workers occupying factories, mines and shipyards across Poland joined forces. Within days, over 200 factories and enterprises had joined the strike committee. By August 21, most of Poland was affected by the strikes, from coastal shipyards to the mines of the Upper Silesian Industrial Area (in Upper Silesia, the city of Jastrzębie-Zdrój became center of the strikes, with a separate committee organized there, see Jastrzębie-Zdrój 1980 strikes).

The 1980 Bank Robbery in Central Nyack that was medically managed at the Nyack Hospital where I responded to the ONLY Code 66 of my career. That “66”indicated for us an external disaster about to unload in our emergency room. The two policemen who were mortally injured and died on our stretchers were personal friends and one the boyfriend of one of the nurses. Their injuries were from machine guns where the flesh is riddled with explosive elements as opposed to a gunshot wounds where there is both an entry and exit site. In our Trauma and Triage Course we never learned about machine gun injuries. Additionally there were the criminals who were also injured and of course we needed to treat them as any other patient regardless of their behavior. The friends of the injured policemen were trying to get to these villains and it was just the most awful evening of my life. To this day I remember feeling nauseous in a way I had never felt before. We had debriefing sessions for weeks and of course were very upset for months. The wounds we had to address, the insertion of chest tubes and everything else all in such a rapid manner was indeed a more than gross situation. There was even open heart massage.

When we moved in a month ago, Mary wanted to get a dog to keep out burglars. However, we finally decided that it would be cheaper to put an iron grille in front of the door and get a burglar alarm. Last week, I went to a shop and bought an alarm for just over PS200. It consists of a control unit with three smaller units. I put the control unit in the lounge and put the other units in place by the front door, back door and lounge windows. That night I soon fell asleep because I was confident that no one could get into our house undetected. At about 1:50 a.m. I woke up suddenly and heard the siren. It was like an ambulance driving right through our bedroom. I couldn't leave the siren on all night. I went downstairs in the dark. When I reached the bottom of the stairs, I switched on the light and looked around. Oh my gosh. The back door was unlocked. I rushed to lock it and it was just at that exact moment that the 'burglar' disappeared behind a curtain. Guess what? It was an ordinary house lizard .Apparently the alarm system had been made for American or European homes in which lizards are never seen. I switched the alarm off and sat down to watch. A few moments later, a lizard ran across a wall, right in front of one of the alarm units.

Shocking: A TV news station was flooded with complaints during an afternoon broadcast after showing a male's genitals on a monitor behind the show's anchor. A spokesman for the channel said: 'The image was actually part of a documentary, but we should have been aware of timing and not had that particular scene playing when we went on air.

Given the question: Information:  - The hawkfishes are strictly tropical, perciform marine fishes of the family Cirrhitidae associated with the coral reefs of the western and eastern Atlantic and Indo-Pacific. They share many morphological features with the scorpionfish of the family Scorpaenidae.  - Cirrhitichthys is a genus of hawkfishes found on tropical reefs in the Indian and western Pacific oceans .  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.    What is the relationship between 'cirrhitichthys' and 'cirrhitidae'? The answer is:","output":"Cirrhitichthys is a genus of hawkfishes within the family Cirrhitidae.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Boston ferns will do best in a potting mixture of peat moss, sand, and garden soil. You can buy all of these at your local gardening store. Your final mixture should be even parts of each ingredient. The pot should be big enough for your fern to sit comfortably without it's roots being near the drainage holes, but without a lot of extra space that could accumulate \\"root rot.\\" Put your mixture and plant into the clean pot with drainage holes in the bottom.The fern can be planted about half of the way to the top of the pot so that the roots have space in the soil. Fill in the rest of the pot with more potting mixture, leaving about 1 inch(\\t25.4 mm) of space from the top. In many places, the summers are warm and humid enough to provide the perfect environment for a Boston fern. They do best in environments with humidity levels of at least 50 percent. If your daytime temperatures are between 65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 24 degrees Celsius), and your nighttime temperatures are between 55 and 65 degrees Fahrenheit (13 to 18 degrees Celsius), your Boston ferns will thrive outdoors. You can place them on your porch or patio, and they should do well. The cooler temperatures at night will help to prevent fungus from developing. If you are keeping your Boston fern indoors, whether permanently or just for the winter months, you will need to be careful about making sure it has adequate humidity. The very best thing to do is to place it in a room with a humidifier. Keep your house between 65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 24 degrees Celsius), and put it in a cooler room at night. If you don’t want to invest in a humidifier, there are other options. You can place your fern in a saucer filled with small stones and water. The water will create humidity as it evaporates. Boston ferns do best when receiving indirect, filtered sunlight. If they’re outdoors, place them somewhere where they will get sunlight through tree branches, or cracks in a porch roof. If they’re indoors, place them near a window. You don’t want your fern to be in shade, but you don’t want them to be in direct sunlight. It’s a delicate balance.

To other analysts the delay between CRA rule changes (in 1995) and the explosion of subprime lending is not surprising, and does not exonerate the CRA. They contend that there were two, connected causes to the crisis: the relaxation of underwriting standards in 1995 and the ultra-low interest rates initiated by the Federal Reserve after the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001. Both causes had to be in place before the crisis could take place. Critics also point out that publicly announced CRA loan commitments were massive, totaling 4.5 trillion in the years between 1994 and 2007. They also argue that the Federal Reserve’s classification of CRA loans as “prime” is based on the faulty and self-serving assumption that high-interest-rate loans (3 percentage points over average) equal “subprime” loans. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): When did CRA make rule changes to relax underwriting standards?","output":"The CRA, or Community Reinvestment Act, made rule changes to relax underwriting standards in 1995. This means that banks were allowed to lend money to people more easily, even if they didn't have everything they needed to show they could pay it back.

In boys, it is controlled by testosterone. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty. At its peak rate, growth in height is about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year in the average male. Growth generally remains rapid for several years. Growth and development of muscles occur toward the end of the growth spurt in height. Muscles may continue to develop and gain strength after growth in height is finished.  Paragraph: Jimothy and Dwight are two brothers living in the same house. Jimothy is a freshman in high school and Dwight is a junior in high school. Their mother takes them to see a doctor and to have their testosterone tested. The tests reveal that Dwight has significantly more testosterone than Jimothy, but that is to be expected given their age difference.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which boy will start developing muscles later? The answer to this question is:","output":"Jimothy will start developing muscles later. Since Jimothy is a freshman in high school, he is younger than Dwight, who is a junior. The age difference between the two brothers indicates that Dwight has already undergone more of the puberty process than Jimothy, including experiencing the adolescent growth spurt. This is further confirmed by the testosterone test results that show Dwight has significantly more testosterone than Jimothy.  Testosterone plays a crucial role in boys' development during puberty, controlling not only their growth spurt but also the growth and development of muscles. As mentioned in the background information, the development of muscles occurs towards the end of the growth spurt in height. Since Dwight has reached an advanced stage in puberty as indicated by his higher testosterone levels, he is also expected to be further along in his muscle development. In comparison, Jimothy, being younger and at an earlier state of puberty, will start developing muscles later than Dwight. As his body continues to grow in height and his testosterone levels rise throughout puberty, he will eventually undergo muscle development towards the end of his adolescent growth spurt. However, this process of muscle growth and development is expected to occur after Dwight, due to the age difference and the different stages of puberty the two brothers are in."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A number of countries forbid members of the legislature from accepting an office of profit under the executive as a means to secure the independence of the legislature and preserve the separation of powers. Is this statement correct \\"is office of profit mentioned in the constitution\\"?","output":"Yes, the statement is correct to some extent. The concept of the \\"office of profit\\" is indeed mentioned in various national constitutions across the globe, including those of India, the United States, and the United Kingdom. It is important to note that the specific language and provisions surrounding the office of profit can vary between different jurisdictions and constitutional frameworks. In India, for example, the term \\"office of profit\\" is not explicitly mentioned in the Indian Constitution. However, the concept is still recognized and addressed in the Constitution under Articles 102(1)(a) and 191(1)(a). These provisions disqualify a member of Parliament or a State Legislature from holding an office of profit under the Government of India or the government of any state. In the United States, the concept of an \\"office of profit\\" is addressed within the Constitution under the Incompatibility Clause, which states in Article I, Section 6, Clause 2: \\"No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil office under the Authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time; and no person holding any office under the United States, shall be a member of either House during his continuance in office.\\" This clause aims to prevent conflicts of interest and maintain the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches of the United States government. It also bars members of the U.S. Congress from simultaneously holding an office under the executive branch. In the United Kingdom, the concept of an \\"office of profit\\" is addressed within the constitutional laws and parliamentary conventions. The British constitution specifically disqualifies members of Parliament from holding a range of executive offices, such as Her Majesty's ministers or civil servants. One key example can be found in the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975, which lists a series of offices considered to be \\"offices of profit\\" and that holders of such offices are thereby disqualified from serving as members of Parliament. While the term \\"office of profit\\" may not necessarily be mentioned explicitly in every national constitution, the concept is still present and relevant in the constitutions of several countries. The fundamental goal behind addressing the \\"office of profit\\" issue is to prevent conflicts of interest, protect the independence of the legislature, and preserve the separation of powers between different branches of government."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

You might need to use additional knowledge to answer the question. Water flowing over Earths surface or underground causes erosion and deposition. Water flowing over a steeper slope moves faster and causes more erosion. How water transports particles depends on their size. When water slows down, it starts depositing sediment. This process starts with the largest particles first. Runoff erodes the land after a heavy rain. It picks up sediment. Runoff carries most of the sediment to bodies of water. Mountain streams erode narrow, V-shaped valleys and waterfalls. Erosion and deposition by slow-flowing rivers create broad floodplains and meanders. Deposition by streams and rivers may form alluvial fans and deltas. Floodwaters may deposit natural levees. Erosion and deposition by groundwater can form caves and sinkholes.

A vulgar and infamous superstar, Sammi is a hometown hero of Eddie's town, and an alumnus of Eddie's own Lakeridge High School. He puts the letter in an envelope and starts doing his chores. Watching the news at the same time, following a report on Sammi's being banned from returning to Lakeridge High to perform at the Halloween dance, Eddie is shocked to hear the worst words to ever reach his ears: Sammi Curr has died in a mysterious hotel fire. Eddie is completely devastated. He goes to his friend \\"Nuke\\" (Gene Simmons), a radio DJ who knew Sammi Curr personally. To take Eddie's mind off the death of his idol, Nuke gives Eddie the only copy of Curr's last and as-yet unreleased album, \\"Songs in the Key of Death\\", on an acetate disc. Nuke has recorded the disc onto high quality tape and plans to play it in its entirety on-air at midnight on Halloween as a tribute since, according to Nuke, that was always Sammi's plan for the album's debut. Once back home, Eddie falls asleep while listening to the record and has a strange dream about the fire that killed Sammi Curr. When he wakes up he finds that the record is skipping and after listening to it for a few seconds he comes to realize that something is not quite right about the lyrics that the record is stuck on. Having previous experience with hidden lyrics, Eddie plays the record backwards, but receives more than he imagined: Sammi Curr speaking to him from beyond the grave. Sammi instructs Eddie on how to go about getting revenge on a group of bullies who make his school life a torment, since Sammi himself was bullied constantly in high school and he wants to now take the revenge on Eddie's bullies that he never got to take on his own. Eddie explains the situation to his best friend Roger (Glen Morgan), who is highly skeptical of the whole thing.

Article: CAIRO (Reuters) - Cairo's Tahrir Square relived its glory days of the revolution on Friday as tens of thousands of flag-waving protesters called on the Egyptian army to relinquish power, in defiance of a stern communiqué from the generals criticizing the Muslim Brotherhood.      All day, through weekly prayers in the baking midday sun to an evening clamor for change, demonstrators, mostly marshaled by the Islamist movement and its allies, called on the military to make good on promises to hand over to a civilian and end the prolonged uncertainty over last weekend's presidential election.      With the result of the run-off between the Brotherhood's man and a former general expected by Sunday, there was an anxious mood as many vowed to follow their leaders' calls to camp out until the army also cancels an order curbing the powers of the new president and revokes its dissolution of parliament.      \\"This is a classic counter revolution that will only be countered by the might of protesters,\\" said Safwat Ismail, 43, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood who came from north Egypt.      \\"I am staying in the square until the military steps down.\\"      The generals flatly refused, heightening a sense of deadlock in achieving the democracy protesters thought they had won with blood spilt on Tahrir Square during last year's Arab Spring, though in the background, officials from army and Brotherhood have been talking, leading some to see a compromise ahead.      In a brusque, four-minute statement read on state television as Egyptians were completing their Friday prayers, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) stood by what critics at home and in the West have called a \\"soft coup\\" intended to prolong six decades of military rule many believed had ended.      \\"The issuance of the supplementary constitutional decree was necessitated by the needs of administering the affairs of the state during this critical period in the history of our nation,\\" the off-screen announcer said, in the bureaucratic language favored by the generals who pushed aside fellow officer Hosni Mubarak last year to appease the angry millions on the streets.      The Islamist presidential candidate, Mohamed Morsy, shot back that the generals were defying the will of the people and said protests would go on. But he stopped short of repeating a claim to have already won the election, urging simply a rapid announcement of the result, and praised the army as \\"patriotic\\".      In what were menacing tones for the army's old adversary the Muslim Brotherhood, SCAF criticized their premature announcement of the election result as sowing division and said people were free to protest - but only if they did not disrupt daily life.      PROTESTS      At Tahrir, the broad traffic interchange by the Nile in central Cairo was filled with makeshift tents offering shade from the scorching sun, hawkers offering an array of goods from tea to \\"I Love Tahrir Square\\" T-shirts. Many knelt in prayer during the weekly service at noon. Large groups of pious Islamists were bused in from the provinces by their parties.      The crowd, swelling when the heat of the day faded, chanted and waved Egyptian flags late into the evening.      Mahmoud Mohammed, a bearded, 31-year-old marine engineer from Alexandria among a group from the fundamentalist Salafist movement camping on the square, insisted they were not looking for a battle, but wanted to see democracy installed.      \\"The people elected a parliament and they put it in the rubbish bin. We need the army to hand over,\\" he said. \\"No one came here for a fight. We need democracy.\\"      Smaller groups of secular activists joined the mainly Islamist throng but the absence of many of the liberal urban youth who drove the early days of the revolt against Mubarak has highlighted a weariness with turmoil and a dismay at politics which have boiled down to Egypt's familiar choice between army and religion, the two best organized institutions, at the expense of candidates from the fragmented centre ground.      The deadlock between Egypt's two strongest forces has raised grave doubts about prospects for consensual democracy, though some see possible compromise, if Morsy does become president.      But the army and Brotherhood have cooperated warily since Mubarak fell and sources on both sides say that may continue, despite the military council infuriating the Islamists last week by dissolving the new parliament, which they had dominated.      The military council said on Friday it had no power to repeal the dissolution, saying that was down to judges who ruled some of January's election rules unconstitutional. Critics say the judges were appointed under Mubarak and are not impartial.      ELECTION      The Brotherhood fears a delay in announcing the result of the presidential election indicates an attempt to cheat - though opponents say it is the Islamists who are not playing fair.      Morsy and former general Ahmed Shafik both say they believe they won the run-off ballot. But it is Morsy's declaration of victory within hours of polls closing which has driven debate about underhand tactics in a country long used to vote-rigging.      The delay in publishing results, due on Thursday but not now expected until at least Saturday, is explained by officials as due to reviewing many appeals. But it has heightened anxiety on all sides, although most insist they will protest peacefully.      Morsy told a news conference he would continue to reject SCAF's decree. \\"The constitutional declaration clearly implies attempts by the military council to restrict the incoming president,\\" he said. \\"This we totally reject.\\"      But with no obvious resolution in sight to the stand-off, Morsy also made conciliatory references to the army. \\"There is no problem between us and our patriotic armed forces,\\" he said.      CONSTITUTION      \\"We do not agree to the issuing of the constitutional decree and neither do the people,\\" Morsy said. \\"Why do we need a supplementary declaration when we are going to draft a new constitution?\\"      The decree has also given the military power to step in and force the pace of drafting a constitution, a process slowed in parliament by a lack of consensus between Islamists and other parties. Some lawmakers involved were due to meet again on Saturday to try to make progress and keep control.      In a country where virtually no one can remember an election that was not rigged before last year, trust is low, not least among Brotherhood officials, many of whom, like Morsy, were jailed under Mubarak for their political activities.      The same electoral commission that handed 90 percent of a November 2010 parliamentary vote to Mubarak's supporters - a result which fuelled the protests that brought him down a few weeks later - sits in judgment on the new presidency.      Hassan Nafaa, a political analyst and critic of Mubarak, said. \\"The military council's statement is intended to scare the people and quell the revolutionary spirit of the nation through the firm authoritarian tone in which the statement was delivered. But this will not work because all politically aware civilians refuse the military's stewardship over the state.\\"      Events of the past week, which also saw a renewal of the power of military police to arrest civilians, have troubled Western allies, notably the United States which has long been the key sponsor of the Egyptian armed forces but now says it wants to see them hand power to civilians.      Adding to unease, Mubarak is himself back in the news, being transferred to a military hospital on Tuesday evening from the prison where he began a life sentence this month.      Military and security sources have given a different accounts of his condition, from \\"clinically dead\\" at one point, to being on life support after a stroke to \\"stabilizing\\". Many Egyptians suspect his fellow generals may be exaggerating his illness to get their old comrade out of jail.      (Additional reporting by Omar Fahmy and Mohamed Abdella; Writing by Alastair Macdonald; Editing by Louise Ireland) ||||| Tens of thousands have packed Cairo's iconic Tahrir Square to denounce a power grab by the ruling military, as the nation nervously awaited the results of the first post-Mubarak presidential election.      Yet Egypt's ruling military warned it would \\"deal firmly\\" with any attempt to harm the public interest, and blamed political divisions on the release of unofficial presidential poll results by candidates.      \\"Protecting the status of state institutions is a national responsibility for all: any attack on them threatens the stability and national security of Egypt,\\" said a Supreme Council of the Armed Forces statement read on state television on Friday afternoon.      \\"Any attempts to harm public or private interests will be confronted with utmost firmness and strength by the police and armed forces within the law,\\" SCAF said.      The SCAF defended a constitutional document giving it legislative powers, control over the new constitution and a broad say in government policy.      \\"The issuing of a constitutional declaration was a necessity imposed by the needs of managing the affairs of the country during the current critical phase of the history of our nation,\\" the military council said.      It instead blamed the tension in Egypt on the release of unofficial poll results.      \\"The early release of the presidential election results, before the announcement by the responsible body, was unjustified and is one of the main reasons for divisions and tensions in the political arena,\\" SCAF said.      Its comments appeared to be directed at the powerful Muslim Brotherhood, which said that its candidate Mohamed Morsi had won the election, providing what it said were certified copies of ballot tallies to bolster its claims.      'Neither confrontation nor violence'      Morsi held a subsequent press conference following the release of SCAF's statement, where he said the Brotherhood wants neither \\"confrontation nor violence\\".      But he added: \\"The expected result is known to everyone. We will not allow anyone to tamper with the result.\\"      \\"We expect that the result will truly reflect the popular will, which we all know,\\" said Morsi, adding that the thousands of protesters in Tahrir Square were there to \\"guarantee that will\\" is respected.      Morsi was speaking at a news conference in Cairo, flanked by several liberal and leftist figures.      He slammed a constitutional declaration issued by the ruling military council that granted the army sweeping powers, as well as the dissolution of parliament and a justice ministry decision giving soldiers powers of arrest.      \\"We reject all this... and the timing concerns us all,\\" said Morsi.      But he pledged that his movement and supporters did not have any plans to clash with the military council or to instigate unrest.      \\"There will be no confrontation or violence or attempts to shake the stability of this country,\\" he said.      \\"The protection of the nation is our highest goal, (including) the protection of its institutions, public and private property.\\"      'Down with military rule'      Members and supporters of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood gathered in the square for the protest on Friday, which was to be joined later in the afternoon by several secular movements.      Protesters used umbrellas, newspapers and hats to shield themselves from the brutal sun, as they chanted \\"down with military rule.\\"      Al Jazeera's Mike Hanna, reporting from Tahrir Square, said the crowds \\"dismissed the statement\\" released by the SCAF earlier in the day.      He went on to say that the crowd gathered in Tahrir were made up of different political supporters. \\"This is probably the most united display of protest seen for a long period of time.\\"      \\"The Muslim Brotherhood has called for protesters to come here, but they have been joined the revolutionary socialists, and the salafi Al Nour party, so this is a wide expanse of political opposition expressed in the square.\\"      Those camping out overnight demanded military rulers reverse new orders that entrench the generals' power and called on the election commission to declare the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Morsi president.      Across town, in a luxury international hotel, former general Ahmed Shafik, who was Hosni Mubarak's prime minister when the army forced out the dictator to appease the Tahrir protesters, challenged Morsi's self-proclaimed victory and said he was sure he had won.      At a televised address to whooping and cheering supporters, Shafik said: \\"These protests in the squares, the campaigns of terror and the media manipulation are all attempts to force the election committee to announce a particular result.\\"            Speaking in person rather than through spokesmen as he has through the week, he added: \\"I am fully confident that I will be the legitimate winner.\\" He called for calm and unity, saying he would invite opponents to join his administration.      On Thursday, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said it held concerns over the military's commitment to hand over power to civilian rule.            \\"The generals' relentless expansion of their authority to detain and try civilians now goes far beyond their powers under Hosni Mubarak,\\" Joe Stork, HRW Middle East director, said in a statement            \\"These decrees are the latest indication yet that there won't be a meaningful handover to civilian rule on June 30,\\" Stork added.      The Election Commission did not say when it would announce the winner of the runoff. But its secretary-general, Hatem Begato, told the state newspaper Al-Ahram that the winner would be announced on Saturday or Sunday.      Allegations of fraud      The commission said the announcement was postponed from Thursday because a panel of judges must look into about 400 complaints of voting fraud submitted by both campaigns, including lawyers for Shafik claiming fraud in 14 of Egypt's 27 provinces.      The lawyers said ballots sent to polling centers were already marked for Morsi.      Morsi's lawyers accused Shafik of buying votes and being involved in forging lists of registered voters to include soldiers, who are barred from voting, and names of the dead.      The Brotherhood says it is being targeted by an organised campaign to keep it out of the presidency, and that even if Morsi is declared the victor, he will face deep resistance that will make it impossible for him to govern.      After two days of voting that ended on Sunday, the group declared Morsi won 52 per cent of the vote. Shafiq's camp on Monday announced he had won 51.5 per cent of the vote. ||||| Egypt's ruling military council has blamed the Muslim Brotherhood for raising tensions in the country by releasing election results early.

This movie is very entertaining, and any critique is based on personal preferences - not the films quality. Other than the common excessive profanity in some scenes by Murphy, the film is a great vehicle for his type of humor. It has some pretty good special effects, and exciting action scenes. As a finder of lost children, Murphy's character starts off looking for a missing girl, which leads him on the path for which others believe he was \\"chosen\\" - - to protect the Golden Child. The young boy is born as an enlightened one, destined to save the world from evil forces, but whose very life is in danger, if not for the help of Murphy, and his beautiful, mysterious and mystical helper/guide/protector. Also, there are moments of philosophical lessons to challenge the audience members who are interested in pondering deep thoughts. One such scene is where the Golden Child, that Murphy's character is solicited to protect, is tested by the monks of the mountain temple. An elderly monk presents a tray of ornamental necklaces for the child to choose from, and the child is tested on his choice. This is a fantasy/comedy that is based on the notion that there are both good and evil forces in our world of which most people are completely unaware. As we accept this premise of the plot, we must let go of our touch with a perceived daily reality, and prepare for the earth and walls to crumble away, and reveal a realm of evil just waiting to destroy us.

LeBron James scores 35 points, grabs 10 rebounds (and has no cramps) as Heat beat Spurs in NBA Finals Game 2 No cramps, no problems for LeBron James. And with their superstar making it to the finish this time, the Miami Heat bounced back from a loss, just as they always do in the playoffs. \\"Obviously, having No. 6 in the game at the end was a plus for us,\\" Dwyane Wade said. James had 35 points and 10 rebounds in a powerful comeback from the cramps that knocked him out of the opener, as the Heat tied the NBA Finals with a 98-96 victory over the San Antonio Spurs in Game 2 Sunday night. Chris Bosh made the go-ahead 3-pointer on a pass from James with 1:18 remaining for the Heat, who have won 13 straight following a loss in the postseason. Just like last year, they rebounded after losing Game 1 to the Spurs. Bosh had 18 points for the Heat, who are headed home for Game 3 Tuesday night. James played more than 37 minutes, making 14 of 22 shots. He was 1 for 4 with three turnovers in a shaky first quarter, then made 11 of his next 13. After two days of enduring criticism for not finishing the game and getting suggestions on how to avoid cramps, James changed the subject. \\"What happened on Thursday was Thursday,\\" James said. \\"My whole focus was how I was going to try to help this team even this up and just try to make some plays.\\" He had a key strip of Tony Parker down the stretch, playing a dominant game on both ends as if he had something to prove. As usual, James found a way to silence his haters. He had 11 points in the second quarter, helping Miami erase an 11-point deficit early in the period. The game was played within a margin of a few points from there, and the Spurs missed a chance to seize control in the fourth quarter when Parker and Tim Duncan missed four straight free throws when they had a two-point lead. James then made a 3-pointer and two free throws to put Miami in position to win. Parker scored 21 points and Duncan had 18 points and 15 rebounds for the Spurs, who had won eight straight at home by at least 15 points. \\"Down the end there they executed really well,\\" Duncan said. \\"LeBron made some great passes and guys made open shots. We had the same result in the first game. They kind of flipped it in this one.\\" The game was played in comfortable conditions inside the AT&T Center, where an air conditioning failure in Game 1 sent temperatures soaring to about 90 degrees. The broken circuit breaker was fixed by Friday afternoon, and it was much cooler inside the arena. James had the toughest time with the heat Thursday, needing treatment midway through the fourth quarter before eventually having to leave for good. He had plenty of time to recover, with the two days off between Games 1 and 2. He changed only a little of his routine, taking an 8 a.m. yoga class Sunday morning and switching to a shorter pair of tights. He personally erased a 62-56 San Antonio lead by scoring eight points in less than a minute, and his 14 points in the third quarter had Miami down only 78-77 heading to the fourth. \\"For me, once I get into a good groove, I feel like everything is going to go in,\\" James said. For a time, everything did. Then he switched to being a passer at the end, finding Bosh in the corner for the shot that made it 95-93. Wade and Rashard Lewis each scored 14 points for the Heat, who also dropped Game 1 of the NBA Finals against Oklahoma City two years ago. They have won five straight series after dropping the opening game. The Spurs were in good position, withstanding James' assault long enough to lead by one with under 2 minutes to play. But they were shut out from there until Manu Ginobili's 3-pointer as time expired. \\"LeBron with the ball did a pretty good job at his end and we had to be really perfect at the other end and we didn't,\\" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. \\"We didn't take advantage of things. We made bad decisions.\\" And it didn't help them that they had to deal with James at the end of this one. Ginobili finished with 19 points for the Spurs, whose 18 points in the fourth quarter were half the 36 they scored in the opener. \\"We have a very competitive group and you have two days to commiserate how that game went down,\\" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \\"It was frustrating, painful going through that for two days and now we have to manage the other emotion.\\" After their sensational finish to Game 1, the Spurs picked up right where they left off, making 10 of their first 15 shots. They opened an 11-point lead early in the second before James got going. He had three straight Miami baskets, and a follow shot later in the period gave the Heat their first lead at 34-33. Notes: Parker has 1,026 assists in the postseason, moving past Michael Jordan (1,022) for eighth place on the career postseason list. He also passed Jordan's Hall of Fame teammate, Scottie Pippen, for 13th on the career scoring list with 3,655 points.

Solve -140*j + 48*j - 787 - 317 = 0 for j.","output":"To solve the equation -140*j + 48*j - 787 - 317 = 0 for j, we need to follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify the equation Combine the j terms and the constant terms.  On the left side of the equation, we have two j terms: -140*j and 48*j. Combining these will give us: (-140 * j + 48 * j) = -92 * j Next, combine the constant terms, -787 and -317: -787 - 317 = -1104 Now the simplified equation looks like this: -92 * j - 1104 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable j To isolate j, we need to get rid of the -1104 on the left side of the equation. To do this, add 1104 to both sides: -92 * j - 1104 + 1104 = 0 + 1104 This will simplify to: -92 * j = 1104 Now, to isolate j completely, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -92: (-92 * j) / -92 = 1104 / -92 This will give us the solution: j = -12 So the solution to the equation -140*j + 48*j - 787 - 317 = 0 is j = -12."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Your first period will probably be very light, and may not even look like blood. It may appear as bright red drops in your underwear, or it could be brownish and sticky. Don't worry that you will be gushing blood, either; during an average period, a woman will only lose about 1 oz. (30 ml) of blood. That's about the same amount of liquid as 2 bottles of nail polish.  Talk to your mom or older sister. They may be able to give you an idea of when you will get your period. It's not always the same, but often girls begin their periods around the age as their mother or sisters did. If you can't talk to a mom or older sister, talk to a school nurse or trusted friend who has already gotten her period. When your period comes, you may notice a feeling of wetness in your underwear. You may even feel liquid flowing out of your vagina, or you may not notice anything at all. If you have a blood phobia and you're worried about how you'll react, try thinking of it this way: this isn't blood like from a wound or injury. The blood from your period is actually a sign that you're healthy. The drugstore or grocery store usually has an entire aisle dedicated to feminine hygiene products (pads, tampons, pantyliners). Don't be overwhelmed by all the choices; as you get to know your flow, you'll have a better idea of which product works best for you. To start out, look for pads that aren't too bulky or noticeable and has light or medium absorbency..  Pads are probably the easiest thing to start out with; you'll have enough to think about without worrying about how to insert a tampon. Practice putting a pad in your underwear before you have your period. If you notice discharge in your underwear, use that to figure out where the middle of the pad should be.  Some websites offer coupons or even free samples or period \\"starter kits\\" for you to keep on-hand. If you'd rather use a tampon or a menstrual cup during your first period, that's completely fine. It's important that you are comfortable with whichever protection you choose. If you're embarrassed about buying pads, just go up to the register with a few other items, and busy yourself looking at candy while the cashier rings you up. Remember that the cashier really doesn't care what you are buying and it's nothing new or shocking to him or her. With all the time you spend at school, playing sports, going to friend's houses, and doing other activities, it's possible, even likely, you will get your period while you are away from home. It may give you peace of mind to know you always have a pad with you wherever you are, just in case.   If you're worried about someone going through your book bag and finding your stash or things falling out, get a makeup bag or pencil case to store your period supplies. You may want to hide a pair of underwear and a resealable plastic bag in your locker in case you get your period at school and need to change your panties. You can rinse the soiled pair in cold water and put them in the bag to take home. You may also want to keep a little bottle of ibuprofen or other over-the-counter pain medication in your locker, just in case you get cramps. Just make sure your school policy allows this so you don't get in trouble. While there's no single indication that your period is arriving, you won't really know until it comes; your body may give you signs that it is preparing to menstruate. A stomach or backache, cramps in your abdomen, and sore breasts can all be signs that you are getting your period.  Women can get their first periods as early as 8 and as old as 16. Most usually get theirs around the age of 11 or 12. Women usually get their periods about two years after they begin developing breasts. You may notice a thick, white discharge in your underpants up to 6 months before getting your first period. Your period usually comes after you have reached 100 pounds (7 stone).  If you are underweight, this may delay your period. If you are overweight, you may begin your period sooner.

The full sentence would read as follows: \\"The cruise itinerary was changed to replace the movie with the musical, as the musical was skyrocketing in popularity.\\" This choice indicates that the cruise organizers decided to alter the entertainment schedule on the ship to accommodate passengers' growing interest in the musical. The decision to substitute the movie with the musical implies that the cruise management recognized the potential for increased satisfaction among guests by providing a more in-demand form of entertainment. Such changes are often made in response to rising trends or unforeseen events, as cruise lines strive to meet the needs and preferences of their passengers. By monitoring interest in various forms of entertainment, cruise organizers can adapt their itineraries accordingly to ensure a memorable and enjoyable experience for all guests on board. In this instance, replacing the movie with the musical was likely seen as a strategic choice to both capitalize on its popularity and position the cruise as a dynamic and flexible entertainment provider. By making these adjustments, cruise organizers demonstrate their commitment to consistently evaluate and refine their programming to accommodate passengers' changing preferences, ensuring that guests can fully engage with the onboard experience. Furthermore, the skyrocketing popularity of the musical may be attributed to a variety of factors, such as its timeless appeal, talented performers, or recent global events that have reinvigorated interest in the genre.

Feel the pads of the kitten's feet and place your finger in the kitten's mouth. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? kittens will die if they drink cold milk when they're warm Options: I. Yes; II. It's impossible to say; III. No;","output":"III. No; The statement \\"kittens will die if they drink cold milk when they're warm\\" does not directly follow from the given text. It is not accurate to conclude that kittens will die from drinking cold milk when they're warm. However, it can potentially cause digestive issues and possibly harm them if they are already cold. To elaborate further on how to feed newborn kittens commercial milk replacer, follow these detailed steps: 1. Prepare the milk replacer: Read the instructions on the commercial milk replacer package carefully and follow them to prepare the milk. This usually involves mixing the powder with warm water, and the proportions might vary according to different products. 2. Warm the milk replacer: The milk must be warmed to a suitable temperature (around 95-100°F (35-38°C)) before feeding it to the kittens, as cold milk can be harmful to them. You can use a bottle warmer or place the bottle in a bowl of warm water until the milk reaches the desired temperature. Shake the bottle gently to ensure even heat distribution. 3. Test the kitten's temperature: As mentioned earlier, make sure the kitten is not cold before feeding. If the kitten feels cold to touch, warm it up using a heating pad, warm water bottles, or by simply holding it close to your body. Keep in mind that a kitten's body temperature should be between 95-99°F (35-37°C) to ensure safe feeding. 4. Prepare the kitten for feeding: Place the kitten on its stomach on a towel or other soft surface. This will mimic the natural nursing position and help the kitten feed comfortably. 5. Use a suitable bottle and nipple: Use a bottle specifically designed for feeding kittens or a small pet nursing bottle, with a hole in the nipple that is just big enough for a steady drip when the bottle is inverted. 6. Feed the kitten: Gently insert the bottle nipple into the kitten's mouth and allow the kitten to latch on. Hold the bottle at a 45-degree angle to prevent air from entering the kitten's digestive system. Feed the kitten slowly and ensure that it is swallowing the milk. 7. Monitor the feeding amount and frequency: Newborn kittens typically need to be fed every 2-4 hours, depending on their age and size. Consult a veterinarian about the appropriate feeding schedule and amount. Maintain a feeding chart to keep track of the feedings. 8. Burp the kitten: After each feeding, gently burp the kitten by placing it against your shoulder and gently patting its back to release any trapped air in its stomach. 9. Clean the kitten: Newborn kittens require help to stimulate urination and defecation. Use a warm, wet cloth or cotton ball to gently rub the kitten's genital and anal area after each feeding. 10. Keep the kittens clean and warm: Make sure the kittens are in a clean, warm, and draft-free environment. Use a heating pad or warm water bottles to maintain a consistent temperature around the kittens. 11. Regularly visit a veterinarian: Schedule regular check-ups with a veterinarian to ensure the kittens are growing and developing properly. The veterinarian can also provide guidance for any adjustments needed in the feeding process. Remember that while feeding newborn kittens commercial milk replacer is a viable option, a mother cat's milk is always the best and most nutritious choice. Always seek professional guidance or advice from a veterinarian for the proper care of newborn kittens."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The film reflects on the fall of Emperor Haile Selassie and on the effects of that regime change relative to Ethiopian history and society. Through a broader lens, the film Teza focuses on the ways in which political upheaval and social change have impacted cultures and nations across the larger African Diaspora.Told mainly through a series of flashbacks, Teza follows the personal narrative of Anberber, who, after leaving Ethiopia for Germany to become a doctor, is led to return to his home village by lingering spirits and haunting visions from his childhood. Using the power of memory as its primary device, Teza recounts the historical circumstances that have framed the context in which contemporary Ethiopia exists.The movie chronicles Anberber's internal struggle to stay true--both to himself and to his homeland--but above all, the film explores the possession of memory, a right that humanity mandates that each of us have--the right to own our pasts.

If there are any, then again, it won't be prime. 3. 14744 is even (since it ends in a 4), which means it is divisible by 2. Therefore, it has at least three factors: 1, 2, and 14744. As I have found that 14744 has more than two factors, I can now conclude it is not a prime number. So the output is 'No'."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Eric Garth Hudson (born August 2, 1937) is a Canadian multi-instrumentalist. As the organist, keyboardist and saxophonist for Canadian-American rock group the Band, he was a principal architect of the group's unique sound. Hudson has been called \\"the most brilliant organist in the rock world\\" by Keyboard magazine. As of 2018, Hudson and fellow musician Robbie Robertson are the last original members of The Band who are still alive. Under the strict supervision of Hawkins, the Hawks became an accomplished band. They split from Hawkins in 1963, recorded two singles and toured almost continually, playing in bars and clubs, usually billed as Levon and the Hawks. Hudson started work as a session musician in 1965, playing on John Hammond, Jr.'s So Many Roads along with Robertson (guitar) and Helm (drums).  In August 1965, they were introduced to Bob Dylan by manager Albert Grossman's assistant, Mary Martin. In October, Dylan and the Hawks recorded the single \\"Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?\\", and in January 1966 they recorded material with Dylan for what would turn into the Blonde on Blonde album. Dylan recruited the band to accompany him on his controversial 1966 \\"electric\\" tour of the United States, Australia and Europe. (An album of Dylan's 1966 performance with his band, The \\"Royal Albert Hall\\" Concert, was finally released in 1998.) Subsequent to Bob Dylan's motorcycle accident in July 1966, the group settled in a pink house in West Saugerties, New York, near Woodstock. Dylan was a frequent visitor, and Hudson's recordings of their collaborations resulted in The Basement Tapes.  By 1968, the group recorded its debut album, Music from Big Pink. The album was recorded in Los Angeles (at Capitol) and New York (at A&R Studio). Capitol originally announced that the group would be called the Crackers, but when Music From Big Pink was released they were officially named the Band. The album includes Hudson's organ showcase, \\"Chest Fever\\", a song that in the Band's live shows would be vastly expanded by a solo organ introduction, entitled \\"The Genetic Method\\", an improvisational work that would be played differently at each performance. An example can be heard on the live album Rock of Ages. Hudson is also adept at the accordion, which he played on some of the group's recordings, such as \\"Rockin Chair\\", from \\"The Band\\"; the traditional \\"Ain't No More Cane\\", from \\"The Basement Tapes\\"; Dylan's \\"When I Paint My Masterpiece\\"; and Bobby Charles's \\"Down South in New Orleans\\" during the Last Waltz. His saxophone solo work can be heard on such songs as \\"Tears of Rage\\" (from Big Pink) and \\"Unfaithful Servant\\" (from The Band). Hudson is credited with playing all of the brass and woodwinds on the studio version of \\"Ophelia\\", from the 1975 album Northern Lights - Southern Cross as well. This album, the first to be recorded in the Band's Shangri-La recording studio in Malibu, California, also saw Hudson adding synthesizers to his arsenal of instruments.  Hudson provided innovative accompaniment. For example, the song \\"Up on Cripple Creek\\" features Hudson playing a clavinet through a wah-wah pedal to create a swampy sound reminiscent of a Jew's harp or the croak of a frog. This clavinet-wah wah pedal configuration was later adopted by many funk musicians.  After years of continuous touring, the Band made its final bow as a touring band with a lavish final concert on Thanksgiving Day 1976 at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, an all-star tribute concert documented in The Last Waltz. What albums was he on?","output":"According to the article, Eric Garth Hudson, as a principal member of the rock group the Band, contributed to numerous albums. These included: 1. \\"So Many Roads\\" by John Hammond, Jr where he worked as a session musician. 2. \\"Blonde on Blonde\\" with Bob Dylan, where they recorded material. 3. An album of Bob Dylan's 1966 performance with his band, The \\"Royal Albert Hall\\" Concert, released in 1998. 4. \\"The Basement Tapes\\", which was a result of collaborations with Bob Dylan. 5. \\"Music from Big Pink\\", which was the debut album of the group. 6. \\"Rock of Ages\\", where an example of Hudson's organ showcase can be heard. 7. \\"Northern Lights - Southern Cross\\", where Hudson is credited with playing all of the brass and woodwinds on the studio version of \\"Ophelia\\". 8. \\"The Last Waltz\\", which documented the Band's final concert as a touring band.

Article: In the 1880s, people drank John Pemberton's tonic to cure headaches. It wasn't a very popular drink, and he sold only about a dozen drinks a day. That's why Pemberton was willing to sell the rights to his medicinal drink. The buyer, Asa Griggs Candler, paid just  2,300 for the rights to Coca-Cola.

Students who get scores at or above 85 percent on all the activities can get a Presidential Physical Fitness Award. The test encourages students to live a healthy and active life. Students taking the test are really testing their limits, according to the US National Association for Sport and Physical Education. China has a similar test: the physical education(PE) test. Beginning at the age of 7, students in China are tested twice a year to check if they are healthy and strong. They also finish activities like the endurance run, sit-ups and the shuttle run. However, unlike students in the US who get awards, Chinese students get points in PE tests. The highest score is 100. For junior school students, the PE test is more important because it is worth 30 to 40 points in the entrance exam for senior high school. In order to get a good score, most students begin to prepare for the test in their junior one year. Question: The Chinese PE tests and the American Presidential Fitness tests are similar in   _ Options: A: Students are tested twice a year. B: Students get awards. C: Students get scores. D: Students must finish push-ups. Answer:","output":"A: Students are tested twice a year."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: A 14-year-old British student is packing for the next day of school: textbooks, notebooks, pens, 250 grams of flour, an egg and some cooking oil. Wait, what? It's not a joke. From September, cookery will be a compulsory   course for kids aged 7-14 in the UK. Primary school students will learn how to put things together and make simple, healthy food. At high school, students will then master a number of different meals. They will also learn some cooking skills including baking. Britain is sometimes known as a country with bad food and unhealthy eating habits. These new courses are part of the country's effort to bring healthy food back onto the table. \\"One in four British families no longer has a table that everyone can eat around. One out of every two meals we eat is eaten alone. Only four out of ten of us enjoy eating meals with our children,\\" British writer Joanna Blythman wrote in her book Bad Food Britain: How A Nation Ruined Its Appetite   in 2006.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:Question: What is the worst part of playing games? Options: - learning - happiness - competition - losing - fatigue  The answer is \\"losing\\" because A:","output":"Losing is often considered the worst part of playing games for several reasons. While all the other options mentioned have their place and significance in the gaming experience, losing can cause negative emotions and impacts that overshadow their positive aspects. 1. Negative emotions: Losing in a game can trigger various negative emotions such as frustration, disappointment, anger, and sadness. While it is natural to experience some degree of emotional upheaval when losing a game, these emotions can sometimes be overwhelming, especially for those who are highly competitive or invest a significant amount of time and effort into their gaming. 2. Impact on self-esteem: Frequent losses can take a toll on a player's self-esteem and confidence. Self-doubt may set in as players start to question their abilities and skills in the game. This may hinder future performance and create a negative cycle of continued poor performance and further loss of confidence. 3. Decreased motivation: Losing can be demotivating as it may seem as though the effort put into the game has gone to waste. This can lead to a decrease in motivation to continue playing the game or engage in other similar activities, making it difficult for players to bounce back and improve their skills. 4. Competitive toxicity: Competition is an inherent part of playing games, and it can be enjoyable and motivating for many. However, losing can breed toxicity among players, with blame-shifting, negative comments, and even harassment occurring as a result. This toxic environment can further ruin the gaming experience for those already dealing with the emotional impact of losing. 5. Social implications: Losing can also have social consequences, especially in group gaming situations. Players may experience isolation or exclusion from the group due to their perceived weak performance or frequent losses. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and negatively impact their overall gaming experience and social relationships. 6. Fatigue: While fatigue is listed as a separate option, it plays a significant role in losing. When players are tired, they may not be able to perform their best in games, leading to more losses. This can result in a frustrating cycle of not being able to break away from the losing streak. While losing is a natural part of playing games, it is important for players to maintain a healthy and balanced perspective on winning and losing. This can help mitigate the negative impacts of losing and encourage personal growth and improved skills in the game. It is also important to remember that games are meant to be fun, and while competition can provide additional drive and excitement, it should not overshadow the overall enjoyment of the gaming experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

One night, Old Major, the prize boar and the second-oldest on the farm, calls the animals on the farm for a meeting, where he compares the humans to parasites and encourages the animals to break free from their tyrant's influence, while reminding them that they must hold true to their convictions after they have gained freedom. With that, he teaches the animals a revolutionary song before collapsing dead mid-song to the animals' horror. The next morning, Jones neglects to feed the animals for breakfast, and they decide to break into the storehouse to help themselves. When Jones wakes up and attempts to intimidate them with his whip, the animals revolt and drive the drunken and irresponsible Mr. Jones away from the farm, renaming it \\"Animal Farm\\". They set to work destroying every trace of the farmer's influence, mainly the weapons used against them. The people of the surrounding area rally against them, but are beaten back after a fierce fight. A subsequent investigation of the farmhouse leads them to concede against living there, though one of the head pigs, an antagonistic boar named Napoleon, takes interest in the abandoned house, and even more so in a litter of puppies left motherless. The Seven Commandments of Animalism are written on a wall of the barn to illustrate their community's laws. The most important is the seventh, \\"All animals are equal.\\" All the animals work, but the workhorse, Boxer, his friend Benjamin the donkey, and the film's protagonist, put in extra work. Snowball attempts to teach the animals reading and writing; food is plentiful, and the farm runs smoothly. The pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership, and set aside special food items ostensibly for their personal health. Napoleon takes the pups and trains them privately.

Then she went into the kitchen and grabbed what she needed before going back up to her room quietly. She switched on the TV and started eating...and eating...for hours, until it was all gone. What Emily didn't know at the time was that she was suffering from an illness called binge-eating disorder(BED) . For years, Emily didn't tell anyone what she was doing. She felt ashamed, alone, and out of control. Why don't famous people confess   to BED, as they do to _ ? It's simple: There's a stigma involved. \\"Overeating is seen as very bad, but dieting to be skinny is seen as positive and even associated with determination,\\" says Charles Sophy, a doctor in Beverly Hills , California. \\"Some parents or friends may look at a teen with BED and think, 'Oh, a good diet and some will-power will do the trick.' But that's not true,\\" says Dr.Ovidio Bermudez , a baby doctor at the Eating Recovery Center in Denver. \\"Eating disorders are real physical and mental health issues; it's not about willpower.\\" The focus in treating BED shouldn't be on weight, because as with all eating disorders, the behaviors with food are a symptom of something deeper. Like most other diseases, genetics may play a big part in who gets BED and who doesn't. If you have a close relative with an eating disorder, that means you're more likely to develop an eating disorder of your own. Besides, many people with BED have tried at some point or another to control it by going on a diet, but paying more attention to food doesn't help. And it might even make things worse, like it did for Carla, who's 15 now and is recovering from BED. \\"My parents would always tease me about my weight, so when I was 14, I went on a very restrictive diet,\\" she says. When you can't have something, you only want it more, so every time Carla would have a bite of something that wasn't allowed on her strict diet. She would quickly lose control and binge  .

Despite this \\"stumbling block\\", Bright said that Windows 8's interface worked well in some places, but began to feel incoherent when switching between the \\"Metro\\" and desktop environments, sometimes through inconsistent means. Tom Warren of The Verge wrote that the new interface was \\"as stunning as it is surprising\\", contributing to an \\"incredibly personal\\" experience once it is customized by the user, but had a steep learning curve, and was awkward to use with a keyboard and mouse. He noted that while forcing all users to use the new touch-oriented interface was a risky move for Microsoft as a whole, it was necessary in order to push development of apps for the Windows Store. Others, such as Adrian Kingsley-Hughes from ZDNet, considered the interface to be \\"clumsy and impractical\\" due to its inconsistent design (going as far as considering it \\"two operating systems unceremoniously bolted together\\"), and concluded that \\"Windows 8 wasn't born out of a need or demand; it was born out of a desire on Microsoft's part to exert its will on the PC industry and decide to shape it in a direction—touch and tablets -- that allows it to compete against, and remain relevant in the face of Apple's iPad.\\" Answer:","output":"The \\"stumbling block\\" that Bright mentioned was Windows 8's system of hot corners and edge swiping not being very obvious due to the lack of instructions provided by the operating system on the functions accessed through the user interface."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Former president was on \\"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\\" Thursday. He says inclusion of Sunnis in Iraqi government is essential to defeating ISIS. Stopping the Ebola outbreak in West Africa \\"will take a Herculean effort\\" Article:","output":"Title: Bill Clinton's Perspective on Iraq, ISIS, and the Ebola Outbreak Former President Bill Clinton made a guest appearance on \\"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\\" last Thursday, where he offered his insights on the ongoing conflict in Iraq, the fight against the terrorist group ISIS, and the global effort to combat the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. During the interview, Clinton stated that the United States cannot win a land war in Iraq, but emphasized that the people of Iraq can, and the US should play a supportive role in their effort to reclaim their country. He highlighted the critical importance of including the Sunni Muslim population in the Iraqi government as a key strategy for defeating ISIS. \\"We can't win a land war in Iraq, but they can and we can help them,\\" Clinton said. This statement reflects the reality of the difficult political landscape in Iraq and elucidates Clinton's concern that a direct military intervention by the US would likely result in a protracted conflict with no clear end in sight. Instead, the former president argued that integrating the Sunni populace into the political fabric of Iraq would unite the various factions in the country, fostering a collaborative environment in which they can effectively push back against the extremist group. Clinton urged that the inclusion of Sunnis in the Iraqi government is essential to the long-term stability of the region and the ultimate eradication of ISIS. His position underscores the importance of addressing the root causes of the conflict, which include sectarian divisions, political marginalization, and a lack of social and economic opportunities for disenfranchised communities. By addressing these underlying issues, the Iraqi government can build a stronger foundation from which to launch an effective resistance against ISIS and rebuild their country. During his interview, the former president also underscored the necessity of a \\"Herculean effort\\" to tackle the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. This devastating disease has claimed thousands of lives and continues to spread rapidly throughout the region, posing global health and security risks. Clinton highlighted the need for a coordinated international response to combat the epidemic. He argued that only through the combined efforts of governments, non-governmental organizations, and global health agencies could we hope to contain the virus and prevent an even more catastrophic humanitarian crisis. In both the fight against ISIS and the battle to contain the Ebola outbreak, Clinton emphasized the importance of multilateral collaboration and the necessity of focusing on the root causes of these problems. The former president's appearance on \\"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\\" provided valuable insight into policy approaches that prioritize long-term stability over short-term military victories and underscore the necessity for global solidarity in the face of daunting challenges. In conclusion, Bill Clinton's perspective on the current crises in Iraq and West Africa highlights the crucial importance of collaboration, inclusivity, and addressing the root causes of conflicts and epidemics rather than simply responding to their symptoms. By employing this approach, the international community can create lasting solutions and prevent the recurrence of these devastating problems. Whether it's the fight against ISIS in Iraq or the battle to contain the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, Clinton's insights serve as a reminder that only through unity, dedication, and a focus on the core issues can we hope to create a more stable, secure, and healthy world."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

For now, just go and turn on the shower. Get the water nice and warm and think about how good it would feel to climb inside. You'll probably find it much easier to shower once you're actually in the bathroom and have everything all ready to go.  The hardest part often lies in simply taking the first step. Remember, the only thing holding you back is lethargy. With that out of the way, nothing can stop you. At this point, it will probably feel silly to have gone to all that trouble just to shut off the water and put your clothes back on. Since you're already in position, and it requires just as much effort to get dressed again, you might as well go ahead and hop in the shower. When you're lounging comfortably on the couch, the list of things you need to do to successfully bathe can seem overwhelming. Instead of trying to focus on lots of details at once, move things along a little at a time. If you find that you lack the motivation to shower, it can be helpful to keep in mind what happens when you don't bathe regularly. Dirt, oil and dead cells can build up on your skin, making you feel grimy and uncomfortable. If you go too long, this can cause problems like itching, clogged pores and skin infections. After a while, you can start to smell, as well, which can be a source of social embarrassment.  It can be bad for you to go too long without a bath or shower. Skin conditions like acne, dermatitis and chronic body odor can develop, making you look and feel unhealthy.  There's no need to shower every day. In fact, dermatologists now believe that it's actually better for you to only shower a few times a week. This may make dealing with the task easier for you. Summary:","output":"To do a big task, like taking a shower, start with small steps. First, turn on the water and get it warm. It will be easier once you're in the bathroom. Taking the first step is the hardest, but once you do it, it's silly not to finish. Break the task into little parts so it's not so overwhelming.

Plot title: Perfume: The Story of a Murderer Movie plot: The film begins with the sentencing of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw), a notorious murderer. Between the reading of the sentence and the execution, the story of his life is told in flashback, beginning with his abandonment at birth in a French fish market. Raised in an orphanage, Grenouille grows into a strangely detached boy with a superhuman sense of smell. After growing to maturity as a tanner's apprentice, he makes his first delivery to Paris, where he revels in the new odors. He focuses on the scent of a kindly girl selling plums (Karoline Herfurth) and startles her with his behavior. To prevent her from crying out, he covers the girl's mouth and unintentionally suffocates her. After realizing that she is dead, he strips her body naked and smells her until the scent fades.Afterwards, Grenouille becomes haunted by the desire to preserve the woman's scent forever. After making a delivery to a perfume shop, Grenouille amazes the Italian owner, Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), with his ability to create fragrances. He revitalizes the perfumer's career with new formulas, demanding only that Baldini teach him how to convert scents into perfume. Baldini explains that all perfumes are harmonies of twelve individual scents, and may contain a theoretical thirteenth scent. He also tells a story about a perfume discovered in an Egyptian tomb that was so perfect that it caused everyone in the entire world to briefly believe they were in paradise the moment the bottle was opened.When Grenouille discovers that Baldini's method of distillation will not capture the scents of all objects, such as iron chains and dead animals, he becomes depressed. After receiving a letter of presentation written by Baldini, Grenouille leaves to learn a different method in Grasse. En route to Grasse, Grenouille realises that he has no scent of his own, and is therefore a cipher.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  In 1967 Solti was invited to become music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was the second time he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.One of the members of the Chicago Symphony described it to Solti as \\"the best provincial orchestra in the world.\\" Many players remained from its celebrated decade under Reiner, but morale was low, and the orchestra was 5m in debt. Solti concluded that it was essential to raise the orchestra's international profile. He ensured that it was engaged for many of his Decca sessions, and he and Giulini led it in a European tour in 1971, playing in ten countries. It was the first time in its 80-year history that the orchestra had played outside of North America. The orchestra received plaudits from European critics, and was welcomed home at the end of the tour with a ticker-tape parade.The orchestra's principal flute player, Donald Peck, commented that the relationship between a conductor and an orchestra is difficult to explain: \\"some conductors get along with some orchestras and not others. We had a good match with Solti and he with us.\\" Peck's colleague, the violinist Victor Aitay said, \\"Usually conductors are relaxed at rehearsals and tense at the concerts. Solti is the reverse.

Today, we are going to talk about how much money Vick paid his agent between the years 2010 and 2012. First, let's understand who these people are. Vick is a famous sports player who makes a lot of money. Just like you have a favorite superhero, many people like to watch Vick play. Now, his agent is like a helper that takes care of important things for Vick, like talking to people who want Vick to play for their teams. To thank the agent for their help, Vick gives them some money.  Now, to know the exact amount Vick paid between 2010 and 2012, we would need to find specific information about their agreements. This information is usually private, which means it's a secret between Vick and his agent. But don't worry! We can still learn something from this. You see, agents often get a portion of the money that sports players earn, and this portion is called a percentage. It's a way to show their share, just like how you share your toys with your friends. Usually, the agents get around 3% to 5% of the money the players get from their team. To find out how much Vick paid his agent during that time, we need two things: 1. Vick's earnings (or how much money he got from playing) between 2010 and 2012. 2. The agent's percentage that was agreed upon by Vick and his agent. Sadly, we don't have that specific information, but now you know how it works!

Paul Getty never saw the Getty Villa. He died two years after his museum opened to the public in January 1974 in a new building modeled on an ancient Roman luxury home. It was not until after Getty’s death in June 1976 that he returned from his estate in England to his “ranch” on the Pacific Coast: he is buried there at the edge of the property on a private plot overlooking the ocean, alongside his eldest and youngest sons, George and Timothy, both of whom predeceased him. Following a renovation and reinstallation of the galleries, the Getty Villa opens a new chapter in its history. Although Getty never set eyes on his creation, the story of how he built the Villa and assembled his collection pervades the galleries even today. A suite of revamped rooms—Galleries 105 to 108—share this history. Featuring ancient works of art Getty bought himself along with archival documents, the new displays place the objects in their cultural contexts and shed light on Getty’s personal relationship to his museum and final resting place. From a Ranch House to an Ancient Villa Getty bought the 64-acre ranch—once part of the Rancho Boca de Santa Monica, an early-nineteenth-century 6,656-acre Mexican land grant—just after the end of World War II, intending it as a weekend retreat where his fifth wife Theodora (“Teddy”) could ride horses and he could display his growing art collection. He knew the area well, for he already owned a small house on the beach in nearby Santa Monica, just steps from the sprawling complex his friend and rival collector William Randolph Hearst had built for the actress Marion Davies. (The Davies estate is now the Annenberg Community Beach House, while Getty’s beach house has been replaced by a large modern condo complex, 270 Palisades Beach Road.)

This curb, a mundane yet significant component of urban architecture, subtly instructs city dwellers of their place, directing the chaotic harmony of city living elegantly.  Sitting alongside it, a red fire hydrant stands sentinel, robust and bold, an unflinching symbol of hope and protection, poised to aid in extinguishing fires that may occur from unfortunate incidents or potential hazards in this teeming, busy world. Its bright shade of red serves an essential function, acting as a beacon amidst the concrete jungle, thus enabling firefighters to locate it rapidly during emergencies, mitigating potential danger and reducing harm to life and property, serving as a silent but crucial partner in maintaining the life rhythm of the city. Radiating from its height, catching the glinting sun at the brightest milliseconds of the day, a metallic top spins, its reflective surface shimmering with the mirrored images of the bustling activity around. A symbol of play, it defies the monotony of life on the street, its innocent rotation a beacon of joyful delight for children who stop to witness its rhythmic twists and turns. In the grand scheme of the city, its frivolous flamboyance forms an essential piece of the urban texture, injecting a much-needed touch of whimsy and fun into the sometimes-grey cityscape.  Collectively, the curb, the hydrant, and the spinning top create a paradox of simplicity and complexity, where everyday objects collectively form a rich tapestry of urban living, each imbued with its unique narrative and role in shaping this urban symphony. They stand in their silent companionship, forming an unlikely trinity that guides us through the humdrum, yet unspeakably beautiful cacophony of our urbanscapes."},{"instruction":"Instructions: In this task, you are given a sentence or phrase in Xhosa.

Some are thankful for what he did during his nine years in Oklahoma City, others are burning his jersey, and still others are crying and would punch him in the face.      But the best video I’ve seen so far features a Thunder fan in a Durant jersey with “traitor” taped over the name, standing outside the Thunder arena holding a “Golden State?! That’s FucKD” sign, getting yelled at by a woman who thinks that Durant put Oklahoma City on the map, and a grown-ass man is allowed to make whatever decision he wants.      Happy Independence Day!      Advertisement      h/t Samantha Vicent ||||| Kevin Durant is joining the Golden State Warriors.      Saying he has experienced \\"by far the most challenging few weeks in my professional life,\\" Durant announced his decision to leave the Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday in a post on The Players' Tribune.      Editor's Picks Durant taking the easy road? Not so fast Kevin Durant might be joining a talented Warriors squad, but there's risk involved in his decision, J.A. Adande writes.      Fans burn Durant's jersey after he leaves OKC Thunder fans didn't take the news of Kevin Durant's leaving Oklahoma City to join the Warriors too well.      Warriors the greatest team ever with Durant? How much better are the Warriors with KD? How long is their title window? Kevin Pelton projects the NBA's new superteam, updated for the additions of David West and Zaza Pachulia. 2 Related      Durant is expected to sign a two-year, 54.3 million contract, sources told ESPN's Marc Stein. The deal will include a player option after the first year.      \\"The primary mandate I had for myself in making this decision was to have it based on the potential for my growth as a player -- as that has always steered me in the right direction,\\" Durant wrote. \\"But I am also at a point in my life where it is of equal importance to find an opportunity that encourages my evolution as a man: moving out of my comfort zone to a new city and community which offers the greatest potential for my contribution and personal growth.      \\"With this in mind, I have decided that I am going to join the Golden State Warriors.\\"      After Durant signs with Golden State, two-time reigning MVP Stephen Curry will be the fourth-highest-paid player on the Warriors. Durant will be No. 1, followed by Klay Thompson (16.6 million), Draymond Green (15.3 million) and Curry (12.1 million), who can become a free agent after next season.      Green told The Undefeated's Marc J. Spears in a text message that he was ecstatic the Warriors landed Durant. He tweeted to express his enthusiasm about his new teammate.      Welcome to THE FAMILY @KDTrey5 let's just do what we are setting out to do!! #Blockoutthenoise — Draymond Green (@Money23Green) July 4, 2016      \\"I'm excited about the opportunity to add one of the best players in the world to our team and welcome him to our brotherhood!

Warriors' odds jump with Durant After Kevin Durant's announcement that he will join Golden State, the Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook has moved the Warriors' odds to win next season's title from 3-2 to 4-5, making them an overwhelming favorite. The Thunder's odds dropped from 8-1 to 30-1 at the Westgate. The SuperBook also opened the Warriors' season win total for the 2016-17 campaign at 68.5.

Warriors coach Steve Kerr was in Hawaii and said he learned about Durant's decision to join Golden State via The Players' Tribune, ESPN's Ramona Shelburne reported.      The Warriors plan to renounce their rights to Harrison Barnes, sources told Stein, to help clear the salary-cap space needed to sign Durant. That will make Barnes an unrestricted free agent on Thursday. Barnes, sources told Stein, remains on course to sign with the Dallas Mavericks, who reached a verbal agreement with the 24-year-old on a four-year max deal worth 94.4 million, no matter what happened with Durant.      The Mavericks also have agreed to a trade with the Warriors to acquire center Andrew Bogut and his 2016-17 contract, with a base value of just over 11 million. Just before Durant's Players' Tribune post, Bogut removed references to the Warriors from his Twitter page.      Golden State will renounce its rights to center Festus Ezeli, which will make him an unrestricted free agent, but guard Shaun Livingston was told by the Warriors that he won't be traded, sources told Spears. Golden State also agreed to a one-year, 2.9 million deal with Zaza Pachulia, according to a report by The Vertical.      Thunder general manager Sam Presti expressed his team's disappointment over Durant's departure in a statement.      \\"Kevin made an indelible mark on the Thunder organization and the state of Oklahoma as a founding father of this franchise,\\" Presti said. \\"We can't adequately articulate what he meant to the foundation of this franchise and our success. While clearly disappointing that he has chosen to move on, the core values that he helped establish only lead to us thanking him for the many tangible and intangible ways that he helped our program.\\"      Presti later said the team had a pretty good idea that Durant was moving on even before its final meeting with him in the Hamptons on Sunday.      \\"Even when we were relatively sure it probably wasn't going to go our way, eight staff members and our owner stayed overnight in New York just to be there and to kind of finish it out,\\" Presti said at a news conference in Oklahoma City on Monday evening.      \\"We've been there for every first in his career, and we wanted to finish it out the right way by being present whenever that decision was made, regardless of how it turned out.\\"      Presti said he was alerted to Durant's final choice in a phone call from Durant on Monday morning a few minutes before the announcement.      \\"It was disappointing, it was hurtful; but at the end of the day, it was what he felt was best for him,\\" Presti said.      The Thunder will take some time before making any roster decisions, particularly related to All-Star point guard Russell Westbrook's future, sources told ESPN's Brian Windhorst.      The biggest catch on the free-agent market, Durant met with six teams over the past three days: Oklahoma City, Golden State, San Antonio, Boston, Miami and the Los Angeles Clippers. The Warriors held their meeting with Durant on Friday.      On Saturday, Durant spoke with NBA legend Jerry West, a member of the Warriors' executive board, on the phone, sources told ESPN's Chris Broussard. West outlined the reasons he thought Golden State would be the ideal fit for the superstar forward.      Kevin Durant is joining the Warriors after his Thunder took Golden State to the brink of elimination in the Western Conference finals last season. Ezra Shaw/Getty Images      Durant, 27, has spent all nine seasons of his career with the Thunder organization. He won the MVP in 2014, has been named first-­team All-­NBA five times and has made seven All-­Star teams. He has appeared in four Western Conference finals and one NBA Finals, in which he lost in five games to the Heat in 2012.      \\"I'm from Washington D.C. originally, but Oklahoma City truly raised me,\\" Durant wrote. \\"It taught me so much about family, as well as what it means to be a man. There are no words to express what the organization and the community mean to me and what they will represent in my life and in my heart forever. The memories and friendships are something that go far beyond the game. Those invaluable relationships are what made this deliberation so challenging.      \\"It really pains me to know that I will disappoint so many people with this choice, but I believe I am doing what I feel is the right thing at this point in my life and my playing career.\\"      Durant bounced back last season to earn second­-team All-NBA honors after undergoing three surgeries to repair a Jones fracture on his right foot suffered before the 2014-­15 season, in which he was limited to 27 games before undergoing a season-­ending bone graft procedure in March. Without Durant, the Thunder missed the postseason.      With Durant back for 72 games last season, the Thunder improved to 55-27 and finished third in the West. The Thunder beat the Dallas Mavericks in five games in the opening round, upset the 67-­win Spurs in six games in the second round and pushed the Warriors to seven games in the Western Conference finals.      Durant averaged 28.2 points, 8.2 rebounds and 5.0 assists last season, and he scored at least 20 points in 67 straight games. In nine seasons, Durant has averaged 27.4 points, 7.0 rebounds and 3.7 assists per game.      Golden State set an NBA regular-season record with 73 wins and led the league in scoring last season, but the Warriors fell just short of a repeat NBA title and lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers in seven games.      ESPN staff writer Royce Young and The Associated Press contributed to this report. ||||| This has been by far the most challenging few weeks in my professional life. I understood cognitively that I was facing a crossroads in my evolution as a player and as a man, and that it came with exceptionally difficult choices. What I didn’t truly understand, however, was the range of emotions I would feel during this process.      The primary mandate I had for myself in making this decision was to have it based on the potential for my growth as a player — as that has always steered me in the right direction. But I am also at a point in my life where it is of equal importance to find an opportunity that encourages my evolution as a man: moving out of my comfort zone to a new city and community which offers the greatest potential for my contribution and personal growth. With this in mind, I have decided that I am going to join the Golden State Warriors.      I’m from Washington, D.C. originally, but Oklahoma City truly raised me. It taught me so much about family as well as what it means to be a man. There are no words to express what the organization and the community mean to me, and what they will represent in my life and in my heart forever. The memories and friendships are something that go far beyond the game. Those invaluable relationships are what made this deliberation so challenging.      It really pains me to know that I will disappoint so many people with this choice, but I believe I am doing what I feel is the right thing at this point in my life and my playing career.      I will miss Oklahoma City, and the role I have had in building this remarkable team. I will forever cherish the relationships within the organization — the friends and teammates that I went to war with on the court for nine years, and all the fans and people of the community. They have always had my back unconditionally, and I cannot be more grateful for what they have meant to my family and to me. ||||| Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE USA TODAY Sports' Sam Amick examines Durant's decision to leave the Oklahoma City Thunder to join Golden State. usa today sports      Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry (30, right) is congratulated by Oklahoma City Thunder forward Kevin Durant (35) after Game 7 of the Western conference finals. Durant has decided if he can't beat the Warriors, to join them. (Photo: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports)      The balance of power in the NBA remained in the Western Conference with Kevin Durant’s stunning decision to play for the Golden State Warriors.      But within the West, the scale has swung – almost impossibly so for a 73-win team with three All-Stars – even more in the Warriors’ favor for the 2016-17 season and beyond.      By adding Durant, one of the league’s best players and former MVP, to a roster with two-time MVP Steph Curry and All-NBA players Draymond Green and Klay Thompson, the Warriors are heavy favorites to win the championship next year after losing a dramatic seven-game Finals series to the Cleveland Cavaliers in June.      While some teams improved in the East, not one has improved enough to surpass the Cavs as the favorites to win the conference title season. There is a strong possibility the Warriors and Cavs will play in the Finals for a third consecutive time – something no two teams have done, not even the Boston Celtics-Los Angeles Lakers of the 1960s and 1980s.      San Antonio, which finished with a franchise-best 67 victories last season, fell further behind the Warriors with Durant’s decision.      Oklahoma City, which had a 3-1 lead on Golden State in the conference finals in May, just lost its star, and now has to ponder a long-term plan that might not include Russell Westbrook, who is a free agent next summer.      The Los Angeles Clippers maintained the status quo.      The Warriors can dominate in the West. It’s a dynasty in the making.      That doesn’t mean they will try to break their record of 73 regular-season victories. In fact, expect Golden State to take a more deliberate approach to the regular season, pacing itself for the two-month playoff run.      Now, the Warriors have work to do on the court. Incorporating four All-Stars into the lineup won’t be easy, especially on the offensive end. But that’s why Warriors coach Steve Kerr – as he has said before – is paid so well. It’s up to him and his coaching staff to get buy-in from those stars to play a certain way, to sacrifice for the good of the team.      But on the surface, that roster creates so many problems for opposing defenses.      Don’t think for a second Durant’s decision to leave small-market Oklahoma City for big-market Golden State sits well with the rest of the league.      The 2011 lockout, in part, sought to create better opportunities for small-market teams to compete. The league instituted tougher restrictions in the collective bargaining agreement, including harsher financial penalties for team spending above the luxury tax line.      As recently as June 2 just before Game 1 of the Finals, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “Creating a system that allows every team I’d say the equality — an equal opportunity to compete for championships. I think we’re never going to have NFL-style parity in this league. It is the nature of this league that certain players are so good that those teams are likely almost automatically if that player remains healthy to become playoff teams and especially mixed with other great players.”      But the influx of TV money gave teams that otherwise would not have had the financial flexibility to add a maximum-salary player the freedom to do just that.      Remember all that angst in 2010 about creating super teams after LeBron James joined the Miami Heat alongside Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh? Well, the Warriors just created the super team of all super teams in this era of the NBA.      Thunder general manager Sam Presti can’t be happy about the league’s inability to prevent a move like this from happening.      Silver knew the unprecedented rise in the salary cap, from 70 million in 2015-16 to 94 million in 2016-17, would create unintended circumstances. At the 2016 All-Star Game Silver said, \\"As I’ve said before, a dramatic increase in the cap, as we’re going to see next year, is not something we modeled when we designed this collective bargaining agreement. We'd prefer a system where teams are managing for cap room, and we'd prefer a system in which stars are distributed throughout the league as opposed to congregating in one market.\\"      Five years ago, NBA owners and front-office executives were not envisioning a scenario in which a team with three All-Stars could add a fourth.      But that’s what just happened, and 29 other teams, including the champion Cavs, are wondering how they’re going to beat Golden State in a seven-game series. |||||","output":"NBA star, Kevin Durant, has announced he will be leaving Oklahoma City Thunder for the Golden State Warriors.

The term \\"modestly made\\" suggests that the movie has a modest budget, a limited scope, or a simplistic approach. This expression could hold either a positive or negative sentiment, depending on the movie's genre and the expectations of the reviewer. For instance, a viewer may appreciate a modestly made film due to its simplicity or focus on storytelling over visual effects. On the other hand, the same term could be used as a critique if the movie lacked a level of refinement or extravagance expected by the audience. However, the presence of the word \\"but\\" implies a contrast or contradiction in the reviewer's opinion. It suggests that the reviewer has more to say about the film, which may alter or clarify the sentiment expressed in the initial part of the sentence. This additional context is crucial in establishing a more accurate assessment of the reviewer's sentiment.

Context: When she's in the mood to push my buttons, my significant other, the delightful and charming Ms. D, frequently alludes to the questionable timeline concerning my birth date. She derives much mirth from the fact that I was born something less than nine or ten months after my parents wed and hints that this indicates a certain amount of premarital hanky-panky. Standing on my dignity ('cause it's higher than the coffee table), my reply is that I have it on good authority that I owe my early entry into the world to Tabusintac Hill. Said hill was once considered to be an abomination of the first water. The Tabusintac, like all hills, had an up and a down. In this case, the up and down were distinguished from each other by a sharp curve at the bottom. The main North/South New Brunswick highway slavishly followed the hill's contours. If you were heading north, the road led you into a ravine and you were faced with a steep uphill incline that, in winter presented a challenge to at least half the vehicles trying to climb it. In true snow country fashion, steep, icy hills were conquered by getting a running start, building up a lot of speed and praying that Mr. Newton's rules concerning inertia would work in your favour. Headed south, the problem became keeping your car under control so that you didn't go shooting into the trees when the road curved to the left. My parents were taking a trip to the Miramachi in December of '56 and were driving a Pontiac borrowed from one of my father's friends. My mother was pregnant with a bundle of bad attitude and misery that would turn out to be me. I assume that my father was driving with that mix of panache and insouciance that my mother tended to describe as reckless behaviour. In any case, as he rounded the corner at the top of the hill, the road was apparently free of snow and ice and there was no reason to slowdown. Until the moose stepped out onto the road just ahead of them. Question: what I responded to mrs D Options:  A. I owe my early entry into the world to Tabusintac Hill  B.

It's impossible to say. While it is true that Hipmunk received increased media attention after Google announced its flight search service in September 2011, there isn't enough information provided to conclusively determine if Hipmunk's media attention was still quite low despite the increase.  Several factors can affect media attention, such as marketing efforts, competition within the online travel industry, and the changing landscape of technology. To make a more accurate assessment of Hipmunk's media attention, we would need to analyze data about its coverage in various media outlets, comparative growth trends, and its performance against competitors during that period. Additionally, \\"quite low\\" is a relative term, and to properly evaluate whether Hipmunk's media attention was still relatively low, we would need to establish a baseline or reference point for comparison. For example, comparing Hipmunk's media attention to a well-established online travel company or an industry average would help provide a better understanding of the level of Hipmunk's media presence during that time.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What three features of religious archiecture are mentioned in the paragraph?\\"  Context: \\"Few large stone buildings were constructed between the Constantinian basilicas of the 4th century and the 8th century, although many smaller ones were built during the 6th and 7th centuries. By the beginning of the 8th century, the Carolingian Empire revived the basilica form of architecture. One feature of the basilica is the use of a transept, or the \\"arms\\" of a cross-shaped building that are perpendicular to the long nave. Other new features of religious architecture include the crossing tower and a monumental entrance to the church, usually at the west end of the building.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The paragraph mentions three distinct features of religious architecture: 1. Transept: This is described as the \\"arms\\" of a cross-shaped building that are perpendicular to the long nave. In religious architecture, the transept serves as a distinct space within the church for various liturgical functions and often houses chapels, altars, and other elements relevant to the worship space. The mention of the transept showcases the influence of the cross shape on the design of these religious structures. 2. Crossing Tower: This is another feature of religious architecture that emerged during the period described in the paragraph. The crossing tower usually rises above the point where the transept and nave intersect, creating a focal point and an opportunity for vertical emphasis in the church's design. This element can serve various purposes, such as housing the church's bells or providing an inspiring visual symbol of the religious institution. 3. Monumental Entrance: The final feature mentioned is the monumental entrance to the church, typically located at the west end of the building. This element highlights the significance and grandeur of the religious structure, as it creates an impressive first impression for the worshippers and visitors entering the church. The monumental entrance could consist of intricately carved doors, ornate sculptures, or large-scale architectural elements framing the entrance, all aimed at elevating the overall experience of entering the sacred space. These three features – the transept, crossing tower, and monumental entrance – demonstrate the innovations in, and the importance of, religious architecture during the period between the Constantinian basilicas of the 4th century and the Carolingian Empire in the 8th century. The mention of these elements offers insight into the architectural evolution of religious spaces and their impact on societal and artistic values of the time."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The desert sky was on fire when the city came into view. Cerberus turned away from me and stuck his head out from the side of the jeep, his giant tongue flapping in the eighty mile an hour wind while I dialed Luna's number.

Please answer the following question: What do apples, pears and oranges all have in common? If you answered that they are all fruits you are absolutely correct. If you answered that they are all good for your health you are spot on again. Fruits used to be a staple in many diets, however in amongst all of the low carb and anti sugar chaos, many people are now avoiding them. In a rush to rid the diet of ‘toxic sugar’, fruit has fallen on the wayside. However, many studies have shown that fruit is not linked to any adverse health effects, quite the opposite in fact. Most recently researchers in Sweden discovered that eating a diet high in fruits could reduce the risk of an often lethal form of aortic aneurysm. The study collected data from over 80,000 people over a 13 year period and found that people eating at least two whole fruits per day, reduced the risk of developing  an abdominal aortic aneurysm by almost a third. The main fruits that were eaten were apples, pears, bananas, oranges and other citrus fruits. The fruits’ high antioxidant levels may offer protection by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Eating whole fruits can also reduced the risk of developing diabetes. Earlier this year a study published in the British Medical Journal revealed that certain whole fruits – in particular blueberries, grapes, apples and pears – could lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The study found that over an 18-year period, 6.5% of the 187,382 participants developed diabetes, but those consuming at least two serves of fruit per week reduced their risk by up to 23%. In the same study those who consumed two or more serves of fruit juice per day increased their risk of developing diabetes by as much as 21%. As Tim wrote in a previous blog post, this is reason why you should be eating your fruit, not drinking it According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

PUBLISHED:. 07:40 EST, 17 May 2013. |. UPDATED:. 07:55 EST, 17 May 2013. A grieving husband has been accused of assaulting a traffic warden who tried to ticket cars outside his home while he waited for his wife's funeral cortege. Angry relatives confronted the warden as he was allegedly preparing to issue them fines while they waited for the hearse carrying the body of cancer victim Rena Page, 64. Her stunned husband Mac Page, 66, challenged the official who later reported him to the police for assault. Stunned: Matthew Page, 39, with wife Kerrie outside his family's home where a traffic warden tried to issue tickets as they waited for his mother's funeral cortege. His father is accused of assaulting the warden. Four cars were briefly parked on a. single yellow line outside Mr Page's home in Hunstanton, Norfolk, as. the funeral cars moved into position. The family confronted the official who allegedly carried on noting the cars' details. A funeral director is also reported to have tried to intervene. Angry family members admit they challenged the warden but were stunned to later learn he had reported widower Mr Page for assault. Mr Page, a self-employed gardener, said yesterday: 'I can’t describe how I felt really. It was bad enough to bury someone at 64 after 48 years of marriage. This bloke didn’t show any compassion at all. Mourned: Relatives of Rena Page, 64, who died of cancer, have accused the warden of behaving heartlessly. 'If it was the middle of the season and there were lots of cars about, I could at least understand it a little bit, but he was just being a jobsworth. The last three years - watching my wife die of cancer - have been quite horrendous, now we have this to deal with on top. 'What I couldn’t believe is that when we rang to complain, his boss backed him up. How can anyone in authority back somebody like that up? It beggars belief.' Mr Page said he was happy to appear in court to give his version of events. His son Matthew Page, 39, who runs a chip shop, added: 'There was just a total lack of respect - and they wonder why they get a bad name. The worst thing was Mum never liked a fuss. This turned it all into a debacle. I cannot believe someone could be so insensitive.' Funeral director John Lincoln, who was leading the cortege, said: 'I have never known anything like this before. He might lose someone one day and I wonder how he would react if this sort of thing happened to him.' A West Norfolk Council spokesman confirmed discretion exists within its parking rules for occasions such as funerals, but refused to apologise until the outcome of the police investigation into the assault was known. The spokesman said: 'Following the incident referred to, a member of our staff reported an assault and the matter is now with the police. We await the outcome of any subsequent investigations.' The spokesman said no tickets were issued during the incident but that vehicles attending a funeral, 'are not exempt from parking rules. When we are made aware of a funeral, we work to accommodate the hearse and funeral cortege respectfully,' he added.Father-of-two Matthew Page has lodged an official complaint with the council.  A spokesman for Norfolk police confirmed the force was investigating a reported assault. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"1.

For weeks prior to the event I kept experiencing ‘visual disturbances.’ I felt when I was reading a newspaper or book a sense that my eyes were crossing. I’d feel aware right before it would occur and I would rush to look in a mirror only to discover my eyes were not crossing. I informed my OB who blamed it on the blood vessels in my eyes enlarging due to pregnancy. Ummm ok. You know more than me. Later I was told by a surgeon what I was experiencing was ‘textbook’ for the passing of blood clots through my occipital area of the brain! The feeling would eventually subside. I awoke one morning feeling ‘kind of fuzzy’ headed. Like I had slept too hard. I sat with my husband at the kitchen table for our morning coffee and newspaper and for no reason I could imagine I was unable to swallow my coffee and it dribbled out the left side of my mouth. My husband asked me what was going on and I apparently told him, I was ‘stroking’ out. He got up from the table assuming I was OK and went off to take his morning shower.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Zakariya Essabar, a Moroccan citizen, moved to Germany in February 1997 and to Hamburg in 1998, where he studied medical technology. Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership. Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it. One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a \\"good man\\" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by  Bin Laden. Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999. Abdelghani Mzoudi, also a Moroccan, arrived in Germany in the summer of 1993, after completing university courses in physics and chemistry. Mzoudi studied in Dortmund, Bochum, and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in 1995. Mzoudi described himself as a weak Muslim when he was home in Morocco, but much more devout when he was back in Hamburg. In April 1996, Mzoudi and Motassadeq witnessed the execution of Atta's will. During the course of 1999, Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive, speaking only in Arabic to conceal the content of their conversations. 87 When the four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to journey to Afghanistan late that year, it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation; no evidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time. Witnesses have attested, however, that their pronouncements reflected ample predisposition toward taking some action against the United States. In short, they fit the bill for  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM. Going to Afghanistan The available evidence indicates that in 1999, Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah decided to fight in Chechnya against the Russians.

Choices:  A). unacceptable  B). acceptable","output":"B). acceptable The given sentence, \\"Joe likes his bar, and Sally's patrons do too,\\" can be considered acceptable by the strictest standards when examined by a linguist. Here is a detailed explanation of why this sentence falls within the realm of grammatical acceptability. Firstly, let's break down the sentence to understand its structure and components: 1. \\"Joe likes his bar\\" is the independent clause, which can stand alone as a complete thought. It has a clear subject (Joe), a verb (likes), and an object (his bar). Moreover, the use of a possessive pronoun 'his' indicates the ownership of the bar by Joe. 2. The coordinating conjunction \\"and\\" is employed to connect the independent clause to the second part of the sentence. The use of \\"and\\" indicates that the two clauses will be related in some manner. 3. \\"Sally's patrons\\" serves as the subject of the second part of the sentence. Here, the use of the possessive noun form (\\"Sally's\\") accurately signifies that the patrons belong to or are associated with Sally. 4. \\"do too\\" acts as a verb phrase in the latter part of the sentence, with the auxiliary verb \\"do\\" serving to avoid repetition of the main verb \\"like\\" from the first clause. The adverb \\"too\\" establishes agreement or similarity with the action described earlier in the sentence and ensures the second part is connected in meaning to the first part. Thus, the sentence maintains a cohesive meaning and adheres to grammatical standards. The structure of the sentence, the choice of conjunction, and the proper use of pronouns and possessive forms contribute to its acceptability. Moreover, this sentence avoids ambiguity and effectively conveys the intended message: both Joe and Sally's patrons share a liking for Joe's bar. Therefore, by considering the rules of grammar and the elements within the sentence, a linguist would deem it acceptable."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They both share a unique bond - being drawn together despite Edward being a nearly immortal vampire.  Bella, a normal human teenager, has always displayed reluctance towards the idea of marriage, despite her love for Edward. Haunted by her parents' tumultuous marriage and eventual divorce, she believes that the institution might be a recipe for disaster. However, there's a twist to their love story; in order for them to be together for eternity, Bella must become a vampire. Edward, a centuries-old vampire, can't bear the thought of turning Bella into a creature of the night, knowing it will strip away her humanity. As they dance around the issue, their love grows stronger, and Bella becomes more drawn to the idea of sharing eternity with Edward. One day, a new threat emerges - a ruthless vampire hunter named Victor who has set his sights on killing Edward and his family, the Cullens. Bella, realizing the real danger her loved ones are in, starts to reconsider her priorities. The story takes a turn when, during a fierce confrontation with Victor, Bella is gravely injured and the vampire hunter exposes the hidden world of vampires to the general public. Now, the Cullen family - along with the town of Forks - must navigate this new reality where humans and vampires are forced to confront each other. With time running out and Victor still at large, Bella comes to a life-altering decision – she wants to join Edward and his family in their fight against Victor, and in order to do that, she must become one of them. Recognizing Edward's desire to protect her, she confronts him with her decision and they both decide to get married, as a symbol of their commitment to one another and their shared fight against evil. The wedding ceremony is bittersweet, as they know threads of their old life must be cut away - but the love between them is enough to give them strength. After converting to a vampire in the presence of her family, Bella and the Cullens join forces to defeat Victor and protect the humans and vampires alike. In the end, with Victor defeated, Bella and Edward find solace in their eternal life together. Through their powerful love story, the citizens of Forks come to accept the existence of vampires and begin to embrace a new, more harmonious world where humans and vampires peacefully coexist. Eternal Flame is a moving exploration of how love transcends all boundaries, even the constraints of time and life itself, and how the bond between Bella and Edward allows them to overcome their personal fears and challenges to protect each other and the ones they love."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Process:  - Animals and plants die in soft soil or mud - Sediment builds up over the remains - The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts - The remaining parts over the years are replaced with mineral - A fossil is formed -   suppose plants die in soft mud more often happens, how will it affect LESS fossils forming.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer is:","output":"- indirectly impacting a step of the process. In the given situation, if plants die in soft mud more often, it would initially appear as though it could lead to more fossil formation as more organic material is available. However, considering other factors, it might actually lead to less fossil formation, thus indirectly impacting the aforementioned process. Here's why: Fossil formation is a fairly rare event as it requires specific conditions. Not all plants that perish will become fossils, most will decompose before fossilization can occur. If more plants are dying and decomposing in the same location (the soft mud), it could potentially accelerate the rate of decomposition due to potentially increasing activities of decomposing organisms. This could thus decrease the chances of fossils forming, as decomposition might occur faster than the rate of sedimentation and mineralization required for fossil formation.  In addition, an increase in dying plants could alter the environment in ways that may not be favorable for fossil formation. For instance, the decomposition process could lead to a lowering of oxygen levels or alteration of the soil’s acidity, which might affect the fossilization process. Therefore, whilst the increasing rate of plants dying in the mud doesn't directly alter a step in the fossil formation process, it could indirectly impact it by changing the conditions required for fossilization to occur, and thus can lead to fewer fossils being formed."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The manager throws them away before anyone can get them .;","output":"[C]. The place is very popular and the caneles get sold out quick. There could be several reasons for the canelles being sold out at Canto 6 bakery when you go there, but the most plausible explanation is that the place is very popular, and the caneles get sold out quickly. This could be due to a combination of factors such as: 1. High demand: Caneles might be one of the most sought-after items at Canto 6 bakery, with people looking forward to savoring them. This results in a high demand for the product, causing them to sell out quickly. 2. Limited production: It's possible that the bakery produces a limited quantity of canelles each day to ensure their freshness and quality. If the production doesn't meet the demand, they will sell out faster. 3. Reputation: If Canto 6 has a stellar reputation for its canelles, it could attract a significant number of customers who specifically visit the bakery for this delicacy. Their fame would contribute to a rapid depletion of inventory. 4. Time of day: Since canelles are typically a breakfast or brunch item, they might sell out earlier in the day. By the time you visit the bakery, the majority of them may have already been purchased by other customers. 5. Regular customers: The bakery might have regular customers who always buy a specific amount of canelles, either to enjoy themselves or to sell at their own establishments. These customers could contribute to the quick sellout of the product. In conclusion, it is most likely that the popularity of the bakery and the high demand for their canelles cause them to sell out rapidly. To increase your chances of getting one, it might be a good idea to go earlier in the day and check if they have a specific time for preparing the canelles, so you can be there right when they're being freshly made."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate \\"The signature in Lisbon tomorrow will underline the commitment of all signatories to achieving ratification of the Treaty.\\" to Finnish?","output":"\\"Allekirjoitus Lissabonissa huomenna korostaa kaikkien allekirjoittajien sitoutumista sopimuksen ratifioinnin saavuttamiseen.\\" In this translation, the sentence structure and word order have been preserved as close to the original English sentence as possible, while still maintaining the natural flow of the Finnish language. Here is a breakdown of the translation, word by word: - The signature = Allekirjoitus - in Lisbon = Lissabonissa - tomorrow = huomenna - will underline = korostaa (the Finnish word for \\"underline\\" is used in the same way as in English, meaning \\"to emphasize\\" in this context) - the commitment = sitoutumista (this is the partitive form of the noun 'sitoutuminen', meaning commitment in Finnish) - of all = kaikkien (an adjective that agrees with the following plural noun) - signatories = allekirjoittajien (a plural possessive form of the noun 'allekirjoittaja', signatory in Finnish) - to achieving = saavuttamiseen (this is the illative form of the noun 'saavuttaminen', which is derived from the verb 'saavuttaa', to achieve in Finnish) - ratification = ratifioinnin (the singular possessive form of the noun 'ratifiointi', ratification in Finnish) - of the Treaty = sopimuksen (the singular possessive form of the noun 'sopimus', treaty in Finnish). Thus, the translation might be more literally understood as: “The signature in Lisbon tomorrow emphasizes the commitment of all signatories to the achievement of the ratification of the Treaty.” This is stylistically different from the English sentence, but preserves the meaning and flows well in Finnish."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This one has a black color, just like the night sky, and a white collar, which is the part that wraps around our neck. Collars can be soft and comfy and help keep our necks warm too. Not to forget, our T-shirt has short sleeves, meaning it covers only a small part of our arms. This is perfect for when the sun is shining outside, but it's not too hot. How to wear our jacket and T-shirt: 1. Pick out your favorite jacket and the black T-shirt with a white collar from your closet. 2. Put on the black T-shirt first. Make sure the white collar is around your neck and the short sleeves are on your arms. You might need some help from a grown-up to make sure it fits just right. 3. Next, put on your jacket. Slide your arms through the sleeves, just like you're giving your jacket a big hug. Ask a grown-up to help you zip or button up your jacket if you need help. 4. Make sure everything feels nice and comfy. If you feel too hot or too cold, you can always change your clothes. 5. Finally, look in the mirror and give yourself a big smile. You did it!

Hypothesis: Two toddlers who want to be doctors when they grow up. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"No, we cannot directly conclude the hypothesis that the two toddlers want to be doctors when they grow up based on the premise you've provided. The premise states that the two toddlers, a boy and a girl, are engaging in a very common mode of play for kids their age - pretend play. They are using plastic doctor toys and giving an adult a make-believe medical examination. These activities can naturally invoke a great deal of amusement and joy for toddlers as it helps them to mimic adult roles and routines, explore social roles, and understand social norms and conventions. Furthermore, using doctor toys can teach children about empathy, nurturing and caring for others who are 'sick' or 'in discomfort.' However, this behavior does not inherently suggest a future career aspiration. Toddlers are generally not capable of long-term planning or thinking about their futures in a concrete way. They play pretend for a variety of reasons, such as entertainment, curiosity, an opportunity to feel empowered or in control, or mimicking scenes that they've seen in real life or in the media. They might play doctor one day, and then play chef, firefighter, astronaut, or superhero the next. While the toddlers are showing an interest in the activity at this point in time, it would be a leap to conclude that this play indicates concrete future career aspirations. They are, at this stage, more likely just exploring and mimicking the world around them, a common and important part of early childhood development. Overall, while we can say that the toddlers are engaged in imaginative play involving medical examinations, it's just as likely that they're simply copying what they've seen adults do, or recreating situations they've seen on TV, or even just using whatever toys were available at the time. To conclude that they want to be doctors based purely on this instance of play would be speculative without additional supporting information."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Especially if you're self-financing your small farm business, you may think a formal business plan isn't necessary. However, a formal business plan can help you start to think of your farm as a business and treat it seriously.  Rely on your market research to come up with profitability predictions. Keep in mind it typically takes small farms several years to get off the ground. If you plan on running your farm as a side-business or a hobby farm, a business plan can still help you organize the finances for your farm and keep it from taking over your personal funds. Once you've finished your business plan, have a business startup or financial advisor critique it and offer suggestions to improve. Look for someone who has extensive experience working with successful small farm businesses. Check with a government farm services office or a regional farm group if you're having a hard time finding a good advisor. Staff at any of those locations typically can provide a strong local recommendation or two. When you're starting out, you have the choice to run your small farm business as a sole proprietorship, an LLC, or a corporation. The form you choose depends on your business goals and the level of personal risk you want to assume.  If you organize your business as a sole proprietorship, your farm is not separate from you and your personal finances in any way. This may be the easiest option if you're just running your farm as a side-business and have a full-time job. A corporation gives you the most personal protection, but also is the most expensive and time-consuming form. You can incorporate at any time, so wait until your farm starts turning a profit. An LLC, or limited liability company, provides all of the benefits of a corporation and a sole proprietorship with none of the downsides of either. Choose this form if your goal is to make your living from your farm someday. Even if you don't hire any employees (although you probably will), you will need a separate tax ID number for your farm business so you can pay taxes on farm income.  If you're in the U.S., you can get an employer identification number (EIN) fairly easily. Simply answer a few questions about your business and you can get your EIN immediately. Write it down or print it out and keep it in a safe place. You may need a separate tax ID number for state or local taxes as well. If you haven't already made friends with staff at your nearest farm services office, now is the time to do so. Schedule an appointment to register your farm so you can take advantage of any government subsidies or benefits.  Bring property documents along with proof of personal identity and business organization documents. Once you're registered, make sure you report any changes in the ownership or organization of your business as soon as possible, and keep your contact information up to date. You may be required to file regular acreage reports and other documentation. Depending on the crops or livestock you're raising, the state or local government may require regular inspections and licensing of your farm operations.  For example, if you're selling crops to the public, you may need a license certifying that your storage facilities meet local health code requirements. Your local town or county government office is one way to find out what licenses are needed. You can also talk to neighboring farmers and find out from them what you'll need. Your state university agricultural extension program typically has specific information and resources to help you handle any licenses or permits you need at either the local or state level. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"The article discusses the importance of a formal business plan for small farm businesses, indicating that it allows for serious organization, treatment of the farm as a business, and financial control. It suggests seeking profitability predictions from a market research and having a startup advisor to proofread the business plan.

It also emphasizes the necessity of acquiring a separate tax ID (EIN) for the farm business and explains the process for getting an EIN in the U.S. Lastly, the article encourages farm registration in order to avail government subsidies, keeping updated with any changes, and the need for inspections, licensing, or permits, which could be obtained through local government offices or state university agricultural extension programs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the sentence \\"A woman carrying a bag with a little girl in a pink dress walking behind her and a man in a blue shirt walking towards her.\\", is the sentence \\"A group of people are walking.\\" a true sentence?","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"A group of people are walking.\\" is a true sentence based on the original description. In the original sentence, there are three individuals involved:  1. A woman carrying a bag 2. A little girl in a pink dress walking behind the woman 3. A man in a blue shirt walking towards the woman. The original sentence describes a scenario where these people are engaged in walking, although they may be walking in different directions. By describing this as \\"a group of people are walking,\\" the sentence accurately captures the action of walking being performed by multiple individuals (in this case, three people).  However, one should note that the term \\"group\\" could have different interpretations, and one might argue that since the man is walking towards the woman and girl, they might not necessarily be perceived as a cohesive unit or group. Despite this potential ambiguity, the sentence still remains true in its broadest interpretation of a group of people taking part in the action of walking. In summary, based on the original sentence, the statement \\"A group of people are walking\\" is indeed a true sentence as it accurately generalizes the actions of the individuals involved. However, it is important to note that the term \\"group\\" can have varying interpretations and may not fully capture the detailed dynamics and directions described in the original sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The body of a boy was found Friday afternoon near the wreckage of a plane crash in Lake Wales, Florida, raising the final death toll to six, officials said. The plane, which was carrying a husband, wife and their four children, went down Thursday. The other bodies had already been recovered. \\"We can tell you that none are now unaccounted for,\\" Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said. \\"It's just a tragic event of monumental proportion, but we're pleased that we're at least reuniting the entire family.\\" The last victim to be found was in thick underbrush about half a mile southwest of the main wreckage, Judd said. The flight originated at Treasure Cay Airport in the Bahamas and landed at St. Lucie County Airport at 10:15 a.m. Thursday to clear customs. The plane left St. Lucie just after noon, and the first 911 call came in at 12:36 p.m., said Judd. Its final destination was Junction City, Kansas. The plane began to break apart and crashed, going down in a remote, palmetto-covered stretch near Lake-Walk-In-The-Water that is not easily accessible, officials said. Rescuers and investigators used all-terrain vehicles to get to the scene. Plane parts were reported as far as four miles away. The cause of the crash is not clear but is under investigation, said Tim Monville, an investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board. \\"We have parts structurally separated. I don't know what that means yet. We'll have to investigate. That's what we're here for,\\" he said. The Polk County Sheriff's Office identified the family as Ronald Bramlage, 45; his wife, Rebecca Bramlage, 43; and their children, Brandon, 15; Boston, 13; Beau, 11; and Roxanne, 8. Boston was believed to be the last one found. The plane is a Pilatus PC-12/47 owned by Roadside Ventures LLC of Junction City. The Bramlage family is well-known in the Kansas State University community. Ronald and Rebecca Bramlage were both graduates, and Fred Bramlage, Ronald's father, was the lead contributor to the Bramlage Coliseum, a multipurpose arena that is home to the men's and women's basketball teams.

It was formerly known as Abaj Takalik; its ancient name may have been Kooja. It is one of several Mesoamerican sites with both Olmec and Maya features. The site flourished in the Preclassic and Classic periods, from the 9th century BC through to at least the 10th century AD, and was an important centre of commerce, trading with Kaminaljuyu and Chocolá. Investigations have revealed that it is one of the largest sites with sculptured monuments on the Pacific coastal plain. Olmec-style sculptures include a possible colossal head, petroglyphs and others. The site has one of the greatest concentrations of Olmec-style sculpture outside of the Gulf of Mexico.Takalik Abaj is representative of the first blossoming of Maya culture that had occurred by about 400 BC. The site includes a Maya royal tomb and examples of Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions that are among the earliest from the Maya region. Excavation is continuing at the site; the monumental architecture and persistent tradition of sculpture in a variety of styles suggest the site was of some importance.Finds from the site indicate contact with the distant metropolis of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico and imply that Takalik Abaj was conquered by it or its allies. Takalik Abaj was linked to long-distance Maya trade routes that shifted over time but allowed the city to participate in a trade network that included the Guatemalan highlands and the Pacific coastal plain from Mexico to El Salvador. Takalik Abaj was a sizeable city with the principal architecture clustered into four main groups spread across nine terraces. While some of these were natural features, others were artificial constructions requiring an enormous investment in labour and materials.

Q:  Bertie returns to London from several weeks in Cannes spent in the company of his Aunt Dahlia Travers and her daughter Angela. In Bertie's absence, Jeeves has been advising Bertie's old school friend, Gussie Fink-Nottle, who is in love with a goofy, sentimental, whimsical, childish girl named Madeline Bassett. Gussie, a shy teetotaler with a passion for newts and a face like a fish, is too timid to speak to her. Bertie is annoyed that his friends consider Jeeves more intelligent than Bertie, and he takes Gussie's case in hand, ordering Jeeves not to offer any more advice. Madeline, a friend of Bertie's cousin Angela, is staying at Brinkley Court (country seat of Aunt Dahlia and Uncle Tom). Aunt Dahlia demands that Bertie come to Brinkley Court to make a speech and present the school prizes to students at the local grammar school, which he considers a fearsome task. Bertie sends Gussie to Brinkley Court in his place, so that Gussie will have the chance to woo Madeline there, but also so that Gussie will be forced to take on the unpleasant job of distributing the school prizes. When Angela breaks her engagement to the athletic but heavy Tuppy Glossop, Bertie feels obliged to go down to Brinkley Court to comfort Aunt Dahlia. In addition to her worry about Angela's broken engagement, Aunt Dahlia is anxious because she has lost 500 pounds gambling at Cannes, and now needs to ask her miserly husband Tom to replace the money in order to keep financing her magazine, Milady's Boudoir. Bertie advises her to arouse Uncle Tom's concern for her by pretending to have lost her appetite through worry. He offers similar advice to Tuppy, to win back Angela. He also offers the same advice to Gussie, to show his love for Madeline. All take his advice, and the resulting return of plates of untasted food upsets Aunt Dahlia's temperamental prized chef Anatole, who gives notice to quit. Not unreasonably, Aunt Dahlia blames Bertie for this disaster. When Bertie attempts to probe Madeline's feelings about Gussie, she misinterprets his questioning as a marriage proposal on his own behalf. To his relief, she tells Bertie she cannot marry him, as she has fallen in love with Gussie. Bertie relays the good news to Gussie, but even with this encouragement, Gussie remains too timid to propose, and Bertie decides to embolden him by lacing his orange juice with liquor. Gussie ends up imbibing more liquor than Bertie had intended. Under its influence, Gussie successfully proposes to Madeline. He then delivers a hilarious, abusive, drunken speech to the grammar school while presenting the school prizes. Madeline, disgusted, breaks the engagement and resolves to marry Bertie instead. The prospect of spending his life with the drippy Madeline terrifies Bertie, but his personal code of chivalrous behavior will not allow him to insult her by withdrawing his \\"proposal\\" and turning her down. Meanwhile, Gussie, still drunk, retaliates against Madeline by proposing to Angela, who accepts him in order to score off Tuppy. Tuppy's jealousy is aroused and he chases Gussie all around the mansion, vowing to beat him within an inch of his life. In the face of this chaos, Bertie admits his inability to cope, and appeals to Jeeves for advice. Jeeves arranges for Bertie to be absent for a few hours, and during that time swiftly and ingeniously solves all the problems, assuring that Angela and Tuppy are reconciled, that Gussie and Madeline become engaged again, that Anatole withdraws his resignation, and that Uncle Tom writes Aunt Dahlia a check for 500 pounds. Bertie learns his lesson and resolves to let Jeeves have his way in the future. Sections of the story were adapted into episodes of the ITV series Jeeves and Wooster. A:","output":"Part #1: You need to create a question about characters, events, facts and beliefs, etc. Usage: What was Gussie Fink-Nottle's passion?

Why was Donald Trump talking about the abortion issue? What will be the angle between electric field, magnetic field and direction of propagation of an EM wave while bending due to gravity (near a black hole)? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"Question 1: Donald Trump was talking about the abortion issue because it's a big topic that many people have strong feelings about. Some people believe that women should have the choice to end a pregnancy, while others think it's wrong. As a president, he had to share his opinions on this issue, so people would know what he believed and how he might make decisions about it. Question 2: When an electromagnetic (EM) wave gets close to a black hole, the gravity from the black hole can make it bend. You see, EM waves are made up of electric and magnetic fields that wiggle together. In regular cases (far from any black holes), the electric field, magnetic field, and direction the wave travels are all perpendicular (at right angles) to each other.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Information:  - Rights are legal, social, or ethical principles of freedom or entitlement; that is, rights are the fundamental normative rules about what is allowed of people or owed to people, according to some legal system, social convention, or ethical theory. Rights are of essential importance in such disciplines as law and ethics, especially theories of justice and deontology. Rights are often considered fundamental to civilization, being regarded as established pillars of society and culture, and the history of social conflicts can be found in the history of each right and its development. According to the \\"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\\", \\"rights structure the form of governments, the content of laws, and the shape of morality as it is currently perceived\\".  - A mother is the female parent of a child. Mothers are women who inhabit or perform the role of bearing some relation to their children, who may or may not be their biological offspring. Thus, dependent on the context, women can be considered mothers by virtue of having given birth, by raising their child(ren), supplying their ovum for fertilisation, or some combination thereof. Such conditions provide a way of delineating the concept of motherhood, or the state of being a mother. Women who meet the third and first categories usually fall under the terms 'birth mother' or 'biological mother', regardless of whether the individual in question goes on to parent their child. Accordingly, a woman who meets only the second condition may be considered an adoptive mother, and those who meet only the third a surrogacy mother.  - A paternal bond refers to the relationship between a father and his child . In the U.S. , legal paternity is presumed for the husband of the mother unless a separate action is taken ; an unmarried man may establish paternity by signing a voluntary recognition of paternity or by taking court action . Paternity may also be established between a man and a younger person , commonly in adoption , without the two being biologically related .  - Sperm donation is the provision (or \\"donation\\") by a male (known as a sperm donor) of his sperm (known as donor sperm), principally for the purpose of inseminating a female who is not his sexual partner.  - Sexual intercourse, or coitus or copulation, is principally the insertion and thrusting of the penis, usually when erect, into the vagina for sexual pleasure, reproduction, or both. This is also known as vaginal intercourse or vaginal sex. Other forms of penetrative sexual intercourse include anal sex (penetration of the anus by the penis), oral sex (penetration of the mouth by the penis or oral penetration of the female genitalia), fingering (sexual penetration by the fingers), and penetration by use of a dildo (especially a strap-on dildo). These activities involve physical intimacy between two or more individuals and are usually used among humans solely for physical or emotional pleasure and commonly contribute to human bonding.  - Inheritance is the practice of passing on property, titles, debts, rights, and obligations upon the death of an individual. The rules of inheritance differ between societies and have changed over time.  - Biologically, a child (plural: children) is a human being between the stages of birth and puberty. The legal definition of \\"child\\" generally refers to a minor, otherwise known as a person younger than the age of majority.  - A father is the male parent of a child. Besides the paternal bonds of a father to his children, the father may have a parental legal and social relationship with the child that carries with it certain rights and obligations, although this varies between jurisdictions. An adoptive father is a male who has become the child's parent through the legal process of adoption. A biological father is the male genetic contributor to the creation of the baby, through sexual intercourse or sperm donation. A biological father may have legal obligations to a child not raised by him, such as an obligation of monetary support. A putative father is a man whose biological relationship to a child is alleged but has not been established. A stepfather is a male who is the husband of a child's mother and they may form a family unit, but who generally does not have the legal rights and responsibilities of a parent in relation to the child.  - A male () organism is the physiological sex that produces sperm. Each spermatozoon can fuse with a larger female gamete, or ovum, in the process of fertilization. A male cannot reproduce sexually without access to at least one ovum from a female, but some organisms can reproduce both sexually and asexually. Most male mammals, including male humans, have a Y chromosome, which codes for the production of larger amounts of testosterone to develop male reproductive organs.  - Parenting or child rearing is the process of promoting and supporting the physical, emotional, social, financial, and intellectual development of a child from infancy to adulthood. Parenting refers to the aspects of raising a child aside from the biological relationship.  - Filiation is the legal term that refers to the recognized legal status of the relationship between family members, or more specifically the legal relationship between parent and child. As described by the Government of Quebec:  - Sperm is the male reproductive cell and is derived from the Greek word () \\"sperma\\" (meaning \\"seed\\"). In the types of sexual reproduction known as anisogamy and its subtype oogamy, there is a marked difference in the size of the gametes with the smaller one being termed the \\"male\\" or sperm cell. A uniflagellar sperm cell that is motile is referred to as a spermatozoon, whereas a non-motile sperm cell is referred to as a spermatium. Sperm cells cannot divide and have a limited life span, but after fusion with egg cells during fertilization, a new organism begins developing, starting as a totipotent zygote. The human sperm cell is haploid, so that its 23 chromosomes can join the 23 chromosomes of the female egg to form a diploid cell. In mammals, sperm develops in the testicles and is released from the penis. It is also possible to extract sperm through TESE. Some sperm banks hold up to of sperm.  - Adoption is a process whereby a person assumes the parenting of another, usually a child, from that person's biological or legal parent or parents, and, in so doing, permanently transfers all rights and responsibilities, along with filiation, from the biological parent or parents. Unlike guardianship or other systems designed for the care of the young, adoption is intended to effect a permanent change in status and as such requires societal recognition, either through legal or religious sanction. Historically, some societies have enacted specific laws governing adoption; where others have tried to achieve adoption through less formal means, notably via contracts that specified inheritance rights and parental responsibilities without an accompanying transfer of filiation. Modern systems of adoption, arising in the 20th century, tend to be governed by comprehensive statutes and regulations.    What entity does 'paternal bond' has the relation 'subclass of' with?

Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BC) launched several military campaigns against them. The ultimate Han victory in these wars eventually forced the Xiongnu to accept vassal status as Han tributaries. These campaigns expanded Han sovereignty into the Tarim Basin of Central Asia, divided the Xiongnu into two separate confederations, and helped establish the vast trade network known as the Silk Road, which reached as far as the Mediterranean world. The territories north of Han's borders were quickly overrun by the nomadic Xianbei confederation. Emperor Wu also launched successful military expeditions in the south, annexing Nanyue in 111 BC and Dian in 109 BC, and in the Korean Peninsula where the Xuantu and Lelang Commanderies were established in 108 BC.\\".

Short movie review: two bodies and hardly a laugh between them  Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"Based on the short movie review, \\"Two bodies and hardly a laugh between them,\\" it appears that the critic is thinking negatively of the movie. This statement implies that the film involved two main characters (the \\"two bodies\\"), and there were very few laughs or humorous moments throughout the movie. The phrasing of \\"hardly a laugh between them\\" likely indicates dissatisfaction with the film, as the critic is emphasizing the lack of humor or engaging moments. Additionally, using the phrase \\"between them\\" can suggest that the chemistry between the two main actors might have been lacking, resulting in limited comedic timing or poor delivery of jokes. The critic may also be disappointed in the film's overall potential for providing a humorous or engaging narrative. Such criticism might indicate that the movie's genre was intended to be a comedy or a lighthearted film. However, the critic's negative perception suggests that it failed to deliver that kind of entertainment. Thus, the movie might have fallen short of its intended appeal. In conclusion, the critic seems to have a negative perception of the movie, expressing disappointment in the limited number of laughs and possibly the lack of chemistry between the two main characters. The film might not have met its intended comedic or entertaining objectives, resulting in the critic's negative review."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is an ancient and massive freshwater lake that holds the record for being the deepest and the largest in terms of volume, containing about 20% of the world's unfrozen freshwater. Lake Baikal has a maximum depth of approximately 1,642 meters (5,387 feet) and an average depth of 744.4 meters (2,442 feet). The lake is also considered one of the world's oldest lakes, with an estimated age of 25-30 million years. Baikal's water is remarkably clear because it is inhabited by epischura baikalensis, a small crustacean that helps to clean the water by consuming and filtering the impurities. The lake is home to more than 1,700 species of plants and animals, two-thirds of which can be found nowhere else in the world. This unique biodiversity has earned the region a place on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The general shape of Lake Baikal is a crescent, stretching approximately 636 kilometers (395 miles) long from northeast to southwest. Its maximum width is about 79 kilometers (49 miles) and the average width is around 48 kilometers (30 miles). The lake's vast waters are spread across 31,722 square kilometers (12,248 square miles), making it the seventh-largest lake in the world by surface area. Lake Baikal is fed by a total of 336 tributary rivers and streams, which supply water to the lake. The most notable of these tributaries is the Selenga River, which contributes more than half of the total inflow to Lake Baikal. Despite the numerous tributaries going in, there is only one outlet from the lake – the Angara River, which flows out of the lake and eventually joins the Yenisey River. The lake's fascinating geological history, rich biodiversity, and impressive depth make Lake Baikal a popular destination for tourists, scientists, and nature enthusiasts. Visitors can enjoy exploring the numerous hiking trails and pristine wilderness around the lake, as well as taking part in various adventure sports, such as diving, swimming, and wildlife observation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Which documentary, Point of Order! or In the Basement is about the Senate Army–McCarthy hearings of 1954? Answer:","output":"The documentary that is about the Senate Army-McCarthy hearings of 1954 is \\"Point of Order!\\" Directed by Emile de Antonio, this influential and important documentary was released in 1964, ten years after the hearings took place. The title, \\"Point of Order,\\" refers to a parliamentary procedure used during the hearings for raising questions and seeking clarification. The Senate Army-McCarthy hearings, held in the spring of 1954, were a series of investigations that intended to look into the causes and nature of the allegations made by Senator Joseph McCarthy regarding the infiltration of communists in the United States Army. At the time, McCarthy was a controversial and polarizing political figure who had risen to national prominence in the early 1950s due to his aggressive and accusatory campaign against alleged communists in the US government, military, and other institutions. \\"Point of Order!\\" is a powerful and compelling documentary that effectively captures the dramatic tension and political intrigue that surrounded the hearings. Emile de Antonio compiled the documentary using extensive footage from the kinescope recordings of the live hearings, which also aired on television to millions of Americans. The documentary presents the proceedings in chronological order, giving viewers the chance to observe key events and exchanges that occurred during the two-month-long hearings, without any added narration. Some of the most memorable personalities featured in \\"Point of Order!\\" include Senator McCarthy himself, Army Special Counsel Joseph N. Welch, and the Chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Senator John L. McClellan. The documentary showcases the adversarial confrontation between McCarthy's team and the Army's defense team, revealing the tactics employed by both sides and highlighting their ultimate objectives. In contrast, \\"In the Basement\\" is a 2014 Austrian documentary film directed by Ulrich Seidl, which explores the peculiar and bizarre activities that various Austrians engage in within their own basements. The documentary is a fascinating collection of vignettes that delves into the private lives of people who indulge in eccentric hobbies and interests in their basement spaces. In summary, \\"Point of Order!\\" is the documentary that focuses on the Senate Army-McCarthy hearings of 1954, providing a detailed and insightful perspective on the proceedings, key players, and the societal and political implications of this significant historical event. \\"In the Basement,\\" on the other hand, is an unrelated documentary that explores the quirky pastimes of ordinary people in a completely different context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I have a new situation: Year 2022 would be an interesting year when three comets would get scientists' attention - Comet A, Comet B, and Comet C. Comet A and C are very faint, but Comet B is very bright. Comet A would enter the inner solar system on February 10, 2022 and leave the inner solar system on February 20, 2022. Comet B would enter the inner solar system on February 18, 2022 and leave the inner solar system on February 26, 2022. Comet C would never enter the inner solar system.  But I can use this background: A comet tail—and coma—are features visible in comets when they are illuminated by the Sun and may become visible from Earth when a comet passes through the inner Solar System. As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them. Separate tails are formed of dust and gases, becoming visible through different phenomena; the dust reflects sunlight directly and the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be visible without the aid of a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye.  What is an answer for this question: Which comet's dust would reflect sunlight, Comet B or Comet C? The answer is:","output":"To answer this question, let's go through the information step by step and justify our conclusions. 1. Comet A and C are faint, while Comet B is bright. This suggests that Comet B's dust and gases are reflecting sunlight more effectively than Comet A and C. 2. Comet A enters the inner solar system between February 10th and February 20th, 2022. This means that during this period, its dust and gases may become visible as they are illuminated by the Sun. 3. Comet B enters the inner solar system between February 18th and February 26th, 2022. As it is a bright comet, its dust and gases will reflect sunlight and be visible during this time. 4. Comet C never enters the inner solar system. As a result, it doesn't come close enough to the Sun for its dust and gases to be effectively illuminated and reflected. Based on this information, the answer to the question \\"Which comet's dust would reflect sunlight, Comet B or Comet C?\\" is: Comet B. This conclusion is justified because Comet B is the bright comet that enters the inner solar system and thus, its dust and gases will be close enough to the Sun to reflect sunlight and be visible. Comet C, on the other hand, never enters the inner solar system and remains too far away for its dust to effectively reflect sunlight."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He had been hoping to avoid discussing this sensitive topic with Jeffrey, who was both his close friend and business partner. Since they had started their small software company together, they had experienced their share of ups and downs. However, Kyle's debt was an entirely different matter - one that had the potential to impact both their professional and personal relationships. \\"Well, it's...not an easy thing to talk about,\\" Kyle admitted after a moment, his voice much lower than usual. Jeffrey, who had always been the more empathetic of the two, nodded in understanding. \\"I know it might be difficult, but I think it's crucial for us to talk about it. It could affect our business, after all,\\" Jeffrey said gently, providing an opening for Kyle. Taking a deep breath, Kyle steeled himself to reveal the truth. \\"It all started a couple of years ago,\\" he began. \\"As you know, we weren't doing too well financially back then, and I made some pretty bad bets on the stock market. I wanted to earn some quick cash to keep us afloat, but it completely backfired. Instead of making a profit, I ended up losing a significant amount of our investment.\\" Jeffrey, who had been under the impression that their financial woes had been a natural consequence of the market fluctuation, was taken aback by the revelation. He had had no idea that their financial issues had been so dire that Kyle had felt compelled to dabble in stocks. \\"But, you never told me any of this,\\" Jeffrey whispered, concern deepening on his face. \\"Why didn't you share this with me?\\" \\"I was scared,\\" Kyle confessed. \\"I was afraid that if you knew how bad the situation was, you'd lose faith in our partnership and walk away. I thought I could fix it on my own, and I didn't want to burden you with my mistakes.\\" Jeffrey sighed, running a hand through his hair. \\"You could have trusted me, Kyle. We've been through so much together, and we've always managed to come out the other side stronger. We're in this together, remember?\\" Touched by Jeffrey's unwavering support, Kyle continued, \\"The debt has been piling up ever since, with interest and penalties. It's reached the point now where I don't know how to handle it on my own. I don't want our company to suffer because of my past mistakes.\\" \\"You're right; we can't let this debt ruin everything we've built,\\" Jeffrey agreed. \\"But what are our options? We need to find a way to pay it off and move forward.\\" As a collective, they decided to sit down and map out a plan to tackle the issue head-on. Some of the strategies they discussed included: 1. Restructuring their business: This involved cutting down costs, optimizing processes, and possibly downsizing their team to make room for more profitable opportunities. 2. Seeking investors: They could look for additional funding options to help cover the debt, in exchange for shares in the company or profit sharing once the business was back on track. 3. Setting up a debt repayment plan: Kyle could negotiate with his creditors, explaining his situation and proposing a structured repayment plan that would allow him more manageable monthly payments. 4. Diversifying their services: By expanding their offerings to new markets or clients, the company could potentially increase its revenue stream, making it easier to repay the debt faster. 5. Merging with another company: This option presented the possibility of a shared burden and the chance to combine resources and expertise to strengthen their overall financial standing. Over several weeks, they analyzed each strategy's pros and cons, eventually devising a plan that combined elements of each proposal. They communicated openly and transparently with their team, customers, and other stakeholders, ensuring that everyone was involved in the company's recovery process. It wasn't an easy journey, but with Jeffrey and Kyle's determination, the support of their team, and a seemingly insurmountable debt as their incentive, they emerged from the crisis stronger, more resilient, and with a deepened appreciation for the power of partnership."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

What is the answer to this question? who founded the first real centralized empire in china?","output":"The founder of the first real centralized empire in China was Emperor Qin Shi Huang, who established the Qin Dynasty in 221 BCE. Qin Shi Huang, born as Ying Zheng, was a pivotal figure in Chinese history, and his reign laid the foundation for the imperial system that would continue for over two millennia. Before the rise of the Qin Dynasty, China was divided into numerous warring states. These states were constantly fighting for supremacy during a period known as the Warring States Period (475-221 BCE). Qin Shi Huang emerged as the King of the State of Qin, one of the most powerful and influential of these warring states. Under his leadership, the Qin state underwent numerous reforms, including the introduction of standardized weights and measures, currency, and a unified writing system. Qin Shi Huang's military campaigns proved to be highly successful. He managed to conquer all other warring states within a decade, beginning with the State of Han in 230 BCE and ending with the State of Qi in 221 BCE. It was at this point that he declared the establishment of the Qin Dynasty, thereby unifying China for the first time in its history. As the First Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang enacted a series of policies and reforms designed to strengthen and centralize the empire. He sought to eliminate any potential opposition to his rule by suppressing traditional noble families and regional differences. He also implemented a strict legalistic system, known as Legalism, which emphasized the importance of strict laws and harsh punishments to maintain order within the empire. Qin Shi Huang was known for his ambitious construction projects, most notably the Great Wall of China. This massive undertaking was intended to protect the empire from the northern nomadic tribes, and it stands as one of the most iconic symbols of Chinese history. He also ordered the construction of a magnificent tomb for himself, known as the Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor. This tomb, which remains largely unexcavated, is most famous for its Terracotta Army, a collection of over 8,000 life-sized terracotta soldiers and horses intended to protect Qin Shi Huang in the afterlife. Despite his accomplishments and the solidity of the empire he established, the Qin Dynasty was short-lived. Qin Shi Huang's death in 210 BCE led to internal strife and power struggles, which ultimately resulted in the collapse of the dynasty in 206 BCE. The subsequent establishment of the Han Dynasty saw the continuation of the unified Chinese empire, which would endure in various forms for over 2,000 years. In summary, Emperor Qin Shi Huang was the founder of the first real centralized empire in China through his conquests and unification of the warring states, his centralizing policies and reforms, and his ambitious construction projects. Although the Qin Dynasty was short-lived, it laid the groundwork for China's imperial legacy and showcased the potential strength of a unified Chinese state."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: (CNN)There is no evidence that anyone at the NFL saw or possessed a video showing Ray Rice punching his then-fiancée until it was made public, but the league should have known it needed to dig deeper into the incident, an external investigative report released Thursday concludes. The report wraps up an inquiry by former FBI Director Robert Mueller into how the NFL initially investigated the then-Baltimore Ravens running back's attack on Janay Palmer last February at the Revel Casino Hotel in Atlantic City. \\"We concluded there was substantial information about the incident -- even without the in-elevator video -- indicating the need for a more thorough investigation,\\" Mueller said in his report. \\"The NFL should have done more with the information it had, and should have taken additional steps to obtain all available information about the February 15 incident.\\" The NFL asked for Mueller's report in September after a public outcry over NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's handling of Rice's discipline. \\"While this investigation has now concluded, our focus on the underlying issues and our commitment to positive change remain as strong as ever,\\" Goodell said in a written statement. \\"We have all learned a great deal in the past months and expect to be judged by how we lead going forward on issues of domestic violence and sexual assault.\\" Here are some things we learned through the report:. No evidence of video at NFL office. In September, The Associated Press reported that a law enforcement official told one of its reporters that the source mailed a copy of a video from a surveillance camera inside an elevator at the now closed Revel casino showing Rice knocking out Palmer to a league executive in April. The report said a woman called from a league phone number to acknowledge receipt of the video. The report says more than 200 league employees were interviewed and found no evidence that happened. Among the employees questioned were the women whose ID badges indicated they were in the NFL office on April 9. All 188 said they made no phone call. \\"Each denied having seen the in-elevator video or even hearing a rumor that an in-elevator video of the Rice incident had been received by the league before it appeared on (celebrity news website) TMZ on September 8,\\" investigators said. Also questioned were people in the mailroom, and no one there could remember a package sent to Jeff Miller, the league's senior vice president of security. Multiple emails from high-level NFL executives indicate they had not seen the video before it was posted on TMZ, the report says. Ray Rice's attorney had copy of video on April 1. The prosecutor's office in Atlantic County wanted to wait until after a grand jury heard the case in late March before releasing the video to Michael Diamondstein, Rice's attorney. Diamondstein had asked for a copy from the casino on February 20. He was told by the casino's lawyer that police said not to turn over any evidence while an investigation was ongoing. Later Diamondstein was referred to the prosecutor. Rice was indicted on March 27 on a third-degree aggravated assault charge. His lawyer received a copy of the video from the casino on April 1 and from the prosecutor days later as part of the process of discovery. The report says Diamondstein chatted about the video with Ravens President Richard Cass and the lawyer said it was \\"terrible.\\" The two disagree precisely when the call took place and how much of what was on the video was discussed. Diamondstein told investigators that if the league had asked for a copy of the video, he would have provided it. That was one of the league's missteps identified in the report. Others included not contacting police officers who investigated the incident, not attempting to get videos from the casino or the prosecutors, and not following up with the Ravens to see if the team had information the league did not. \\"Had the league undertaken a more substantial investigation, it may have gathered available information about the incident, possibly including the in-elevator video prior to its public release,\\" the report says. Atlantic City Police called NFL in March. A private investigator who was working the case for the NFL had been in touch with the Atlantic City Police Department trying to get the arrest report and other documents. He was told twice the police wouldn't provide the information. He asked a supervisor in the records division, Ava Davenport, if he could get reports if he filed an Open Public Records Act request. She said everything in it would be redacted. On March 28, the day after Rice's indictment, someone using Davenport's work phone called the NFL office and spoke to an operator for 59 seconds. Police declined to discuss the nature of the call and the operator couldn't remember what was discussed. The call wasn't transferred, records showed. The incident was viewed live. A security officer at the casino watched Rice strike Palmer twice as it happened on a surveillance monitor. That employee called another security officer to the elevator. When a supervisor arrived Palmer couldn't remember what had happened. Two DVD copies of surveillance video were given to police that morning. The in-house copy of video was viewable by security workers for several days before access was restricted. One employee told Mueller's team as many as 40 people had access to the room where the video could be watched. Mueller calls investigation independent. Several media reports had called into question Mueller as lead investigator because his law firm has done work for the NFL. But Mueller writes he has never provided legal services to the league nor has any of his team. Mueller said he joined the WilmerHale firm in March 2014, years after the firm helped the league negotiate with two media groups. In the past four years, the firm has only provided advice on immigration issues. \\"Placing these relationships in context, I am quite confident that the ties described above have in no way influenced the conduct of this investigation,\\" he says. Recommendations. Mueller says: \\"Our findings demonstrate the weaknesses inherent in the league's longstanding practice of deferring to the criminal justice system with respect to the investigation of facts and the imposition of discipline under the Personal Conduct Policy. Discipline should be imposed on the basis of the specific nature of the player's conduct, not solely or necessarily on the disposition of a criminal case.\\" He recommend the NFL establish an investigative team for domestic violence and sexual assault cases, that the league expand its security department with a special counsel and other personnel, and clarify policies that assured teams the league shared information. \\"Investigations of domestic violence cases present unique challenges,\\" the report says. Highlights:","output":"- An external investigative report by former FBI Director Robert Mueller found no evidence that anyone at the NFL saw or possessed a video showing Ray Rice punching his then-fiancée until it was made public. - The NFL should have known it needed to dig deeper into the incident and be more thorough in its investigation.  - More than 200 league employees were interviewed and found no evidence that a video was received by the league before it appeared on TMZ.  - The report suggests that the NFL should establish an investigative team for domestic violence and sexual assault cases, expand its security department with a special counsel and other personnel, and clarify information-sharing policies. - NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell says that the focus on the underlying issues and commitment to positive change remain strong and that the NFL expects to be judged by their future actions regarding domestic violence and sexual assault issues."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

He found that something in the U.S. army. Fleming began his service in 2009 and never looked back. A few years later, Fleming volunteered to go to Afghanistan. There, he worked as a bodyguard for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. He enjoyed it, except for the almost-nightly rocket attacks. Karl was never hit directly by a rocket, but he didn't need to be to feel its effects. The rockets caused severe shaking, shaking so bad that Fleming was left with many injuries. He was also diagnosed with concussions  and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder(PTSD). Fleming said he was down but not out. Once he returned from Afghanistan, Fleming underwent one test after another. At first, Fleming said he thought he could recover or be able to return to duty and realize his dream of becoming an officer. But then came the news he had never imagined: Fleming would never be an officer because he was too injured to continue. Fleming said he was depressed after learning his military career was over. Add that to the memory loss, extreme anxiety and the many painful medical procedures he was already experiencing. He rarely ventured outside on the weekend. Instead, he preferred to sleep in. All that changed, however, with Fleming's service dog, Kuchar. Fleming said he had heard dogs could help people suffering from PTSD, so he started doing research. Karl eventually selected K9s for Warriors, which is where he met Kuchar, a yellow lab. Fleming and Kuchar trained together for weeks, before returning to Fort Benning. K9s for Warriors provided Fleming with Kuchar and the training for free. Life with Kuchar has been life-changing. Fleming doesn't sleep in any more because Kuchar won't let him.

Question 2 specifies \\"of all time,\\" while Question 1 does not explicitly state a time range.

Many have travelled back from temporary accommodation in nearby areas in the hope of rescuing their homes, businesses and belongings. Here, one Fort McMurray resident, 40-year-old Kory Walsh, describes his return on Thursday and the challenges ahead for the people - and pets - of the Canadian oil city. \\"I just pulled back into Fort McMurray after being in Edmonton for the past month, following the evacuation. I've never felt better than I did driving back here on the highway today. There were fire trucks parked on the bridges on the way into town, hanging Canadian flags. If that doesn't bring a tear to your eye, you don't have a heart. There are not a lot of businesses open yet. It is still a voluntary return for many. I have a pet store that I have to get back off the ground. My wife has already returned and is working and staying at an oil facility 50km north of the city. My firefighter friend, who's my business partner, managed to grab the 10 or so pets that we had in the store and evacuate them to other towns, with the help of the local SPCA (Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals). They included hedgehogs, gerbils, rabbits, lizards and snakes. We closed the store before downtown was evacuated. There was a big operation all over town to evacuate pets. It's a really big pet community. Now the people and pets are returning to town. We lost some of our stock, particularly dog food, which accounts for about two-thirds of our business, but the store is still standing, with not really any smoke damage. We may get some of the pets back but I'm just glad that the other stores were able to take them and they're safe. We have to get some emergency insurance quickly to get the business up and running again, as we still have to pay the rent. My house is also fully intact, luckily. I just went in there for the first time since I evacuated. There is some smoke damage but it's better than I expected. A lot of homes in the area were damaged, but thankfully the fire somehow skipped my street. It was pretty emotional going home again. It was quite surreal and heavy. The house was almost as it was when I left that morning I evacuated. Things were thrown all over the place. There is a big clean-up ahead. But there is some amazing support being given by the whole country. It's strange being on the receiving end of all that support and love. My friend and the rest of the firefighters are the real heroes here now. They saved our community. Now we're going to rebuild it. The firefighters knocked down about 60-70ft worth of trees behind my house. Not a bad thing as it probably saved my home. There are still a lot of health concerns and a lot of people are staying away, but it feels good to be one of the first ones back. Now I'm going to get the doors of my business open as soon as possible.\\" This article was about:","output":"This article is about Kory Walsh, a 40-year-old Fort McMurray resident, sharing his experience of returning to the Canadian oil city after being evacuated due to wildfires.

Our parents got married before they had children and did n't invent stupid names for their kids like ' Kiora ' and ' Blade ' ..... This generation has produced some of the best risk - takers , problem solvers and inventors ever ! The past 70 years have been an explosion of innovation and new ideas . What may happen after having kids ?","output":"After having kids, numerous possible events and experiences can occur in different aspects of individuals' lives. While each family's experience is unique, some common events, challenges, and milestones can be identified. 1. Changes in relationships: The relationship between the parents might evolve, as they now share parenting responsibilities and make decisions together regarding the upbringing of their children. Parenthood may help couples grow closer as they collaborate and support each other in their new roles. However, it can also introduce tensions and conflicts that need to be addressed in a healthy and constructive manner. 2. Adjustment to new roles and responsibilities: Both parents must adjust to the increased responsibilities that come with being a primary caregiver, providing for the child's needs, and managing a household. The balance between work and parenting may present challenges, and some parents may need to reduce their working hours or change their career paths to accommodate their new priorities. 3. Emotional changes: The arrival of a child may bring a range of emotions, including joy, excitement, and love, but it may also create feelings of stress, anxiety, or even postpartum depression. As children grow and reach different milestones, parents may experience feelings of pride, accomplishment, worry, and even nostalgia. 4. Development of parenting skills: New parents will need to develop parenting skills and strategies to ensure their child's well-being and development. Establishing consistent routines, effective communication, discipline techniques, and guidance will be crucial in raising a well-adjusted and healthy child. 5. Impact on social life: With the increased responsibilities associated with parenthood, the parents' social life might be impacted. Some friendships may fade, while others evolve. New friendships may be formed with other parents who share similar experiences and challenges. 6. Financial considerations: Raising a child can be costly, and parents may need to re-adjust their financial plans to factor in expenses such as childcare, education, healthcare, and daily needs. This may include cutting back on discretionary spending, prioritizing savings, and planning for the child's future, such as saving for college. 7. Personal growth: Parenthood can bring valuable life lessons, fostering personal growth and self-discovery. Parents may find new passions related to their children, develop more profound empathy, and gain a heightened sense of responsibility and purpose. 8. Continuation of family traditions and values: Parents have the opportunity to pass on their cultural heritage, family traditions, and values to their children, strengthening family bonds and ensuring that their legacy lives on. 9. Encouraging creativity and innovation: As the article mentioned, this generation has produced some of the best risk-takers, problem solvers, and inventors. Encouraging children to develop and explore their interests and talents will, in turn, shape the next generation of innovators and leaders. 10. Potential for long-term impact: The experiences, skills, and values that parents instill in their children can have a lasting effect on their lives. Through providing love, guidance, and support, parents have a unique opportunity to influence their children’s outlook on life and shape their future decisions. In conclusion, having children can lead to various transformations in individuals' lives, with both expected and unexpected consequences. The experience is unique for each family, and while it may come with challenges and difficulties, it can also bring immense joy and satisfaction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: If stopping air pollution has a positive effect on an ecosystem, then what has a positive effect on an ecosystem?  Answer choices: - maintaining air pollution  - removing habitats  - stopping air pollution  - to stay warm  - in the frog family  - Electric generators  - increasing air pollution  - genetic diversity Answer:","output":"Stopping air pollution has a positive effect on an ecosystem. Among the given answer choices, the option that corresponds to having a similar positive effect on an ecosystem is genetic diversity. Air pollution can have detrimental effects on ecosystems, causing issues like acid rain, visibility reduction, and harm to plants and animals. By stopping air pollution, you help protect the environment and promote the overall health and balance of ecosystems. Genetic diversity is essential for the long-term survival and adaptability of species within an ecosystem. A higher level of genetic diversity ensures that populations have a larger gene pool to draw from, enabling them to better respond to changing environmental conditions and resist pathogens and diseases. With a larger gene pool, there is a higher chance that at least some individuals in the population will be able to adapt to new challenges, ensuring the survival and thriving of the species. Maintaining air pollution, removing habitats, increasing air pollution, and electric generators do not have a positive effect on an ecosystem. These activities can actually harm ecosystems by damaging plants and wildlife, contributing to climate change, and decreasing the quality of life of the organisms living within the ecosystem. While staying warm and being in the frog family might not directly impact an ecosystem in a negative way, they do not specifically contribute positively to an ecosystem like stopping air pollution or increasing genetic diversity. In summary, stopping air pollution and promoting genetic diversity have positive effects on ecosystems, as they contribute to the overall health, stability, and adaptability of the organisms within those ecosystems. Other factors such as staying warm, being in the frog family, or using electric generators may not necessarily have a direct positive effect on ecosystems. In contrast, the remaining options mentioned, such as maintaining or increasing air pollution or removing habitats, have negative effects on ecosystems and are hence inadvisable from an ecological perspective."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Since that time, there has been a lot of rain and we noticed Happy Pond had a green coating across the top of it. We also thought about going to a new pond in center of the park called Ridge Pond. We are hoping to catch a lot of fish to serve at our family reunion.  Does Happy Pond have more nitrogen or oxygen?  Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. The nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water bodies. Since there is a lot of nitrogen it causes algae to grow out of control. Figure below shows a pond covered with algae. Algae may use up so much oxygen in the water that nothing else can grow. Soon, even the algae die out. Decomposers break down the dead tissue and use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico. You can see it Figure below .

Answer a question about this article: The style and role of any minority leader is influenced by a variety of elements, including personality and contextual factors, such as the size and cohesion of the minority party, whether his or her party controls the White House, the general political climate in the House, and the controversy that is sometimes associated with the legislative agenda. Despite the variability of these factors, there are a number of institutional obligations associated with this position. Many of these assignments or roles are spelled out in the House rule book. Others have devolved upon the position in other ways. To be sure, the minority leader is provided with extra staff resources—beyond those accorded him or her as a Representative—to assist in carrying out diverse leadership functions. Worth emphasis is that there are limits on the institutional role of the minority leader, because the majority party exercises disproportionate influence over the agenda, partisan ratios on committees, staff resources, administrative operations, and the day-to-day schedule and management of floor activities. What influences role of minority leader?","output":"The role of a minority leader is influenced by a variety of elements, including: 1. Personality: The individual's distinct character traits and leadership style can shape their approach to their role as a minority leader. 2.

Would \\"The song's music video, directed by Anton Corbijn , garnered critical plaudits.\\" be a reasonable answer? The answer is:","output":"No, your proposed answer only provides information about the song's music video and its reception, not the actual meaning or theme of the song itself. A more appropriate response would be:  \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" is a song by the American rock band Nirvana, released as the first single from their third and final studio album, \\"In Utero\\" in 1993. The song was written by Kurt Cobain, the band's frontman and guitarist. While there isn't a definitive explanation or interpretation of the lyrics, there are some popular theories and suggestions about its meaning.  One interpretation is that it is about Kurt Cobain's tumultuous relationship with his then-wife, Courtney Love. The \\"heart-shaped box\\" is said to represent Cobain's feelings of being trapped or smothered by their passionate and highly scrutinized romance. The lyrics, like many of Cobain's works, contain a mix of dark imagery and visceral emotions, reflecting the struggles he faced with his personal life and fame. Another theory is that \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" explores themes like drug addiction, particularly focusing on Cobain's own battles with addiction. The lines \\"I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black\\" are thought to be a metaphor for Cobain's desire to fight and consume the darkness (or addiction) that plagued both him and those close to him.

Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: Some times I have trouble expressing myself, but I use clothing, sometimes even ugly clothing as a form of this. Possible A: fun, fashion, pain, communication, embarrassment  Why is \\"communication\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"\\"Communication\\" as an answer aligned with human common sense encapsulates the way in which a person may choose to express themselves through their clothing choices, even if that includes choosing to wear ugly clothing. Communication is an essential aspect of human interaction, helping individuals convey their thoughts, feelings, and emotions to others in various ways. Nonverbal communication, such as clothing and appearance, plays a significant role in shaping how people perceive and engage with one another. In this case, wearing clothing that deviates from mainstream fashion or is considered unattractive allows the individual to express their uniqueness, emotions, or convey a particular message through their outward appearance. Firstly, clothing serves as a powerful form of nonverbal communication that conveys information about one's personality, preferences, and cultural background. When someone chooses to wear unconventional clothing, they are essentially engaging in a form of self-expression that illustrates their beliefs, values, and characteristics. This form of communication is essential in shaping an individual's identity, be it personal or social. Secondly, wearing clothing that may be deemed \\"ugly\\" by societal standards serves as a means of breaking the mold and challenging conventional ideas about fashion and beauty. By doing so, the individual demonstrates their willingness to challenge societal norms, express their personal style or creativity, and engage in a counter-cultural dialogue. This deliberate act of communication signals their openness to confront and redefine expectations, sparking conversation and personal growth. Furthermore, choosing to wear unattractive clothing can sometimes signify a deeper emotional state or convey specific emotions. For instance, an individual may wear purposely ugly clothing in a satirical or protest-driven manner, in an attempt to critique or shed light on an issue they find important. Additionally, the choice of clothing could be a reflection of the individual's emotional state – they might be feeling distressed, rebellious, or want to provoke reactions from others. Lastly, due to the subjective nature of fashion and beauty, what one person perceives as ugly might hold significant cultural, historical, or personal meaning for another individual. Clothing can act as a form of communication to symbolize personal experiences, memories, or associations, all of which contribute to one's understanding and perception of the world around them. In summary, \\"communication\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it encapsulates the multifaceted ways in which clothing choices, even seemingly ugly ones, serve as a form of self-expression and nonverbal communication. By wearing clothing that deviates from the norm, individuals challenge societal expectations, share their emotions and beliefs, and engage with others in meaningful interactions that enrich their sense of identity and personal growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Now answer this question: What equations are used to figure out the index of refraction and extinction Coefficient?","output":"The Forouhi-Bloomer dispersion equations are used to calculate the index of refraction (n) and extinction coefficient (k) in the semiconductor industry, specifically for characterizing materials such as thin films and periodic trench structures using infrared light. The Forouhi-Bloomer (F-B) dispersion model, introduced by Artemis J. Forouhi and Irving Bloomer in 1986, is an empirical relationship between the optical properties (both the refractive index and the extinction coefficient) of a material and its photon energy. The model accounts for the fundamental interactions between photons and electrons in a material and provides an improved description of its optical behavior in comparison to the previously established models, such as the Cauchy-Urbach, Tauc-Lorentz, and Sellmeier models. The F-B dispersion equations for the index of refraction (n) and extinction coefficient (k) are given as follows: n(λ) = A + B / (λ^2 - C^2) + D / (λ^2 - E^2) k(λ) = F × (λ - G)^2 / [(λ^2 - H^2) × (λ^2 - J^2)] In these equations, λ is the wavelength of the incident light, and A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and J are material-specific constants. The index of refraction n(λ) and the extinction coefficient k(λ) are wavelength-dependent quantities that characterize the material's ability to transmit and absorb light, respectively. By measuring the reflectance of light from the surface of a semiconductor wafer and fitting the experimental data to the Forouhi-Bloomer dispersion equations, researchers can effectively determine the index of refraction and the extinction coefficient of the analyzed material. Furthermore, the reflectance of infrared light can also be used to obtain information about the critical dimensions, depth, and sidewall angle of high aspect ratio trench structures, which are vital for microelectronics and semiconductor device manufacturing."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What country of origin does 5urprise and Seo Kang-joon have in common?

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I read this background article the other day: One result of air pollution is acid rain. Acid rain is precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust.  I am facing a new situation today: Beijing recently opened several new coal-fired power plants over the last few months. In Montreal, there have been large reductions in sulfur oxides produced by manufacturing plants after a recent referendum.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which area is more likely to have acid rain? Answer:","output":"Based on the background information provided and the new situation, it is more likely that Beijing will experience acid rain compared to Montreal. The primary reason for this assessment is that Beijing has recently opened several new coal-fired power plants. These plants release sulfur oxides, which, as mentioned in the background article, contribute to the formation of acid rain. The increased number of coal-fired power plants in the area would lead to increased sulfur oxide emissions, making it more likely for acid rain to occur. On the other hand, Montreal has witnessed a significant reduction in sulfur oxide emissions after the recent referendum. The decrease in these emissions, which are known to cause acid rain, suggests that the likelihood of acid rain in Montreal has decreased. While both sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides contribute to acid rain formation, opening new coal-fired power plants in Beijing is expected to have a more significant impact on acid rain occurrence compared to the reduction of sulfur oxides produced by manufacturing plants in Montreal. Therefore, between the two areas, Beijing is more likely to experience acid rain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Given the question \\"How would you describe Robin?\\", is \\"lazy\\" a valid answer? Answer:","output":"When assessing Robin's character based on the decision to spray paint the walls while decorating the new house, describing Robin as \\"lazy\\" could be considered a subjective perspective, depending on various factors and the context of this particular situation. Let's analyze different aspects of this scenario to provide a more comprehensive and detailed answer. 1. Technique Choice: It is essential to consider whether the use of spray paint as a coloring method was an intentional choice based on preferences, specific design outcomes, or limited resources, or an attempt to finish the task faster while entirely disregarding the final result's quality. If Robin chose spray paint for its convenience and speed without considering the impact on their home's appearance, it might justify labeling Robin as \\"lazy.\\" 2. Skill Level: If Robin is an experienced painter or DIY enthusiast and has mastered spray painting techniques, the decision to use this method could be based on Robin's confidence and familiarity with the tool. In this context, labeling Robin as \\"lazy\\" would not be accurate, as the goal might be to achieve a professional and artistically unique finish in less time. 3. Efficiency: Spray painting can be an efficient method of covering large surfaces in less time than traditional brush painting, especially when using specialized equipment like paint sprayers. As long as Robin maintains good quality workmanship during the process, it would not be valid to describe Robin as \\"lazy,\\" but rather as someone who appreciates efficiency, particularly if time is of the essence. 4. Environmental Factors: It is essential to consider the environmental impact of using spray paint compared to traditional methods before labeling Robin as \\"lazy\\" or not. Some types of spray paints can be harmful to the environment and human health. If Robin chooses an eco-friendly paint option, ensures proper workspace ventilation, and takes necessary safety precautions, this shows Robin's level of responsibility far from laziness. 5. Work Ethic: One should also consider Robin's overall approach to the home decoration project. If Robin demonstrates commitment, attention to detail, and dedication in other aspects of the project, it may be unjust to judge Robin's character based only on the decision to use spray paint. Ultimately, to determine whether \\"lazy\\" is a valid descriptor for Robin, it is crucial to understand the reasons behind Robin's decision to use spray paint, consider their skillset, evaluate their broader work ethic, and analyze the context of this choice. Describing Robin as \\"lazy\\" oversimplifies the situation and might not accurately reflect Robin's character as a whole."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the solution?","output":"Okay, little buddy, let's solve this math problem step by step. We want to find the value of w that makes the equation true. First, let's see the equation we have: 1324*w + 146382 = -105*w - 919*w - 13*w Now, we should add all the w's together on the right side of the equation: 1324*w + 146382 = (-105 - 919 - 13) * w 1324*w + 146382 = -1037 * w Next, we want all the w's on one side of the equation. Let's move the -1037*w to the left side by adding 1037*w to both sides of the equation: 1324*w + 1037*w + 146382 = 0 (1324 + 1037) * w + 146382= 0 2361 * w + 146382 = 0 Now, we need to get w by itself. Let's move the 146382 to the right side by subtracting 146382 from both sides of the equation: 2361 * w = -146382 Finally, let's find w by dividing both sides of the equation by 2361: w = -146382 / 2361 Now, when you calculate that division, you get: w = -62 So, the solution for w is -62.

Is Hanja is also extensively used in situations where ambiguity must be avoided,[citation needed] such as academic papers, high-level corporate reports, government documents, and newspapers; this is due to the large number of homonyms that have resulted from extensive borrowing of Chinese words. a good answer to this question?","output":"A location with a high level of ambiguity refers to a place or situation where it is challenging to distinguish between different aspects or features due to a lack of clear distinctions. These locations might lead to confusion, misinterpretation, or difficulty in understanding specific elements due to a high degree of similarity or overlap. The given paragraph discusses the role of Hanja, or the traditional Korean writing script that heavily borrows Chinese characters, in contexts where ambiguity must be avoided. However, this information does not directly discuss a location with a high level of ambiguity. Instead, it explains that ambiguity arises in the Korean language due to its extensive borrowing of Chinese words, resulting in numerous homonyms. Hanja helps reduce this ambiguity by clarifying the intended meaning in various formal contexts such as academic papers, corporate reports, government documents, and news articles. To answer the original question, we should consider the circumstances in which a high level of ambiguity is present. Ambiguous locations might include: 1. Linguistic settings: Communication could be unclear due to the presence of homonyms or words with multiple meanings. For example, the Korean language, as mentioned in the paragraph, may lead to ambiguity without the usage of Hanja. 2. Cultural contexts: Situations where cultures or customs overlap or vary can create confusion and misinterpretation. For instance, shared spaces of diverse cultures or international conferences may exhibit a higher level of ambiguity due to contrasting perspectives and values. 3. Geographical regions: Borders between countries or regions, disputed territories, or areas where control is regularly transferred could be construed as ambiguous locations. The boundaries may fluctuate, causing uncertainty or confusion about jurisdiction. 4. Legal situations: Cases where laws or regulations are unclear or open to multiple interpretations can generate ambiguity. This can happen when a rule's language is vague or when there are conflicting laws between different legal systems. 5. Online environments: In virtual locations, anonymity and a lack of context can produce ambiguous situations. Users might engage in discussions or post content with unclear meanings or intentions. In summary, a location with a high level of ambiguity is a place or setting where distinguishing between different aspects or elements becomes challenging due to a lack of clarity or an overlap of features. The information provided on Hanja's usage in the Korean language does not directly pertain to the original question, but it does highlight how ambiguity may arise in linguistic situations. Ambiguous locations can be found in various other scenarios, including cultural contexts, geographical regions, legal situations, and online environments."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We had heard rave reviews from friends and colleagues, but I must say, our experience surpassed all expectations! Everything from the atmosphere to the presentation of the dishes was top-notch. In this review, I will highlight some of the many aspects that contributed to our spectacular dining experience. Upon entering the bistro, the ambiance immediately caught our attention. The warm lighting, contemporary décor, and soft music set the mood for a relaxing dining experience. The staff greeted us with warm smiles, and our server, Sarah, promptly escorted us to our reserved table. Sarah provided us with extraordinary service throughout the evening. She was knowledgeable, attentive, and genuinely friendly, making us feel welcomed and comfortable. Her passion for the food and the restaurant truly shined through her explanations of daily specials and personal recommendations. Now to the main highlight of the evening: the amazing food! We started our meal with the truffle mac & cheese bites and roasted beet salad. The mac & cheese bites were crispy on the outside and delightfully cheesy on the inside, while the beet salad had the perfect balance of earthy-sweet flavors and a hint of citrus. For our main courses, I opted for the seared scallops with butternut squash puree and wild mushrooms. The scallops were cooked to perfection, and the combination of flavors from the puree and wild mushrooms was divine. My spouse chose the pan-roasted duck breast with cherry compote and whipped potatoes. The duck was cooked impeccably, tender with a slightly sweet finish, thanks to the cherry compote. My daughter selected the eggplant parmesan, which she enjoyed thoroughly.

Peaches Geldof, Elliott Smith and why we still blame celebrities for deaths Elliott Smith: unexpectedly keeping some of our tabloids afloat this week. Photograph: Wendy Lynch/Redferns Uninformed people such as \\"doctors\\" and \\"psychologists\\" tend to claim that there are five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance. But it is a truth universally acknowledged (on Fleet Street) that grief is more swiftly abated if it involves a sixth stage: randomly blaming a celebrity. Which brings us to the strange and unlikely saga of the singer Elliott Smith and his role in the death of Peaches Geldof. Last week, after the results of the inquest into Peaches Geldof's death were announced, newspapers were left with something of a puzzle: how could they take this story further? What could, you know, jazz up a depressing story about a 25-year-old mother's probable heroin overdose so that readers could feel, instead of the enervating heaviness of sympathy, that delicious inner glow of prurience and outrage? Sympathy just makes people sit on the sofa moping, doesn't it? Whereas outrage propels people out of the front door and straight to their newsagent, desperate to read yet more about this thing that will outrage them more, more, more! Outrage, you see, is the caffeine of the 21st century, now powering huge swaths of the western world. Who needs a double espresso when instead one can just wake up, look at one's phone and search on the internet for something to feel outraged about? Truly, nothing makes a modern person spring out of his or her bed more quickly than the prospect of updating one's Facebook status with something one has seen on the internet and is angry about. It took the tabloids a whole day to find the crucial grain of outrage in Geldof's story – but find it they did. The person to blame for this sad death was none other than American singer-songwriter Elliott Smith, writer of some breathtakingly beautiful songs, including Miss Misery, Pictures of Me and, of course, Needle in the Hay. \\"Peaches had become increasingly obsessed with the drug-addicted US musician Elliott Smith in the days before her death … Peaches described Smith as her 'kindred spirit,'\\" heavy-breathed the Daily Mail, so outraged that it didn't bother to explain its habit of referring to female celebrities by their first name and male ones by their surname. The Sunday Mirror took this iron-clad story yet further by splashing on its front page the printing-press-halting story that Geldof was overheard days before she died arguing with her husband \\"over the number of songs Peaches had on her iPhone by Elliott Smith\\". As far as I can ascertain from my research, this is the first time that a story about Elliott Smith made a British tabloid front page. Congratulations Elliott! Quite what Smith – a man who could make Brian Wilson look like a happy-go-lucky kinda guy – would make of being brought into this story one can only imagine, as he, sadly, died more than a decade ago. The tabloids themselves were a bit mystified as to who he was, judging from their little guides to the man: \\"It was widely though [sic] Smith's depression stemmed from him being a child,\\" opined the Sunday Mirror, which does strike one as bad news for pretty much everyone with a similar history. I have to admit, I never thought I'd see the day when a live performance of Smith performing Needle in the Hay – his song about addiction – would be embedded in a Mail Online story alongside pictures of Rihanna's \\"underboob\\", but such is the strange serendipity of life. \\"Like Peaches, Elliott Smith was a music obsessive,\\" chinstroked the Mail. It seems safe to say at this point that, if Smith were not already dead, that sentence would likely have propelled him under the nearest bus. Doesn't this all feel delightfully retro, blaming a pop singer for a tragedy? I thought video games were the villains now, but it is hard to keep up in this crazy modern media world. Is this all part of the 90s fashion revival, perhaps? Does anyone know whether Philip Seymour Hoffman was a secret fan of Marilyn Manson? Because that would really explain everything. There isn't much one can say in defence of coming of age in the 90s. I endured the Britpop years, the combat-trouser era, and I went to a Spice Girls concert. Twice. But one thing I can take away from my shameful youth is the lesson that any time that journalists or public figures attempt to blame pop culture for something, they end up sounding like laughable old coots. When Marilyn Manson was widely blamed for inspiring the Columbine high school massacre in 1999 (even though the killers, Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, were later found to have hated Manson's music), he wrote an article in Rolling Stone that made his accusers sound semi-illiterate as well as hysterical. In 1992 President Bush blamed \\"the tide of incivility and the tide of intolerance\\" on The Simpsons as opposed to, say, his near-to-total inaction on the American economy. Eminem was pretty much blamed for everything in the 90s. The result of all this blaming was, of course, precisely nothing, and bad things still happened, and continue to do so. Elliott Smith didn't kill Peaches Geldof any more than my fondness for Mama Cass's music made me have a sandwich for lunch. But then, if we don't find someone or something to be outraged about right now, the whole of Britain and the eastern seaboard of the United States will deflate and sink into the Atlantic. So well done, Elliott Smith. You've kept certain sections of Fleet Street afloat for another week. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"The media often looks for a celebrity to blame in tragic situations, such as the deaths of Peaches Geldof and Elliott Smith, fueling public outrage and generating more attention for their publications. This kind of scapegoating does nothing to address the real issues behind these tragedies and perpetuates a cycle of misdirected anger and sensationalism."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, it is important to also include the specific date of the Rose Bowl game in 2012 to provide a complete response. The 2012 Rose Bowl Game, officially known as the 98th Annual Rose Bowl Game, took place on January 2, 2012, in Pasadena, California, at the historic Rose Bowl Stadium. This game is part of the annual college football postseason tradition and is one of the oldest and most prestigious bowl games in the United States. It traditionally features a matchup between the champions of the Big Ten Conference and the Mountain West Conference. The game's result was indeed a victory for the TCU Horned Frogs over the Wisconsin Badgers, with a final score of 21-19. This was the third consecutive year that Wisconsin had participated in the Rose Bowl, and their second consecutive loss. TCU, on the other hand, was participating in the prestigious game for the first time since 1959. The contest was a hard-fought one, with both teams demonstrating their respective strengths. TCU's quarterback, Andy Dalton, played a key role in the game, helping to secure the victory with his performance on the field. His efforts earned him the offensive MVP award for the game. Meanwhile, Tank Carder, a linebacker for TCU, earned the game's defensive MVP award. The 98th Annual Rose Bowl Game in 2012 will be remembered as an exciting and competitive matchup between two strong teams, ultimately leading to TCU's historic victory over Wisconsin.

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Barack Obama has shortened the sentences of 214 inmates of U.S. federal prisons, in what the White House called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century. The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. \\"We are not done yet,\\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries.

The very foods with a high carbon cost---meat, pork, dairy products, processed snacks---also tend to be filled with fat and calories. A green diet would be mostly vegetables and fruits, whole grains, fish and lean meats like chicken---a diet that's eco- and waistline-friendly. Eating green can be healthier and beneficial to the climate. It may be hard to believe that a meal at McDonald's produces more carbon than your trip to a far away place. More than 37% of the world's land is used for agriculture, much of which was once forested. Deforestation   is a major source of carbon. The fertilizer   and machinery needed on a modern farm also have a large carbon footprint, as does the network of ships and trucks that brings the food from the farm to your plate. The most efficient way to reduce the carbon footprint of your menu is to eat less meat, especially beef. Raising cattle takes a lot more energy than growing the equivalent   amount of grains, fruits or vegetables. What's more, the majority of cattle in the U.S. are fed on grain and loads of it---670 million tons in 2002---and the fertilizer used to feed that creates separate environmental problems. Focus on eating lower on the food chain, with more plants and fruits and less meat and dairy. It's simple. We can change today what goes into our bodies for the health of our planet and ourselves.

An Effort to Upgrade a Court Archive System to Free and Easy To Mr. Malamud, putting the nation’s legal system behind a wall of cash and kludge separates the people from what he calls the “operating system for democracy.” So, using 600,000 in contributions in 2008, he bought a 50-year archive of papers from the federal appellate courts and placed them online. By this year, he was ready to take on the larger database of district courts. Those courts, with the help of the Government Printing Office, had opened a free trial of Pacer at 17 libraries around the country. Mr. Malamud urged fellow activists to go to those libraries, download as many court documents as they could, and send them to him for republication on the Web, where Google could get to them. Aaron Swartz, a 22-year-old Stanford dropout and entrepreneur who read Mr. Malamud’s appeal, managed to download an estimated 20 percent of the entire database: 19,856,160 pages of text. Then on Sept. 29, all of the free servers stopped serving. The government, it turns out, was not pleased. A notice went out from the Government Printing Office that the free Pacer pilot program was suspended, “pending an evaluation.” A couple of weeks later, a Government Printing Office official, Richard G. Davis, told librarians that “the security of the Pacer service was compromised. The F.B.I. is conducting an investigation.” Lawyers for Mr. Malamud and Mr. Swartz told them that they appeared to have broken no laws, noting nonetheless that it was impossible to say what angry government officials might do. At the administrative office of the courts, a spokeswoman, Karen Redmond, said she could not comment on the fate of the free trial of Pacer, or whether there had been a criminal investigation into the mass download. The free program “is not terminated,” Ms. Redmond said. “We’ll just have to see what happens after the evaluation.” As for the system’s cost, she said: “We’re about as cheap as we can get it. We’re talking pennies a page.” Meanwhile, the 50 years of appellate decisions remain online and Google-friendly, and the 20 million pages of lower court decisions are available in bulk form, but are not yet easily searchable. “I want the whole database in 2009,” Mr. Malamud said. Mr. Malamud, 49, has a long record of trying to balance openness with privacy, and has also pushed the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Patent and Trademark Office to put their records online free. But the issue is a thorny one with court documents, which often contain personal information. Daniel J. Solove, a professor at the George Washington University Law School, noted that marketers skim court records for personal data, and making records easier to troll will put even more data at risk. “It’s taking away this middle ground that offered a lot of protection, practically, and throwing it into this radically wide open box,” he said. But this argument for what is known as “practical obscurity” does not convince Peter A. Winn, a privacy expert who is an assistant United States attorney in Washington State. Noting that he was speaking only for himself, he argued that the courts developed rules over the last 400 years to protect privacy. “It worked in the bricks-and-mortar age — it should work in the electronic age,” Mr. Winn said. The administrative office of the courts, he said, should take on the role of policing privacy on its databases. “This is going to take focus and a lot of hard work,” he said. Mr. Malamud agrees that the court system needs to do a better job of protecting privacy. He found thousands of documents in which the lawyers and courts had not properly redacted personal information like Social Security numbers, a violation of the courts’ own rules. There was data on children in Washington, names of Secret Service agents, members of pension funds and more. “They’re pretty spectacular blunders,” he said. He sent letters to the clerks of individual courts around the country. After some initial inaction, and repeated and increasingly spirited notices from Mr. Malamud, most of the offending documents were pulled from the databases to be redacted. Ms. Redmond, of the administrative office of the courts, said the courts comb through the documents “on a regular basis” and tell lawyers to redact confidential information. The number of violations, she noted, was relatively small. Mr. Malamud scoffed at that. “This is a large number of transgressions, and this is illegal,” he said. “The law doesn’t say that you should only publish a small number of Social Security numbers!” Mr. Malamud said his years of activism had led him to set a long-shot goal: serving in the Obama administration, perhaps even as head of the Government Printing Office. The thought might seem far-fetched — Mr. Malamud is, by admission, more of an at-the-barricades guy than a behind-the-desk guy. But he noted that he published more pages online last year than the printing office did. Mr. Malamud represents a perspective of openness and transparency that is much in tune with the new administration’s, said Lawrence Lessig, a law professor at Harvard who is a leading advocate for free culture. “The principles are those that Carl has been at the center of defining,” he said. The idea also seems to have a measure of appeal for John D. Podesta, a longtime fan of Mr. Malamud and head of the Obama transition team, who stopped short, however, of anything resembling an endorsement. “He would certainly shake things up,” Mr. Podesta said, laughing. Mr. Malamud says he is not counting on the new administration’s being quite that bold. Besides, he said, he keeps himself awfully busy doing what he believes the government ought to be doing anyway. “If called, I will certainly serve,” he said. “But if not called, I will probably serve anyway.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A16 of the New York edition with the headline: An Effort to Upgrade a Court Archive System to Free and Easy.

Question: Where is Brian when Abby approaches him? Title: The Truth About Cats & Dogs Movie plot: This article needs an improved plot summary. (August 2015) Abby Barnes (Garofalo) is a veterinarian and host of a radio show called The Truth About Cats and Dogs. When she makes a blind date with Brian (Chaplin), a caller to her show, her insecurity about her appearance leads her to persuade her more conventionally attractive (though less intellectual) friend Noelle (Thurman) to pretend to be Abby on their date. Both women develop feelings for Brian, leading to a series of comic misunderstandings. Brian's persistence in pursuing Noelle in person is thwarted as Noelle tries to maneuver him toward the real Abby. After Abby behaves jealously while drunk and embarrasses herself at a photo shoot, she leaves and it appears to her that Brian and Noelle sleep together. However, Noelle actually leaves too, and Brian, distressed by Noelle's changing attitude, corners Abby in her apartment where he finds evidence of her real identity as the radio host he fell for through her voice. As Abby and Noelle attempt to explain, Brian decides he has been the victim of a practical joke and leaves in disgust. Abby later approaches Brian at his regular bar and explains what happened, and although initially dismissive, he eventually meets with Abby and he has fallen for the real Abby and was only attracted to Noelle because of their deception. He suggests they start again, and Abby happily agrees. The answer is:","output":"Can't answer"},{"instruction":"How long ago was it…? It was a long time is all I know.

I quickly got off the train in excitement taking in the view of the station like it was first time I had seen anything. We exited the station and took the trolley to get to our hotel. For breakfast, we had delicious, regional delicacies (among other things). They looked similar to crepes, but all I know is that it had a German name that I can’t remember. After we got situated in our hotel, we immediately headed off for the Mozart Plaza/Park. My family and I also visited other monuments that day: By the end of the day, our legs were worn out. We had rode so many trolleys and walked so much that I’m pretty sure that any longer and we would’ve collapsed on the spot. The bed never felt so good.

Given the question \\"What will Cameron want to do next?\\", is \\"start to cry\\" a valid answer? Available choices:  (A). Yes;  (B). No; A:","output":"A detailed analysis of the situation is necessary for understanding whether \\"start to cry\\" would be a valid answer for what Cameron may want to do next. To begin with, let's break down the scenario. 1. Sydney mocked Cameron's remarks at school: Mockery is a form of ridicule, aimed at belittling or disparaging someone. In this context, it indicates that Sydney made fun of or insulted Cameron's words or ideas publicly. This sort of behavior might result in feelings of embarrassment, humiliation, or hurt for the person being mocked. 2. Cameron's remarks were made to seem foolish: This implies that Sydney's mockery had the effect of undermining the credibility or soundness of Cameron's statements or views. The words used by Sydney might have been sarcastic, dismissive, or derisive, further impacting Cameron's emotional state. Given these factors, it is important to consider the potential thoughts and emotions that might be affecting Cameron and how they could influence his reaction. Some possible outcomes could include: - Feeling embarrassed or humiliated: The public mocking may have led Cameron to experience a sense of embarrassment or humiliation. This could potentially cause him to withdraw, feel defensive, or try to assert himself further in the situation. Crying, in this context, could be a possible reaction if Cameron felt considerably hurt or distressed. - Becoming angry or upset: Rather than immediately prompting tears, Cameron may instead feel indignation or resentment towards Sydney for mocking him. This could inspire him to confront Sydney, defend his ideas, or retaliate in some manner. - Attempting to save face or regain credibility: In light of the embarrassment, Cameron might focus on proving that his remarks were not foolish. This could involve presenting evidence or arguments to support his point of view, or perhaps trying to discredit Sydney's mockery. - Seeking support or sympathy from others: Cameron may look to friends, classmates, or teachers for consolation, understanding, or reassurance. In this case, his focus would be on finding validation and comfort from those around him rather than dwelling on the mockery itself. To answer the question, \\"start to cry\\" could be considered a valid response (Choice A) if Cameron felt extremely hurt, embarrassed, or overwhelmed by the situation. However, it is important to remember that individual responses can differ greatly, and crying may not be the automatic or only reaction Cameron might have. It is essential to consider the various possibilities based on his personality, emotions, and the specific circumstances involved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Help as much as you can. I can use this background: Gamma rays, X-rays and the higher energy range of ultraviolet light constitute the ionizing part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The word \\"ionize\\" refers to the breaking of one or more electrons away from an atom, an action that requires the relatively high energies that these electromagnetic waves supply. Further down the spectrum, the non-ionizing lower energies of the lower ultraviolet spectrum cannot ionize atoms, but can disrupt the inter-atomic bonds which form molecules, thereby breaking down molecules rather than atoms; a good example of this is sunburn caused by long-wavelength solar ultraviolet. The waves of longer wavelength than UV in visible light, infrared and microwave frequencies cannot break bonds but can cause vibrations in the bonds which are sensed as heat. Radio wavelengths and below generally are not regarded as harmful to biological systems. These are not sharp delineations of the energies; there is some overlap in the effects of specific frequencies.The word radiation arises from the phenomenon of waves radiating (i.e., traveling outward in all directions) from a source. This aspect leads to a system of measurements and physical units that are applicable to all types of radiation. Because such radiation expands as it passes through space, and as its energy is conserved (in vacuum), the intensity of all types of radiation from a point source follows an inverse-square law in relation to the distance from its source. Like any ideal law, the inverse-square law approximates a measured radiation intensity to the extent that the source approximates a geometric point.  Now, I have a new situation: A scientists has discovered two new types of radiation. He notes that radiation type A has the ability to break away atoms from molecules, while radiation type B simply causes them to vibrate.  Answer this question please: Which radiation type will have a longer wavelength, radiation type A or B? The answer to this question is:","output":"Radiation type B will have a longer wavelength. Since radiation type A has the ability to break away atoms from molecules, it would need higher energy, which corresponds to shorter wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum. On the other hand, radiation type B, which causes atoms to vibrate, would require lower energy, and therefore would have longer wavelengths."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer this question: where does artificial raspberry flavor come from beaver?","output":"To answer the question, I will first provide information about artificial raspberry flavor and then explain its relation to beavers. Step 1: Understand artificial raspberry flavor Artificial raspberry flavor is a synthetic compound that mimics the taste of real raspberries. It is often used as a cheaper and more stable alternative to natural raspberry flavoring obtained from actual berries. Step 2: Identify key components of raspberry flavor Raspberry flavor has various components, including sweet, fruity, and floral notes. One of the essential compounds contributing to the raspberry flavor and aroma is a chemical called \\"castoreum.\\"  Step 3: Discover the relation between castoreum and beavers Castoreum is a substance found in the glandular secretions of beavers, specifically the North American and European beaver. This secretion comes from the castor sacs, which are located near the base of the beaver's tail. Beavers use this secretion to mark their territory and deter predators with its strong odor. Step 4: Explore the usage of castoreum in artificial flavoring Due to its naturally occurring fruity and musky notes, castoreum has been historically used as a component in both fragrances and food flavorings, including artificial raspberry flavor. Castoreum is collected from captive beavers through a manual expression of the castor sacs. However, it is important to note that the use of castoreum in food and beverages is relatively rare today, mainly because it is expensive and its production raises ethical concerns. In summary, artificial raspberry flavor can be derived from the castor sac secretions of beavers, which contain the chemical compound castoreum. However, this method is not commonly used today due to cost and ethical issues. Most contemporary artificial raspberry flavors are derived from purely synthetic compounds."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The team photo from September 26, 2013 tells all. Louis van Gaal has stripped and sold the scraps for parts in what appears to be an exciting new attacking era for those in the red half of Manchester. You can like our Manchester United Facebook page here. A total of 17 players or staff have left the club since the beginning of the 2013-14 season under David Moyes - United finished seventh in the Premier League. Back row: Danny Welbeck, Phil Jones, Chris Smalling, Jonny Evans, Marouane Fellaini, Rio Ferdinand, Michael Carrick, Robin van Persie. Third Row: Masseur Garry Armer, performance analyst Paul Brand, head of fitness Tony Strudwick, Antonio Valencia, Darren Fletcher, Wilfried Zaha, Adnan Januzaj, Fabio da Silva, masseur Rod Thornley, kit Manager Alec Wylie, physio Neil Hough.

Front Row: Shinji Kagawa, Rafael da Silva, Anderson, Nani, assistant Manager Steve Round, Ryan Giggs, manager David Moyes, Nemanja Vidic, coach Jimmy Lumsden, Patrice Evra, Javier \\"Chicharito\\" Hernandez, Tom Cleverley and Wayne Rooney. Danny Welbeck (back row, far left) The striker was sick of playing second fiddle to Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Co and joined Arsenal for £16million in a deadline-day move. Under Moyes, he averaged just 58 minutes per game. Danny Welbeck left Manchester United for Arsenal in a £16million, described as the 'bargain of the century' Rio Ferdinand (back row, third from right) The defender makes a tasty return to Old Trafford on Sunday with Queens Park Rangers and will be told to try and contain Radamel Falcao and United's new attacking line-up. Former England international Ferdinand turned down two other London clubs in favour of joining Harry Redknapp at Loftus Road. Veteran defender Rio Ferdinand will line up for Queens Park Rangers against his former club at Old Trafford on Sunday. Wilfried Zaha (third row, sixth from right) Zaha never truly got going at United, making just two Premier League appearances, and the winger was given permission to return to Crystal Palace, a club he helped win promotion to the top flight in 2013, on a season-long loan. Fabio da Silva (third row, fourth from right) Now on the books of Cardiff City, the full-back left United after spending a year on loan at QPR. In his six years in Manchester, Fabio managed just 22 Premier League appearances, compared with his brother, Rafael, who has broken the 100 mark. Fabio da Silva marks Wilfried Zaha and the pair are both no longer at Manchester United. Alexander Buttner (second row, fourth from left) Buttner joined Dynamo Moscow after spending two years with United. The 25-year-old left for £4.4m, having made just 13 Premier League appearances and scoring twice. Van Gaal deemed Buttner surplus to requirements following the signing of Luke Shaw from Southampton. Alexander Buttner moved from Manchester United to Dynamo Moscow after two years at Old Trafford. Coach Phil Neville (second row, third from right) Former Everton defender Neville was reunited with Moyes at United, becoming the first-team coach. The 37-year-old is now concentrating on his career as a pundit for the BBC, and following in the footsteps of his brother, Gary. Phil Neville walks with Ryan Giggs at Old Trafford but only the latter remains at Manchester United. Shinji Kagawa (front row, far left) Kagawa was never loved at Old Trafford the same way he was at Borussia Dortmund and the attacking midfielder returned to the Bundesliga club for £6.3m on a four-year contract. Nani (front row, fourth from left) Nani left to join former club Sporting Lisbon on a season-long loan and, in his own way, helped with the arrival of Marcos Rojo. Nani made 147 appearances in the Premier League and scored 25 goals. Shinji Kagawa laughs with Nani in the background during the pair's time together at Manchester United. Assistant manager Steve Round (front row, fifth from left) The departure of Moyes caused a ripple effect which was felt by his back-room staff. Round, United's assistant manager during the year they finished seventh, was relieved of his duties. Manager David Moyes (front row, centre) United did not qualify for the Champions League for the first time in 19 years and the Old Trafford club had never finished outside of the Premier League top three before. Both records were smashed. The former Everton boss and his coaching staff were paid £5.2m compensation for the sacking. Manchester United assistant manager Steve Round (left) left Manchester United with David Moyes (centre) Nemanja Vidic (front row, sixth from right) After eight years at the club and five Premier League titles - not to mention a Champions League win - Vidic decided enough was enough.

Given the question: The answer to the question: What major even brought urbanisation to the town that was a scattered farming settlement composed of a series of single-story houses? is inside the article: Neilston (Scots: Neilstoun, Scottish Gaelic: Baile Nèill, pronounced [paləˈnɛːʎ]) is a village and parish in East Renfrewshire in the west central Lowlands of Scotland. It is in the Levern Valley, 2 miles (3.2 km) southwest of Barrhead, 3.8 miles (6.1 km) south of Paisley, and 5.7 miles (9.2 km) south-southwest of Renfrew, at the southwestern fringe of the Greater Glasgow conurbation. Neilston is a dormitory village with a resident population of just over 5,000 people. Neilston is mentioned in documents from the 12th century, when the feudal lord Robert de Croc, endowed a chapel to Paisley Abbey to the North. Neilston Parish Church—a Category B listed building—is said to be on the site of this original chapel and has been at the centre of the community since 1163. Little remains of the original structure. Before industrialisation, Neilston was a scattered farming settlement composed of a series of single-storey houses, many of them thatched. Some domestic weaving was carried out using local flax. Water power from nearby streams ground corn and provided a suitable environment for bleaching the flax. The urbanisation and development of Neilston came largely with the Industrial Revolution. Industrial scale textile processing was introduced to Neilston around the middle of the 18th century with the building of several cotton mills. Neilston became a centre for cotton and calico bleaching and printing in the 18th century, which developed into a spinning and dying industry, and continued into the early 20th century. Although Neilston is known as a former milling village, agriculture has played, and continues to play, an economic role. The annual Neilston Agricultural Show is an important trading and cultural event for farmers from southwest Scotland each spring.Although heavy industry died out in the latter half of the 20th century, as part of Scotland's densely populated Central Belt, Neilston has continued to grow as a commuter village, supported by its position between Paisley and Glasgow, from roughly 1,000..., can you guess it ?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. (CNN)  -- Bill Tilden was a controversial tennis legend who dominated the sport in the 1920s, but died in disgrace. The American achieved fame and fortune through his tennis exploits and befriended Hollywood stars such as Charlie Chaplin, but he spent over a year in jail in the 1940s on a morals charge, which ruined his reputation before his untimely death in 1953. Tilden won his six straight U.S. Open titles from 1920-1925, a record since the tournament abolished the challenge system -- where the champion automatically qualified for the final -- in 1911. Under that system, Richard Sears won the first seven editions of the U.S. Open (then the U.S. National Tennis Championships) in the 1880s. Last year, world No. 1 Roger Federer failed in his bid to match Tilden's record when he was beaten in the final by Juan Martin Del Potro. Tilden, who claimed his seventh U.S. Open title in 1929 as well as being twice a losing finalist, goes down in the history books as one of the greatest tennis players of all time. A relatively late starter, Tilden struggled to get into his college tennis team in Pennsylvania, but years of dedicated practice started to bear fruit after the First World War as he reached the U.S. Open finals of 1918 and 1919. He reached his peak in the 1920s, winning his first U.S. Open title and holding the world number one spot for seven straight years. Tilden also led the United States to a record seven straight Davis Cup titles as well as claiming three Wimbledon titles. His famed \\"cannonball\\" serves worked particularly well on the fast grass surfaces on which the U.S. Open and Wimbledon were staged. Tilden never won the French Open, being losing finalist in the last year it was held on grass courts, in 1927, and 1930 on clay. He won the last of his 10 grand slam titles at Wimbledon in 1930 before deserting the amateur ranks for the fledging professional circuit. Eventually joined by the likes of Ellsworth Vines, Fred Perry and Don Budge, Tilden remained a star attraction until well into his 40s, filling arenas such as Madison Square Garden in big-money matches. But off the court, Tilden was a controversial figure, battling with tennis officials as his amateur status was called into question, and he was accused of being arrogant and inconsiderate. Tilden, who never married, saw his reputation destroyed in the 1940s when he was found guilty of a morals charge in connection with a minor. He served seven-and-a-half months of a year's jail term, but was arrested again in 1949 after picking up a 16-year-old male hitchhiker. Tilden served a further 10 months for his probation violation and was shunned by the tennis community. His friendship with Hollywood stars such as Chaplin and a love of the theatrical world saw Tilden pour much of his riches into less-than-successful Broadway productions. He died a tragic figure in 1953, having a stroke in Los Angeles as he prepared for a trip to play in the U.S. Pro Championships despite his 60 years of age. Tilden was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1959, and in any polls of all-time great tennis players he always features in the top order. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"This article is about Bill Tilden, a famous tennis player from the 1920s who was very successful but had a difficult life.

To ensure that you don't lose a large amount of money while betting on a horse race, decide in advance how much you are willing to spend. Think about what type of bets you would like to place and how much risk you are willing to take. Note that the minimum bet is 2 USD for the most basic wager. Go to the betting window and tell the clerk the number of the race you're betting on. Tell them how much you are betting, the type of wager, and the number of the horse as it is listed in the program. Be sure to check your betting ticket before leaving the window to correct any mistakes that might be on it. Automatic tellers are also available at some racetracks. Horse betting can be done online through sites that use advance deposit wagering. Read the rules and regulations of a site and register to be able to place a bet. Look for a site that offers free video streaming of the horse races, and doesn't demand a sign-up fee or wagering fees for each bet. A straight win wager is the simplest bet to place at the racetrack. Choose 1 horse and bet on it winning first place. The odds of winning a “win” wager are average. ” Place a bet on your horse “placing” (i.e., either winning or coming in second), which will increase your odds of winning. The payout will be less, but the risk of losing is also smaller. To make the bet even safer, bet on your horse “showing,” which means you will get a payout if it comes in first, second, or third. If you're feeling confident, place an “across the board” bet, which is essentially 3 bets in 1. It is usually 3 times more expensive than “win,” “place,” or “show” bets because you're betting on your horse winning all the first 3 places. If your horse wins, you get the money from all 3 bets. Unlike “straight” wagers, “exotic” wagers involve multiple horses and very specific situations. These bets are often 3 or 4 times more expensive than simple bets and have lower odds, but hold the potential for a larger payout if you win. Choose your bet carefully and only go through with it if you have enough cash to handle a likely loss. Some examples of “exotic” bets are:  A “quinella” bet, where your horses must finish first and second, in any order. This is the simplest “exotic” bet to place. An “exacta” bet, where your horses must finish first and second in the specific order you choose. A “trifecta” bet, where your horses must win first, second, and third place in the specific order you choose. A “daily double” bet, where your horses must win two consecutive races on the same day. This varies in risk given the number of horses you bet on. A “pick 3” race, where your horses must win three consecutive races on the same day. This is essentially a “daily double” plus another race.

So, we have: -765 = 15*s - 510 Step 3: Isolate the variable 's'. - To isolate the variable 's', we'll add 510 to both sides of the equation. This will cancel out the -510 on the right side: -765 + 510 = 15*s - 510 + 510 Step 4: Perform the arithmetic operation - When we add -765 and 510, the result is negative, as follows: -255 = 15*s Step 5: Solve for 's'. - Now, we have 15 multiplied by 's' equal to -255. To find 's', we'll divide both sides of this equation by 15: (-255) / 15 = (15*s) / 15 Step 6: Perform the arithmetic operation - When we divide -255 by 15, we get: s = -17 So, the solution is s = -17."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Check fuses and breakers when the furnace doesn't light.\\" Article:","output":"Title: How to Fix a Furnace That Doesn't Light: A Simple Guide for Kids Hey kids! Have you ever wondered how a furnace works to keep our homes warm and cozy during cold days? Sometimes, it needs a little help to work properly, just like when our toys need new batteries. Today, we'll learn how to safely fix a furnace that doesn't light. Don't worry, we'll make it simple and fun, so even if you're only five years old, you can understand! Step 1: Place a Container Under Bleeder Pipes First, let's learn about bleeder pipes. These are small pipes in a furnace that help get rid of air bubbles or extra water. Sometimes, gunk might come out of those pipes, and we don't want to make a mess, right? So before we start fixing, we need to place a container, like a small bucket or a plastic bowl, under the bleeder pipes. This will keep our floor clean and dry - just like when we put a paper towel under our drinks to catch any spills. Step 2: Press the Reset Button Did you know that furnaces have a reset button, just like our toys and games? When something stops working, we can try pressing the reset button and see if it starts working again. Find the reset button on your furnace - it's usually red or black - and press it gently but firmly. It's like telling your furnace, \\"Wake up, buddy! We need you for some warmth!\\" Step 3: Check Fuses and Breakers Okay, so we've tried using the reset button, but what if our furnace still doesn't light up? Don't worry! We can also check the fuses and breakers. Now, you might think, \\"What are those?\\" Well, fuses and breakers are like little safety guards in our homes that make sure we have the right amount of electricity for all our appliances, including the furnace. Sometimes, fuses and breakers can switch off if there's too much electricity being used. When this happens, our furnace won't get the power it needs to light up. We'll ask an adult to help us find the fuse box or breaker panel in our home, which is usually in the basement or a utility room. Then, we can check if any of the fuses or breakers are turned off for the furnace. If we find one, we'll make sure to turn it back on! And there you have it, kids! With these three simple steps, we've helped our furnace work properly again. Now our homes will be warm and comfortable, just in time for a cozy movie night with the family. Remember, fixing things can be fun and easy when we break it down into small steps and always ask for an adult's help!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Jeffrey knew how to sneak out of the house without Brett knowing, as","output":"Jeffrey knew how to sneak out of the house without Brett knowing, as he had carefully observed all the sounds, movements, and patterns within the house over a considerable amount of time. His methods were refined to an art, the result of months of close observation and minute attention to detail. From his room, located at the end of the hallway on the second floor, he would often listen to the ticks of the old grandfather clock in the hall. Every hour, it would strike, and he noticed that the thick, heavy sound of the gong would fairly echo through the house. This was the first thing on his list: timing his escape to coincide with the hourly clamor of the clock when it struck. The noise from the clock would effectively mask any other sound he might make, giving him a safe window of opportunity. Aside from the ticking clock, he had come to memorize the old hardwood floor's quirks and groans like a sailor knows the rhythm of his ship. There were certain boards, especially near Brett's room, that would sigh under the barest weight, while others were as silent as stone. He had painstakingly mapped out the silent path in his mind, a safe route connecting his room to the backdoor, and would rehearse traversing it whilst he was alone. Next was Brett’s routine. As a light sleeper who worked night shifts, Brett would be home always in the wee hours. Jeffrey noticed a pattern in Brett's behavior. After coming home, Brett usually spent some time having a late snack before heading to bed and would be dead to the world until sunrise. The best time to make an escape, he had deduced, was just after Brett had retired for the night and the grandfather clock struck. Even the family dog, an aged Labrador named Zeus, was part of Jeffrey’s planning. Zeus was fond of Jeffrey, and the feeling was mutual. Jeffrey had managed to train Zeus not to bark or get too excited when he saw him during 'off hours', mainly through a combination of treats, affection, and repetition. Having everything planned out meticulously, Jeffrey had grown confident in his ability to ghost through the house undetected. Even the squeaky third step of the backdoor staircase - a detail he had discovered much later into his observation period - was accounted for in his plan. He’d simply leap over it, a minor feat of athleticism that even in sleepy haze he could manage. Finally, he made sure he did everything slowly and calmly, to prevent rushing and causing a mistake. Quick movements and panic were the enemy of stealth. A calm mind, deep, slow breaths, and deliberate actions were his keys to success. So, with the calculated precision of a master strategist, Jeffrey would disappear into the night undetected, the grandfather clock conveniently masking his careful footfalls. All thanks to the thorough planning and observation of a boy navigating his world, learning the ways to escape unnoticed from safe confines unfathomed by his caretaker, Brett."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels. On the other other hand, radioactive elements are nonrenewable like fossil fuels and could eventually be used up.  There are two cities, Chien and Marisol, in France that are leaders in the amount of wine they export to the rest of the world. Although they both export the same amount of wine, they use different sources of power to generate their electricity. Chien uses coal to power the city and Marisol uses nuclear power plants to produce electricity. The citizens of both cities are voting on whether to continue their current method of electricity generation.  Does Marisol have a higher or lower chance of acid rain than Chien? Answer:","output":"Marisol has a significantly lower chance of experiencing acid rain compared to Chien due to the differences in their electricity generation methods and the resulting environmental impacts. Chien relies on coal to generate electricity, which involves the combustion of fossil fuels. The process of burning coal releases various harmful gases and particles into the atmosphere, including sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). When these pollutants interact with water vapor in the atmosphere, they form sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3), which then fall back to Earth as acid rain. Prolonged exposure to acid rain can be detrimental to ecosystems, deteriorate building materials and infrastructure, and negatively impact human health. On the other hand, Marisol uses nuclear power plants to produce electricity. Nuclear power generation is a non-combustion process, meaning it does not release combustion by-products like SO2 and NOx into the atmosphere. Instead, nuclear energy is produced through controlled nuclear reactions, which generate heat that is then used to produce electricity. Although nuclear power plants do produce radioactive waste, they do not emit greenhouse gases or other pollutants that cause acid rain. As a result, Marisol has a much lower risk of experiencing acid rain compared to Chien. However, it is essential to recognize that nuclear power comes with its own set of risks and challenges, including the potential for accidents, the long-term storage and management of radioactive waste, and concerns regarding the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Despite these challenges, nuclear power's ability to generate electricity without producing air pollution or contributing to acid rain makes it a more environmentally sustainable option for Marisol than Chien's reliance on coal. Therefore, when considering the specific risk of acid rain, Marisol has a lower chance than Chien due to its utilization of nuclear power plants for electricity generation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Indian government expressed \\"concern\\" over the constitution and on Monday recalled its ambassador to Nepal for urgent consultations. Since then, leading Nepalese newspapers have been criticising what they see as interference. More than 40 people have been killed in protests in areas adjoining India. \\"Certainly, while drafting the constitution serious problems have erupted in our country,\\" says the prominent Nepali paper Kantipur, but goes on to add that \\"it is for us to solve these problems\\". \\"A neighbouring country's coming into the picture, or its being invited to solve our internal problems and challenges, is not acceptable at all,\\" the paper says.

Emperor Gaozu was troubled about the abundant Han-manufactured iron weapons traded to the Xiongnu along the northern borders, and he established a trade embargo against the group. Although the embargo was in place, the Xiongnu found traders willing to supply their needs. Chinese forces also mounted surprise attacks against Xiongnu who traded at the border markets. In retaliation, the Xiongnu invaded what is now Shanxi province, where they defeated the Han forces at Baideng in 200 BC. After negotiations, the heqin agreement in 198 BC nominally held the leaders of the Xiongnu and the Han as equal partners in a royal marriage alliance, but the Han were forced to send large amounts of tribute items such as silk clothes, food, and wine to the Xiongnu.

Article: Consumers can expect to pay more to get a mortgage next year, the result of changes meant to reduce the role that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac play in the market.

Such fees are... ||||| This Christmas holiday, a number of families will be allowed to stay in their homes for a short while longer. Mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have both announced a two-week moratorium on evictions over the Christmas and New Year's holiday. Though the gesture seems benevolent and considerate, does it really mean that much?      A brief respite      From Dec. 18 through Jan. 3, residents of foreclosed single-family homes and two- to four-unit dwellings will be allowed to stay without disturbance from Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. The moratorium will only stand for actual evictions, as other administrative functions and proceedings will continue during the two-week period. In addition, the local eviction companies will be allowed to continue their administrative duties to prepare for the eviction at the end of the break.      By looking at the most recent data from both Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, the firms have foreclosed on an average of 58,000 homes per quarter. The two-week moratorium may give up to 11,000 families nationwide the time they need to reach out to friends and family to make new living arrangements.      Nothing new      The moratorium is not a new occurrence for the mortgage giants. Each year they announce the same respite for beleaguered families. Though the families appreciate the gesture, investors shouldn't view the event as a real kindness that would cost the companies anything. Since the administrative and procedural steps will continue on schedule, the only difference to Freddie and Fannie will be the physical acquisition of the foreclosed property.      Though Fannie and Freddie wouldn't be able to sell the foreclosed property before the eviction, that would possibly pose a slight delay for the firms, but the Christmas holiday is historically a slow time for property sales -- giving the GSEs very little downside for offering the moratorium.      Season of giving      Announcing the moratorium has given both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac the opportunity to give some advice to troubled homeowners. Both firms have expressed their desire that borrowers who find themselves in trouble should seek help as soon as possible. Terry Edwards, chief operating officer for Fannie Mae, said, \\"We encourage any homeowner who is having difficulty making their mortgage payment to reach out for help right away. Fannie Mae will continue to help borrowers avoid foreclosure whenever possible.\\" Both GSEs have good records of helping troubled borrowers avoid foreclosure, with Freddie Mac saying eight out of 10 borrowers have been able to stay in their homes with the foreclosure alternatives it provides.      Hopefully the extra time the families get from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae's moratorium will be enough to allow them a happy holiday season. For investors, the mortgage giants' generosity should give you a little bit of the warm and fuzzies, without any concerns about their operations. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"In this article, it discusses how mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will charge higher fees on loans to borrowers with lower down payments and credit scores, causing consumers to pay more for mortgages next year. However, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have also announced a two-week moratorium on evictions for foreclosed single-family homes and two- to four-unit dwellings, to last from Dec. 18 through Jan. 3.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Little is known of the earliest Stone Age inhabitants of Europe's southwestern extremity. The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century. Under Moorish Rule In a.d. 711, the Moors brought powerful armies from North Africa and launched a devastating attack on the Iberian peninsula, conquering much of what would become Spain and Portugal. They imposed Islam and left an indelible influence on the countryside and the population of the Algarve. The Moorish legacy can still be seen in the form of wells and waterwheels, squat white houses, the dark complexions of the people, and in the very name given the region — taken from Al-Gharb, which means \\"country of the west\\" (when the Moors conquered the territory, it was the most westerly in the known world). The Moors governed their Iberian kingdoms from across the border in Seville, but the Algarve had its own regional capital and huge, invulnerable fortress. The capital was Chelb (or Xelb), and it was bigger and better defended than Lisbon. Today the town, known as Silves,  is a provincial outpost whose only besiegers are busloads of tourists who climb the narrow streets up to the old Moorish ramparts.

Here is a goal: Mix the concrete for concrete slab. How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of mixing concrete for a concrete slab, I would follow these step-by-step instructions while justifying each step: 1. Determine the necessary concrete mix ratio: The first step is to find out the appropriate concrete mix ratio needed for the specific project. This is important because the ratio of cement, sand, and aggregate (gravel) will affect the strength and durability of the concrete slab. Typically, a common ratio is 1:2:3 (cement:sand:aggregate) for normal strength concrete slabs. 2. Calculate the required materials: Once the mix ratio is determined, calculate the amount of materials needed based on the size of the slab. Measure the area and depth of the slab and convert it to cubic meters or yards. Then, multiply the volume by the various mix ratio components to find out the total weight of each required material (cement, sand, and aggregate). 3. Gather materials and tools: Purchase or gather all the necessary materials, such as cement, sand, and aggregate, along with tools like a concrete mixer or wheelbarrow, a shovel or hoe, and buckets for measuring the materials. 4. Measure the materials: Carefully measure the materials using the calculated quantities from step 2, ensuring that the mix ratio is maintained. This is crucial for obtaining the desired strength and consistency of the concrete. 5. Mix the dry materials: First, pour the sand and aggregate into the mixer or wheelbarrow, and mix them evenly. Then, gradually add the cement and mix until the dry materials are well combined. This step ensures that the cement will be evenly distributed throughout the concrete. 6. Gradually add water: Start adding water to the dry materials while mixing, being careful not to add too much at once. Use a watering can or hose with a spray nozzle so that water can be added slowly. The right consistency of the concrete mix is obtained when it's not too wet, but it's workable and can be easily spread and compacted. Typically, this is when the concrete starts to look like thick oatmeal. 7. Mix the concrete thoroughly: Continue mixing the concrete for a few minutes, ensuring that all ingredients are evenly distributed and the texture is consistent. Good mixing is crucial for obtaining optimal strength and durability of the concrete slab. 8. Pour and level the concrete slab: Once the concrete has been mixed, pour it into the prepared area immediately. This avoids the concrete from starting to set before it's in position. Use a straight edge or a screed to level the concrete and ensure a smooth surface. By following these steps, I would accomplish the goal of mixing concrete for a concrete slab, ensuring proper ratio, mixing, and pouring for optimal concrete slab strength and durability."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Title: Hercules Movie plot: After imprisoning the Titans beneath the ocean, the Greek gods gather to Mount Olympus for Zeus, and his wife Hera have a son named Hercules. While the other gods are joyful, Zeus' jealous brother Hades plots to overthrow Zeus and rule Mount Olympus. Turning to the Fates for help, Hades learns that in eighteen years, a planetary alignment will allow Hades to locate and free the Titans to conquer Olympus, but only if Hercules does not interfere. Hades sends his minions Pain and Panic to dispose of Hercules. The two succeed at kidnapping and feeding him a formula that turns him mortal, but fail to remove his superhuman strength before Hercules is found and adopted by the farmers Amphitryon and Alcmene. Years later, the teenaged Hercules becomes an outcast due to his strength, and wonders where he came from. After his foster parents reveal the necklace they found him with, Hercules decides to visit the temple of Zeus for answers. The temple's statue of Zeus comes to life and reveals all to Hercules, telling him that he can regain his godhood by becoming a \\"true hero\\". Zeus sends Hercules and his forgotten infant-hood friend Pegasus to find the satyr Philoctetesâ\\"Phil\\" for shortâwho is known for training heroes. The two meet Phil, who has retired from training heroes due to numerous disappointments, but Hercules inspires him to follow his dream to train a true hero who will be recognized by the gods. Phil trains Hercules into a potential hero, and when he is older, they fly for Thebes. On the way, they meet Megaraâ\\"Meg\\" for shortâa sarcastic damsel whom Hercules saves from the centaur Nessus. However, after Hercules, Phil, and Pegasus leave, Meg is revealed to be Hades' minion, having sold her soul to him to save an unfaithful lover. Arriving in Thebes, Hercules is turned down by the downtrodden citizens until Meg says that two boys are trapped in a gorge. Hercules saves them, unaware that they are Pain and Panic in disguise, allowing Hades to summon the Hydra to fight Hercules. Hercules continually cuts...

Not Sold Out: Alternatively, the guitarist from Kiss might perform on stage, but the event does not sell out. This outcome could result from several factors, such as less promotion, a smaller venue capacity, or the performance occurring concurrently with other popular events. In this scenario, the crowd at the show is not sold out. 3. Partially Sold Out: In this situation, the guitarist's performance does generate interest, but not enough to sell out the show completely. Some seats/areas may remain unoccupied, resulting in a partially sold-out show. Varied reasons such as ticket prices, the day of the week, and competing events could contribute to this outcome.

CANTON — Louis and Judith Friedman took their mission throughout the state, the country, the world. Once, on a trip to the Soviet-era Kremlin, they famously presented Mikhail Gorbachev with a solar-powered watch.      But they never left Canton or the house on their sprawling, 25-acre property, an energy-efficient marvel built decades before \\"global warming\\" was rolled into the national lexicon.      The couple, pioneers in advocating for environmental issues, were found dead in that home Tuesday, but residents say their legacy in this town of 10,300 — and beyond — will live on.      \\"They were nice people. They were always willing to help,\\" Karen Bahre, the owner of Applegate Farms, said Tuesday. The Friedmans were frequent patrons of the farm's produce stand, located down the road from their property. Last year, Judith even offered to donate some of the raspberries from their farm to Bahre and her workers.      \\"That was her way,\\" Bahre said. \\"She was gracious.\\"      Like so many of her neighbors, Bahre was shocked at the news of the Friedmans' deaths.      Canton police Chief Christopher Arciero told The Courant that \\"preliminarily, evidence indicates the deaths were apparent suicides.\\" He declined to discuss the cause of their deaths, citing the investigation by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.      Judi and Lou Friedman Courant File Photo Judi and Lou Friedman in 1991. Judi and Lou Friedman in 1991. (Courant File Photo) (Courant File Photo)      Longtime friends said the couple struggled with medical issues. Louis, 81, had been mostly confined to his home in the last three years, beset by problems with his knees and heart. Judith, 80, retired earlier this month from the People's Action for Clean Energy, the group she led for 43 years, partly due to health concerns, one colleague said.      Arciero said the Friedmans' family attorney discovered their bodies while visiting their home for a prearranged business meeting. Investigators were withholding the name of the attorney, a lawyer out of Avon, until they had a chance to discuss the case with him in more detail, Arciero said.      The couple's three children traveled to Canton on Tuesday to handle the family's affairs. Their son, Seth, declined to comment as he stood outside his parents' home on Lawton Road. His emotions were too raw, he said. But there was no shortage of people Tuesday willing to discuss the lives of the Friedmans.      \\"They were awesome, they were just rocks, solid rocks,\\" Barbara Backman, a former vice president for PACE, said as she choked back tears. \\"They lived what they believed. They walked their talk.\\"      As long as a quarter-century ago, the couple gained fame for advocating environmental issues and putting energy-saving methods into practice. Theirs was one of the first houses in the state to utilize solar panels, which were among the many features praised by the New York Times as \\"ahead of their time\\" in the newspaper's 1992 profile of the couple.      Outside of their concerns for the environment, Louis Friedman founded Westledge School, an experimental, multiracial secondary school in Simsbury in 1968. It closed a decade later. He also helped Judith edit her children's books, titles like \\"The Eel's Strange Journey\\" and \\"Jelly Jam: The People Preserver,\\" that stressed the importance of environmental stewardship. Three of those books Judith penned in the 1970s and 1980s are still in circulation at the Canton Public Library.      They took their cause to the global stage as well, traveling throughout Asia and Europe to discuss environmental and world-peace issues for Promoting Enduring Peace and EarthKind, Washington-based advocacy groups that Louis worked for, according to a biography he wrote for Swarthmore College.      After the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, Louis organized fundraisers for the victims and brought members of the media on tours of the devastated landscape, as detailed in a Courant article from 1998.      \\"They started telling the state — and the rest of the country, really — that clean energy was the way to go,\\" Backman said. \\"It was Judi who hung on and was there as a beacon.\\"      Backman met the Friedmans years ago, on one of the many solar home tours that they organized through PACE. Theirs was an instant friendship, one that spanned decades.      She clings to the memory of helping Judith clean out her basement a few weeks ago, laughing with her as they filled nearly 30 trash bags with equipment and recyclables.      \\"They welcomed everybody, they just were some of the most open people,\\" she said. \\"Even though they knew what they believed in and fought for it, they never disparaged anyone who disagreed with them.\\"      Jessie Stratton, a former state representative who lives around the corner from the couple in Canton, said she'll miss the Friedmans dearly. \\"They lived their lives dedicated to the things they believed in,\\" she said, noting that Judith often testified in front of her when she led the legislature's environment committee.      The couple had a way of engaging with everyone, of letting their colleagues know they appreciated their efforts. Little gestures that people often overlooked, like the handwritten thank-you notes Louis would send.      \\"He was always so thoughtful. It was important to him to let people know what he was thinking,\\" said Gretchen Swibold, a former member of Canton's board of assessors who received many of those notes since moving to the town in 1971. \\"They set an example for all of us.\\"      The couple's passion, even in their later years, always inspired her.      \\"I'm 83 years old, and I told Judi several times that they don't have to do this anymore,\\" Swibold said. \\"She just told me 'This is what I do.' She couldn't imagine giving it up.\\"      Her passion, limitless as it was, inspired others. As David Sinish put it, when \\"Judi called you up and asked you to do something, you'd say, 'Yes, sure.' \\"      \\"When you worked with her, you couldn't help but become more outspoken, more of an activist,\\" said Sinish, a former Canton selectman and longtime environmental advocate in his own right. \\"And she was the most gracious, thankful volunteer manager that we were ever involved with.\\"      When Sinish and his wife heard of their friends' deaths, they realized, through their mourning, that they owed it to the Friedmans to continue their work.      \\"One of conclusions we had is that well, they're not here any longer, so we'll have to work harder to make up for that deficit,\\" he said.      Courant staff writer David Owens contributed to this story ||||| CANTON–A prominent couple from Canton was found dead in their home Tuesday, and police are investigating.      Police say they are investigating the deaths of Judith, 80, and Lou Friedman, 81, and say it is an isolated incident and there is no threat to the public.      According to the Hartford Courant, the deaths are being investigated by police as “apparent suicides” based on preliminary evidence.      The official causes of death will be released Wednesday after the autopsies are completed.      State Police also responded to the scene to investigate.      The Courant reports that couple is best known for advocating for environmental issues and energy saving, and has been active in that respect for more than a quarter century. Lou Friedman also found the Westledge School in Simsbury, and Judith Friedman headed the Peoples’ Action for Clean Energy, wrote children’s books and ran a summer camp.      They were also among the first residents in Connecticut to install solar panels for hot water.

Background: The primary role of red blood cells in the circulatory system is to transport oxygen to the tissues. The actual carrier of oxygen molecules is the protein hemoglobin, which binds to the oxygen and moves it throughout the body, releasing it in areas where the concentration of dissolved oxygen is low. A certain mutation in the gene for hemoglobin causes a slight change in the structure of this crucial protein, resulting in a disease called sickle-cell anemia. For people with this mutation, the hemoglobin produced by their red blood cells has a tendency to clump together, distorting the shape of the red blood cells and giving rise to the crescent-shaped cells seen above. By understanding the changes in structure that are the underlying cause of this disease, we have developed various ways to treat and manage this illness.  Paragraph: Doctors studied Dan, a normal patient, whit a normal number of red blood cells, and Jim, a patient that had sickle-cell anemia. The differences were remarkable in terms of overall well-being and health.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which patient had more red blood cells, Dan or Jim?","output":"The paragraph does not provide specific information on which patient, Dan or Jim, had more red blood cells. The paragraph only states that Dan is a normal patient with a normal number of red blood cells, and Jim is a patient with sickle-cell anemia. The number of red blood cells can vary in individuals with sickle-cell anemia, and it is often the shape and functionality rather than the sheer number of these cells that causes health complications. Therefore, without additional data, we cannot conclusively say who between Dan and Jim has more red blood cells."},{"instruction":"Read the following context and answer the question.

The sentence provided is: \\"The witch turned him from a prince.\\" First, let's examine the sentence from a syntactic standpoint, which refers to the structural arrangement and relationship between words and phrases. The sentence appears to satisfy the basic requirements of English syntax, with the following components: 1. Subject: \\"The witch\\" - a noun phrase (NP) that acts as the agent of the action. 2. Verb: \\"turned\\" - the main verb representing the action, in simple past tense. 3. Direct Object: \\"him\\" - a pronoun referring to the person who undergoes the action of the verb. 4. Prepositional Phrase: \\"from a prince\\" - providing additional information about the object, \\"him.\\" Although the sentence might appear structurally sound, some linguists might argue that it is semantically ambiguous. Semantics refers to the meaning conveyed by language. In the given sentence, the intended meaning might not be clear: Does it mean that the witch transformed the man, who was once a prince, into something else? Or does the sentence imply that the witch separated the man from a prince, as in positioning? To eliminate the ambiguity, the sentence can be rephrased by using a different verb or preposition, or by providing more context: 1. \\"The witch turned him into a frog from a prince.\\" - Explicitly stating the result of the transformation clarifies the intended meaning. 2. \\"The witch transformed him from a prince to a frog.\\" - In this case, using the verbs \\"transform\\" or \\"change\\" along with \\"to\\" can make the sentence more precise and less ambiguous. Lastly, linguists may also examine the sentence from a pragmatic perspective, which deals with the context and intended meaning within a particular situation. Without clear context, the sentence may seem vague, but if it were a part of a larger narrative, the intended meaning might be obvious to the reader or listener. In conclusion, a linguist would likely find the given sentence to be syntactically valid but semantically ambiguous, potentially requiring rephrasing or additional context to clarify the intended meaning. In certain contexts, however, the sentence might be deemed acceptable as-is."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

My friends and I visited this much-talked-about new restaurant in town, hoping to enjoy a unique and healthy meal. Unfortunately, our experience was far from pleasant. Upon arrival, we had to wait for 30 minutes beyond our reserved time, even though the restaurant seemed to have open tables. The hostess seemed quite disorganized and frazzled when accommodating guests, which was frustrating. We were finally seated in a cramped space, with tables placed too close together, making it hard to have an intimate conversation without feeling like we were becoming a part of the conversations around us. The menu was rather confusing, with dish names that didn't offer a clear explanation of what they consisted of, and our server couldn't provide satisfactory descriptions either. When asked for recommendations, the server appeared uncertain and suggested we just \\"try a couple of things and see what we like.\\" Thankfully, after some more questioning, we managed to select some dishes to try. The presentation of our appetizers was quite appealing; however, the first bite was where it went downhill. The kale chips were excessively salty and the spinach dip had a strange texture. Health-conscious cuisine does not mean that attention to flavor should be dismissed, and these dishes were a clear indication of that. Our main courses didn't fare much better. I ordered the quinoa-stuffed bell pepper, which was undercooked and lacked any substantial seasoning. My friend's grilled miso tofu was dry and crumbly instead of moist and smooth. Moreover, the prices were exorbitant compared to the quality of what we received. It's disheartening to spend hard-earned money on food that doesn't live up to the expectations set by the restaurant's marketing. The only redeeming factor of the evening was the dessert - a decadent vegan chocolate mousse. But one stellar dish could not make up for the litany of disappointments. The overall experience at \\"The Questionable Quinoa\\" was frustrating and disappointing. Though I believe in supporting local businesses and encouraging incorporation of healthy ingredients in restaurant offerings, I could not, in good faith, recommend this restaurant to others. If you want a joint that ensures delicious, fresh, and well-prepared meals, it's worth exploring one of the many other exciting dining options in our area."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Golden Heian Era: The geomancers in 794 decided that Heian-kyo (modern Kyoto) would be an auspicious site for the imperial family. It was indeed — until 1869. Grants of tax-free land over the years had been made to Buddhist temples and members of the court aristocracy. The most powerful families thus carved out for themselves whole regions that were to become the fiefdoms of Japanese feudalism. By the end of the eighth century the clans had created a hierarchy of shiki, or rights, from the highest to the lowest ranks of society. The aristocrat or court patron lent his prestige to a powerful provincial proprietor, who employed a competent estate-manager to oversee smallholders, who in turn worked their farms with dependent laborers. This elaborate structure of interdependent rights and obligations was to serve Japanese society right into the 20th century. Meanwhile, Heian court life blossomed in an effusion of aesthetic expression. Princes and princesses judged the merits of birds, insects, flowers, roots, or seashells. Literary party games held in ornate palace gardens required each guest to compose a small poem as his wine cup floated toward him along a miniature winding channel of water. Expeditions were organized to the best viewing points for the first spring cherry blossoms, and special pavilions were built to watch the rising of the full moon. Every gesture, from the most banal opening of an umbrella to the sublimest act of lovemaking, had its appropriate ceremonial. Conversation often took the form of elegant exchanges of improvised verse. The changing role of Chinese culture in Japanese life was epitomized in the language itself. In the absence of an indigenous alphabet, Japanese scholars had with the greatest difficulty tried to adapt the complex ideograms of monosyllabic Chinese to the essentially polysyllabic Japanese. Thus developed the katakana system used as a vehicle for writing Buddhist names and concepts. After rival Fujiwara factions had been struggling for years to gain control of the imperial throne, they turned to the Taira and Minamoto armies in 1156 to wage the four-year war that heralded the end of the golden age of the Heian court. The Taira, controlling the region along the Inland Sea, defeated the Minamoto armies based in the Kanto province east of the capital.

Please answer a question about the following article about Ottoman Empire: The effective military and bureaucratic structures of the previous century came under strain during a protracted period of misrule by weak Sultans. The Ottomans gradually fell behind the Europeans in military technology as the innovation that fed the Empire's forceful expansion became stifled by growing religious and intellectual conservatism. But in spite of these difficulties, the Empire remained a major expansionist power until the Battle of Vienna in 1683, which marked the end of Ottoman expansion into Europe. Poor rule by what class of people strained the empire?","output":"The poor rule that strained the Ottoman Empire during the protracted period of misrule can be attributed to weak Sultans who failed to effectively maintain and develop the military and bureaucratic structures that had previously propelled the empire to greatness. These weak Sultans had a significant impact on the empire's trajectory, ultimately contributing to its decline. In the context of the Ottoman Empire, Sultans were the supreme rulers, possessing complete authority over governance and state affairs. They were key figures in determining the empire's policies and direction. As the Ottoman Empire transitioned from a period of strong, dynamic leadership under powerful and effective Sultans to an era of misrule by weak and ineffective rulers, the essential structures that had ensured the empire's prosperity and dominance became compromised. There are several factors that contributed to the rise of weak Sultans and their detrimental effects on the empire. Among these factors were the increasingly conservative approach to religion and intellectualism and the growing reliance on the palace bureaucracy, which diminished the Sultans' direct involvement in governance and allowed for corruption and inefficiency to enter the ranks of the administrators. Additionally, the practice of fratricide—wherein brothers of the reigning Sultan would be executed to eliminate potential rivals—fell out of favor, and many Sultans refrained from this brutal custom in favor of keeping potential rivals alive. This decision led to the emergence of factions and power struggles within the empire, further weakening the authority of the Sultans. As weak Sultans gained power and contributed to the misrule of the empire, their inability to adapt to changing military technology, one of the cornerstones of the empire's success, significantly hampered their forces. The Europeans were advancing their military prowess, and the Ottomans lagged behind, failing to implement and make use of new innovations and strategies. This further diminished the might of the Ottoman Empire, which had once been a feared and powerful force. Despite these challenges, the Ottoman Empire remained a major expansionist power until 1683, with the Battle of Vienna marking the end of Ottoman ambitions in Europe. The decline of the empire can largely be attributed to the poor rule by weak Sultans, who failed to effectively manage and advance the military, bureaucratic, and intellectual components that had once made the empire a pinnacle of strength and progress."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Which entity is this text about? Daniel Boone (November 2, 1734 [O.S. October 22] - September 26, 1820) was an American pioneer, explorer, woodsman, and frontiersman, whose frontier exploits made him one of the first folk heroes of the United States. Boone is most famous for his exploration and settlement of what is now Kentucky, which was then part of Virginia but on the other side of the mountains from the settled areas. As a young adult, Boone supplemented his farm income by hunting and trapping game, and selling their pelts in the fur market. Through this occupational interest, Boone first learned the easy routes to the area. Daniel Boone was of English and Welsh ancestry. Because the Gregorian calendar was adopted during his lifetime, Boone's birth date is sometimes given as November 2, 1734 (the \\"New Style\\" date), although Boone used the October date. The Boone family belonged to the Religious Society of Friends, called \\"Quakers\\", and were persecuted in England for their dissenting beliefs. Daniel's father, Squire (his first name, not a title) Boone (1696-1765) emigrated from the small town of Bradninch, Devon (near Exeter) to Pennsylvania in 1713, to join William Penn's colony of dissenters. Squire Boone's parents, George Boone III and Mary Maugridge, followed their son to Pennsylvania in 1717, and in 1720 built a log cabin at Boonecroft.  In 1720, Squire Boone, who worked primarily as a weaver and a blacksmith, married Sarah Morgan (1700-77). Sarah's family were Quakers from Wales, and had settled in 1708 in the area which became Towamencin Township of Montgomery County. In 1731, the Boones moved to Exeter Township in the Oley Valley of Berks County, near the modern city of Reading. There they built a log cabin, partially preserved today as the Daniel Boone Homestead. Daniel Boone was born there, November 2, 1734, the sixth of eleven children. The Daniel Boone Homestead is just four miles from the Mordecai Lincoln House, making the Squire Boone family neighbors of Mordecai Lincoln, the great, great grandfather of future President Abraham Lincoln. Mordecai's son, also named Abraham, married Ann Boone, a first cousin of Daniel.  Daniel Boone spent his early years on what was then the edge of the frontier. Several Lenape Indian villages were nearby. The pacifist Pennsylvania Quakers had good relations with the Native Americans, but the steady growth of the white population compelled many Indians to move further west. Boone was given his first rifle at the age of 12. He learned to hunt from both local settlers and the Lenape. Folk tales have often emphasized Boone's skills as a hunter. In one story, the young Boone was hunting in the woods with some other boys, when the howl of a panther scattered all but Boone. He calmly cocked his rifle and shot the predator through the heart just as it leaped at him. The validity of this claim is contested, but the story was told so often that it became part of his popular image.  In Boone's youth, his family became a source of controversy in the local Quaker community when two of the oldest children married outside the endogamous community, in present-day Lower Gwynedd Township, Pennsylvania. In 1742, Boone's parents were compelled to publicly apologize after their eldest child, Sarah, married John Willcockson, a \\"worldling\\" (non-Quaker). Because the young couple had \\"kept company\\", they were considered \\"married without benefit of clergy\\". When the Boones' oldest son Israel married a \\"worldling\\" in 1747, Squire Boone stood by him. Both men were expelled from the Quakers; Boone's wife continued to attend monthly meetings with their younger children.","output":"This text is about Daniel Boone, an American pioneer, explorer, woodsman, and frontiersman who became one of the first folk heroes of the United States.

Article:     University of California at Berkeley police guard the building where former Breitbart News editor Milo Yiannopoulos was to speak on Feb. 1. (Ben Margot/Associated Press)      The University of California at Berkeley is bracing for massive protests and potential violence in an open, public space known as Sproul Plaza after hearing that conservative commentator Ann Coulter plans to give a speech there Thursday.      The state flagship university has become ground zero for an intense confrontation between the far left and the far right since Donald Trump’s election in November, with some protesters trying to stop controversial speakers from appearing on campus and others objecting that such actions violate their right to free speech. Some of the clashes have devolved into riots, leaving the school and city to struggle with how best to balance the free exchange of ideas with community safety.      In February — and twice more since then — masked protesters turned demonstrations over free speech and hate speech into violent confrontations, setting fires, causing injuries and leaving hundreds of thousands of dollars of property damage in their wake.      “The character of that attack on campus was unprecedented,” UC-Berkeley Chancellor Nicholas Dirks said Tuesday.      [How Berkeley has become the far left and far right’s battleground]      Coulter said in an email late Tuesday night that she plans to arrive at Berkeley sometime after 6 p.m. on Thursday. She said she is still hopeful that Berkeley will provide “an appropriate room” for the event and that she is still unsure when and where she will speak. College Republicans had been discussing the possibility of Sproul Plaza for Coulter’s speech since the university canceled Thursday’s planned event and so far has declined to provide a venue for it on that day.      Sproul Plaza, site of the Free Speech Movement protests in the 1960s, would be both symbolic and logistically challenging for the university because anyone can be there. Dirks said that for an inside event, the university would have metal detectors and other ways to search for weapons, but security will be much more difficult in a public outdoor space.      [Berkeley gave birth to the Free Speech Movement in the 1960s. Now, conservatives are demanding it include them.]      “If somebody brings weapons, there’s no way to block off the site, or to screen them,” Dirks said, noting that officials realize that some of the demonstrators, such as those known as Black Bloc, understand how to penetrate the crowd and use it as a shield. “In an open space, you have almost no control over that,” he said. “The challenges are immense.”      Conservative commentator Ann Coulter says threats of violence won't stop her from speaking at the University of California at Berkeley on April 27. (Reuters)      After the university went on lockdown after a February clash and police urged university officials to cancel controversial writer Milo Yiannopoulos’s speech — which they did — President Trump raised the threat of pulling federal funding from the public school.      But the cancellation of the Yiannopoulos event further galvanized activists on the far right, who viewed it as a call to arms and proof that conservatives around the country are being oppressed. And in recent weeks, rallies in the city of Berkeley have devolved into bloody street brawls. Left-wing activists have clashed with Trump supporters, and anarchists in black masks have squared off against self-proclaimed militia groups.      [Trump lashes back after violent protests at UC Berkeley]      On Monday Coulter retweeted a weather forecast with this comment: “Nice day for an outdoor speech at Berkeley.”      Nice day for an outdoor speech at Berkeley. https://t.co/PlbOP8YcDj — Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) April 24, 2017      Berkeley College Republicans originally invited Coulter to speak on campus Thursday, but university officials canceled the event because of safety concerns. The university, facing backlash, quickly reversed course and invited her to speak next week instead at an indoor location.      Coulter rejected that offer and said she still plans to come to Berkeley on Thursday despite the university’s warnings against it. On Monday, student groups filed a lawsuit against university officials, complaining that the university’s decision was stifling free speech at the school, particularly for politically conservative students whose views are controversial on the liberal campus.      “Though UC Berkeley promises its students an environment that promotes free debate and the free exchange of ideas,” the lawsuit contends, “it had breached this promise through the repressive actions of University administrators and campus police, who have systematically and intentionally suppressed constitutionally-protected expression” by the many students whose political views align with the plaintiffs.      The lawsuit claims that students typically leave campus in early May — the week known as “dead week” before final exams — and that delaying Coulter’s speech until then limits her potential impact. Dirks countered that claim.      “That’s not our experience,” he said. “It’s not a vacation. We assume students stay and work in the libraries.”      Having the event next week would open up options because there will be no conflict with classes and it would be much easier to get a safe venue, Dirks said. There were very few places police believe they can secure for such a speech given the current climate, he said.      Dirks defended the university’s commitment to free speech and said his concerns about academic freedom include worries about some members of the College Republicans who have been targeted by other members of campus for their views.      In Dirks’s time as chancellor, protesters tried to stop liberal television host and comedian Bill Maher from speaking, but Dirks said he insisted that Maher come. He told students and faculty upset about Yiannopoulos that his First Amendment rights should prevail over their concerns that he violates the community’s values.      [Ann Coulter finds an unlikely ally in her free-speech spat with Berkeley: Bill Maher]      University officials thought they were prepared for Yiannopoulos, having erected three barrier chain-link fences, placed about 90 police officers on campus, and searched for weapons and other items when ticket-holders came inside. But that wasn’t enough.      “It took about 15 minutes for Black Bloc protesters to come and begin to break the windows and doors … and light a major fire using a propane tank that was there for temporary lighting,” Dirks said.      The campus has become a symbolic center of a much larger fight, he said, with a growing perception among many that universities are so steeped in political correctness that they reject real debate, that they are isolated bubbles with values antithetical to the Trump administration. But they also face anger from the far left for allowing speakers whose views offend some. “We’re getting hit from both sides,” Dirks said.      Since February, he said, “We’re engaged in a new reality — what was unprecedented is not going away.” Now people think of the campus as a place “for the mounting of pitched battle, and the staging of violent controversies.”      Dirks said Tuesday that, given the school’s history, “It is in a way fitting that Berkeley be a leader in helping figure out how the new political realities are going to affect the life of the university.”      It’s not just a problem at Berkeley.      Last week at Auburn University, a fistfight broke out during protests when alt-right leader Richard Spencer spoke on campus. Earlier this year at Middlebury College, an angry mob of hundreds surrounded author and conservative scholar Charles Murray after he tried to give a lecture about his most recent book. Protesters, including some wearing masks, climbed on the hood of his car and pounded on windows as he tried to leave.      Lawrence Lokman, a spokesman for Penn State University, confirmed that its president, Eric Barron, serves on “an academic advisory committee to Homeland Security and co-chairs a subcommittee on countering extreme violence on campuses. As part of that, they have received a briefing on violence related to campus speakers.”      Pranav Jandhyala, who leads one of the two student groups that invited Coulter to campus, said Tuesday that Coulter and a national group working on her behalf called Young America’s Foundation had told student organizers about her plans to speak on Thursday at Sproul Plaza. Coulter said in an email that she and the students she has had contact with at Berkeley did not discuss the specific venue or time of her speech.      In the email, Coulter said of Jandhyala, “I appreciate his group and his enthusiasm, but this is a telephone game of misinformation.”      Jandhyala said his student group has been trying frantically to find an off-campus venue for Thursday, and he said he shares the concerns of university officials that Coulter’s appearance at Sproul — and the protests and counter-protests it likely would spark — could grow violent. But he said that Coulter and her representatives made clear in communication with him and other student organizers that she intends to go through with her plans to appear at the public plaza if no venue is provided.      “We’re worried about it turning into a huge battle between her security and conservative militia and antifascists and others,” Jandhyala said. “To have that right in the middle of Sproul doesn’t bode well for the image of our school or the city. We’re worried about violence and student safety and our own safety as well. It’s a huge safety concern.”      He said the exact time of Coulter’s speech is still uncertain. “She said she doesn’t even know her full schedule on Thursday right now. She’s going to know Thursday morning and relay to us when she plans to come to Sproul,” Jandhyala said.      When Jandhyala’s group, the politically moderate Bridges USA, teamed up with Berkeley’s College Republicans to invite Coulter to campus, the goal was to facilitate a dialogue about immigration.      “It’s an issue that hits home for many of our students,” Jandhyala said. “Berkeley is a sanctuary city. We have many undocumented immigrant students. That’s why it seemed like a good issue to put on the table. UC-Berkeley can represent the liberal point of view very well. So what we were trying to do with Coulter was to bring in an opposing view to have a dialogue about it.”      While that was the original purpose, Jandhyala acknowledged that Coulter might now have a different agenda for her appearance: “Her goal is testing the limits of speech and doing all she can to uphold this value and prove what’s possible and not back down from free speech.”      An outdoor speech at the plaza probably would make it difficult for any dialogue or interaction with students, he said, and his group is trying to have a separate event with her that would allow for conversation.      The Young America’s Foundation, a group fighting First Amendment cases on many campuses, announced in a statement Tuesday that they had assumed Berkeley would provide adequate security for an event that was part of its national lecture series. But they said the University of California Police Department’s policies would allow “the leftist thugs who have terrorized Berkeley’s campus to do so without consequence.”      They said they had asked for things including a central location that could hold hundreds of participants in the afternoon or early evening, a statement from the university expressing zero tolerance for masked agitators, and sufficient security including coordination with city police.      “As of 4:00 p.m. today, UC-Berkeley failed to meet our demands, after refusing to provide a proper venue for six weeks. Berkeley made it impossible to hold a lecture due to the lack of assurances for protections from foreseeable violence from unrestrained leftist agitators,” the group said in a statement. “Berkeley should be ashamed for creating this hostile atmosphere.”      The group is pressing forward with its lawsuit, the statement continues, and “Ms. Coulter may still choose to speak in some form on campus, but Young America’s Foundation will not jeopardize the safety of its staff or students.”      Dan Mogulof, a university spokesman, said the school does not discuss security arrangements in detail, but he said officials will take extraordinary steps to protect the campus, in coordination with local and regional law enforcement.      “At UC-Berkeley, we don’t have gates,” Mogulof said. “There are probably literally hundreds of ways to come onto campus from the city. We don’t have a drawbridge or moat. We are a completely porous campus.”      Dirks had a message for extremists: “I’d like to ask them to stay away. It’s a college campus. If they want to come and engage in free speech, that’s great. If they want to come and disrupt and engage in other activities, they should stay away from the university.”      Matt Zapotosky and Perry Stein contributed to this report.      This post has been updated. ||||| Coulter expected to speak at Sproul Plaza on Thursday      Conservative commentator Ann Coulter plans to speak at UC Berkeley’s Sproul Plaza on Thursday, campus officials said, prompting the university and the city to scramble to prepare for what they fear could be another violent showdown between fans and opponents of President Trump.      Coulter is expected to bring her own security for the afternoon appearance, but campus officials — who had urged her to reschedule for a later date — believe that won’t be sufficient.      “We’re going to be doing what we can in this short amount of time that’s left to provide safety and security to our students, other members of the campus community, the public, and, if need be, Ms. Coulter,” UC Berkeley spokesman Dan Mogulof said Tuesday.      Coulter’s appearance was again thrown into question late Tuesday when she tweeted that she was still expecting Berkeley “to provide a room,” despite the fact that officials have said they cannot offer a safe venue for her to speak.      UC cannot bar Coulter from speaking in Sproul Plaza, Mogulof said. Besides being one of the main campus entrances, Sproul has historic significance as the birthplace of the Free Speech Movement in 1964.      “The university has neither the ability nor desire to keep people off this campus,” Mogulof said. “Sproul Plaza is open to the public.”      But, he added, “You can’t have free speech if your event is canceled” due to violence. Mogulof said time and location are key factors in the ability of campus and city police to ensure safety, which is why the university opposed a Coulter visit on Thursday.      It was not immediately clear exactly when Coulter plans to show up at Sproul, but right-wing groups were using online chat groups to organize a campus visit to coincide with Coulter’s appearance, and they were calling on supporters to be “battle ready.”      Coulter was originally invited to speak Thursday by the Berkeley College Republicans, but UC officials said there was no available venue where they could ensure the safety of those attending or protesting the event after police learned of threats of violence.      University officials offered to reschedule to May 2, but Coulter refused, saying the proposed date was during “Dead Week,” when students would be studying for finals.      Students associated with the Berkeley College Republicans and Young America’s Foundation, the sponsor of the speech, sued the University of California on Monday, saying that not providing a place for Coulter to speak Thursday amounted to unconstitutional censorship.      On Tuesday, Young America’s Foundation, a conservative youth group, backed out of the event, saying UC Berkeley had failed to promise that it would protect people from “leftist thugs.”      The group said it wanted UC to “announce that there will be zero tolerance at the event itself for masked agitators, disruption of the event, and sufficient security to ensure the safety of attendees.”      “UC Berkeley failed to meet our demands, after refusing to provide a proper venue for six weeks. Therefore, Young America’s Foundation will not be moving forward with an event at Berkeley on April 27 due to the lack of assurances for protections from foreseeable violence from unrestrained leftist agitators,” the group said.      Pranav Jandhyala, co-founder of BridgeUSA, a nonpartisan campus group helping to organize Coulter’s visit, said he still hoped organizers could find an indoor venue. But he said he worried that a Coulter appearance on Sproul would result in violence and destruction.      “Honestly, if it were up to me we would do it on a future date,” he said. “If it were up to me, she wouldn’t do it on Sproul. It’s not up to me. It’s up to her.”      Coulter has said in social media posts that she will show up Thursday because she already had a contract to do so.      UC police canceled an appearance in February by another far-right speaker, Milo Yiannopoulos, after a riot began just before his speech was to be delivered. On April 15, 11 people were injured and 20 arrested when Trump supporters and opponents battled in a downtown Berkeley park.      “The University of California welcomes speakers of all political viewpoints and is committed to providing a forum to enable Ann Coulter to speak on the Berkeley campus,” Dianne Klein, spokeswoman for UC President Janet Napolitano, said in a statement. “The campus seeks to ensure that all members of the Berkeley and larger community — including Ms. Coulter herself — remain safe during such an event.”      Students and staff at UC Berkeley opposed to Coulter’s appearance said Tuesday that they planned to hold a demonstration at 5 p.m. Thursday.      Students affiliated with the International Socialist Organization and labor groups on the Cal campus said they will rally Thursday afternoon regardless of Coulter’s plans.      “As the narrative around when, where, and if Ann Coulter will speak at UC Berkeley changes day by day, we know one thing for certain: We stand against xenophobic, bigoted language, and we are in solidarity with undocumented students, community members, and all marginalized populations,” the organization said in a Facebook invitation to the rally.      “It’s important that regardless of what the alt-right is doing on and off campus, that our side, the oppressed majority, continues to get organized,” said Mukund Rathi, a first-year law student at the university and part of the International Socialist Organization.      Although he disagrees with Coulter’s politics, Rathi said, UC shouldn’t be deciding whether or when she can appear.      “The university should not be playing a role in deciding who does or who does not get to speak on campus,” he said.

Email: jtucker@sfchronicle.com Twitter: @jilltucker ||||| Following a series of disagreements with campus administration over possible speaking event dates and venues, conservative author Ann Coulter has confirmed that she will speak on campus Thursday regardless of security concerns raised by UCPD, according to Pranav Jandhyala, founder and co-president of BridgeUSA.      Coulter was invited by Berkeley College Republicans, or BCR, and BridgeUSA to speak on campus Thursday, April 27 on the topic of illegal immigration. After UCPD learned that certain groups responsible for inciting violence at Milo Yiannopoulos’s event in February were planning to make an appearance at Coulter’s event, however, campus administration announced that it was postponing Coulter’s speech to September.      On Thursday, the campus rescinded its previous decision to postpone Coulter’s speech and extended an invitation to the right-wing author to speak May 2. Coulter, however, raised concerns that the proposed date falls during RRR week, when instruction has ended. The campus is no longer planning to host the event May 2 after BCR threatened to file a lawsuit — and BCR did file a lawsuit Monday.      Campus spokesperson Dan Mogulof said Coulter’s concerns were confusing to the administration because she initially objected to giving her speech Thursday afternoon, when students would be in class.      Jandhyala said Coulter’s concerns were misinterpreted. Coulter’s main concern was that during RRR week, students are more likely to be studying for finals and therefore might be less inclined to listen to her speech, according to Jandhyala.      Jandhyala expressed concerns regarding the negative image that recent protests have shed upon the campus. He said it is important for people outside the campus community to recognize that the violence is not a reflection of the campus, but rather of unaffiliated groups hoping to stir up trouble.      “What I’m worried about is our campus community, and our community as a whole, looking like it’s something it’s not,” Jandhyala said.      A member of BCR could not be reached for comment.      According to Mogulof, the campus is coordinating with UCPD to do whatever is necessary to protect students and members of the community. UC San Francisco’s Office of the Chief confirmed that it has been called to assist UC Berkeley’s UCPD in securing the event Thursday.      “We will have an increased law enforcement presence on our campus to ensure the safety of our community,” said UCPD spokesperson Sgt. Sabrina Reich in an email.      According to Jandhyala, despite the possibility of UCPD security at the event, violence is nearly guaranteed to break out if Coulter gives her speech on Sproul Plaza.      “We’re definitely going to try to do everything that we can to turn a speech that might end up being violent into an event where dialogue between students can be created,” Jandhyala said.

The crystal clear water glistened as it filled the shallow dish, reflecting a myriad of colors from the sunlight streaming through the nearby window. Diane always made sure her beloved feline companion, Whiskers, had a fresh and clean supply of water. Whiskers, an elegant and graceful calico cat, watched patiently from the edge of the countertop, her tail curled around her paws. Her green eyes sparkled with anticipation, knowing that once her water bowl was replenished, she could quench her thirst. Diane had rescued Whiskers from a local animal shelter two years ago, and since then, their bond had only grown stronger. They were inseparable, and taking care of her had become an essential part of Diane's daily routine. As the water reached the brim of the bowl, Diane carefully lifted the pitcher, ensuring not to spill a drop. Whiskers, ever eager to drink the freshly-poured water, hopped down from the countertop and sauntered over to the bowl with a swish of her tail. She lowered her head gracefully, her pink tongue flicking out to lap up the cool liquid, each movement precise and efficient. Diane smiled at the sight of her feline companion enjoying her simple gesture of care. It warmed her heart to know that she could provide everything that Whiskers needed to live a happy and healthy life. As the cat continued to drink, Diane took a moment to appreciate their peaceful little corner of the world, each day made brighter by the company of Whiskers. The comfortable silence of the room was broken by the faint hum of the refrigerator, the only indication of the passage of time. Diane glanced at the clock, realizing that it was time to prepare dinner. She scooped a generous portion of Whiskers' cherished salmon-flavored kibble into her food bowl, the sound of each piece clattering against the ceramic dish causing Whiskers to lift her head from the water bowl, her eyes trained on the familiar sound. Finished with her drink, Whiskers moved on to her meal in a seamless transition. Diane, ever the attentive owner, patted her affectionately on the head before heading to the pantry to gather the ingredients for her own dinner. The sound of Whiskers happily munching on her kibble was a comforting background noise for Diane as she began the familiar process of preparing her meal, grateful for the company and love of her feline friend. As the sun began to dip below the horizon, casting warm hues of orange and pink throughout the kitchen, Diane knew they would soon settle into their nightly routine of snuggling on the couch and sharing each other's warmth. Whiskers' soft purrs would fill the air, a gentle lullaby that always eased Diane into a peaceful slumber. And for now, in their small corner of the world, all was well."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Choices:  - petals  - spores  - roots  - leaves  A: Answer:","output":"The specific part of the African violet (Saintpaulia) used to propagate other plants is its leaves. African violets are popular houseplants, well-known for their beautiful, colorful flowers and velvety leaves. They propagate very well through a method called leaf-cutting propagation. Propagation through leaf cuttings involves the following steps: 1. Selection of a healthy leaf: Choose a healthy, mature leaf from the middle of the plant. Make sure the leaf is free from any pests, diseases, or physical damage. 2. Cutting the leaf: Use a sharp, sterilized pair of scissors or a razor blade to cut the leaf from the plant, leaving about 1-2 inches of the petiole (leaf stem) attached to the leaf blade. Cutting at an angle (about 45°) is advisable because it provides a larger surface for rooting and facilitates better absorption of water. 3. Preparing the rooting medium: A well-draining, light, and porous medium is essential for successful propagation. A mixture of equal parts peat moss or coco coir and perlite is commonly used. Fill a small pot or container with the prepared medium and moisten it thoroughly. 4. Planting the leaf cutting: Make a small hole in the rooting medium using a pencil or your finger, and gently insert the cut end of the leaf stem into the hole. Press the medium around the petiole to provide support. The leaf blade should be resting on the surface of the soil. You can also dip the cut end of the leaf petiole in rooting hormone powder to speed up the process, although this is not always necessary. 5. Creating a humid environment: Cover the pot with a clear plastic bag or place it in a propagator to maintain high humidity around the cutting. This step is essential, as it prevents the leaf from losing excessive moisture and allows the cutting to root more easily. 6. Providing appropriate light and temperature: African violets prefer bright, indirect light for the best rooting success. Avoid direct sunlight, as it can cause leaf scorching. The ideal temperature for African violet propagation is between 70°F and 75°F (21°C and 24°C). 7. Monitoring the progress: It usually takes a few weeks for the cuttings to develop roots and new plantlets. Keep an eye on the moisture level, ensuring the medium does not dry out completely nor stay too wet. Remove any dead or rotting leaves to prevent the spread of disease. 8. Transplanting the new African violets: Once the plantlets have several leaves and a well-developed root system, you can transplant them into individual pots filled with an African violet-specific potting mix. Gradually acclimate the young plants to the normal humidity levels in your home by removing the plastic cover and providing proper care. In summary, the African violet is propagated using leaf cuttings, which is a simple and efficient method to create new plants. Following the proper steps and providing the right growing conditions will ensure successful propagation and a collection of healthy, vibrant African violets."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If so, hope you remember the evening. Seventeen men and women have been charged in Florida in what prosecutors say was a scam targeting tourists looking for after-dark fun that played out in these and other private clubs, according to an Associated Press report. The con: \\"B-Girls\\" (slang for women at bars whose job is to encourage customers to spend a lot of money) enticed victims to South Beach private clubs where they were charged sky-high prices for Champagne and other drinks. The story said that women -- most from Russia and neighboring Eastern European countries -- would chat up tourists and businessmen in legitimate nightspots, looking for those who seemed to have money to spend. Then the women invited their victims to the \\"private clubs,\\" where drinks flowed and credit cards took big hits. Women would pour drinks into buckets or planters to get the men to buy more, The Miami Herald says. \\"Some victims are so intoxicated by the drinks forced upon them by the B-Girls that they cannot stand and are not competent enough to sign credit card receipts,\\" FBI agent Alexander V. Tiguy said in an affidavit quoted in the story. \\"Those victims are propped up by the B-Girls long enough to obtain signatures.\\" I tried to call three clubs listed on the main South Beach drag of Washington Avenue. One had no phone number I could find, one had a disconnected number and one had only an answering machine with no business name on it. Prosecutors say at least 88 victims have been identified with total losses in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. One victim was gouged 43,000, the AP reports. Some of the accused are being held without bail and one top operative is believed to have fled the country, the story said. U.S. Attorney Wifredo Ferrer told the AP that such scams could give \\"our tourism industry a black eye. We are pleased to have put this ring out of operation.\\" (My colleague Cathy Grossman, a former Floridian, says that B-girls have always been a part of the South Florida scene. She reminds me that the former Poodle Lounge at the Fontainebleau resort, where the Rat Pack partied, was a big hangout for ladies waiting to meet rich gents and conventioneers and that any female sitting solo at the bar was suspect. However, I'm pretty sure 43,000 tabs weren't rung up there.) Readers, has anyone heard of this scam or of anything similar in another pleasure capital, Las Vegas?

Plot title: King Rat Movie plot: George Segal plays Corporal King, an American soldier in a Japanese prison camp who manages all the black market operations amongst the enforced holding of a group of English and Americans. His demeanor and bearing stand out in contrast to the rag tag prisoners he shares the camp with in part because of his willingness to ostensibly advance on the needs of others. He is constantly scrutinized by Lieutenant Grey (Tom Courtenay), the camp police chief, as he has gotten reports that King has robbed fellow prisoners in a poker game. It is clear that King takes pleasure in living on what would be considered a clear example of the American Capitalist version of supply and demand. He seeks ways to increase his organization by recruiting talented men like Peter Marlowe (James Fox), an English soldier who speaks fluent Malay, but refuses King's offering of money for his services. Marlowe attempts to live by a code that bonds men in a way that transcends any financial gain, and in fact considers King an actual friend because he and the American are interned together under Japanese rule. King extends his operation to include trading valuables to the Japanese and breeding rats to sell as food to the officers as a delicacy, activities that Marlowe is happy to aid in because of the smart commercial way that the schemes are launched. The ability to gain valuable items including medical supplies becomes important when Marlowe injures himself and faces serious physical danger. As Lieutenant Grey closes in to mete out the camp law enforcement, his code of conduct conflicts with Marlowe, his cabin mate.

A barometer of future US economic activity fell for a fifth month in October, the longest decline since 1995, signaling that the world #39;s largest economy may slow in coming months. What is this text about?","output":"This text discusses the decline in a barometer of future U.S. economic activity, which fell for a fifth month in October. This drop marks the longest decline since 1995, and it signals potential slowing down of the world's largest economy in the upcoming months. To provide an in-depth analysis, let's break down the key points mentioned in the text. 1. Barometer of future U.S. economic activity: This refers to an economic indicator that helps predict and measure the growth or contraction of the United States economy. Some common examples of such barometers include the Consumer Confidence Index, employment rates, housing starts, and the stock market. By measuring these factors, economists can make educated predictions about the direction in which the economy might be headed. 2. Fell for a fifth month in October: This states that the barometer has seen a consistent decline for five consecutive months, up until October. It shows a negative trend in economic indicators, indicating a possible weakening of economic activity. 3. Longest decline since 1995: The five-month decline mentioned is the longest period of consistent decrease since the year 1995. Such extended periods of decline are rare, and this piece of information highlights that the current economic situation might be particularly concerning. 4. Signaling that the world's largest economy may slow in coming months: The United States has the largest economy globally, and the consistent decline in the economic barometer may be a sign of an economic slowdown. This is significant not just for the U.S. but also for the world economy, as the U.S. plays a crucial role in driving the global economic growth. A slowdown in the American economy can have ripple effects on other countries, impacting international trade, investments, and market stability. To sum up, the text highlights a consistent decline in a barometer of future U.S. economic activity over five months, which indicates a possible slowing down of the American economy. This could have potentially negative consequences not only for the United States but also for the global economy, as the U.S. plays a significant role in driving economic growth around the world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: Greg said goodbye to his last student at 8:15 PM, locked up the studio, and got into his car. He always looked forward to his evening rendezvous with Bonnie--his nickname for the Bonneville. He liked to put her top down, and drive her around town in the moonlight. Their route varied from night to night, but the ultimate destination was never in question. \\"May I help you?\\" The worn-out speaker was crackly, but he still recognized the particularly twangy East Texas voice of Fontana Fry. Over his six years of vocal training, he had become acutely aware of accents. This is true of all classically trained singers. Great emphasis is placed on precise pronunciation and enunciation. It is mandatory that the singer's repertoire include works written in English, Latin, Italian, German, and French. So, by the time Greg finished his graduate degree, his accent had been all but eliminated. He sounded somewhat like a network news anchor instead of an East Texan. \\"I would like a large--\\" \\"--a large dipped cone, the usual. Right?\\" The Dairy Queen drive-thru ordering station was located out in front of the restaurant, on the right side. He looked up, and saw the 19 year-old waving at him. She looked so cute in her little Dairy Queen outfit. Fontana was in her first year at Kilgore College. She planned to be an elementary teacher. He knew she would be a good one. Greg had met Fontana a few months earlier when she brought her 13-year-old brother to the studio to enroll for guitar lessons. The boy was holding a U.S. made, 1968 Harmony acoustic guitar his uncle gave him. The body and the frets were badly worn, but the instrument still played beautifully. It looked somewhat like a large violin, with arched top and f-holes. That shape produces a more mellow sound than flattops. And the guitar's age contributed additional warmth to the tone. Question: How does Greg feel about Fontana. Options:  A. He does not like her  B. He thinks she is cute  C. He admires her accent  D. not enough information Answer:","output":"B.

Information:  - George Harrison, (25 February 1943  29 November 2001) was an English guitarist, singer, songwriter, and music and film producer who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of the Beatles. Often referred to as \\"the quiet Beatle\\", Harrison embraced Hindu mythology and helped broaden the horizons of his fellow Beatles as well as their Western audience by incorporating Indian instrumentation in their music. Although most of the Beatles' songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group included \\"Taxman\\", \\"Within You Without You\\", \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" and \\"Something\\", the last of which became the Beatles' second-most covered song.  - Skiffle is a music genre with jazz, blues, folk and American folk influences, usually using homemade or improvised instruments. Originating as a term in the United States in the first half of the 20th century, it became popular again in the UK in the 1950s, where it was associated with artists such as Lonnie Donegan, The Vipers Skiffle Group, Ken Colyer and Chas McDevitt. Skiffle played a major part in beginning the careers of later eminent jazz, pop, blues, folk and rock musicians and has been seen as a critical stepping stone to the second British folk revival, blues boom and British Invasion of the US popular music scene.  - John Winston Ono Lennon, (born John Winston Lennon; 9 October 19408 December 1980) was an English singer and songwriter who co-founded the Beatles, the most commercially successful band in the history of popular music. With fellow member Paul McCartney, he formed a celebrated songwriting partnership.  - The Beatles : The First U.S. Visit is a 1991 re-edited version of renowned documentary filmmaking team Albert and David Maysles ' 1964 16mm documentary What 's Happening ! The Beatles In The U.S.A. , about the Beatles ' first visit to America in February 1964 . It documents the Beatles ' US trip as they travel to New York City , Washington , DC , and Miami Beach . Footage of the Beatles ( often acting irreverently in front of the camera ) in hotel rooms makes up the majority of the non-musical portion of the film . The main difference between the original 1964 documentary and the 1991 re-edited version is that 22 minutes of the Beatles ' live recorded performances on The Ed Sullivan Show have been inserted the 1991 release . However , as the 1964 documentary is 81 minutes long and the 1991 version is 83 minutes , some 20 minutes of the 1964 documentary have been excluded , such as several scenes with Brian Epstein . The original 1964 documentary is still being shown at various festivals , such as the Silverdocs in 2008 , and was also shown at a special screening at the Maysles Cinema in New York on 18 November 2011 in honour of Albert Maysles ' 85th birthday .  - \\"Beatlemania\\" is a term that originated and was coined during the early 1960s to describe the intense fan frenzy directed towards the English rock band the Beatles. The phenomenon began in 1963 and continued past the group's break-up in 1970, despite the band ceasing public performances in 1966.  - A ballad is a form of verse, often a narrative set to music. Ballads derive from the medieval French \\"chanson balladée\\" or \\"ballade\\", which were originally \\"danced songs\\". Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of the British Isles from the later medieval period until the 19th century. They were widely used across Europe, and later in the Americas, Australia and North Africa. Ballads are 13 lines with an ABABBCBC form, consisting of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables.  - Sir James Paul McCartney, (born 18 June 1942) is an English singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and composer. With John Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr, he gained worldwide fame with the rock band the Beatles, largely considered the most popular and influential group in the history of pop music. His songwriting partnership with Lennon is the most celebrated of the post-war era. After the band's break-up, he pursued a solo career and formed the band Wings with his first wife, Linda, and Denny Laine.  - Hard rock is a loosely defined subgenre of rock music that began in the mid-1960s, with the garage, psychedelic and blues rock movements. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with pianos and keyboards.  - Direct Cinema is a documentary genre that originated between 1958 and 1962 in North America, principally in the Canadian province of Quebec and the United States, and developed by Jean Rouch in France. Similar in many respects to the cinéma vérité genre, it was characterized initially by filmmakers' desire to directly capture reality and represent it truthfully, and to question the relationship of reality with cinema.  - Albert (November 26, 1926  March 5, 2015) and his brother David (January 10, 1931  January 3, 1987) Maysles were an American documentary filmmaking team known for their work in the direct cinema style. Their best-known films include \\"Salesman\\" (1969), \\"Gimme Shelter\\" (1970) and \\"Grey Gardens\\" (1976).  - The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \\"Beatlemania\\", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s.  - Richard Starkey, (born 7 July 1940), known professionally as Ringo Starr, is an English musician, singer, songwriter and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for the Beatles. He occasionally sang lead vocals, usually for one song on an album, including \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\" and their cover of \\"Act Naturally\\". He also wrote the Beatles' songs \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Flying\\".

Question: Where would there be a ticket office that has people with suitcases? Options: - hotel - train station - opera house - end of line - city  The answer is \\"train station\\" because","output":"Step 1: Analyze the options First, let's consider each option one by one by thinking about the context in which they typically exist and the activities that occur in those locations. Option 1: Hotel Hotels are places where people stay overnight or for extended periods of time. They do not necessarily have a ticket office, but they usually have a front desk. Option 2: Train station Train stations are places where people go to travel by train. They often have ticket offices where people buy tickets to travel to various destinations. People traveling with suitcases are typically found at train stations as they are carrying their belongings for their journeys. Option 3: Opera house Opera houses are venues where operas and other performances are held. They may have ticket offices for purchasing tickets to performances, but people with suitcases are not commonly found here, as the primary purpose of an opera house is entertainment, not transportation. Option 4: End of line End of line refers to the final stop or destination on a transportation route. It could possibly have a ticket office depending upon the context, but the connection to suitcases is unclear. Option 5: City A city is a large, densely populated area with a variety of services and attractions. While there may be ticket offices for various events or attractions within a city, the presence of people with suitcases is not specific enough to establish a city as the correct answer.

Would \\"\\"What a Wonderful World\\" is a song written by Bob Thiele (as \\"George Douglas\\") and George David Weiss .\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"The song \\"What a Wonderful World\\" was actually performed by the iconic jazz musician Louis Armstrong. While your statement is correct in terms that Bob Thiele (under the pen name \\"George Douglas\\") and George David Weiss were indeed the co-writers of this classic song, it doesn't answer your initial question of who sang it. Louis Armstrong, often nicknamed \\"Satchmo\\" or \\"Pops\\", was an American trumpeter, composer, vocalist, and actor who is among the most influential figures in jazz. His career spanned five decades, from the 1920s to the 1960s, and different eras in the history of jazz.  The song \\"What a Wonderful World\\" was first recorded by Louis Armstrong and released in 1967 as a single, which topped the pop charts in the United Kingdom, though it performed poorly in the United States because ABC Records did not promote it. Armstrong's recording was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999. This song showcases Armstrong's instantly recognizable rich, raspy voice, and it carries a timeless message of appreciation for the undeniable beauty in the world. So, a more accurate response to your question would be \\"What a Wonderful World\\" was sung by Louis Armstrong, and was written by Bob Thiele (as \\"George Douglas\\") and George David Weiss."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I have been a teacher for many years and so many of my students have done nice things for me…..they are just nice people. I retired last year and was a substitute teacher this last school year. In June a teacher I had just subbed for a half day needed emergency surgery and I was asked to go in and finish her year. Good thing it was in an area I knew…English and Social at the grade 9 level. The kids were pretty good…some were a handful but most of them were very accommodating. They were also writing important provincial exams at the end of the year and were getting stressed out about it. As I was getting them ready to write their exam, I took a few moments to thank them for welcoming me into their classroom and making my job…while not easy….at least a rewarding experience. One boy who seemed to complain about everything….thanked me for taking ownership and preparing them for final exams. I had recognized that his argumentative nature was his way of dealing with stress and tried not to let it affect my teaching. That mostly worked. There was a time when I told him, quite loudly, that if he had spent his time getting ready to do assignments instead of arguing…he could have been finished days ago.

My family has been coming to Marrakech in Vegas for as long as I can remember. So, when I saw a groupon for it we snatched that baby up and booked a reservation for July 4th weekend, during our recent trip to Vegas. The coupon helped tremendously, since there were 7 of us and this place is a tad on the expensive side, but for all you get, it is surely worth the price.

Soaking up that buttery, garlicky sauce with fresh bread is excellent. I love the hummus and pickled carrots. The soup is OK (I would cut this course out if I could). The beef kabobs are the BOMB! They are so well cooked and extra yummy. The chicken is moist, and the cous cous is good, but nothing special. The dessert was different this past time than it previously was.

Second question: Why aren't there a lot of Muslim cricketers in the Indian cricket team? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First Question: To be selected in an Indian cricket team, one has to showcase exceptional talent and skills in the sport, perform consistently, and have a sound understanding of the game. The process may seem overwhelming, but with dedication, hard work, and the right guidance, it is possible. Here are some steps to help you pursue a career in cricket and increase your chances of being selected in an Indian cricket team. 1. Start early: Beginning your cricket journey at a young age allows you to acquire essential skills and develop a strong foundation in the sport. 2. Join a cricket academy: While not mandatory, joining a reputable cricket academy can greatly enhance your skills, as you will receive professional coaching, guidance, and exposure to various opportunities. This can help you make significant progress in your cricket career. 3. Develop your strengths: Identify your strengths, be it batting, bowling, or fielding, and focus on developing them to the fullest. Equally important is working on your weaknesses and improving those areas. 4. Excel in local matches: Performing well in school, college, and club level matches will help build your reputation as a promising cricketer. Ensure that you register with your state cricket association to participate in various age-group tournaments. 5. Move to higher levels: Gradually progress to the state level and represent your state in competitions such as the Ranji Trophy, Vijay Hazare Trophy, or Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. Consistent performances in these tournaments can lead to selection in the national team. 6. Perform consistently: Consistency is a crucial factor. Deliver strong performances regularly to keep selectors' attention on your skills. 7. Stay disciplined and committed: To excel in cricket, you must be disciplined both on and off the field. A strong work ethic, commitment to fitness, and a focused mindset will help you succeed. 8. Networking and visibility: Attend cricket workshops, seminars, and other events in your region. Connect with other players, coaches, and stakeholders in the cricket community, as they can advocate for your potential and provide valuable opportunities. Second Question: The Indian cricket team’s selection policy is based on merit, performance, and potential. There is no specific quota or restriction for players belonging to any particular religion or caste. The primary factor in choosing players is their talent and contributions to the game. The representation of Muslim cricketers in the Indian team has varied over the years. Some prominent Muslim cricketers, such as Mohammad Azharuddin, Irfan Pathan, and Zaheer Khan, have been successful members of the national team. The reasons for a lower number of Muslim cricketers in the Indian cricket team can include, but are not limited to: 1. Socio-economic factors: Historically, cricket teams are formed based upon the best performers, and youngsters from socio-economically challenged backgrounds often lack the resources or opportunity to excel in the sport. 2. Lack of proper infrastructure or support: There may be fewer academies, clubs, or facilities in certain regions or communities, limiting the growth of aspiring Muslim cricketers. 3. Cultural or social factors: In some cases, conventional beliefs, family expectations, or social pressure may influence an individual's career choice, steering them away from sports and towards other professions. 4. Competition and probabilities: With millions of aspirants competing in cricket, the possibility of being selected in the Indian cricket team is, in general, quite low for any individual, irrespective of their religious background. In conclusion, the two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question seeks advice on being selected in the Indian cricket team and whether joining a cricket academy is necessary. The second question concerns the representation of Muslim players in the national cricket team and the reasons behind it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Death toll in Nairobi attack rises to 59 Death toll from Egypt violence rises to 638","output":"The similarity between the two sentences can be rated as a 3.5 on a scale of 0 to 5. While both sentences do address the topic of death tolls and involve an increase in the number of casualties resulting from violence, they are not exactly the same in terms of meaning. The key differences are the locations of the violent incidents and the specific number of casualties involved. The primary elements in both sentences include: 1. Death toll: In each sentence, the death toll is the primary topic, which implies casualties in a violent incident. 2. Increase in the number of casualties: Both sentences mention that the death toll has risen, indicating an ongoing issue that has led to the loss of more lives. 3. Violent incident: Although both sentences refer to violent incidents, the specific circumstances and locations of the events differ. The first sentence refers to an event that occurred in Nairobi, whereas the second sentence refers to an event in Egypt. 4. Number of casualties: The numeric death toll varies between the two sentences, with 59 in the first sentence and 638 in the second. This indicates a difference in the scale and possibly the severity of the two violent events. In conclusion, while both sentences share a common theme of violence and rising death tolls, they differ in several elements that are crucial in understanding their meanings fully. Therefore, a similarity rating of 3.5 is appropriate as it reflects the overlap of some core concepts, but falls short of being identical due to the distinct details."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Winnipeg Public Library is a public library network with 20 branches throughout the city, including the main Millennium Library.Winnipeg the Bear, which would become the inspiration for part of the name of Winnie-the-Pooh, was purchased in Ontario by Lieutenant Harry Colebourn of the Fort Garry Horse. He named the bear after the regiment's home town of Winnipeg. A. A. Milne later wrote a series of books featuring the fictional Winnie-the-Pooh. The series' illustrator, Ernest H. Shepard, created the only known oil painting of Winnipeg's adopted fictional bear, displayed in Assiniboine Park.The city has developed many distinct dishes and cooking styles, notably in the areas of confectionery and hot-smoked fish. Both the First Nations and more recent Eastern Canadian, European, and Asian immigrants have helped shape Winnipeg's dining scene, giving birth to dishes such as the desserts schmoo torte and wafer pie.The Winnipeg Art Gallery is Western Canada's oldest public art gallery, founded in 1912. It is the sixth-largest in the country and includes the world's largest public collection of contemporary Inuit art. Since the late 1970s Winnipeg has also had an active artist run centre culture.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  In mid-2012, The Wiggles announced that Page, Fatt, and Cook would be retiring from touring with the group; Emma Watkins, the first female member of The Wiggles, replaced Page, Lachlan Gillespie replaced Fatt, and Simon Pryce, who was initially supposed to replace Page in August, replaced Cook.  Anthony Field remained in the group because he found it too difficult to give up and because he still had a passion for educating children.

Page, who was still struggling with his health issues and had stated that his interest was in working with the group's original line-up, was subsequently asked to extend his stay until the end of the year so he would leave alongside Cook and Fatt, to which he agreed.  Cook reported that the original members were confident that the new group would be accepted by the fans because they passed on their founding concepts of early childhood education to Watkins, Gillespie, and Pryce.  The new members, like Moran, who was not approached to return, were salaried employees.The group, for their farewell tour, visited 8 countries and 141 cities, for a total of almost 250 shows in over 200 days for 640,000 people.

Context: The 8th Race of Champions was a non-Championship motor race, run to Formula One rules, held on 18 March 1973 at Brands Hatch circuit in Kent, UK. The race included several entrants in Formula 5000 cars and was won by Peter Gethin in a Chevron-Chevrolet B24 '72-05'.

Hypothesis: The 8th Race of Champions was one of the best races.","output":"While it might be tempting to draw the hypothesis that the 8th Race of Champions was one of the best races, we would need more information about the race and a clear standard for evaluating \\"best\\" to make such a claim. However, several interesting aspects from the given context can be acknowledged, such as: 1. Unique outcome: The 8th Race of Champions had a distinctive outcome, as it was one of the only two races in which a Formula 5000 car beat a Formula One car. This could be seen as a noteworthy achievement, demonstrating the potential of Formula 5000 cars in comparison to Formula One. 2. Peter Gethin's victory: Another notable aspect is Peter Gethin's victory in this race, driving a Chevron-Chevrolet B24 '72-05'. This adds a layer of intrigue to the story, with Gethin being victorious in a race that saw an unusual outcome as mentioned above. 3. The race's non-Championship status: The Race of Champions was not part of the Formula One World Championship. This means that the competition took place outside the realm of the regular series, providing the opportunity for a different format or set of entrants, such as the inclusion of Formula 5000 cars. 4. Brands Hatch circuit: The race took place at Brands Hatch circuit in Kent, UK, a well-known and respected racing venue. The circuit has a rich history and has hosted many important motor races, adding prestige to the event. While these aspects might be seen as adding excitement and intrigue to the race, there is not enough evidence to conclude that the 8th Race of Champions was one of the best races. To form a more informed hypothesis, it would be necessary to analyze the level of competition, strategy, the presence of exciting on-track action, and a comparison of this race to other races across time. The assessment of what makes a race \\"the best\\" is ultimately subjective and would depend on factors such as personal taste in racing, historical significance, and memorable moments during the event."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Reviewing the album in the NME, Richard Cook described the band as tighter and more disciplined than in earlier recordings, \\"their master piece to date\\", while still maintaining their impact.

Could you please translate this to English?","output":"The phrase \\"On ne sait néanmoins pas si cette pratique est fréquente\\" translates to English as \\"However, we do not know if this practice is common.\\" This sentence is expressed in a somewhat formal and uncertain tone, suggesting that more information or research is needed to determine how regularly the mentioned practice or behavior occurs. This could be in reference to a wide range of activities or habits, from professional procedures to personal routines, cultural traditions, or any form of repeated behavior. The use of \\"néanmoins\\" (however) indicates some contrast or opposing idea to a previous statement, implying that this lack of knowledge is an exception or complication in an otherwise certain situation. The subject of the sentence \\"this practice\\" is vague and could be replaced with a specific term based on context. For instance, if the discussion was about recycling, then \\"cette pratique\\" would refer to the practice of recycling. Therefore, it's critical to interpret this phrase within its broader conversation or text to fully understand what practice is being referenced. In addition, the verb phrase \\"ne ... pas\\" is a standard way to form negations in French, equivalent to the addition of \\"not\\" in English sentences. When combined with \\"on sait\\" (we know), it signals lack or absence of knowledge or certainty about a certain matter. Lastly, \\"est fréquente\\" literally means \\"is common,\\" referring to how regularly or often this practice happens. This could be important for understanding the prevalence or acceptance of the said practice in a particular group or society.

The Soldier The answer to this question is:","output":"Step 1: Establish the main character and background. Our main character, Alex Chambers, is a top CIA agent codenamed \\"The Soldier\\". He's in his late thirties, an expert in hand-to-hand combat, and highly skilled in espionage and intelligence gathering.  Step 2: Create the main conflict to drive the plot. The CIA learns about a planned terrorist attack on an American city, orchestrated by an international criminal organization known as \\"The Conclave\\". Upon further investigation, it turns out that the mastermind behind the attack is a former CIA asset codenamed \\"Viper\\", who has gone rogue. The CIA assigns Alex Chambers the task of finding and stopping Viper before the attack can be carried out. Step 3: Introduce key supporting characters. One of Alex's main sources of information is Sarah, a tech expert and fellow CIA agent skilled in hacking and gathering digital intelligence. Sarah is responsible for providing Alex with valuable intelligence on The Conclave and Viper's whereabouts. Additionally, the whole operation is overseen by Alex's close friend and mentor, Director Jack Collins, who has his own mysterious past with Viper. Step 4: Set important plot milestones. 1. Alex tracks Viper to Europe, only to find that he's always one step ahead. 2. With Sarah's help, Alex uncovers the identity of a high-ranking member of The Conclave, which provides him with a significant lead in his pursuit. 3. Alex infiltrates a Conclave base and obtains crucial information about the terrorist attack, including the target and timeframe. 4. Viper manages to capture and interrogate Sarah to learn more about Alex's progress. Step 5: Create twists and revelations. 1. Director Collins reveals that he once trained Viper. The rogue agent's betrayal has become a personal mission for him. 2. The Conclave double-crosses Viper, who is now forced to team up with Alex to stop the attack and get revenge on the organization. 3. Alex discovers that The Conclave has a mole within the CIA, supplying them with information and sabotaging their efforts. Step 6: Climax and resolution. 1. As Alex and Viper work together, they uncover the identity of the CIA mole and bring them to justice. 2. The duo manages to thwart the terrorist plot in a high-stakes face-off with The Conclave's top operatives. 3. In the end, Viper sacrifices himself to save Alex and stop the attack, proving that he still has honor as a soldier. 4. Sarah recovers from her captivity, and the CIA disbands The Conclave. The result is a movie plot that revolves around an intense, action-packed race against time, with complex characters and unexpected twists, all centered around the question: Can the CIA agent codenamed \\"The Soldier\\" succeed in stopping this devastating attack and uncover the truth about his enemies and allies?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bin Laden reportedly discussed the planes operation with KSM and Atef in a series of meetings in the spring of 1999 at the al Matar complex near Kandahar. KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but  Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible.  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM,  Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets.  Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings,  Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from  Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions. Khallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family. His father had been expelled from Yemen because of his extremist views. Khallad had grown up in Saudi Arabia, where his father knew  Bin Laden, Abdullah Azzam, and Omar Abdel Rahman (the \\"Blind Sheikh\\").

The UK-based fashion brand is distributing the first round of samples exclusively to its 7.6 million Facebook fans. Interested parties are invited to visit the Burberry Body tab on its Facebook Page to request a sample. Burberry’s largely international fanbase will be pleased to see that the company is shipping testers to a broad range of countries. Christopher Bailey, Burberry’s chief creative officer, announced the program via a YouTube video (above) cross-posted to its Facebook Page. Burberry’s fans are, unsurprisingly, widely supportive of the campaign. Earlier this year Oscar de la Renta, a New York-based luxury fashion house, launched its flagship fragrance via Facebook. After giving away 25,000 samples — a supply it exhausted in just three days — the brand’s Likes grew by 40%, said Erika Bearman, Oscar de la Renta’s director of communications. In past interviews, beauty marketers have noted that Facebook fans tended to be their most loyal and engaged customers and, as such, make excellent recipients for sampling programs.","output":"UK fashion brand Burberry is launching an exclusive fragrance sampling campaign for its latest scent, Burberry Body, via Facebook.

The U.S. Supreme Court signaled Wednesday it may be open to new limits on the government's ability to track someone's movements by accessing data on that person's cellphone.  A case before the high court could result in a landmark decision in the ongoing debate over civil liberties protections in an era of rapid technological change.  At issue is whether law enforcement will be able to access cellphone data that can reveal a person's whereabouts without having to first obtain a court-issued search warrant.  The case stems from the conviction of Timothy Carpenter for a series of robberies back in 2010 and 2011. Prosecutors were able to obtain cellphone records that indicated his location over a period of months, information that proved crucial to his conviction. On Wednesday, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union argued that law enforcement should be required to obtain a court-ordered search warrant before obtaining such information.  They also argued that allowing law enforcement to access the cellphone data without a warrant would violate the prohibition on unreasonable search and seizures contained in the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  \\"It is impossible to go about our daily lives without leaving a trail of digital breadcrumbs that reveal where we have been over time, what we have done, who we spent time with,\\" said ACLU attorney Nathan Freed Wessler, who spoke to reporters outside the Supreme Court following oral arguments. \\"It is time for the court, we think, to update Fourth Amendment doctrine to provide reasonable protections today.\\"  Some of the justices also raised concerns about privacy in the digital age.  \\"Most Americans, I think, still want to avoid Big Brother,\\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who often sides with the liberal wing of the court, said.  Chief Justice John Roberts, who often sides with conservatives on the court, said the central question was whether the cellphone information should be accessible to the government \\"without a warrant.\\" Question: Who was convicted of a series of robberies in 2010 and 2011?

Answer the following question: Given the below context:  In Billings, Montana, a police officer arrives and discovers Woody Grant walking on the shoulder of the roadway. Woody is picked up by his son David, who learns that Woody wants to go to Lincoln, Nebraska, to collect a million dollar sweepstakes prize he believes he has won. When David sees the sweepstakes letter, he knows immediately that it is a mail scam designed to get gullible people to purchase magazine subscriptions. David brings his father home, where his mother Kate becomes increasingly annoyed by Woody's insistence on collecting the money. After Woody is picked up again trying to get to Nebraska, David and his brother Ross discuss putting Woody in a retirement home. David pays a visit with his ex-girlfriend, Noel, who returns his belongings and refuses to move back in with him. Their conversation is cut short by a call from Kate reporting that Woody has taken off once again. David retrieves Woody and decides to drive him all the way to Lincoln, much to Kate's dismay. While in Rapid City, South Dakota, Woody goes on a bender and hits his head while stumbling back to their motel room. David takes him to the hospital to get his head stitched up. David learns that they will be passing through Woody's hometown of Hawthorne, Nebraska, and suggests they spend the night with Woody's family. Woody is against the idea, but they end up going anyway. They stay with Woody's brother Ray, his wife, and their two sons, Cole and Bart. Woody and David visit a mechanic shop Woody once co-owned, followed by some beers at a bar. When David brings up Woody's alcoholism and problems within the family—with Woody implying that he did not love Kate nor really want children—they get into an argument. At another bar, they meet Ed Pegram, whom the family blames for stealing Woody's air compressor decades ago. Over David's objections, Woody mentions winning the money and the barflies toast his good fortune. The next day, they learn that the news has spread through the town like wildfire.
