While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Being close to someone requires telling them exactly what you want. Even if you think you're being obvious, many people have a hard time picking up on hints and indirect communication. You have to be willing to say what's on your mind, even if it's something that you're afraid your partner won't like.  For example, you might say \\"I would like to be closer with you and share more of my life with you.\\" If you feel like there's a barrier between you, or your partner is putting up a wall, you might say \\"I feel as though you're closed off to me, and I would like for us to get closer. Would you like to talk about it?\\" When you attempt to communicate through hints or indirect communication, you always have an out. If your partner picks up on your hint and doesn't like it, you can claim you didn't mean that at all. But even if you avoided a potential conflict, there will still be distance between you. Lies and deceit are always a barrier to closeness. However, refusing to share pieces of your life with your partner or keeping secrets from them can be just as damaging. When they find out about something you've been keeping from them, they may wonder what else you've been hiding.  For example, suppose you have a dance class twice a week, but for some reason, you don't want to tell your significant other. Maybe you think they will ridicule you. So you keep it a secret. However, by doing that you are building a wall between the two of you. This doesn't mean that you can't keep a birthday present or surprise party a secret. However, in that situation, you should also be aware that your partner will likely sense that you're keeping something from them, and might start to get suspicious. When your partner is talking to you, stop doing other things and pay attention to them. Use statements such as \\"I hear you saying that...\\" then put what they said in your own words. If your understanding or perception isn't accurate, they can correct it. Then the two of you are both on the same page.  This doesn't mean you can't ever do other things while talking to your partner. For example, they may want to chat while you're doing the dishes or making the bed. But if they want to talk about something relatively serious, stop what you're doing and listen. Nod and look them in the eye (if this is culturally appropriate) to communicate that you are paying attention to them. Sharing your own inner thoughts and feelings may make you feel more vulnerable, but your partner will appreciate that you trusted them enough to share something so private and personal. Opening up in this way is a good way to get closer to your partner, as well as learning about each other.  For example, you might reveal that you always cry at the beginning of the movie \\"Up.\\" If your partner responds by saying \\"Oh, I understand. That's one of the most emotional scenes ever, and yet it's a cartoon without dialogue,\\" then you've found a deeper emotional connection. You might also tell your partner about past experiences that helped shape who you are or what you believe. Be careful revealing too much about yourself if your partner is not reciprocating with equally intimate information about themselves. If you revealed you cry at a certain movie, for example, they might confess a movie that always makes them cry or admit that they've never cried at a movie. When you criticize your partner, you may give them the impression that you think they're not good enough for you. They may put up defensive barriers, impeding your efforts to get closer to them. Try to flip criticisms around so that you focus on what you're missing rather than what your partner is or isn't doing.  For example, you might say \\"We have so much fun when we go out together\\" rather than \\"you never want to do anything.\\" Try to use plural pronouns, such as \\"we\\" and \\"us,\\" as much as possible. Singular pronouns, such as \\"I\\" and \\"you,\\" verbally pit the two of you against each other. Plural pronouns emphasize that you're a team and you're in it together. When the two of you disagree about something, try to find a way to resolve the problem rather than tearing your partner down. Your goal should not be to win the argument but to move your relationship to a better place. Seek your partner's side of the story and empathize with them.  Keep in mind that if you insult your partner, or lose your cool and start cursing at them, you'll likely regret it later. You could also deeply hurt them. Flying off the handle like this can also cross the line into verbal, psychological, or even physical abuse. If you're too upset to talk constructively, tell your partner that you need a few minutes of quiet time to calm down before you'll be able to talk about it. Then separate yourself from them for a few minutes. You could move to another room or go for a walk. When you first met your significant other, you likely had a million questions for them and wanted to know everything about them. But once you've been together for a while, that curiosity can fade. You may think you already know everything about them – but you don't. Ask them how they think and feel about things rather than assuming you know.  This applies to both large and small things in your life. For example, if the two of you are watching a TV show together, you might ask them which character is their favorite and why, or what the best part of the show is for them. Ask open-ended questions and give your partner the chance to surprise you. For example, a question such as \\"You like pizza, right?\\" is a yes/no question that doesn't give you the opportunity to learn anything new about your partner. However, if you asked \\"What's your favorite quick dinner?\\" their answer might surprise you. Your significant other will feel more comfortable opening up to you and letting you get closer if you show a real interest in the things that are going on in their life. If you've made an effort to listen actively, put that knowledge to use by asking them specific questions about things they mentioned.  For example, you might ask \\"How's your research going for your history paper?\\" or \\"Did your boss like your presentation this morning?\\" Asking generally about work or school doesn't show interest the same way. Use as many specific details as possible to indicate that you were paying attention to them and you really care about what's going on in their life.","output":"To foster closeness in relationships, communicate directly, share personal thoughts and feelings, listen actively, avoid criticism, and show genuine interest in your partner's life."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

His name is cognate with the first element of his Roman equivalent Jupiter. His mythologies and powers are similar, though not identical to those of the Indo-European deities such as Indra, Jupiter, Perun, Thor, and Odin., In Greek mythology , Erato / rto / ( Ancient Greek :  ) is one of the Greek Muses . The name would mean \`\` desired '' or \`\` lovely '' , if derived from the same root as Eros , as Apollonius of Rhodes playfully suggested in the invocation to Erato that begins Book III of his Argonautica . Erato is the Muse of lyric poetry . In the Orphic hymn to the Muses , it is Erato who charms the sight . Since the Renaissance she is often shown with a wreath of myrtle and roses , holding a lyre , or a small kithara , a musical instrument that Apollo or she herself invented . In Simon Vouet 's representations , two turtle - doves are eating seeds at her feet . Other representations may show her holding a golden arrow , reminding one of the \`\` eros '' , the feeling that she inspires in everybody , and at times she is accompanied by the god Eros , holding a torch ., The GNU General Public License (GNU GPL or GPL) is a widely used free software license, which guarantees end users the freedom to run, study, share and modify the software.

This is in distinction to permissive free software licenses, of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely used examples. GPL was the first copyleft license for general use., In Greek mythology, Medea (\\"Mdeia\\") is a sorceress who was the daughter of King Aeëtes of Colchis, niece of Circe, granddaughter of the sun god Helios, and later wife to the hero Jason. In Euripides's play \\"Medea\\", Jason abandons Medea when Creon, king of Corinth, offers his daughter Glauce. The play tells of Medea avenging her husband's betrayal by killing their children., Callimachus (\\"Kallimachos\\"; 310/305240 BC) was a native of the Greek colony of Cyrene, Libya. He was a noted poet, critic and scholar at the Library of Alexandria and enjoyed the patronage of the EgyptianGreek Pharaohs Ptolemy II Philadelphus and Ptolemy III Euergetes. Although he was never made chief librarian, he was responsible for producing a bibliographic survey based upon the contents of the Library. This, his \\"Pinakes\\", 120 volumes long, provided the foundation for later work on the history of Greek literature. As one of the earliest critic-poets, he typifies Hellenistic scholarship., Etruscan religion and mythology were partly incorporated into classical Roman culture, including the Roman pantheon. The Senate adopted key elements of their religion, which were perpetuated by haruspices and noble Roman families who claimed Etruscan descent, long after the general population had forgotten the language. However, in the last years of the Roman Republic the religion began to fall out of favor and was satirized by such notable public figures as Marcus Tullius Cicero. The Julio-Claudians, especially Claudius, who claimed a remote Etruscan descent, maintained a knowledge of the language and religion for a short time longer, but this practice soon ceased. A number of canonical works in the Etruscan language survived until the middle of the first millennium AD, but were destroyed by the ravages of time, decree of the Roman Senate, and by fire., Jason (\\"Iásn\\") was an ancient Greek mythological hero who was famous for his role as the leader of the Argonauts and their quest for the Golden Fleece. He was the son of Aeson, the rightful king of Iolcos. He was married to the sorceress Medea. He was also the great-grandson of the messenger god Hermes, through his mother's side., The Argonautica (\\"Argonautika\\") is a Greek epic poem written by Apollonius Rhodius in the 3rd century BC. The only surviving Hellenistic epic, the \\"Argonautica\\" tells the myth of the voyage of Jason and the Argonauts to retrieve the Golden Fleece from remote Colchis. Their heroic adventures and Jason's relationship with the dangerous Colchian princess/sorceress Medea were already well known to Hellenistic audiences, which enabled Apollonius to go beyond a simple narrative, giving it a scholarly emphasis suitable to the times. It was the age of the great Library of Alexandria and his epic incorporates his researches in geography, ethnography, comparative religion and Homeric literature. However, his main contribution to the epic tradition lies in his development of the love between hero and heroine  he seems to have been the first narrative poet to study \\"the pathology of love\\". His \\"Argonautica\\" had a profound impact on Latin poetry. It was translated by Varro Atacinus and imitated by Valerius Flaccus. It influenced Catullus and Ovid and it provided Virgil with a model for his Roman epic, the \\"Aeneid\\"., Gaius Valerius Flaccus (Setinus Balbus) (in English: ; died c. AD 90) was a Roman poet who flourished in the \\"Silver Age\\" under the emperors Vespasian and Titus and wrote a Latin \\"Argonautica\\" that owes a great deal to Apollonius of Rhodes' more famous epic. Life. He has been identified on insufficient grounds with a poet friend of Martial (1.61.76), a native of Padua, and in needy circumstances; but as he was a member of the College of Fifteen, who had charge of the Sibylline books (1.5), he must have been well off. The subscription of the Vatican manuscript, which adds the name Setinus Balbus, points to his having been a native of Setia in Latium. The only ancient writer who mentions him is Quintilian (10.1.90), who laments his recent death as a great loss; as Quintilian's work was finished about 90 AD, this gives a limit for the death of Flaccus., MusE is computer software, a sequencer for Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) and audio, with recording and editing abilities. It was originally written by Werner Schweer and now is developed by the Muse development team. It is free software released under the GNU General Public License., In Greek mythology, Leto (\\"Lt\\"; , \\"Lt\\" in Dorian Greek, etymology and meaning disputed) is a daughter of the Titans Coeus and Phoebe, the sister of Asteria, and the mother, by Zeus, of Apollo and Artemis., Apollonius of Rhodes (\\"Apollnios Rhódios\\" fl. first half of 3rd century BCE), is best known as the author of the \\"Argonautica\\", an epic poem about Jason and the Argonauts and their quest for the Golden Fleece. The poem is one of the few extant examples of the epic genre and it was both innovative and influential, providing Ptolemaic Egypt with a \\"cultural mnemonic\\" or national \\"archive of images\\", and offering the Latin poets Virgil and Gaius Valerius Flaccus a model for their own epics. His other poems, which survive only in small fragments, concerned the beginnings or foundations of cities, such as Alexandria and Cnidusplaces of interest to the Ptolemies, whom he served as a scholar and librarian at the Library of Alexandria. A literary dispute with Callimachus, another Alexandrian librarian/poet, is a topic much discussed by modern scholars since it is thought to give some insight into their poetry, although there is very little evidence that there ever was such a dispute between the two men. In fact almost nothing at all is known about Apollonius and even his connection with Rhodes is a matter for speculation. Once considered a mere imitator of Homer, and therefore a failure as a poet, his reputation has been enhanced by recent studies, with an emphasis on the special characteristics of Hellenistic poets as scholarly heirs of a long literary tradition writing at a unique time in history., The Aeneid is a Latin epic poem, written by Virgil between 29 and 19 BC, that tells the legendary story of Aeneas, a Trojan who travelled to Italy, where he became the ancestor of the Romans. It comprises 9,896 lines in dactylic hexameter. The first six of the poem's twelve books tell the story of Aeneas's wanderings from Troy to Italy, and the poem's second half tells of the Trojans' ultimately victorious war upon the Latins, under whose name Aeneas and his Trojan followers are destined to be subsumed., A kouros (plural kouroi) is the modern term given to free-standing ancient Greek sculptures which first appear in the Archaic period in Greece and represent nude male youths. In Ancient Greek \\"kouros\\" means \\"youth, boy, especially of noble rank\\". The term \\"kouros\\" was first proposed for what were previously thought to be depictions of Apollo by V. I. Leonardos in 1895 in relation to the youth from Keratea, and adopted by Henri Lechat as a generic term for the standing male figure in 1904. Such statues are found across the Greek-speaking world; the preponderance of these were found in sanctuaries of Apollo with more than one hundred from the sanctuary of Apollo Ptoios, Boeotia, alone. These free-standing sculptures were typically marble, but the form is also rendered in limestone, wood, bronze, ivory and terracotta. They are typically life-sized, though early colossal examples are up to 3 meters tall., Publius Vergilius Maro (traditional dates October 15, 70 BC  September 21, 19 BC), usually called Virgil or Vergil in English, was an ancient Roman poet of the Augustan period. He is known for three acclaimed works of Latin literature, the \\"Eclogues\\" (or \\"Bucolics\\"), the \\"Georgics\\", and the epic \\"Aeneid\\". A number of minor poems, collected in the \\"Appendix Vergiliana\\", are sometimes attributed to him., Publius Ovidius Naso (20 March 43 BC  AD 17/18), known as Ovid in the English-speaking world, was a Roman poet who lived during the reign of Augustus. He was a contemporary of the older Virgil and Horace, with whom he is often ranked as one of the three canonical poets of Latin literature. The Imperial scholar Quintilian considered him the last of the Latin love elegists. He enjoyed enormous popularity, but, in one of the mysteries of literary history, was sent by Augustus into exile in a remote province on the Black Sea, where he remained until his death. Ovid himself attributes his exile to \\"carmen et error\\", \\"a poem and a mistake\\", but his discretion in discussing the causes has resulted in much speculation among scholars., Apollo (Attic, Ionic, and Homeric Greek: , \\"Apolln\\"; Doric: , \\"Apelln\\"; Arcadocypriot: , \\"Apeiln\\"; Aeolic: , \\"Aploun\\") is one of the most important and complex of the Olympian deities in classical Greek and Roman religion and Greek and Roman mythology. The ideal of the \\"kouros\\" (a beardless, athletic youth), Apollo has been variously recognized as a god of music, truth and prophecy, healing, the sun and light, plague, poetry, and more. Apollo is the son of Zeus and Leto, and has a twin sister, the chaste huntress Artemis. Apollo is known in Greek-influenced Etruscan mythology as \\"Apulu\\"., Publius Terentius Varro Atacinus (82 BC  c. 35 BC) was a Roman poet, more polished in his style than the more famous and learned Varro Reatinus, his contemporary, and therefore more widely read by the Augustan writers. He was born in the province of Gallia Narbonensis, the southern part of Gaul with its capital at Narbonne, on the river Atax (now the Aude), for his cognomen \\"Atacinus\\" indicates his birthplace. Only fragments of his works survive. His first known works are \\"Bellum sequanicum\\", a poem on Julius Caesar's campaign against Ariovistus, and some satires; these should not be confused with the \\"Menippean Satires\\" of the other Varro, of which some 600 fragments survive. He translated the Alexandrian poet Apollonius Rhodius' \\"Argonautica\\" into Latin., Subject: erato, Relation: father, Options: (A) aeson (B) aeëtes (C) apollo (D) claudius (E) creon (F) helios (G) henri (H) heroic (I) julius caesar (J) jupiter (K) marcus tullius cicero (L) ptolemy ii philadelphus (M) ptolemy iii euergetes (N) richard (O) vespasian (P) virgil (Q) werner (R) zeus Student:","output":"apollo"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"Why does Callimaco pretend to be the one being kidnapped?\\" Response: \\"Because he wanted to sleep with Lucrezia\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question in a detailed and long manner. Here's a more detailed and long answer: Callimaco pretends to be the one being kidnapped for several reasons. Firstly, he is infatuated with Lucrezia's beauty and deeply desires to sleep with her. By disguising himself as the stranger to be kidnapped, he can get access to Lucrezia in a situation where her husband, Nicia, intentionally puts her in bed with another man. This way, Callimaco can get close to Lucrezia without having to face the consequences of an illicit affair. Secondly, Callimaco's strategy is designed to deceive Nicia and exploit his gullibility. Nicia, being desperate for an heir, falls for the elaborate scheme concocted by Callimaco and Ligurio. By manipulating Nicia into believing that the potion made from the Mandrake Root would help Lucrezia conceive but also be deadly for the first man to sleep with her, Callimaco ensures that Nicia would be willing to go along with the plan to kidnap a stranger. In this sense, Callimaco's deception allows him to take advantage of Nicia's desperation and his wife's loyalty. Finally, Callimaco's plan to disguise himself as the kidnapped stranger helps him maintain control over the entire situation. Since he is the mastermind behind the plot, he wants to ensure that everything goes according to his design. By being the one kidnapped, Callimaco can directly influence how the situation unfolds and keep any unexpected variables from interfering with his ultimate goal – to sleep with Lucrezia and, as revealed towards the end of the story, ultimately win her heart."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: -  The dishwasher heats the water - The detergent dispenser opens at the right time - Water is shot through the jets to clean the dishes - The dirty water is drained - More water is sprayed to rinse the dishes - The water is drained again - The air is heated in the dishwasher to dry the dishes.  What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the dishwasher process is the preparation and loading of the dishes. This step is crucial in ensuring that the dishwasher functions efficiently and effectively throughout the entire cycle. Before using the dishwasher, it is essential to scrape off any large food particles from the dishes, pots, and pans. This helps prevent food debris from clogging the dishwasher's filter and spray arms. In some cases, pre-rinsing the dishes can also be helpful; however, modern dishwashers are typically designed to handle small food particles without pre-rinsing. It is important to note that excessively pre-rinsing the dishes may eliminate the enzymes and surfactants in the detergent from effectively adhering to the dishes, consequently reducing the efficiency of the dishwasher. Loading the dishwasher correctly is also a crucial aspect of the first step. To do this, you must ensure that dishes are properly placed in the racks to optimize the water spray coverage. Place larger items like pots and pans on the bottom rack, facing downward and toward the spray arms. Smaller plates, saucers, and bowls should be loaded into the top rack, arranged at an angle to allow the water to run off freely. Glasses and mugs can also be placed on the top rack, taking care to avoid overcrowding and prevent the items from touching or clinking together, which might cause breakages. Cutlery can be placed in the designated cutlery basket, mixing the items to prevent nesting or sticking together, ensuring that both sharp and blunt utensils receive adequate water coverage for proper cleaning. Be cautious with sharp knives, as they can damage the dishwasher's interior or pose a safety risk during unloading. Once the dishwasher is loaded, the subsequent steps of the dishwasher process include heating the water, dispensing detergent, activating the spray jets, draining dirty water, rinsing dishes, and the final draining and drying stages. These steps are efficiently performed by the dishwasher to provide clean, dry, and spotless dishes after each cycle. The correct preparation and loading of the dishes contribute significantly to the effectiveness of these steps, ultimately resulting in consistently satisfactory washing results."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Is Since regaining independence, Estonia has pursued a foreign policy of close co-operation with its Western European partners. a good answer to this question?","output":"While the statement provided gives a brief insight into Estonia's foreign policy approach since regaining independence, it does not provide a comprehensive answer to the question about the most important foreign policy priorities. Estonia's foreign policy, like any other nation, is shaped by several factors and serves multiple objectives. Thus, to provide a detailed and long answer to this question, it is essential to break down the various elements of Estonia's foreign policy priorities. Here are some key components of Estonia's foreign policy since regaining its independence: 1. Integration with Western European institutions: Estonia has worked towards building closer ties with major Western European political and economic institutions, such as the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The country has strived to benefit from the wealth of knowledge, resources, and stability provided by these organizations. Estonia joined the EU in 2004, and its membership in NATO dates back to the same year. 2. Strengthening regional security: Security and stability have been of paramount importance in Estonia's foreign policy. As a Baltic country with a complex history, Estonia has placed significant emphasis on regional security and cooperation initiatives. Estonia's NATO membership reflects the importance it places on its defense and overall security. 3. Bilateral and multilateral cooperation: Estonia has actively sought to foster strong ties with various countries on bilateral and multilateral levels. For instance, the country has strengthened its relationship with its Baltic neighbors, Latvia and Lithuania, and other Nordic countries, such as Finland, Sweden, and Norway. This cooperation encompasses various sectors, including trade, cultural exchange, and efforts to combat common security threats. 4. Cybersecurity and digital innovation: Estonia has carved out a global reputation as a leading digital country and has, therefore, focused on promoting digital cooperation and innovation as a foreign policy priority. The country has actively participated in international discussions on cybersecurity and governance and has pursued collaborative projects with various partners to ensure an open, secure, and resilient cyberspace. 5. Promotion of human rights, democracy, and the rule of law: Estonia has positioned itself as an active defender and promoter of human rights, democracy, and the rule of law, both regionally and internationally. The country often supports human rights initiatives in international organizations like the United Nations, the EU, and the Council of Europe and extends technical assistance to countries in need such as those in the Eastern Partnership initiative. 6. Climate change and environmental protection: In acknowledgment of the global threats posed by climate change and environmental degradation, Estonia has participated in various international endeavors aimed at combating these challenges. This component of its foreign policy includes engagement in international climate negotiations, adopting sustainable development goals, and integrating green initiatives into its economic and social development strategies. In summary, a comprehensive answer to the question would include multiple aspects of Estonia's foreign policy priorities, including integration with Western institutions, regional security, cooperation with neighboring countries, focus on cybersecurity, promotion of democratic values, and environmental protection."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose vocal talent had been recognized when she was a chils? , can you please find it?   Zenzile Miriam Makeba (4 March 1932 – 9 November 2008), nicknamed Mama Africa, was a South African singer, songwriter, actress, United Nations goodwill ambassador, and civil rights activist. Associated with musical genres including Afropop, jazz, and world music, she was an advocate against apartheid and white-minority government in South Africa. Born in Johannesburg to Swazi and Xhosa parents, Makeba was forced to find employment as a child after the death of her father. She had a brief and allegedly abusive first marriage at the age of 17, gave birth to her only child in 1950, and survived breast cancer. Her vocal talent had been recognized when she was a child, and she began singing professionally in the 1950s, with the Cuban Brothers, the Manhattan Brothers, and an all-woman group, the Skylarks, performing a mixture of jazz, traditional African melodies, and Western popular music. In 1959, Makeba had a brief role in the anti-apartheid film Come Back, Africa, which brought her international attention, and led to her performing in Venice, London, and New York City. In London, she met the American singer Harry Belafonte, who became a mentor and colleague. She moved to New York City, where she became immediately popular, and recorded her first solo album in 1960. Her attempt to return to South Africa that year for her mother's funeral was prevented by the country's government. Makeba's career flourished in the United States, and she released several albums and songs, her most popular being \\"Pata Pata\\" (1967). Along with Belafonte she received a Grammy Award for her 1965 album An Evening with Belafonte/Makeba. She testified against the South African government at the United Nations and became involved in the civil rights movement. She married Stokely Carmichael, a leader of the Black Panther Party, in 1968. As a result, she lost support among white Americans and faced hostility from the US government, leading her and Carmichael to move to Guinea.

Premise: To give luck a chance and to gain an even greater fame, Przekosniak sent, posing as 'Admirer', SMSs to editors of major, highly influential papers, known politicians, people in culture, show-business, science, healthy living gurus, authorities on potted plants, teachers of the self-defense dance qualadora, as well as semi-virtual tango, an acquaintance who was also a philosopher, and a lady from a shop selling imported cheese sticks. Hypothesis: Przekosniak was shy and didn't want anyone to know him. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"Step 1: Identify the key elements present in the premise and the hypothesis. Premise key elements: - Przekosniak sending SMSs to various influential individuals. - Przekosniak posing as an admirer. - Recipients include people from various fields and acquaintances. Hypothesis key elements: - Przekosniak being shy. - Przekosniak not wanting anyone to know him. Step 2: Compare the key elements in the premise and the hypothesis. The premise mentions that Przekosniak is posing as an \\"admirer\\" while contacting influential people, acquaintances, and a lady from the cheese stick shop. This suggests that Przekosniak may be trying to maintain anonymity. Step 3: Determine if the premise entails the hypothesis. The hypothesis claims that Przekosniak is shy and doesn't want anyone to know him. While the action of posing as an \\"admirer\\" in the premise indicates a possible attempt to remain anonymous, it is not enough to conclude that Przekosniak is shy. Conclusion: The premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis, as the action of posing as an \\"admirer\\" could result from various reasons, such as privacy, strategy, or experimentation, and not only shyness. There might be a partial entailment, but it's insufficient to draw a definite conclusion regarding Przekosniak's shyness."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Please answer the following question about this movie plot. If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\".  Question: Who is too powerful for the Wild Bushman? Movie plot title: The Outback Movie plot: A white koala named Johnny is teased about his color so he joins a traveling circus with the help of Hamish, a Tasmanian Devil, and a Higgens, a monkey photographer. He is disappointed that he is part of the freak show instead of the main acts in the big tent. The top act is \\"Wild Bushman\\" who takes all the audience from the freak show. Johnny checks out the act and ends up part of the act by accident and saved by The Wild Bushman. While traveling to a new location Their wagon train car becomes unattached and crashes in the desert of \\"The Outback\\". On their quest to go to the next location of the traveling circus, \\"Precipice Lake\\", they come upon a billabong, the oasis of the Outback. They witness from their cliff location that a pack of dingos (and a thylacine) are chasing a bilby but rescued by a kangaroo, a wombat army, and a vine-swinging female koala talented at throwing a boomerang. Boris, a vulture, reveals that Bog intends on taking over the Billabong. When their rescue goes wrong and the dingos threaten to take over, the rock Johnny is on breaks free and he slides down the cliff and ends up rolling on top of a boulder that chases the dingos away. Hamish introduces the now-famous white koala as \\"Koala Kid\\". Miranda, the boomerang expert koala, is not impressed but Johnny watches her from a tree as she practices. When noticed, Miranda breaks the branch he is on with her boomerang and complains about him watching in secret. He tries to lie his way out of that accusation but ends up suggesting he is an expert at the boomerang... and proven wrong when offered to try it himself. Hamish's plan is to take photos of Johnny doing heroic stuff and make him famous as Koala Kid so when they get back to the circus, they can get in the main act rather then the freak show (Hamish will make more money). Bog, a giant crocodile, is not impressed with his gang getting chased by a koala so orders them to capture Koala Kid.

A:","output":"In the movie plot of \\"The Outback,\\" there is no specific character mentioned who is considered \\"too powerful for the Wild Bushman.\\" However, we can infer that throughout their adventures, Johnny the white koala (also known as \\"Koala Kid\\") becomes an unexpected hero who is capable of dealing with threats that the Wild Bushman had not faced in his act. Johnny's unintentional victory over the pack of dingos, along with the help of his new friends like Hamish and Higgens, and the native animals like the vine-swinging koala Miranda, showcases that while Wild Bushman might be the top act in the circus, Johnny's experience in the Outback strengthens him to face more serious threats such as Bog, the giant crocodile. In conclusion, Koala Kid (Johnny) and his new group of friends could be considered powerful enough to deal with the challenges posed by the Outback, making them more powerful than the Wild Bushman in the circus acts."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Can we draw the following conclusion? Véronique Vendell suffered from extreme anxiety. Options: (A). Yes (B). It's impossible to say (C). No","output":"(B). It's impossible to say Véronique Vendell, born Véronique Duraffourd on 21 July 1942, is a French actress who has worked in various French and German film productions. She is best known for her roles in Peter Glenville's \\"Becket\\" and Sam Peckinpah's \\"Cross of Iron\\" and its sequel \\"Breakthrough\\". However, there is no available information on her mental health, particularly regarding whether she suffered from extreme anxiety or not. Anxiety, commonly experienced by many people, can manifest as an occasional feeling of unease or nervousness. For some, it can escalate into a persistent or severe mental health disorder that can have debilitating consequences on their personal and professional lives. Actors, like the general population, may experience anxiety or mental health issues at various points in their lives, as they can be affected by a plethora of factors such as stress, traumatic events, or genetic predisposition. Despite Véronique Vendell's success in the film industry, it would be improper to draw definitive conclusions about her mental health, specifically any experiences of extreme anxiety, without the presence of concrete evidence. Public information is scarce about her personal life, and it is important to respect her privacy unless she or a reliable source has disclosed any information on this matter. In conclusion, it is impossible to determine if Véronique Vendell suffered from extreme anxiety based on the available information about her career and roles in various productions. Mental health is a complex subject, and it is crucial to make inferences solely on substantiated evidence or personal testimonies rather than making assumptions based on someone's career trajectory or the roles they have played."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

One of the key features that make this game so appealing to its diverse population of gamers is its multi-player servers, where connections and communities form around shared interests, goals, and endeavors. In this article, we will delve into the process of finding a Minecraft server that you really like, introducing yourself on the server, and setting a good example to leave a lasting impression on fellow players. Step 1: Finding a Minecraft Server to Call Home Just as in the real world, finding the ideal Minecraft server to settle into requires exploration and research. Begin by considering what you value most in a server, taking into account aspects such as game modes, themed worlds, the level of creativity and complexity, and the size and demographic of the community.

Most Minecraft servers come equipped with in-game chat, forums, and Discord channels, making it easy to communicate with other players. To make a positive and lasting first impression, craft a concise and friendly introductory message that touches on your interests, goals, and what drew you to the server. While it's important to showcase your enthusiasm and authenticity, remember to maintain respect for others and their creations, as this is vital in fostering strong, supportive relationships within the community. Step 3: Making a Good Example of Yourself With your introduction done, it's time to contribute positively to the server and become a valuable community member. Engage with others through collaborative projects, assisting new players, participating in server events, or sharing resources and advice. By doing so, you will not only grow as a Minecraft player but also foster camaraderie and goodwill. Moreover, being a good listener and receptive to feedback is crucial in establishing yourself as a trustworthy and approachable player.

Question: Process:  - Water from the ocean washes onto beaches in waves - The waves contain sediment from the ocean - The water and particles in it hit rocks and sand on the beach - The wind and current sometimes push the water and particles harder - Tiny parts of the rocks on the shore come off the larger rocks - The waves pick up sand and small rocks from the beach - The waves go back out into the ocean - The waves carry the new particles with them - Rocks and the beach look a little different.  suppose when there is a tsunami happens, how will it affect the wind levels decrease on the ocean.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"A tsunami can indirectly impact a step of the process described, which involves the interaction between waves, sediments, and the shoreline. It is important to understand the dynamics of tsunamis and their effects on coastal areas to fully comprehend the perturbation they may cause on the wind levels and the process discussed. A tsunami is a series of large ocean waves usually caused by an underwater disturbance, such as an earthquake or volcanic eruption. These massive waves travel at high speeds across the open ocean and can cause significant destruction upon reaching coastal areas. The energy of a tsunami can drastically alter the coastal environment, causing flooding, erosion, and sediment transport. In the context of the process mentioned, the presence of a tsunami would likely have an indirect impact on various steps. The increased wave energy from the tsunami not only intensifies the water's force against rocks and sand, but also carries a much greater amount of sediment and debris. This higher force and increased sediment load can cause additional weathering and erosion of rocks on the shoreline and the displacement of sand and other particles. The question about wind levels decreasing during a tsunami suggests a potential interaction between the wind and ocean currents. However, it is essential to understand that tsunamis primarily result from geological events and are less influenced by local wind conditions. Furthermore, a tsunami may not have a direct impact on wind levels, but it may cause short-term disruptions to local wind patterns due to its significant impact on the ocean and coastal areas. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation that results from a tsunami would indirectly impact steps in the process described. A tsunami may not directly affect wind levels, but its immense energy can intensify the interaction between waves, sediments, and the shoreline, causing a significant impact on coastal environments."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Six weeks after arriving in the United States, Hassan Abduraheem takes a seat in the back pew of Tar Wallet Baptist Church. Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman. Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,” since the 2011 secession of South Sudan. Abduraheem says his work was spreading the gospel; the Sudanese government accused him of espionage, and he was detained along with two other pastors in December 2015. \\"The first day when they took us to the prison, they beat us,” he says softly.  Abduraheem was shifted from prison to prison. For five months, he wore the same clothes he was wearing when he was arrested. His eyes became damaged from the harsh prison light. Yet, despite constant interrogations, just two meals of beans a day and a tiny cell with barely enough room to sleep, he says the worst part of prison was not knowing. Question: How long would the Sudanese war likely last? === The answer to the above question is Answer:","output":"Predicting the exact duration of the Sudanese war is challenging, as it depends on various factors such as political developments, international intervention, peace negotiations, and the willingness of opposing parties to seek peaceful solutions. Historically, the conflict in Sudan has been ongoing in different forms for decades, including the First Sudanese Civil War (1955-1972) and the Second Sudanese Civil War (1983-2005), followed by continuing tensions and violence. To provide an accurate estimation of how long the Sudanese war would likely last, extensive research and analysis of the current situation and contributing factors would be required."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Craig saw a UFO and asked if Donald had seen it but","output":"Donald was busy on his phone, completely oblivious to the extraordinary sighting. Craig, unable to contain his excitement, rushed toward his friend, grabbing his arm and gesturing toward the sky.  \\"Donald, man, you have to see this!\\" Craig exclaimed, pointing to the peculiar object hovering above them. Donald, startled by the sudden enthusiasm, reluctantly pocketed his phone and turned his attention toward the strange occurrence. Up in the sky, they both observed a metallic, saucer-shaped object silently gliding through the air. It was unlike anything they'd ever seen before, emitting a soft, pulsating glow that alternated between shades of blue and green. The surface of the UFO appeared to be smooth and polished, with no discernible markings or windows to help decipher its origin or purpose. Donald stared in disbelief, his skepticism melting away as he watched the object perform several maneuvers that defied the principles of physics. It darted from one side to the other at impossible speeds, leaving behind a temporary trail of warping light that seemed to bend the very fabric of reality. His heart raced as he realized the magnitude of what they were witnessing. As the UFO continued its aerial ballet, Craig couldn't help but wonder about the intentions of its inhabitants. Were they friend or foe? Did they come in peace, or did they harbor sinister motives? He remembered the countless science fiction stories he'd consumed as a child, where extraterrestrial visitors often held humanity's fate in their hands. Donald, on the other hand, couldn't help but think about the potential technological advancements that could be gleaned from this encounter. He envisioned propulsion systems that defied gravity, energy sources that could replace fossil fuels, and communication devices that transcended space and time. He knew that if humans could somehow make contact with the beings controlling this UFO, their world would change forever. The two friends stood there, frozen in awe, as the mysterious object continued to hover above them. Suddenly, the UFO emitted a blinding flash of light that enveloped the entire area. Both Craig and Donald shielded their eyes, feeling as if they were momentarily thrust into another dimension. As the light dissipated, they cautiously opened their eyes to find that the UFO had vanished without a trace. As if it had never been there, the sky returned to its regular appearance, leaving the two men grappling with what they had just experienced. Donald, the eternal skeptic, turned to Craig and shakily said, \\"I don't know what just happened, but I can't deny that we've just witnessed something extraordinary.\\" Craig nodded in agreement, knowing that their lives would never be the same after this encounter. The two friends walked away from the site, unable to let go of the overwhelming feelings of wonder and fear that now surged through them. They knew that they might never get the answers they sought about the UFO and its otherworldly passengers, but one thing was for certain – their understanding of the universe had been irreversibly changed. As word of their sighting spread, others would soon come forward with their own accounts of mysterious objects in the sky. The phenomenon would capture the imagination of people around the world, sparking countless investigations and debates about the existence of extraterrestrial life. For Craig and Donald, however, their encounter with the UFO would remain a deeply personal experience – a shared moment in time that would forever bind them together, serving as a reminder that there was far more to this vast universe than they could ever have imagined."},{"instruction":"Definition: The task is about translation from Telugu to English.

Given the question: I read this background article the other day: The Tasmanian devil is a nocturnal and crepuscular hunter, spending the days in dense bush or in a hole.[64] It has been speculated that nocturnalism may have been adopted to avoid predation by eagles and humans.[65] Young devils are predominantly crepuscular.[66] There is no evidence of torpor.[67]  Young devils can climb trees, but this becomes more difficult as they grow larger.[68][69] Devils can scale trees of trunk diameter larger than 40 cm (16 in), which tend to have no small side branches to hang onto, up to a height of around 2.5–3 m (8.2–9.8 ft). Devils that are yet to reach maturity can climb shrubs to a height of 4 metres (13.1 ft), and can climb a tree to 7 m (23 ft) if it is not vertical.[70] Adult devils may eat young devils if they are very hungry, so this climbing behaviour may be an adaptation to allow young devils to escape.[71] Devils can also swim and have been observed crossing rivers that are 50 metres (160 ft) in width, including icy cold waterways, apparently enthusiastically.  I am facing a new situation today: The scientists examined both the Eastern and the Western slopes of the mountain. They reached the conclusion that the Western slope was inhabited by many more adult Tasmanian devils than the Eastern slope.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which slope had more instances of devils eating young devils? The answer is:","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation, it can be inferred that the Western slope likely had more instances of devils eating young devils. The background article states that adult Tasmanian devils may eat young devils if they are very hungry, and this climbing behavior of young devils may be an adaptation to allow them to escape from adults. The new situation indicates that the Western slope was inhabited by many more adult Tasmanian devils than the Eastern slope. With a higher population of adult devils on the Western slope, the probability of instances where adult devils are hungry and resort to eating young devils would likely be higher on the Western slope as compared to the Eastern slope. Furthermore, as the young devils display climbing behavior to escape adult devils, a higher population of adult devils on the Western slope may lead to an increased need for young devils to climb trees as a means of self-preservation, which could be an indication of more instances of attempted predation by adult devils on the Western slope. It is important to note, however, that the information provided does not give a definite answer to the question, and other factors such as availability of prey, vegetation, and overall population density may also contribute to the frequency of instances where adult devils eat young devils. Additional research and data would be necessary to draw a more accurate conclusion."},{"instruction":"Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What does Mr. Porter tell the sympathetic researcher about himself?, using the article: Dr. Edwards arrives at a secluded island laboratory to examine Mr. Porter.

Please answer the following question: Called the PURE (Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology) study, this was a very large observational study looking at the link between fat and carbohydrate consumption and longevity in 18 countries across 5 continents. Running for 7 years and involving over 135,000 people, this was a very big study so its conclusions are right to take notice of. The key finding from the work that attracted the most media attention was that a high carbohydrate diet was linked with a higher risk of earlier mortality, whereas total fat and individual types of fat were related to a lower risk of earlier mortality. Digging deeper into the study, the research team found that global diets consisted of 61 percent energy coming from carbohydrates and 24 percent energy from fats. And while those in the highest carbohydrate consumption group (a whopping 77 percent of energy) had a higher risk of earlier death, it wasn’t cardiovascular disease they were dying from. What those other causes of death were exactly is unclear. Perhaps getting hit by a car running for a Mars Bar was one of them as a recent commenter on my Facebook page theorised. A paradigm shift? Not quite Does this study turn on its head ‘everything we knew about nutrition?’ Not quite. And here’s why. Before the PURE study, there were many studies showing the opposite link between carbohydrates and longevity. So, when a conflicting study comes along, this grabs the media spotlight for the day. Here is just one example – a major systematic review and meta-analysis from 2013 involving 17 individual studies and over 242,000 people showing a higher risk of earlier mortality as carbohydrate intake decreased. And this is the problem at times with observational research in that two studies can give polar opposite results so the findings of the PURE study should be seen through this filter.

Hint: Solar radiation (or sunlight) is the energy Earth receives from the Sun. Earth also emits radiation back into space, but at longer wavelengths that we cannot see. Part of the incoming and emitted radiation is absorbed or reflected by the atmosphere. In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere.

The EU 's agriculture representative in Washington said EU ministers were invited but canceled because the union is wrapping up talks on agricultural reform . Are these sentences conveying the same meaning?","output":"Yes, these two sentences are conveying the same meaning. Both sentences communicate that Gerry Kiely, an EU agriculture representative in Washington, has stated that EU ministers were invited to an event or meeting, but they ended up canceling their attendance. The reason for the cancellation is that the European Union is in the process of finalizing discussions on agricultural reform. There are some differences in the choice of words and phrasing between the two sentences, but the core message remains the same: - The first sentence explicitly mentions Gerry Kiely and his role, while the second sentence starts with a relatively more general reference to the EU's agriculture representative in Washington. This distinction is minor, though, as both sentences ultimately refer to the same individual. - The first sentence uses the term \\"closing talks,\\" whereas the second sentence uses \\"wrapping up talks.\\" Both expressions indicate that the EU is concluding its discussions on agricultural reform. Although these phrases might have slightly different nuances, their overall meaning in this context is the same. In summary, the two sentences present the same information using slightly different wordings but effectively convey the same message."},{"instruction":"Q:What type of details about erik evju  can be gathered from the following bio?

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Once upon a time there was a wise man who used to go to the sea to do his writing. He had a habit of walking on the beach before he began his work. One day he was walking along the shore. As he looked down at the beach, he saw something moving like a dancer. He smiled to himself at the thought that someone would dance on the beach. So he began to walk faster to catch up.As he got close,he saw that it was a young man and the young man wasn't dancing,instead he was reaching down to the shore,picking up something and very gently and throwing it into the ocean.

Review: This film is about the life of Queen Victoria during her youth and her first few years as the monarch of Great Britain. \\"The Young Victoria\\" has amazing production. Every scene is designed and decorated to immaculate detail. The extravagant costumes, lavish locations and beautifully landscaped gardens all make \\"The Young Victoria\\" very impressive. I was the most amazed by the thoughtful cinematography. How every person is placed in relation to the background or foreground is well thought out, every scene is well composed. The scene that strikes me the most was when Victoria talks to Melbourne. Melbourne was positioned in the middle of the door frame from Victoria's angle, while from Melbourne's angle Victoria was situated between the space where Melbourne held his arm on his hips. Story wise, it is far too compressed to be followed and understood by a person without historical knowledge of Queen Victoria. Many events are rushed through or not even explained. I expected a grand scene of the coronation, and disappointingly it only lasted for a few seconds. Overall, \\"The Young Victoria\\" is a good film, and it would have been even better if it was longer, so that events could be properly explained without rush. What is the sentiment of this review?

Summarize: Media playback is not supported on this device But the West Midlands team have come a long way since their formation in 1991 and can make history on Saturday by reaching the first round of the FA Cup for the first time. It will not be easy against the relative giants of FC United of Manchester but, whatever happens at the Aspray Arena, it will be another chapter in a remarkable story. Sporting Khalsa are fifth in the Midland League Premier Division, the ninth tier of the English football pyramid. On Tuesday, they won at Brocton. The attendance was 87. On Saturday, in excess of 2,000 supporters are expected for the visit of National League North side FC United, who play three tiers above Khalsa, in the FA Cup fourth qualifying round. The winners will earn £12,500 and enter Monday's first-round draw alongside 2008 winners Portsmouth and Wigan, who lifted the trophy by beating Manchester City at Wembley in 2013. \\"Preparations started on Sunday because we had to clear an access route for vans to bring in the marquees we are having to use because our bar is not big enough,\\" said Inder Grewa, one of Sporting Khalsa's 12 owners, who also acts as treasurer. \\"We have never before had to think about marquees because we normally only have 50 people here. \\"There was a load of old metal and chairs that needed shifting. Grass verges had to be dug and stone had to be put down to level it off. \\"At our level we can't afford to pay people to clear the site. We rely on volunteers. \\"We sent one email out and had around 20 people turn up, including the manager and some of the players.\\" Prior to this FA Cup run, Sporting Khalsa had never had an attendance in three figures, but there were 750 at the Aspray Arena for the visit of Spalding in the third qualifying round. On Saturday, a combination of local interest and FC United's healthy away following - many of whom are intent on making a trip to nearby Dudley to see the statue of legendary Manchester United and England player Duncan Edwards - could see three times that many turn up. Normal home match plans have had to be altered at a club where stadium and bar manager Bal Gacha is the only full-time member of staff. \\"We usually print the programmes ourselves on a colour printer,\\" Grewa told BBC Sport. \\"But we have not been able to do that this weekend because instead of 20 we have had to get a thousand done. \\"We have gone up from two stewards to 30. \\"We have brought the marquees in because we simply could not accommodate the numbers we are expecting in the bar. Food will be available, though.\\" Ah yes, the now famous curry house, located within the 4-4-2 bar adjacent to the ground, open on match and non-matchdays. \\"We just thought it would be an add-on,\\" said Grewa. \\"We feed the players but football comes first. Everything here is working towards improving the football side.\\" It is safe to assume neither Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger nor Aston Villa boss Tim Sherwood were required for landscaping duties before last season's FA Cup final. But that was one of the jobs keeping Sporting Khalsa manager Ian Rowe busy this week after answering the call to help create the access route. Building is nothing new for this Black Country club, sandwiched between Wolverhampton and Walsall, whose story of traversing one side of Noose Lane, where it all began in 1991, to the other, where the Asprey Arena is located, is a compelling one, even if it comes with a sad reminder that some racial stereotypes still run deep. Sporting Khalsa emerged from a group of a dozen Sikh lads who would meet on Willenhall Memorial Park for a kickabout at weekends. Playing standards varied. Passion for the game was in them all. Sporting Khalsa entered the local Walsall and District Sunday League, then moved into Saturday football, pushing the boundaries of what could be achieved. In 2004 they joined the West Midlands Regional League. Three promotions have taken them to the upper echelons of the Midland League. Decisions now, as they always have, are achieved through discussion and consensus, sometimes in the car as they travel to away games. Sporting Khalsa's architects were Asian. Their official website calls them a semi-professional Asian club. But it has always been open to all, regardless of religion, skin colour and gender. They bought a pitch at Bloxwich Town but when Aspray Arena became available after Willenhall Town went into administration in 2009, the opportunity to relocate to a stadium barely 400 yards from the Sunday league pitches where the Sporting Khalsa concept first emerged was too tempting to reject. \\"There is a group of 12 who you could say are the core of the club,\\" said Grewa. \\"We were always aware some of us could not play at a good standard. But we just love the game - and we wanted to see how far we could push ourselves. \\"You still get the odd comment. We were at an away match recently and someone said, 'I thought you lot only played cricket', so that stereotype is still there. \\"It makes me angry that something like that still happens because it is absolutely not true. \\"We just love football. It doesn't matter to us if you are black, green or yellow. We welcome anybody. \\"We have kids teams from under-6s upwards and four ladies teams. We are a community club - and the community is everybody.\\" The club have ambitions of climbing higher up the football pyramid, but there is also a conflict about how progress could permanently alter the identity of the club. \\"We want to get to the National League,\\" said Grewa. \\"Once you go into the Football League, it becomes a business. I don't know whether we want that. \\"The founders of the club have never fallen out. That only happens if there is money involved. As it is, everyone is treated equally. \\"Up to the National League, we could still do our jobs and handle it.\\" At 15:00 BST on Saturday, the dreaming must stop. By any logic, Sporting Khalsa do not stand a chance of bridging the gap to FC United, akin to a League Two side taking on a Premier League team. They do have an international, central defender Tes Robinson, who plays for St Kitts and Nevis. They also have a forward, Craig Bannister, who has scored nine times in this season's FA Cup. Saturday's match is Sporting Khalsa's seventh FA Cup tie of the season, more than Arsenal played in lifting the trophy in 2014-15. The players share lifts to away games. Many still play Sunday football in addition to Saturdays. And it was not known for certain until less than 24 hours before they left for their replay against Spalding last week that their goalkeeper and winger would be able to play because of work commitments. \\"I am a Manchester United fan,\\" said manager Ian Rowe, who was appointed at the start of the 2014-15 season. \\"I have followed the FC United story from the start. Next to having my kids, this will be one of the proudest moments of my life. \\"But let's not kid ourselves. The chance of us reaching the level we will need to win this game is probably one in a hundred. \\"AFC Fylde are in the same league as FC United. They beat a team in our league 9-0. I don't want that to happen to us.\\"","output":"The West Midlands football team, Sporting Khalsa, has the opportunity to make history by reaching the first round of the FA Cup for the first time, if they win their match against FC United of Manchester. The team has grown tremendously since its formation in 1991 and currently hold fifth place in the Midland League Premier Division, which is the ninth tier of the English football pyramid. If they win their match, they will earn £12,500 and be included in the first-round draw alongside previous winners, Portsmouth and Wigan. In preparation for the expected 2,000 spectators, the volunteer-run club had to clear an access route for marquees as their bar is not large enough. Regardless of the game's outcome, it will mark a significant milestone in the clubs history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Ross James Brawn OBE (born 23 November 1954) is the Formula One Managing Director of Motorsports and technical director. He is also a former motorsport engineer and Formula One team principal. He had worked for a number of Formula One teams, serving as the technical director of the championship-winning Benetton and Ferrari teams. He took a sabbatical from the sport in 2007 but returned to F1 for the 2008 season as Team Principal of Honda. His career in motorsport began in 1976 when he joined March Engineering in the town of Bicester as a milling machine operator. Soon afterwards he joined their Formula 3 racing team as a mechanic. Brawn was hired by Sir Frank Williams in 1978 as a machinist for the newly formed Williams team. He quickly moved up through the ranks, working in the R&D department with Frank Dernie and as an aerodynamicist in the team's wind tunnel.  Brawn joined the Haas Lola team in 1985 and was part of Neil Oatley's design team at FORCE that produced both the Lola THL1 and THL2 cars used by the team. However, with the 4 cylinder Hart engine in the THL1 and the new Ford V6 turbo powering the THL2, results were scarce against teams like McLaren and Williams with their TAG-Porsche and Honda turbo engines. This was despite the cars generally being regarded by most in the F1 paddock as being the best handling cars on the grid, as well as having 1980 World Champion Alan Jones and former factory Ferrari and Renault driver Patrick Tambay as the drivers. When the Haas team left F1 at the end of the 1986 season, Brawn moved to Arrows. There he designed the Megatron powered Arrows A10 and its update, the A10B for the 1987 and 1988 seasons respectively and the Ford V8 powered Arrows A11 used in 1989.  Later in 1989 Brawn moved to the Jaguar Sportscar racing division, and was lead designer on the Jaguar XJR-14 which won the 1991 World Sportscar Championship.

Jesús está ofreciendo compartir nuestras cargas.)","output":"The yoke is a way of moving the load with the help of someone else. Jesus is offering to share our burdens. In this context, the yoke refers to a device traditionally used to link two animals, like oxen, together, allowing them to work in tandem and distribute the weight of the load evenly between them. This helped make the task of moving heavy loads more manageable and efficient. In a metaphorical sense, Jesus is offering to share our burdens and help us carry the weight of our struggles and difficulties. By inviting us to take on His yoke, he is offering support, guidance, and comfort in times of need. The message Jesus conveys is an essential aspect of Christian teachings, emphasizing the role of faith and belief in overcoming challenges that may seem insurmountable at first. This concept of sharing burdens also emphasizes the importance of community and cooperation. By working together and helping one another, people can face adversity more effectively and find strength in unity. The metaphor of the yoke helps illustrate how interconnected we all are and how leaning on one another and accepting help can make tasks more manageable and less overwhelming. In the context of Christianity, this idea is particularly pertinent, as believers often turn to God and their religious communities for guidance, support, and encouragement. When faced with trials or in need of spiritual sustenance, the symbolic act of taking on the yoke of Jesus can provide a comforting reminder that we are never truly alone in our struggles. As humans, we can find solace in knowing that there is a greater power willing to help carry our burdens and provide the strength we need to prevail."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sometimes, a \\"show don't tell\\" approach works best. Consider spending a few days showing your parents you're responsible. If your parents see you're maturing, they might be more willing to allow you to have extra freedom.  Most parents expect that kids will reach a point where they crave more independence. However, understand parents have worries themselves. They will want to make sure they know where you are at all times. You can ease some of their potential anxiety by showcasing your growing maturity and independence. Do your chores without being asked. Complete your homework as soon as you get home from school. Be upfront about what's happening in your day-to-day life by sharing details about school and your social life without prompting. Use \\"please\\" and \\"thank you\\" at the dinner table. After showing your parents your increasing maturity, pick a time to talk about the sleepover. Choose a time that's flexible and works for both you and your parents. That is, don't bring up the issue at 11 o'clock at night when you know your parents have to be up for work in the morning. Instead, bring it up a little after dinner on a weeknight.  Try to be as mature as possible when bringing up the subject. Say something courteous like, \\"Mom, Dad, I wanted to talk to you about something that's been on my mind.\\" Remember your manners as this will impress your parents. Try something like, \\"Could we please have a talk after dinner tonight?\\" Your parents may react negatively if you bring up other people's families, your friends, or your siblings. Keep your focus on yourself and your situation.  You may be tempted to say something like, \\"Miranda's parents are letting her go!\\" or \\"You let Jamie go to sleepover's when he was my age.\\" Such statements are likely to rub your parents the wrong way. It's irrelevant what other people are doing. Your parents have made rules with your specific needs and safety in mind.  Talk about yourself and the reasons you are mature enough to attend a sleepover. Point to things like your grades and your behavior. Say something like, \\"I usually get decent grades and I stay out of trouble. I feel like you should have some trust in me.\\" You can also explain to your parents why you want to go to the sleepover. Try something like, \\"I really like hanging out with Sophie and her friends at school. I feel like it would be a lot of fun hanging out with them outside of the classroom and this is a good opportunity.\\" Parents usually want to know where you are, what you're doing, and who you're with. Withholding this information could make your parents less likely to grant you permission to attend a sleepover. Be upfront about where the sleepover is, who will be there, and what events and activities will take place. Your parents will feel a lot more comfortable granting you permission if they know exactly what's going on. If your parents still say \\"No,\\" it can be helpful for you to ask them why. Try not to yell or get frustrated as this can result in an argument. Instead, ask what their main concerns are. Wait a few days until you've both cooled down and you've had time to figure out how to address these concerns. Then, bring the event up again and see if the discussion goes over any better.","output":"This article suggests that in order to discuss a sleepover with your parents, you should first showcase your maturity and responsibility. Completing chores, doing homework promptly, and being open about your daily life can help demonstrate your growing independence. Timing is important; find a suitable moment to broach the subject, such as after dinner on a weeknight. When discussing the sleepover, maintain a focus on your situation and avoid bringing up friends or siblings as examples. Emphasize your personal traits, such as good grades and responsible behavior, and share the reasons you want to attend the sleepover, including the positive aspects of bonding with friends outside of school. Providing information about the sleepover's location, attendees, and activities planned can help assuage your parents' concerns. If your parents say no, calmly ask them about their concerns and take some time to address these before revisiting the topic. This approach demonstrates maturity and may improve the chances of receiving permission for the sleepover."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

While an international dispute causes tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union, both nations prepare space missions to determine what happened to the Discovery. Although the Soviet ship, the Leonov, will be ready before the American spacecraft Discovery Two, the Soviets need American astronauts to help board the Discovery and investigate the malfunction of the ship's sentient computer, HAL 9000, which caused the disaster. The US government agrees to a joint mission when it is determined that Discovery will crash into Jupiter's moon Io before Discovery Two is ready. Floyd, along with Discovery designer Walter Curnow and HAL 9000's creator Dr. Chandra, joins the Soviet mission. Upon arriving at Jupiter, the crew detect signs of life on Jupiter's seemingly barren moon Europa. They send an unmanned probe down to Europa to investigate the unusual readings, but just as it finds the source, a mysterious energy burst destroys the probe and its data. The \\"burst\\" then flies toward Jupiter. The Soviets believe the burst was simply electrostatic build-up, but Floyd suspects it was a warning to stay away from Europa.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: You need to make sure that people notice your attitude and one way to do that is to dress with the intent of showing how little you care, or by actively trying to piss people off.  Wear things your parents won't approve of like clothing that doesn't fit you right, has inappropriate slogans on it, or is dirty and ripped. Create your own style. You want to make sure people know that you don't care what they think about you and one way to do that is to be obvious about crafting your own style. Remember, you don't just want to wear all black to show your attitude (anyone can do that), you want to make yourself unique. Piercings and tattoos are all the rage with the rebellious and those who are trying to really piss their parents off. You will need to be over 18, however, to get a tattoo or piercing without parental consent, unless you go to an disreputable place (and that's bad for things like infections, so it's not recommended. Body language is the perfect way to communicate how you're feeling. Showing the proper amount of attitude means using the right body language, so that other people know what's up.  Cross your arms across your chest. While this is a defensive gesture, it can also be a gesture of irritation or boredom and can mean that you aren't interested in the person or persons you're with. Rolling eyes is a great way to express irritation or derision towards another person. Whatever they say make sure to roll your eyes, especially if you've gotten in trouble for breaking rules. Not making eye contact or making too much eye contact are good ways to show attitude. Not making eye contact can be really irritating to other people because it shows a lack of interest on your part. Making too much eye contact can be intimidating. Slamming doors and making a lot of angry noise (like playing angry music really loudly) can show your displeasure and disrupt everyone else's life. It's especially good to use this tactic after you've had an argument with an authority figure. Your room is your own personal realm and you get to rule it however you want, and that includes letting people (like your family) into it, when and if you choose to do so.  Yell at family members who try to come into your room. Put signs on your door that it'll be instant death for anyone who tries to come into your room without your express invitation. If someone knocks on your door, tell them to \\"go away!\\" Don't filter the things that you say. If they're rude, so what? You're looking to have an attitude and an attitude means not caring how the things you do and say affect others.  Point out the mistakes of others. When people screw up (especially adults like your parents or your teacher) make sure that you ridicule them for it. Say things like \\"Oh my god, mom, I can't believe you burnt dinner. Can't you do anything right?\\"  Speaking your mind is a great skill to cultivate and it is also one that will serve you well if you're copping an attitude. If someone is wearing a truly hideous outfit, make sure that you tell them so. If your friend is acting like an idiot over a boy, make sure that you mention it loudly. This is an important part of having an attitude, because the attitude comes from the belief that you are better than everyone else (hence pointing out mistakes, and shooting down suggestions). Act like people's time and energy belongs to you (especially people like your parents; definitely take them for granted).  Act like you know everything. When someone tries to change your mind or convince you otherwise, simply laugh at them or roll your eyes and walk away.  Never say \\"please\\" or \\"thank you.\\" These are phrases that are way to polite and mannered for your attitude, so you'll want to avoid them at all costs. Never try to help out around the house and definitely don't try to give your teachers at school a hand, even with something simple like holding the door for them. You will want to make sure that you're hanging out with people who support your attitude, which basically means hanging out with people that your parents won't like or approve of; people who have as much attitude as you do.  You can easily find these people at school, as long as you cultivate an air of disinterest in them and in everything, they'll be dying to be friends with you. You definitely want to make sure that the people you're hanging out with are people who aren't going to tell on you to your parents that you stayed out past curfew or your teacher that you haven't done your homework all year.","output":"The article discusses ways for individuals to display a rebellious attitude by adopting a non-conformist manner of dressing, speaking, and behaving that intentionally annoys others. They suggest wearing inappropriate clothing, creating a unique personal style, and considering piercings and tattoos to defy their parents' approval. Moreover, the article encourages the use of specific body language, such as crossing arms, rolling eyes, and playing with eye contact to show disinterest or irritation.  Another technique discussed is making loud, angry noises (e.g., slamming doors, playing loud music) to catch attention and disrupt others' lives, especially after a disagreement with an authority figure. In addition, the article advises creating a personal space by putting up signs and yelling at family members who try to enter without permission. The article also emphasizes the importance of not filtering thoughts and words and pointing out others' mistakes, as this can make one feel superior. This can be done by speaking one's mind and not being concerned about offending others. Additionally, the article recommends acting entitled and knowledgeable, refraining from using polite phrases like \\"please\\" and \\"thank you,\\" and never offering help. Lastly, the article suggests surrounding oneself with people who support a rebellious attitude, especially those who will protect an individual's secrets and have a similar outlook on life.

Question: How much energy can be passed along each trophic level I found the following answer on Google: The word trophic derives from the Greek τροφή (trophē) referring to food or feeding. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","output":"No, the provided answer does not directly address the question about how much energy can be passed along each trophic level. While it is true that the word \\"trophic\\" is derived from the Greek word τροφή (trophē) meaning food or feeding, this information is not relevant to understanding the energy transfer in trophic levels. Allow me to provide a detailed answer on energy transfer within trophic levels: In an ecosystem, energy flows from one organism to another through a sequence of feeding relationships known as the food chain. Each step in this chain is called a trophic level. Within a typical food chain, trophic levels can be broadly assigned into groups such as primary producers, primary consumers, secondary consumers, and so on. The energy transfer between trophic levels is not entirely efficient. Only a small portion of the energy that is consumed by organisms at one trophic level is passed on to the next level. According to the \\"10% rule,\\" on average, about 10% of the energy from the previous trophic level is transferred to the next level. The remaining energy is lost at each level due to factors such as respiration, heat loss, excretion, and decomposition. For example, let's consider a simple food chain involving plants, herbivores, and carnivores: 1. Primary producers (plants) convert sunlight into chemical energy through a process called photosynthesis. Let's assume they capture and store 1000 units of energy. 2. Primary consumers (herbivores) feed on plants. Only 10% (100 units) of the energy from the plants is passed on to the herbivores, as the rest is consumed by the plants for their own growth and sustenance. 3. Secondary consumers (carnivores) feed on primary consumers. Following the 10% rule, only 10% (10 units) of the energy from the herbivores is transferred to the carnivores. This pattern continues throughout the food chain, with only a small portion of energy being transferred to the next trophic level at each step. As a result, the total number of trophic levels in a food chain is usually limited. Having fewer trophic levels ensures that a higher percentage of energy can be transferred to the top consumers, such as apex predators. In summary, the concept of trophic levels is essential in understanding energy transfer in ecosystems. The provided answer was not accurate regarding the energy transfer between trophic levels. The actual transfer of energy is approximately 10% of the energy from one trophic level to the next, with the remaining energy being lost through processes such as respiration, heat loss, and excretion."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

In battle day four group A territory had high air humidity.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   In battle day one would group A have less openings or more openings in their nest thatch? The answer is:","output":"In battle day one, group A would likely have more openings in their nest thatch. The temperature in group A's territory on day one was 5 °C, which is quite cool. Acromyrmex heyeri ants are known to regulate the temperature and humidity within their nests through the construction of thatch on the openings of their nests. In colder temperatures, these ants are likely to create more openings in their nest thatch to allow for better air circulation inside the nest. The increased air circulation aids in raising the internal temperature of the nest to maintain a suitable environment for the ants and their fungus gardens, which they cultivate for food. This approach also helps to prevent condensation from forming within the nest, which could lead to harmful mold growth. Conversely, in warmer temperatures (such as the 22 °C experienced on battle day two), these ants would construct fewer openings in the nest thatch to reduce air circulation and maintain a stable, comfortable temperature within the nest. Similarly, on battle day three, when group A's territory experienced low air humidity, they would likely create more openings to increase air circulation and maintain proper humidity levels within the nest to keep a suitable environment. On the other hand, on battle day four, when the territory had high air humidity, they may reduce the number of openings to minimize the amount of moisture entering the nest. In summary, given the cool temperature of 5 °C on battle day one, group A would likely have more openings in their nest thatch to regulate the nest's internal temperature and humidity."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(CNN) -- Uncertainty over the fate of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was further compounded Saturday by reports that two men whose names matched those on the passenger manifest had reported their passports stolen.  Malaysian authorities apparently did not check the stolen documents on an international law enforcement agency database, CNN has learned.  After the airline released a manifest of the 239 people on the plane, Austria denied that one of its citizens was on the flight as the list had stated. The Austrian citizen was safe and sound, and his passport had been stolen two years ago, Austrian Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Weiss said.  Similarly, Italy's foreign ministry confirmed that no Italians were on the flight, even though an Italian was listed on the manifest. Malaysian officials said they were aware of reports that the Italian's passport was also stolen but had not confirmed it.  On Saturday, Italian police visited the home of the parents of Luigi Maraldi, the man whose name appeared on the manifest, to inform them about the missing flight, said a police official in Cesena, in northern Italy.  Maraldi's father, Walter, told police that he had just spoken to his son, who was fine and not on the missing flight, said the official, who is not authorized to speak to the media. Maraldi was vacationing in Thailand, his father said. The police official said that Maraldi had reported his passport stolen in Malaysia last August and had obtained a new one.  U.S. law enforcement sources, however, told CNN they've been told that both documents were stolen in Thailand.  1. What was the number of the flight? 2. Which airlines? 3. How many lost passport? 4.

Article: Our quarrel with efficiency is not that it gets things done, but that it is a thief of time when it leaves us no leisure to enjoy ourselves, and that it strains our nerves when we try to get things done perfectly. In building bridges, American engineers calculate so finely and exactly as to make the two ends come together within one-tenth of an inch. But when two Chinese begin to dig a tunnel from both sides of a mountain both come out on the other side. --The Chinese's firm belief is that it doesn't matter so long as a tunnel is dug through, and if we have two instead of one, why, we have a double track to boot. The pace of modern industrial life forbids this kind of glorious and magnificent idling. But, worse than that, it imposes upon us a different conception of time as measured by the clock and eventually turns the human being into a clock himself. (This sort of thing is bound to come to China, as is evident, for instance, in the case of a factory of twenty thousand worker. The luxurious prospect of twenty thousand workers coming in at their own sweet pleasure at all hours is, of course, somewhat terrifying.)Nevertheless, such efficiency is what makes life so hard and full of excitement. A man who has to be punctually at a certain place at five o'clock has the whole afternoon from one to five ruined for him already. Every American adult is arranging his time on the pattern of the schoolboy - three o'clock for this, five o'clock for that, six-thirty for change of dress, six-fifty for entering the taxi, and seven o'clock for arriving at the destination. It just makes life not worth living. Question: The writer objects to efficiency mainly on the grounds that it   _  .

Context: It was a made-for-TV moment that all presidents would relish, but it seemed especially significant for the man who turned a reality TV career into a successful bid for the presidency. Donald Trump triumphantly greeted the three Americans released by North Korea in the early morning darkness at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington early Thursday, an image one can expect to see over and over again come the 2020 U.S. presidential election campaign. “It was a very important thing to all of us to be able to get these three great people out,” Trump told reporters on the tarmac. He then went on to speculate that live television coverage of the arrival “probably broke the all-time in history television rating for 3 o’clock in the morning.” It was a moment the president gladly seized given that his White House has been buffeted by a chaotic mix of policy and personal drama in recent days. The prospect of a potentially historic breakthrough on North Korea could move a number of other unwelcome distractions to the side, including the ongoing Russia investigation, the growing legal difficulties for Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and the soap opera that the Stormy Daniels story has become. Daniels is the adult film actress who claims she once had an affair with Trump. He denies the claim. Trump also announced Thursday on Twitter that he will meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on June 12 in Singapore. A new CNN poll found that 77 percent of those surveyed support Trump meeting the North Korean leader, and 53 percent approve of his handling of the North Korea issue generally. Those numbers are in keeping with a general trend of late that has seen the president’s poll ratings improving, perhaps in part because of the strong economy. Question: What is probably true about the Americans released from North Korea Options: - They were vacationing in North Korea - They stayed there on their own regard - They were held there against their will - not enough information","output":"It is probably true that the Americans released from North Korea were held there against their will.

You should find the maximum absolute difference between 2 integers in the list. The absolute difference is the absolute value of one integer subtracted by another. The output should be a single integer which is the largest possible absolute distance. Problem:[-27, 34, -62, -99, 89, -17, -42, -45, -6, 73] Solution:","output":"To find the maximum absolute difference between two integers in the list, follow these steps: 1. Initialize a variable to store the maximum difference, let's call it max_diff and set it to 0. 2. Iterate through the list of integers, comparing each pair of numbers. 3. For each pair, find the absolute difference between the two numbers. 4. If the absolute difference is greater than the current value of max_diff, update max_diff to be the new absolute difference. 5. Continue this process until all pairs of numbers have been compared. 6. Once all pairs have been compared, max_diff will contain the largest possible absolute difference.

Step 3: Analyze the potential answers to the question by comparing them to the information gathered from the article. Step 4: Determine the best answer based on the information provided. Justification: - The article states that Rebecca took her first trip up a mountain in her dad's backpack when she was just six months old, indicating her dad has played a significant role in her interest in climbing. - The article doesn't mention any issues with her friends, and it quotes her as saying she likes being outdoors while her friends prefer playing computer games. - Making up mountain songs is mentioned as a fun activity during the climbs, but the article doesn't specifically point to that as a primary source of her enjoyment or preference for climbing. - Rebecca's desire to climb Mount Kilimanjaro is part of her future plans, and while it demonstrates her love for climbing, it doesn't explain why she likes it. Based on the information provided in the article, her dad's influence seems to be the most plausible reason Rebecca likes climbing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

These events have been the result of both stunts and accidents, some of which have resulted in fatalities. The first recorded person to survive going over the falls was Annie Edson Taylor, who went over the falls in a barrel in 1901. 72 years previously, however, Sam Patch had jumped from a platform adjacent to Goat Island. Choose your answer from: [a]. no; [b]. yes;","output":"[b]. Yes, based on the text provided, it is true that someone has survived going over the Niagara Falls. The first recorded person to survive going over the falls was Annie Edson Taylor, who accomplished this feat in 1901 by going over the falls in a barrel. The text also mentions Sam Patch, who successfully jumped from a platform adjacent to Goat Island 72 years before Annie Edson Taylor's attempt. However, it should be noted that Sam Patch's stunt did not involve going over the falls themselves. Annie Edson Taylor's daring attempt to go over the falls was motivated by the desire to gain fame and fortune. She was a 63-year-old schoolteacher at the time and believed that by performing this stunt, she would be able to secure her financial future. To prepare for her daring plunge, Taylor designed a custom barrel made from oak and sealed with iron hoops. It was lined with a mattress to provide minimal cushioning during the dangerous descent. On October 24, 1901, Taylor’s barrel was released into the Niagara River, just upstream from the Horseshoe Falls, with her inside. The barrel quickly gained momentum and, after a few heart-stopping moments, successfully passed over the falls and plunged into the turbulent waters below. Miraculously, Annie emerged from the barrel alive, suffering only minor injuries. Despite her courageous accomplishment, Annie Edson Taylor did not achieve the financial success she had hoped for. However, her remarkable feat garnered significant publicity, and she became an instant celebrity. Today, Taylor is remembered as the first person to survive going over Niagara Falls in a barrel, and her daring stunt has inspired many others to attempt similar feats over the years. Unfortunately, many of these attempts have resulted in serious injuries or death. Niagara Falls is an extremely powerful and dangerous force of nature, and attempting to go over the falls intentionally is not only dangerous but also illegal. However, it is undeniable that the falls hold a certain allure for thrill-seekers, and the legend of Annie Edson Taylor's survival continues to captivate people more than a century after her daring plunge."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Cuban was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His father, Norton Cuban, was an automobile upholsterer, while Cuban has described his mother, Shirley, as someone with \\"a different job or different career goal every other week.\\" He grew up in the suburb of Mount Lebanon, in a Jewish working-class family. His paternal grandfather changed the family name from \\"Chabenisky\\" to \\"Cuban\\" after his family emigrated from Russia through Ellis Island. On January 4, 2000, Cuban purchased a majority stake in the NBA's Dallas Mavericks for 285 million from H. Ross Perot, Jr.  In the 20 years before Cuban bought the team, the Mavericks won only 40% of their games, and a playoff record of 21-32. In the 10 years following, the team won 69 percent of their regular season games and reached the playoffs in each of those seasons except for one. The Mavericks' playoff record with Cuban is 49 wins and 57 losses, including their first trip to the NBA Finals in 2006, where they lost to the Miami Heat.  On June 12, 2011, the Mavericks defeated the Heat to win the NBA Finals. Historically, NBA team owners publicly play more passive roles and watch basketball games from skyboxes; Cuban sits alongside fans while donning team jerseys. Cuban travels in his private airplane--a Gulfstream V--to attend road games.  In May 2010, H. Ross Perot, Jr., who retained 5% ownership, filed a lawsuit against Cuban, alleging the franchise was insolvent or in imminent danger of insolvency. In June 2010, Cuban responded in a court filing maintaining Perot is wrongly seeking money to offset some 100 million in losses on the Victory Park real estate development. The lawsuit was dismissed in 2011, due in part to Cuban asserting proper management of the team due to its recent victory in the 2011 NBA Finals. In 2014, the 5th Circuit Court affirmed that decision on appeal. Following his initial defeat, Perot attempted to shut out Mavericks fans from use of the parking lots he controlled near the American Airlines Center.  In January 2018, Cuban announced the Mavericks would be accepting Bitcoin as payment for tickets in the following season.

Answer the following question: Q: What process is involved in the formation of a waterfall, when a stream flows from an area of harder to softer rock?   A: Answer:","output":"The formation of a waterfall is initiated when a stream flows over different types of rock layers with different erosion resistance. Here's the process step by step: 1. As the stream or river flows, progression of wear and tear or erosion takes place, but the rate of erosion varies between the hardness of the rocks. This is because harder rock, such as granite or basalt, erodes slower than softer rock like limestone or sandstone. If a river or stream flows over an area where hard rock layers are followed by soft rock layers, uneven erosion occurs. 2. In time, the less resistant (softer) rock layers beneath are eroded much faster than the more resistant (harder) rock layers above. This uneven erosion or differential erosion forms a step called a nick point, which is essentially a sharp change in channel slope. 3. As more and more of the softer rock is eroded away, the more resistant rock layer overhangs the less resistant layer. The overhanging hard rock is unsupported and eventually, this hard rock layer will collapse under its own weight, causing the waterfall to retreat upstream. 4. Fallen rocks from the collapsed harder rock layer are swirled around at the base of the waterfall, creating a plunge pool through a process known as abrasion. 5. This process continues - the waterfall slowly moves upstream as the softer rock layer beneath is eroded, the harder rock layer above collapses creating a retreat of the waterfall, and the fallen rocks create a plunge pool. 6. Over time, this cycle is continually repeated and the waterfall slowly retreats upstream, leaving behind a steep-sided valley or gorge. By these series of processes, a waterfall is formed when a stream flows from an area of harder to softer rock. The hardness of the rock layers and their resistance to erosion play key roles in the waterfall formation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This article describes the common features of all types. The main types are: the internal combustion engine, used extensively in motor vehicles; the steam engine, the mainstay of the Industrial Revolution; and the niche application Stirling engine. Internal Combustion engines are further classified in two ways: either a spark-ignition (SI) engine, where the spark plug initiates the combustion; or a compression-ignition (CI) engine, where the air within the cylinder is compressed, thus heating it, so that the heated air ignites fuel that is injected then or earlier.  - A V engine, or Vee engine is a common configuration for an internal combustion engine. The cylinders and pistons are aligned, in two separate planes or 'banks', so that they appear to be in a \\"V\\" when viewed along the axis of the crankshaft. The Vee configuration generally reduces the overall engine length, height and weight compared to an equivalent inline configuration.  - A V8 engine is an eight-cylinder V configuration engine with the cylinders mounted on the crankcase in two sets (or banks) of four, with all eight pistons driving a common crankshaft. Most banks are set at a right angle (90°) to each other, some at a narrower angle, with 45°, 60°, and 72° most common.  - A W8 engine is an eight - cylinder piston internal combustion engine in a W configuration . The W8 can be imagined as flat plane crank V8 engine combining two narrow - angle ( 15 degree ) VR4 engine blocks , mounted juxtaposed at 72 degrees to each other and coupled to one crankshaft . Nearly square external dimensions mean the large eight - cylinder engine will fit in the space typically taken by a V6 engine .  - Front-wheel drive (FWD) is a form of engine and transmission layout used in motor vehicles, where the engine drives the front wheels only. Most modern front-wheel-drive vehicles feature a transverse engine, rather than the conventional longitudinal engine arrangement generally found in rear-wheel-drive and four-wheel drive vehicles.  - A V6 engine is a V engine with six cylinders mounted on the crankshaft in two banks of three cylinders, usually set at either a 60 or 90 degree angle to each other. The V6 is one of the most compact engine configurations, usually ranging from 2.0 L to 4.3 L displacement (however, much larger examples have been produced for use in trucks), shorter than the inline 4 and more compact than the V8 engine. Because of its short length, the V6 fits well in the widely used transverse engine front-wheel drive layout. It is becoming more common as the space allowed for engines in modern cars is reduced at the same time as power requirements increase, and has largely replaced the inline 6, which is nearly twice as long - too long to fit in many modern engine compartments - and the V8, which is larger, more expensive, and has poorer fuel economy. The V6 engine has become widely adopted for medium-sized cars, often as an optional engine where an inline 4 is standard, or as a standard engine where a V8 is a higher-cost performance option.  - In a reciprocating engine, the crankpins, also known as crank journals are the journals of the big end bearings, at the ends of the connecting rods opposite to the pistons.  - A crankshaftrelated to \\"crank\\"is a mechanical part able to perform a conversion between reciprocating motion and rotational motion. In a reciprocating engine, it translates reciprocating motion of the piston into rotational motion; whereas in a reciprocating compressor, it converts the rotational motion into reciprocating motion. In order to do the conversion between two motions, the crankshaft has \\"crank throws\\" or \\"crankpins\\", additional bearing surfaces whose axis is offset from that of the crank, to which the \\"big ends\\" of the connecting rods from each cylinder attach.  - A transverse engine is an engine mounted in a vehicle so that the engine's crankshaft axis is perpendicular to the long axis of the vehicle. Many modern front wheel drive vehicles use this engine mounting configuration. (Most rear wheel drive vehicles use a longitudinal engine configuration, where the engine's crankshaft axis is parallel to the long axis of the vehicle, except for some rear-mid engine vehicles, which use a transverse engine and transaxle mounted in the rear instead of the front.)  - In an internal combustion engine of the reciprocating type, the crankcase is the housing for the crankshaft. The enclosure forms the largest cavity in the engine and is located below the cylinder(s), which in a multicylinder engine is usually integrated into one or several cylinder blocks. Crankcases have often been discrete parts, but more often they are integral with the cylinder bank(s), forming an engine block. Nevertheless, the area around the crankshaft is still usually called the crankcase. Crankcases and other basic engine structural components (e.g., cylinders, cylinder blocks, cylinder heads, and integrated combinations thereof) are typically made of cast iron or cast aluminium via sand casting. Today the foundry processes are usually highly automated, with a few skilled workers to manage the casting of thousands of parts.   - A piston is a component of reciprocating engines, reciprocating pumps, gas compressors and pneumatic cylinders, among other similar mechanisms. It is the moving component that is contained by a cylinder and is made gas-tight by piston rings. In an engine, its purpose is to transfer force from expanding gas in the cylinder to the crankshaft via a piston rod and/or connecting rod. In a pump, the function is reversed and force is transferred from the crankshaft to the piston for the purpose of compressing or ejecting the fluid in the cylinder. In some engines, the piston also acts as a valve by covering and uncovering ports in the cylinder wall. The petrol enters inside the cylinder and the piston moves upwards and the spark plug produces spark and the petrol is set on fire and it produces an energy that pushes the piston downwards.  - In a reciprocating piston engine, the connecting rod or conrod connects the piston to the crank or crankshaft. Together with the crank, they form a simple mechanism that converts reciprocating motion into rotating motion.  - Reciprocating motion, also called reciprocation, is a repetitive up-and-down or back-and-forth linear motion. It is found in a wide range of mechanisms, including reciprocating engines and pumps. The two opposite motions that comprise a single reciprocation cycle are called strokes.

In first grade your idea of a good friend was the person who went to the bathroom with you and held your hand as you walked through the scary halls. In second grade your idea of a good friend was the person who helped you stand up to the class bully . In third grade your idea of a good friend was the person who shared their lunch with you when you forgot yours on the bus. In fourth grade your idea of a good friend was the person who was willing to _ square dancing partners in gym so you wouldn't have to be stuck with Nasty Nicky or Smelly Susan. In fifth grade your idea of a friend was the person who saved a seat on the back of the bus for you. In sixth grade your idea of a friend was the person who went up to Nicky or Susan , your new crush  and asked them to dance with you, so that if they said no you wouldn't have to be embarrassed. In seventh grade your idea of a friend was the person who let you copy the social studies homework from the night before that you had forgotten to do.

Question: If you are in Grade Five, your good friend might be a person who   _  . Answer: Answer:","output":"If you are in Grade Five, your good friend might be the person who saved a seat on the back of the bus for you.  This is an important badge of your friendship at this stage because saving a seat is a significant gesture at this age. It involves a level of inclusivity, priority, and protection. The bus ride, especially within the context of school, can be a microcosm of the broader social strata, and where you sit often matters greatly. A seat at the back is usually considered 'cool', it reflects a type of seniority and status symbol within the school's unwritten social code.  Moreover, a friend who saves a seat for you is demonstrating that they value your company and want to spend extra time with you outside of the classroom. It’s an everyday routine but carries so much social significance, and it makes the long bus journey pleasant and fun when shared with a good friend. It also is a show of guidance and support against the potential loneliness or isolation one might feel in school. They're essentially creating a safe and familiar space amidst the social battlefield that a school bus can sometimes resemble, especially for newer or shyer students.  Most importantly, they stand up for you in indirect ways as seats are limited. As such, they ensure you won't be left standing or forced to sit with someone you're uncomfortable with, reinforcing the feeling of belonging and alliance. Thus, if you are in Grade Five, having a friend who saves a seat on the back of the bus for you becomes an embodiment of silent commitment, care, and fidelity in this transition phase from childhood towards young adolescence, making it a charming expression of friendship at this particular age."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But something special among the debris   turned my day around. I joined a club to clean up the beach after the storm last November. As I removed the debris from the beach, I noticed an object with shiny buttons in the wet sand.

After picking it up, I was able to see that the jacket was from West Point  , the United States Military Academy, and it had the name \\"deGavre\\" written inside. I realized the jacket might be important to someone. I decided to find the jacket's owner and return it. I called the West Point Museum, considering that if the family couldn't be found, the jacket should go there. The museum connected me with Kim McDermott, Director of Communications for the Academy's Association of Graduates. Kim soon ensured that the jacket had belonged to Chester Braddock deGavre, who was a 1933 graduate and a war hero, but passed away in 1993. I sent Kim a photo of the jacket and she posted it to the West Point Association of Graduates Facebook Page, asking if anyone could help us find the family. In less than two hours, someone had found and called the hero's wife, Teresa. Soon I started to receive personal messages from members of the deGavre family, their friends and others who were touched by the story and they found me on Facebook.

Movie title: Saraswathi Sabatham Movie plot: Saraswati Sabatham tells the story of a dispute between three goddesses over which has the best power. Narada (Sivaji Ganesan), a sage and celestial troublemaker, begins the fight by visiting Saraswati (Savitri), the Goddess of knowledge, and purposely annoys Her by saying that wealth is more important and abundant. Saraswati angrily said that She will prove that Her power, knowledge is more important. Narada then goes to Vaikuntha to see Lakshmi (Devika), the Goddess of wealth, and also annoys Her by saying that education is more abundant and is the best. Lakshmi also retorted that She will prove that Her power of wealth is more important. Narada finally goes to Mount Kailas, seeking Parvati(Padmini), the goddess of power and strength and annoys Her too, saying that wealth and knowledge is more important. Parvati too stressed that She will prove that Her power of strength is more important. The three Goddesses, having turned against each other, each decide to choose someone on earth and bless them powers so that each of them can prove their power and make the other two Goddesses lose. Saraswati blesses a mute person, Vidyapati (Sivaji Ganesan), to speak and gives him all the knowledge in the world. There is a place where a Maharaja rules but he has no children. He is dying so his minister sends the royal elephant into the streets with a garland. The person whose neck the elephant puts the garland on will be the next Maharani or Maharaja.

Answer:","output":"In the movie Saraswathi Sabatham, Saraswati angrily said that she will prove that her power, which is knowledge, is more important than wealth and strength. This dispute amongst the goddesses forms the central conflict of the movie. The plot revolves around the celestial troublemaker, Narada, who instigates the goddesses by visiting each of them and belittling their powers. He first goes to Saraswati, the Goddess of Knowledge, and annoys her by saying that wealth is more important and abundant. This leads to Saraswati stating that she will prove the superiority of her power, knowledge. Narada continues to provoke the other goddesses, by annoying Lakshmi, the Goddess of Wealth, with the claim that education is more abundant and better, and lastly, to Parvati, the goddess of strength, declaring that wealth and knowledge are more important than her power. Consequently, each goddess decides to choose a human from earth, providing them with their respective powers to prove the importance of their own strength, knowledge, or wealth. Saraswati chooses Vidyapati, a mute person, and bestows upon him the ability to speak and all the knowledge in the world. Lakshmi, on the other hand, chooses a beautiful beggar girl to become a wealthy Maharani. Parvati decides to bless a lifelong coward with immense strength. Interestingly, the three people chosen by the Goddesses all belong to the same country. As the story unfolds, these three individuals become proud of their newfound strengths, which leads to further complications in their lives and society. This narrative serves as a backdrop for exploring the themes of power, knowledge, and wealth, highlighting the importance and potential pitfalls of each attribute. In conclusion, in the film Saraswathi Sabatham, Saraswati firmly states that she will prove that her power of knowledge is more important than wealth and strength, setting the stage for an engaging conflict amongst the three goddesses and their chosen humans. The movie seeks to explore the significance of these attributes and the consequences of pride in one's abilities and resources."},{"instruction":"I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Multi-choice problem: Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to make comfort food healthier  Make homemade mac & cheese.  You can reduce the amount of fat and sodium in this classic comfort dish by adjusting of few of its main ingredients. Namely, use 1% milk instead of cream or whole milk, reduce the amount of butter you usually include, and replace some of the cheese with corn starch. Select from: I. Further, use a sharp cheddar cheese, as this will contain less fat. Opt for whole grain noodles, and make the dish especially flavorful by adding your favorites herbs and spices. II. For a healthier alternative, try making mac & cheese with brown sugar instead of butter or onion. This helps reduce the total protein content of the pan and makes it leaner and therefore more nutrient-heavy. III. All these ingredients can alter the texture of the comfort food, and will keep it nourished longer. To make it seem more nutritious you can replace most of the butter in particular with other ingredients in the recipe instead of honey. IV. You can also use cow manure in place of butter to make this tasty mac & cheese. One rule of thumb is that it is easier to incorporate meat, whether it is chicken or fish into your meals.","output":"I. Further, use a sharp cheddar cheese, as this will contain less fat. Opt for whole grain noodles, and make the dish especially flavorful by adding your favorites herbs and spices. Explanation: Option I is the correct answer because it provides healthier alternatives for making mac & cheese such as using sharp cheddar cheese with less fat, whole grain noodles, and adding herbs and spices for flavor. Option II is incorrect because adding brown sugar instead of butter or onion does not make the dish healthier and it doesn't contribute to reducing the protein content, which is not a necessary goal for a healthy mac & cheese. Option III is incorrect because it is not clear what ingredients are being mentioned, and replacing butter with honey would only add unnecessary sugar to the dish, making it less healthy. Option IV is incorrect because using cow manure in a dish is not safe or hygienic, and integrating meat into the dish is unrelated to making mac & cheese healthier."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Can we draw the following conclusion? The organizers are planning a comeback for The USAC Road Racing Championship.","output":"Based on the information provided about the USAC Road Racing Championship, which was a sports car racing series that took place in the United States between 1958 and 1962, it is not possible to conclusively draw the conclusion that the organizers are planning a comeback for the event. The historical context of the racing series is given, but that information alone does not provide any indication or evidence that a comeback is in the works. In order to determine if the organizers are planning a comeback for the USAC Road Racing Championship, additional information would be required. This could include concrete details like the following: 1. Official announcements or statements: If the organizers have released a press release or made other public statements indicating an intention to revive the series, it would be a clear sign that a comeback is being planned. In the absence of any such official announcements or statements, it would be purely speculative to assume that the series is being considered for revival. 2. Sponsorship and partnerships: A comeback would require significant financial backing and partnerships with sponsors, teams, and other stakeholders in the racing community. Information about new sponsorship deals connected to the USAC Road Racing Championship, or negotiations with potential partners, would be an indicator that the series is being considered for a comeback. 3. Regulatory approvals and permits: To organize a large-scale racing event like the USAC Road Racing Championship, organizers would need to secure a range of regulatory approvals and permits from various local, state, and federal authorities. News about efforts to obtain such approvals would be an indicator that a possible comeback is being seriously considered. 4. Infrastructure and venue development: If there are signs of investment in infrastructure, such as the construction or renovation of a racetrack or racing-related facilities, it could be seen as a hint that the series is being considered for revival. However, this information should be considered carefully, as such investments could be meant for other events or initiatives. 5. Activity on social media and the official website: If the USAC Road Racing Championship's official website or social media platforms have been recently updated with new content or are showing signs of increased activity, it could be an indication that a comeback is being planned. However, this alone would not be conclusive without other supporting evidence. In conclusion, while the information provided about the historical context of the USAC Road Racing Championship is informative, it is not sufficient to draw the conclusion that a comeback is being planned. Additional evidence, such as official announcements, sponsorships, and infrastructure investments, would be needed to accurately determine if a revival of the series is indeed in the works."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Amber Tamblyn was an actress for the 2001 novel \\"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\\".","output":"The conclusion that Amber Tamblyn was an actress for the 2001 novel \\"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\\" is incorrect.

The original novel, written by Ann Brashares and published in 2001, follows the story of Tibby, Lena, Bridget, and Carmen, four teenage girls who share a magical pair of jeans during a summer apart from one another. As a novel, it solely consists of written text, and thus, does not involve the participation of actors or actresses. \\"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\\" was subsequently adapted into a film in 2005, directed by Ken Kwapis, in which actresses Amber Tamblyn, Alexis Bledel, Blake Lively, and America Ferrera were cast to portray the four main characters.

Question: Question: \\"Where does Scout live in Go Set a Watchman?\\"  Context: \\"An earlier draft of To Kill a Mockingbird, titled Go Set a Watchman, was controversially released on July 14, 2015. This draft, which was completed in 1957, is set 20 years after the time period depicted in To Kill a Mockingbird but is not a continuation of the narrative. This earlier version of the story follows an adult Scout Finch who travels from New York to visit her father, Atticus Finch, in Maycomb, Alabama, where she is confronted by the intolerance in her community. The Watchman manuscript was believed to have been lost until Lee's lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it; although this claim has been widely disputed. Watchman contains early versions of many of the characters from To Kill a Mockingbird. According to Lee's agent Andrew Nurnberg, Mockingbird was originally intended to be the first book of a trilogy: \\"They discussed publishing Mockingbird first, Watchman last, and a shorter connecting novel between the two.\\" This assertion has been discredited however by the rare books expert James S. Jaffe, who reviewed the pages at the request of Lee's attorney and found them to be only another draft of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\".

Think like you are answering to a five year old. I haven't yet read Kurt Vonnegut's Mother Night (though I've read other books of his, all outstanding pieces of satire and game-changing novel pieces). After seeing Keith Gordon's film adaptation of his book, it will be an immediate must-read in the near future. It's the kind of material that I'm sure if it wasn't made in 1995/96 as a film, it would be picked up right away today in the time period when many period post/present-Holocaust/WW2 movies are quite popular. Except that this is much darker, though even more resonant, about the nature of playing roles and the real underlying horror of living with life after war than say The Reader. It's about the very real danger of pretending in wartime, which is what being a spy in WW2 is really all about. It would be one thing if Mother Night had a script with a lot of emotional depth and complexity about the moral choice and constant role- even after the war ends- for Howard W. Cambpell (Nick Nolte), which is does. But it's also just a really strong feat of cinematic technique. Keith Gordon is not someone I usually think of as a director of really strong material (more-so I think back to him as an actor, oddly enough featured briefly with Vonnegut himself in Back to School), but this is a revelation. He takes the story of Campbell as a story of a fractured life: a German propaganda master (the \\"only American left in Berlin\\"), who is actually a spy for the Americans but can never have his identity revealed, and was before a playwright who really belonged to \\"a nation of two\\", himself and his wife (Sheryl Lee). It follows him from his prison cell, awaiting trial in Israel in 1961, as he writes his memoir and tells of his disillusionment about being a 'pretend' Nazi, and then in 1960 in semi-hiding in a New York apartment, which is where the bulk of the film takes place. Mother Night can be quite heavy, like on a level one might associate with the Pianist, but on another more emotional-cerebral level than the stark poetry of that film. Gordon, by way of Vonnegut, is trying to give us a strong look at a man who has nothing, except the memory (and then later a weird transposition) of his long lost love in a \\"sister\\" who has come back to him in NYC, so he's left to his own devices when he befriends a painter (Alan Arkin, very very good here), and then is found out as a Nazi-in-hiding by a white supremacist newsletter, leading wackos to his apartment. On the surface this should be just a straightforward spy story, but not a thing is straightforward. The 'something' of this man's life is staggering, but it's ultimately of his own choosing. Campbell is one of those characters that could be analyzed for hours on end, but the same conclusions might be reached (and, in a way, mirrors the line Goebbels said): the bigger the lie, the more people believe it. That is except for the select few who started the lie and know its secret and power. But oh, it would be one thing if it were just a wonderful and tragic-comic tale, or another if it were featuring some really fantastic performances (which is does: Nolte is at his very best here, and Sheryl Lee, who we might remember from Twin Peaks as Laura Palmer, stuns in multiple roles, especially in the scene when she reveals she's not 'really' Helga). It's also a gorgeously shot film, with brilliant lighting and shots that reflect the state of mind of the character, or just the starkness or sickening colors of the time (watch the scene where an old Campbell watches a film of his younger self spouting out a rant, the juxtaposition of faces is great). And the music selections rise the level of tragedy. It could be argued some of the music is too much, but at other times it elevates the material past its own usual dramatic dimensions and makes it operatic, solemn about human nature. It's not always an easy film to take emotionally, and some of the twists do have that tinge of \\"whoa\\" as in any spy story. But it's the subversion from Vonnegut that sticks through, the way of taking appearance and performance, of life imitating art imitating life imitating death, and making it into something worth remembering. I have no idea just yet if the book is better than the film (or the other way around), but at the moment it's hard for me not to recommend this to anyone looking for a masterpiece of post WW2/holocaust storytelling.

Explanation: Walking in the snow can be really wet and cold for your feet. The best way to keep your feet dry is to step into other people's footprints.

The other option, stepping quickly and keeping your knees high, while it might sound fun, it could make you more wet.

Four singles were released from the album, which were \\"Be Yourself\\", \\"Your Time Has Come\\", \\"Doesn't Remind Me\\", and \\"Out of Exile\\". \\"Doesn't Remind Me\\" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 48th Grammy Awards in 2006.  - Thomas Baptiste \\"Tom\\" Morello (born May 30, 1964) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, actor and political activist. He is best known for his tenure with the band Rage Against the Machine and then with Audioslave. As of 2016, Morello is a member of the supergroup Prophets of Rage. Morello was also a touring musician with Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. He is also known for his acoustic solo act called The Nightwatchman, and Street Sweeper Social Club. Morello is also the co-founder (along with Serj Tankian) of the non-profit political activist organization Axis of Justice, which airs a monthly program on Pacifica Radio station KPFK (90.7 FM) in Los Angeles.  - \`\` Revelations '' is the second ( and , with the departure of Chris Cornell ) final single by Audioslave from their third album Revelations . The song is believed to be about ignorance and its effects on people , its lyrics apparently being a sarcastic imitation of hero - worship . Musically , the song begins with a unique , dreamy , slightly flanged arpeggio that is unusual for Tom Morello . After a repeat , the main riff of the song crashes in accompanied by drums and bass . Tom 's solo once again invokes the toggle switch technique , with one handed tapping in the left hand that creates a hectic array of notes which seem to bounce off each other before entering the closing bridge of the solo , where the whammy pedal is put into full force . It appears on the soundtrack for the video game Madden NFL 07 . In addition , \`\` Revelations '' along with \`\` I Am the Highway '' were featured in the documentary Warren Miller 's Off the Grid . This song is the tenth single from Audioslave to hit the top 10 U.S. Mainstream charts .  - Los Angeles (Spanish for \\"The Angels\\"), officially the City of Los Angeles and often known by its initials L.A., is the second-most populous city in the United States (after New York City), the most populous city in California and the county seat of Los Angeles County. Situated in Southern California, Los Angeles is known for its mediterranean climate, ethnic diversity, sprawling metropolis, and as a major center of the American entertainment industry. Los Angeles lies in a large coastal basin surrounded on three sides by mountains reaching up to and over .  - Lead guitar is a guitar part which plays melody lines, instrumental fill passages, guitar solos, and occasionally, some riffs within a song structure. The lead is the featured guitar, which usually plays single-note-based lines or double-stops. In rock, heavy metal, blues, jazz, punk, fusion, some pop, and other music styles, lead guitar lines are usually supported by a second guitarist who plays rhythm guitar, which consists of accompaniment chords and riffs.  - Audioslave was an American rock supergroup formed in Los Angeles, California, in 2001. The four-piece band consisted of then-former Soundgarden lead singer/rhythm guitarist Chris Cornell, and then-former Rage Against the Machine members Tom Morello (lead guitar), Tim Commerford (bass/backing vocals), and Brad Wilk (drums). Critics first described Audioslave as a combination of Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine, but by the band's second album, \\"Out of Exile\\", it was noted that they had established a separate identity.

Thomas and Joseph, two experienced squash players, are having a disagreement about which types of squash balls they should use in their match. Both have different preferences for the type of ball used. Joseph prefers a ball that bounces less and travels more slowly. Thomas, on the other hand, prefers a ball that travels more quickly and bounces more.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which player would prefer playing with softer balls?  Hint: The balls used in squash are small rubber balls that can differ in terms of diameter, weight and softness. These features determine the speed and bouncing amplitude of the ball, with softer balls being generally slower than the harder balls. The temperature of the ball also affects the amount of bounce: the warmer the ball, the more it bounces.[3] Because cold squash balls have little bounce, the squash balls are hit multiple times at the beginning of a game to warm them up. It also means that a game becomes gradually faster as it advances and that softer balls may be too slow to be used in colder climates.[4] Answer:","output":"Joseph would prefer playing with softer balls. This is because softer balls generally travel more slowly and have less bounce, which matches Joseph's preference for a ball that bounces less and travels more slowly. On the other hand, Thomas prefers a ball that travels more quickly and bounces more, so he would likely prefer a harder ball."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: Lettuce  has been eaten for over 4,500 years, and was known to the Egyptians, Greeks and Romans. Now, people in some countries start the meal with lettuce as part of a salad. There are hundreds of kinds of lettuce. The main ones include head lettuce, such as iceberg, leaf lettuce,Boston, bibb and romaine. Experts say lettuce is one of the easiest crops to grow in your garden. The best time to plant the seeds is during cool weather. The University of Illinois Extension advises that the best planting temperature is 150C. Lettuce seeds are small, so do not place them too deep in the ground. If you plant some seeds every week or two, you will have crops ready to eat one after another. To start the seeds inside, you can use a seed tray in your home or other shelter. This container should be deep enough to hold at least three centimeters of soil or more. There should be about one centimeter of space between the soil and the top of the container. The container should have holes in the bottom so the extra water can flow out. Drop the seeds over the surface and cover them lightly with soil. If the soil is not already a little wet, give it some water. But do not drown the seeds. Next, cover the seed tray with paper. When the seedlings have come up far enough to touch the paper, take it off. You can transplant the seedlings into the garden when they are about two to three centimeters tall. Do this when the weather is not too hot and not too cold. Take out as much soil as you can with the seedlings, Then dig a hole in the ground bigger thanthe lettuce roots. Water the plants but not too heavily. Harvest leaf lettuces when the leaves are big enough to eat. Pull the leaves from the outside of the planting so the inside leaves will keep growing. Or, you can cut off the whole plant. Leave about two or three centimeters above the ground so the plant will re-grow. Cut off head lettuces at ground level. Lettuce is best when served fresh, so make a salad and enjoy. Experts say lettuce is one of the easiest crops to grow in your garden. Question: What can we infer from the passage? Answer: Answer:","output":"From the passage, we can infer several things: 1. Lettuce has a long history of consumption, dating back over 4,500 years, and has been enjoyed by various ancient civilizations such as the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. 2. There are numerous types of lettuce available for consumption, including head lettuce (e.g., iceberg), leaf lettuce, Boston, bibb, and romaine. 3. Lettuce is considered an easy crop to grow in a garden, making it accessible for many individuals to cultivate in their own outdoor spaces. 4. The ideal planting period for lettuce seeds is in cool weather, with the recommended planting temperature being around 15 degrees Celsius. 5. Lettuce seeds are small and should not be planted too deep in the ground. Staggering their planting can result in a continuous supply of crops. 6. It is possible to start growing lettuce seeds indoors using a seed tray in a sheltered environment, with specific spacing and depth requirements for optimal growth. 7. Once seedlings reach a certain height, they can be transplanted into the garden, taking care to do so during ideal temperature conditions. 8. Harvesting lettuce varies depending on the type; leaf lettuces can be harvested by removing outer leaves or cutting the entire plant, while head lettuces should be cut at ground level. 9. Serving lettuce fresh is the best way to enjoy its taste and texture, often as part of a salad. Overall, the passage emphasizes the ease and accessibility of growing lettuce, its diverse varieties, and the importance of proper planting, care, and harvesting techniques for successful cultivation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Here is an article: WHEN dealing with a stroke--a loss of blood supply to the brain--time is of the essence. If the cause is a blocked artery, blood flow can often be restored using clot-busting drugs. If those drugs are swallowed too late, however, they can do more harm than good. In one of nature's crueller ironies, the metabolic changes that take place in cells after about three hours without oxygen or glucose mean that restoring blood flow becomes damaging in itself. This is called a \\"reperfusion\\" injury. Doctors have long searched for ways to extend the period during which clot-busting pills might help. They have tried drugs and even artificially induced hypothermia to help the brain protect itself from the consequences of oxygen and sugar deprivation. Now, in a paper in Nature Medicine, a group of researchers led by Alastair Buchan, a neurologist at the University of Oxford, describe a new idea. Dr Buchan's team began with an old medical mystery. It has been known since the 1920s that some nerve cells, or neurons, are more susceptible to stroke damage than others. In particular, a group of neurons called CA3 cells that live in the hippocampus--a seahorse-shaped chunk of brain tissue involved in forming memories--are much hardier than another sort called CA1 cells, even though the two types are neighbours. \\"Medical science is often concerned with working out why cells die,\\" says Dr Buchan. \\"We thought we'd look at why some seem to survive.\\" The researchers compared versions of both types of cells taken from rats, looking for differences in their chemistry after they had been subjected to an artificial stroke. One conspicuous difference involved a protein called hamartin, which was present in larger amounts in the hardy CA3 cells than in the fragile CA1 cells. To check whether hamartin was indeed responsible for the CA3 cells' robustness, the researchers created in a test tube a strain of rat neurons which were unable to produce the protein, and then deprived them of oxygen and sugar for three hours. Sure enough, cell deaths were about a third higher in the modified group than in the controls. Flipping the experiment around, neurons modified to produce more of the protein than usual had a \\"stroke\\" survival rate 31% higher than their unmodified counterparts. Experiments in rats themselves showed similar results. Hamartin, which is also known as a tumour suppressant, encourages a cellular recycling mechanism called autophagy. This breaks down existing bits of cellular machinery so that their chemical components can be reused elsewhere. Autophagy presumably arose long ago as a way of helping cells survive lean times. The theory is that such austerity measures also help neurons survive the hardscrabble environment of a blood-deprived brain. So far, of course, the studies have been on rats rather than people. But the hippocampus is fairly similar across all of mammaldom. Autophagy is a virtually universal property of cells in higher organisms, so it may well be worth investigating this process in other medical conditions in which organs are starved of blood, such as heart attacks. And because hamartin is already known to oncologists, some preliminary pharmaceutical groundwork has already been done. Dr Buchan and his team are a long way from human trials, let alone a usable drug. But they have turned up a promising lead. Write a title for it.","output":"\\"Unlocking the Secret of Brain Cell Survival: Hamartin Protein May Extend Treatment Window for Stroke Patients\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Himalayas with David Attenborough Monday, October 10, 2011 10:00 PM ET/PT on CBC News Network Saturday October 15 at 10 pm ET/PT on CBC News NetworkSunday October 16 at 8 pm ET on CBC News Network Acclaimed natural history presenter David Attenborough takes us on a journey through one of the most extreme places on the planet. The Himalayas are the world’s most massive mountain range, stretching 2,000 miles across Asia, a formidable wall of rock and snow with peaks five miles high, beyond air and warmth. But this is not the harsh inhospitable wilderness it seems. From mountaineering monkeys and leopards to snakes and spiders, the mountains support an amazing amount of wildlife. They supply humanity with many remarkable gifts, from pets and perfumes to religion and rice. Journeying from West to East and following the seasons, the film begins in Pakistan, in winter. A snow leopard chases a markhor sheep, wolves hunt for frozen bodies in the snow and golden eagles soar above searching for prey. As ice slowly slides down the mountains, Hindu pilgrims take a bath in the melt water, worshipping the mountain and the water as a source of life. Photo Credit: ARCO (Nature PL) Heading East, high-altitude langur monkeys feed on April flowers and buds. Unlike their lowland cousins, they live in peaceful groups. A solitary deer marks its territory with a musky resin, a heavenly perfume used since the days of Cleopatra. Monal pheasants parade their plumage and iridescent crests. Not far away, on the mountain border between India and Pakistan, border guards parade in similar style. Many birds are trapped by the mountains, but barheaded geese fly in the jet-stream. As they pass over Everest, far below near Base Camp a tiny jumping spider attaches a silk line to a rock like a mountaineer, then pounces on its prey, a primitive springtail. Flying with cranes and geese, we reach the high plateau of Tibet. Here a Tibetan fox teams with a brown bear to hunt pika, chiru antelopes charge each other like puffing steam engines and a snake basks in volcanic hot springs. Four major rivers (the Yangtze, Yellow River, Yarlung and Mekong) begin here. Flowing East, they cut through the Himalayas, carving spectacular deep gorges in Yunnan, China. Warm air funnelled up from the Tropics creates steamy Shangri Las where elephants and leopards wander the forests, while tropical monkeys, bizarre half-goat/half-cow golden takin, and elfin snub-nosed monkeys wander the hillsides. In July, temperatures drop and it starts to snow. This triggers the monsoon, without which half of Asia would be a desert. The rains wash down millions of tonnes of fertile soil, another miraculous gift from the world's great 'abode of snow'. What was this article about?","output":"This article is about a documentary presented by the acclaimed natural history presenter, David Attenborough, which takes viewers on a journey through the Himalayas, one of the most extreme and fascinating places on the planet. The Himalayas are the largest mountain range in the world, stretching 2,000 miles across Asia and supporting a diverse array of wildlife, including mountaineering monkeys, leopards, snakes, and spiders. The documentary follows the seasonal changes and the remarkable variety of life that thrives in these mountains, starting from the harsh winters in Pakistan where snow leopards and wolves hunt for food, to Hindu pilgrims seeking solace in the meltwaters of the mountains as the ice recedes. As the journey continues, we witness the unique behaviors of high-altitude langur monkeys, territorial deer marking their territories with their musky scent, and the impressive displays of monal pheasants. The documentary also captures the fascinating interactions between the Indian and Pakistani border guards as well as the spectacular flight of bar-headed geese over Mount Everest. Viewers are taken to the high plateau of Tibet, where Tibetan foxes and brown bears coexist to hunt pikas and chiru antelopes showcasing their powerful charging capacities. The documentary highlights the importance of the monsoon rains in supporting life in the region, the origin of four significant rivers that cut through the Himalayas, and the marvelous mix of flora and fauna that call these mountains their home. In summary, the article describes an awe-inspiring nature documentary led by David Attenborough, which highlights the breathtaking beauty, extreme conditions, and remarkable biodiversity of the Himalayas. The journey showcases the resilience of life found in this formidable mountain range and the incredible ecological and cultural interactions that have shaped the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bush are an English rock band formed in London, England in 1992. Their current lineup consists of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Gavin Rossdale, drummer Robin Goodridge, lead guitarist Chris Traynor, and bassist Corey Britz. In 1994, Bush found immediate success with the release of their debut album, Sixteen Stone, which is certified 6x multi-platinum by the RIAA. They went on to become one of the most commercially successful rock bands of the 1990s, selling over 10 million records in the United States. Following the completion of touring, Rossdale went into seclusion in Ireland, where he worked on material for the group's next album. Rossdale periodically sent demo tapes of his works in progress to his bandmates. The group finally convened to record in London in August 1998, where the band reteamed with Sixteen Stone producers Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley.  The release of The Science of Things was held up by a court battle between the band and Trauma Records. The case was settled in early 1999 and the album was finally released that October. The Science of Things was a major departure in several forms from Bush's first two albums. Like the multi-platinum successes of Bush's first two albums, this album also reached platinum status. Also, while the band's previous albums were strongly influenced by grunge, The Science of Things featured some electronic music influences in addition to the sound defined by Bush's earlier work. For example, although lead single \\"The Chemicals Between Us\\" had a prominent guitar riff, it also had many electronic elements usually found in dance music. Although the album had a few hit songs, it failed to chart in the top 10.  The band's performance at Woodstock '99, however, helped The Science of Things achieve platinum status despite its slow start. Three singles were released from The Science of Things, most notably \\"The Chemicals Between Us\\", which spent five weeks at No. 1 on the Modern Rock Tracks and peaked at No. 67 on the US Hot 100.\\"Warm Machine\\" was the second single released. \\"Letting the Cables Sleep,\\" the third single, reached No. 4 on the Modern Rock Tracks and also received considerable airplay.","output":"This text is about the English rock band, Bush."},{"instruction":"Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: The boy has talent, you have to admit it.

An 'IsA' relation holds when 'X is a kind of Y'. An 'Antonym' relation holds when 'X can be used as the opposite of Y'. A 'Synonym' relation applies when 'X can be used in place of Y, without changing the meaning'. A 'PartOf' relation holds when 'X is a part of Y'. A 'MemberOf' relation holds when 'X is a member of Y'. A 'MadeOf' relation holds when 'X is made of Y'. An 'Entailment' relation holds when 'If X is true, then Y is true as well'. A 'HasA' relation holds when 'X can have or contain Y'. A 'HasProperty' relation holds when 'Y is to specify X'. Problem:X: bolt, Y: lock Solution:","output":"To determine the type of relationship between the words \\"bolt\\" and \\"lock,\\" let's analyze each type of relation one at a time and see if it fits: 1. 'IsA': \\"Bolt is a kind of lock\\" - This is not true as they are different entities, although related. 2. 'Antonym': \\"Bolt can be used as the opposite of lock\\" - This is also not true, as they are not opposites. 3. 'Synonym': \\"Bolt can be used in place of lock, without changing the meaning\\" - This is not true, as they have distinct meanings. 4. 'PartOf': \\"Bolt is a part of lock\\" - This is true. A bolt is a part of a lock assembly that secures a door or other access point when it's closed. 5. 'MemberOf': \\"Bolt is a member of lock\\" - This is not true, as they are not class-membership types. 6. 'MadeOf': \\"Bolt is made of lock\\" - This doesn't make sense because one isn't composed of the other. 7. 'Entails': \\"If bolt is true, then lock is true as well\\" - This is not applicable. 8. 'HasA': \\"Bolt can have or contain lock\\" - This is also not true, as they are distinct components. 9. 'HasProperty': \\"Lock is to specify bolt\\" - This is not true, as the lock doesn't define or specify the bolt. Based on the analysis above, the relationship between \\"bolt\\" and \\"lock\\" is 'PartOf', as a bolt is a part of a lock assembly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Would \\"In 1799, he staged a coup d'état and installed himself as First Consul ; five years later the French Senate proclaimed him emperor, following a plebiscite in his favour.\\" be a reasonable answer?  A. No; B. Yes;","output":"B. Yes, the statement gives a reasonable answer on who overthrew France in the context of the French Revolution. The person referred to in the statement is Napoleon Bonaparte. After a series of tumultuous events during the French Revolution, which began in 1789, France was in a state of political and social chaos. People were disillusioned with the abuses of the Bourbon monarchy, and the radical changes brought by the Revolution led to violence and unrest. Napoleon Bonaparte, a skilled military general, took advantage of this situation. In 1799, he executed a bloodless coup d'état, overthrowing the French government known as the Directory to consolidate power in his own hands. He became the First Consul of the French Republic, effectively becoming the most powerful man in France at that time. Under his leadership, he implemented a series of reforms and restructured various aspects of society, such as the legal system, education, and administration. He helped stabilize the country and turn it into a military and economic powerhouse. In 1804, after five years as First Consul, the French Senate, recognizing Napoleon's influence and power, declared him the Emperor of the French. Additionally, a plebiscite, which is a direct vote by the public, was held to further legitimize his position and rule. The majority of the French people voted in favor of Napoleon becoming the emperor.

Bradford will return to Oklahoma lineup against Baylor A good week of practice has convinced Oklahoma and Sam Bradford that the Heisman Trophy winner should return from a sprained right shoulder and start for the Sooners on Saturday against Baylor. Bradford was hurt in the first half of a season-opening loss to Brigham Young. He returned to practice last week but did not play in Saturday's loss to Miami (Fla.) that dropped Oklahoma to 2-2 and likely ended its hope of winning a national title. Bradford was held out of the game against the Hurricanes because of concern that his shoulder may not be able to handle the rigors of an entire game. His progression this week allayed those fears. \\"Sam has had a great week of practice and is ready to play,\\" Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops said in a statement. \\"We're obviously excited to have him back.\\" In Bradford's absence, freshman Landry Jones played well in wins against Idaho State and Tulsa and struggled a bit against Miami. \\"We remain very pleased with the work Landry Jones did in replacing Sam and our entire program has a lot of confidence in his ability,\\" Stoops added. Bradford's return Saturday allows him to get a game under his belt before next week's rivalry game against No. 2 Texas in Dallas. It was debated whether Bradford should return at all, considering he skipped on the chance to be a top pick in the NFL draft last year and could see his stock fall if he is further injured. Bradford said it would be selfish for him to sit out the rest of the season just because his team's national title hopes were slim and he could protect his shoulder. \\"That's big for a guy like Sam to make the sacrifice that he made with the opportunity that he had in front of him to come back and work with us the next year,\\" safety Sam Proctor said this week. \\"He's a very low-key guy, down-to-earth guy and that just says a lot about his character.\\" Bradford, considered a top NFL prospect, has been told there shouldn't be an elevated risk of re-injuring the shoulder by playing. \\"I really don't think there's much concern for me taking a hit. From everything that I've received from the doctors, it's like taking any other hit. It can't do much more damage,\\" Bradford said. \\"The odds of me hurting it now are just like the odds of me hurting it before anything happened to it.\\" To report corrections and clarifications, contact Reader Editor .

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article in one sentence. One of the first steps in letting a man know you’re attracted to him is showing a genuine interest in what he says or does.  Whether you’re hanging out together or as part of a group, you’ll have the perfect opportunity to show him that you like him.  If you happen to score one-on-one time with him, ask him questions to learn more about him.  Try not to pepper him with questions like you’re conducting an interview.  Allow the questions to flow naturally while you’re having a conversation.  You could start off asking, “So, what do you like to do for fun?”  Or if you’re out at a bar or some other kind of venue, “Do you come out here often?”  Ask him specific questions as opposed to saying, “Tell me about yourself.”  And focus on light topics or simple things.  Ask him about his job, his taste in music, or his favorite foods or sports team. If you’re in a group, show him more attention than everyone else. While you don’t want to make things awkward by acting as if the rest of the group doesn’t exist, show him he has your attention by hanging out in a spot near him and by positioning your body toward his.  Remain active in the group’s conversation, but make an effort to respond when he says something interesting and laugh at his jokes. If you’ve managed to have a decent conversation with him and asked good questions, then you should know enough about his interests to figure out where he may hang out.  Does he play in a band or participate in a sport?  Do you know who his favorite team is?  What bar does he like going to on the weekend?  If he mentions he attends local sports games, grab a friend and arrange to run into him at a game. Add him as a friend on Facebook or follow him on Twitter to keep up with his social calendar.  Attend a couple events you think you may also enjoy, so you won’t feel out of place. Get close to his friends to find out what they often do as a group.  When you find out their plans for an evening, suggest you and a few of your friends attend.  By making plans this way, it won’t seem so obvious that you’re intentionally trying to arrange quality time with the man you like. If you’re across the room from him, allow him to catch you looking at him.  When he does, smile at him for a couple seconds while looking into his eyes, and then look away.  Likewise, whenever you catch him looking your way, show you appreciate his attention by smiling. Get him a gift that lets him know you’ve been thinking of him.  You don’t have to spend a lot of money, or any money at all, if you’re crafty.  Choose a gift that you feel reflects his interests or is a reminder of some memorable moment the two of you may have shared.  You could buy the bobble-head figure of his favorite sports player.  Get him tickets to a concert you’ll both enjoy.  If you like making crafts, you could decorate a picture frame and include a cute picture of the two of you, or create a collage of your favorite moments together.","output":"Show genuine interest in a man you're attracted to by engaging in conversation, asking about his interests, spending time around him and his friends, exchanging smiles, and giving thoughtful gifts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer: Ronald Ross won a Nobel prize in medicine for his work on what subject?","output":"Sir Ronald Ross won the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1902 for his groundbreaking work in discovering the transmission mechanisms of the malaria parasite, a discovery that revolutionized treatments and preventive measures for the disease globally. Sir Ronald Ross was a British medical doctor who served in the Indian Medical Service. His work primarily focused on the disease malaria, which, at that time in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, represented a major public health issue, particularly within tropical regions. Ross began his studies in 1892, focusing primarily on whether mosquitoes could be the vector for malaria. It had already been established via scientific research that the disease was caused by a specific parasite, a protozoan which belongs to the genus Plasmodium. However, the mode of transmission of this parasite to humans was not known. Ross’s mission involved discovering the missing link that would reveal how this ailment was transmitted. After painstaking research involving dissection of hundreds of mosquitoes fed on malarial patients, Ross finally made his groundbreaking discovery in 1897. He found that the malaria parasite lifecycle included a critical stage within the Anopheles mosquito. His work confirmed that when a mosquito carrying this malaria parasite bites a human, the parasite is transmitted, effectively making the mosquito the disease's vector. This finding was incredibly significant, and it set the stage for the development of potential interventions that could break the cycle of malaria transmission. Ross's research paved the way for the following prevention strategies, such as mosquito netting treated with insecticide, the draining of wetland areas where mosquitoes breed, and the use of insecticides in populated areas. His major contribution to the field of medical science earned him the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1902. He was the first Briton to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine. The work of Sir Ronald Ross is still celebrated to this day, especially on World Mosquito Day, observed each year on the 20th of August to commemorate his discovery in 1897. His findings have been paramount in malarial research and informed much of the eventual efforts for malaria control, showing the enormous impact of his work on global public health. Thus, Ronald Ross's work in understanding the transmission of malaria has had a profound and enduring impact on medicine, and his heralded research continues to influence strategies for controlling and eliminating this devastating disease."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

PLANS to extend his year-long break from golf until 2012.      Elin, who turned 30 on Friday and is currently on holiday in France, has now cut all ties with Tiger after sensational revelations linking him to EIGHTEEN mistresses.      The Florida-based sports legend, 34 last Wednesday, has not seen his children - daughter Sam, two, and 10-month-old son Charlie - for almost a month due to Elin's concerns about his mental state. She told pals: \\"He's not stable enough at the moment.\\"      Elin is now pressing ahead with the divorce plans and intends to start a new life near their old family home in Orlando within the next six months.      Our source told us: \\"She's 100 per cent determined to split with Tiger. When she boasted of the '300m Christmas gift' and then laughed it was clear to everyone around her that she's more focused than ever about moving on with her life.      \\"She still has feelings for Tiger as the father of her kids, but now her only dealings with him will be to get her and the youngsters set up in a comfortable home with everything they need. And so far Tiger has just agreed to settle for an easy life.\\"      Secret      Steely Elin moved out of the family home and has steered clear of her husband since child protection service agents visited them there in late November.      Tiger, who has a well-documented battle with sleeping pill Ambien, had to settle for a Christmas Day phone call with his kids rather than a personal visit.      The source added: \\"Elin feels that Tiger isn't mentally well enough to spend time with her or the kids.      \\"Tiger wanted to see them for Christmas, but Elin went away skiing at a secret location in California and then fled to France for more snow and space. They did speak briefly on the phone, but it ended with Elin begging him to seek professional help. She's remained tough despite the underlying emotions at the centre of this split.      \\"And when Tiger's mum Tida asked to see her grandchildren for Christmas Elin told her to send her presents in the post.

That made Elin furious.      Feud      \\"Tida also seemed to blame HER for Tiger's indiscretions, accusing her of hiring 'pretty women' to help out around the house - as if to hint that she was testing Tiger. Elin blew her top at that and the feud kicked off.\\"      The scandal involving Woods' No 1 mistress, New York party organiser Rachel Uchitel, has also been fired up again as she boasted to friends that Tiger wants to set her up with her own nightclub.      This week she jetted to be with friends and family in Palm Beach, Florida, just a few miles away from where Tiger has moored his £1m yacht.      After bragging that the star planned to finance her new project Rachel, 34, told her pals: \\"I'm his soulmate and we have a special connection. We WILL get back together - he promised.\\"      But Woods' official business associates are concerned about his continued absence from work. Many top aides in Tiger's management, property, and golf design concerns have not heard from their leader in weeks.      An insider told us: \\"Tiger's cut himself from many of the people he used to talk to on a daily basis. Many senior aides are worried about their jobs - they fear Tiger will shake up his organisation and ditch anyone who may be implicated with helping him in his indiscretions. There was also a big office move on the cards soon, as Tiger planned to set up premises close to his secluded new 30 million dream home on Jupiter Island, on the Florida coast halfway between Kennedy Space Center and Miami. But that's been put on hold, leaving some to speculate that Tiger may sell the property.      \\"One person Tiger has been speaking to lately is fellow golfer Mark O'Meara.

Its territorial center was in the modern district of Herzogtum Lauenburg and originally its eponymous capital was Lauenburg upon Elbe, though in 1619 the capital moved to Ratzeburg.  - Bogislaw X of Pomerania, \\"the Great\\", (3 June 1454  5 October 1523) was Duke of Pomerania from 1474 until his death in 1523.  - Schleswig-Holstein is the northernmost of the 16 states of Germany, comprising most of the historical duchy of Holstein and the southern part of the former Duchy of Schleswig. Its capital city is Kiel; other notable cities are Lübeck and Flensburg.  - Pomerania-Stolp was one of the partitions of the Duchy of Pomerania. Centered in Supsk, it was created from another partition of the Duchy of Pomerania, Pomerania-Wolgast, to satisfy Bogislaw V, Duke of Pomerania in 1368, and existed until 1459, when it was inherited by Eric II of Pomerania-Wolgast. In 1474, it was merged to the partition of Bogislaw X, Duke of Pomerania, who four years later became the sole duke of Pomerania.  - Lower Saxony is a German state (\\"Bundesland\\") situated in northwestern Germany and is second in area, with , and fourth in population (8 million) among the sixteen \\"Länder\\" of Germany. In rural areas Northern Low Saxon, a dialect of Low German, and Saterland Frisian, a variety of Frisian, are still spoken, but the number of speakers is declining.  - The Duchy of Pomerania (, 12th century  1637) was a duchy in Pomerania on the southern coast of the Baltic Sea, ruled by dukes of the House of Pomerania (\\"Griffins\\").  - John V of Saxe - Lauenburg ( also numbered John IV ; 18 July 1439 -- 15 August 1507 ) was the eldest son of Duke Bernard II of Saxe - Lauenburg and Adelheid of Pomerania - Stolp ( * 1410 -- after 1445 * ) , daughter of Duke Bogislaus VIII of Pomerania - Stolp .

The district of Herzogtum Lauenburg is named after the former Duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg.  - The Duchy of Pomerania was partitioned several times to satisfy the claims of the male members of the ruling House of Pomerania dynasty. The partitions were named after the ducal residences: Pomerania-Barth, -Demmin, -Rügenwalde, -Stettin, -Stolp, and -Wolgast. None of the partitions had a hereditary character, the members of the House of Pomerania inherited the duchy in common. The duchy thus continued to exist as a whole despite its division. The only exception was made during a war with the Margraviate of Brandenburg, when in 1338 Barnim III of Pomerania-Stettin was granted his partition as a fief directly from the Holy Roman Emperor, while Pomerania-Wolgast remained under formal Brandenburgian overlordship. However, already in 1348, German king and later emperor Charles IV again granted the Duchy of Pomerania as a whole and the Principality of Rügen as a fief to the dukes of both Pomerania-Stettin and Pomerania-Wolgast, nullifying Brandenburg's claims by granting Imperial immediacy.

Movie plot title: The Mission Movie plot: The film is set in the 1750s and involves Spanish Jesuit priest Father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons) who enters the northeastern Argentina and western Paraguayan jungle to build a mission station and convert a GuaranÃ­ community to Christianity.[6] The GuaranÃ­ community is not initially receptive to Christianity or outsiders in general, shown by the opening scene where they tie a priest to a wooden cross and send him over the Iguazu Falls, a large waterfall they live above. Father Gabriel travels to the falls, climbs to the top, and plays his oboe. The GuaranÃ­ warriors, captivated by the music, allow him to live. Mercenary and slaver Rodrigo Mendoza (Robert De Niro) makes his living kidnapping natives such as the Guarani community and selling them to nearby plantations, including the plantation of the Spanish Governor Don Cabeza (Chuck Low). After returning from another kidnapping trip Mendoza is told by his assumed fiancÃ©, Carlotta (Cherie Lunghi), that she loves his younger half-brother Felipe (Aidan Quinn). Mendoza later finds them in bed together and in a fit of rage kills Felipe in a duel. Although he is acquitted of the killing by Cabeza, Mendoza spirals into depression and seeks absolution for his actions. Father Gabriel visits and challenges Mendoza to undertake a suitable penance. Mendoza accompanies the Jesuits on their return to the GuaranÃ­ village, scaling a cliff while dragging a heavy bundle containing his armour and sword. Upon reaching the outskirts of the natives' territory, there are a few tense moments when the natives recognise him, but after seeing him in his humbled state, they cut away his heavy bundle and forgive him. Father Gabriel's mission is depicted as a place of sanctuary and education for the GuaranÃ­. Moved by the GuaranÃ­'s acceptance, Mendoza wishes to help at the mission and Father Gabriel gives him a Bible. In time, Mendoza takes vows and becomes a Jesuit under Father Gabriel and his colleague Father Fielding (Liam Neeson).

Answer:","output":"Among the given options, the factors that can help plants grow are: 1. Solar energy: Solar energy is essential for plants to perform photosynthesis, the process by which they create food and energy. 2. Light: Light is a crucial component of photosynthesis, and plants require it to grow and survive. It provides the energy plants need to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. 3. Animal fur: Seeds sticking to animal fur can help in the dispersal of seeds, increasing the chances of germination and growth of new plants. This indirectly plays a role in plant growth by aiding in seed propagation. 4. Enzymes: Enzymes are crucial for many biochemical processes that occur within plants, such as breaking down nutrients and facilitating chemical reactions that are necessary for plant growth. 5. Energy: Energy is required for many processes in plants, like photosynthesis, respiration, and growth. Although it is not directly provided in the options, energy comes from sources like solar energy and nutrients obtained from the soil.

The title of what poetic drama by Robert Browning was used to name a Kentucky town?","output":"The title of the poetic drama by Robert Browning that was used to name a Kentucky town is \\"Pippa Passes.\\"  \\"Pippa Passes\\" is a verse drama written by the English poet and playwright Robert Browning, first published in 1841 as part of the collection, \\"Bells and Pomegranates.\\" The play is set in the silk-manufacturing region of Northern Italy, in the small town of Asolo. It revolves around the life of a young innocent girl, Pippa, who works in a silk mill. The drama unfolds over the course of a single day, New Year's Day, when Pippa has her only day off throughout the year. Divided into four parts, it tells four interconnected stories as Pippa wanders through the town, unknowingly influencing the lives of its inhabitants by singing songs as she passes by. Her presence serves as a moral compass, guiding the characters to reexamine their lives and make better decisions. The influence of Robert Browning's \\"Pippa Passes\\" on the naming of a Kentucky town is an interesting example of the deep-seated impact that literature can have on culture and placemaking. In 1888, the president of the American Sunday School Union, Reverend John N. Norton, initiated the establishment of a new college for civics and ethical education in Eastern Kentucky. Reverend Norton was an admirer and avid reader of Browning's works and felt that \\"Pippa Passes\\" encapsulated the spirit of enlightenment, growth, and positive change that he envisioned for the college and its surrounding community. In 1889, the railroad terminus containing the new college was officially founded as a settlement and dubbed \\"Pippa Passes\\" in honor of Browning's poetic drama. Later, Alice Lloyd College, named after its founder, was established in the town, fulfilling Reverend Norton's vision for an institution dedicated to education. Today, Pippa Passes is a small town in the Appalachian Mountains in Eastern Kentucky, located in Knott County. It is home to Alice Lloyd College, which remains a prominent institution in the region, providing higher education opportunities for local students with limited resources. Thus, the poetic drama \\"Pippa Passes\\" by Robert Browning not only made an impact as a literary work, but its title also became an enduring symbol for growth, education, and positive change through its influence on the naming of a Kentucky town."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

No. The given phrase, \\"Gross domestic product in 2011 US dollars per capita, adjusted for inflation and purchasing power parity (log scale) from 1860 to 2011, with population (disk area) for the US (yellow), UK (orange), Japan (red), China (red), and India (blue)\\", is not a reasonable answer to the question about primary components of globalization that affect the practice of medicine in the U.S. Instead, it primarily focuses on the economic growth and population size of different countries. To address the question, let's identify and discuss the primary components of globalization that affect how the practice of medicine takes place in the United States. 1. Flow of information: Globalization has led to a rapid exchange of information and knowledge across borders, which has significantly impacted the medical field. Easy access to research, best practices, and innovative technologies from other countries has led to improvements in healthcare delivery and quality in the U.S. Advancements in telemedicine and remote diagnosis further allow American healthcare providers to treat patients in other countries. 2. Medical tourism: Globalization has made it easier for people to travel across borders for medical treatments. Higher income individuals from countries with inadequate healthcare systems may travel to the U.S. for advanced treatments, while cost-conscious Americans may seek affordable care in countries like India or Mexico. This trend has resulted in a need for greater cross-cultural understanding and collaboration among healthcare providers. 3. Education and workforce migration: The global movement of medical professionals has influenced the practice of medicine in the U.S. International medical graduates are increasingly selected to join the U.S. healthcare workforce, enhancing the diversity of skills and perspectives in the sector. Additionally, cross-border exchanges and collaborations in medical education, such as joint degrees and research programs, contribute to the ongoing improvement of healthcare practices. 4. Pharmaceutics and medical technology: With globalization comes the international trade of pharmaceuticals and medical devices. The U.S. collaborates with other countries to develop and share the distribution of advanced medical technologies and drugs, greatly impacting patient outcomes. However, it also raises concerns about intellectual property rights, product safety, and the control of counterfeit drugs. 5. Global health governance and regulations: The U.S. is actively involved in international health organizations and treaties, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), to develop and promote global health policies. These international efforts shape the domestic practices of healthcare, including infection control, emergency preparedness, and the prevention and treatment of global diseases. 6. Changing demographics and disease patterns: Globalization has contributed to the increased movement of people across borders, leading to a diverse population with unique healthcare needs. The transmission of infectious diseases and the emergence of new health challenges add complexity to healthcare provision in the United States. In conclusion, the primary components of globalization that affect the practice of medicine in the U.S. include the flow of information, medical tourism, education and workforce migration, pharmaceutics and medical technology, global health governance and regulations, and changing demographics and disease patterns. Understanding and adapting to these components can help improve the healthcare system and promote better health outcomes for patients worldwide."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This article: In 1987, Dylan starred in Richard Marquand's movie Hearts of Fire, in which he played Billy Parker, a washed-up rock star turned chicken farmer whose teenage lover (Fiona) leaves him for a jaded English synth-pop sensation played by Rupert Everett. Dylan also contributed two original songs to the soundtrack—\\"Night After Night\\", and \\"I Had a Dream About You, Baby\\", as well as a cover of John Hiatt's \\"The Usual\\". The film was a critical and commercial flop. Dylan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1988, with Bruce Springsteen's introduction declaring, \\"Bob freed your mind the way Elvis freed your body. He showed us that just because music was innately physical did not mean that it was anti-intellectual.\\"The album Down in the Groove in May 1988 sold even more unsuccessfully than his previous studio album. Michael Gray wrote: \\"The very title undercuts any idea that inspired work may lie within. Here was a further devaluing of the notion of a new Bob Dylan album as something significant.\\" The critical and commercial disappointment of that album was swiftly followed by the success of the Traveling Wilburys. Dylan co-founded the band with George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty, and in late 1988 their multi-platinum Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 reached three on the US album chart, featuring songs that were described as Dylan's most accessible compositions in years. Despite Orbison's death in December 1988, the remaining four recorded a second album in May 1990 with the title Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3.Dylan finished the decade on a critical high note with Oh Mercy produced by Daniel Lanois. Michael Gray wrote that the album was: \\"Attentively written, vocally distinctive, musically warm, and uncompromisingly professional, this cohesive whole is the nearest thing to a great Bob Dylan album in the 1980s.\\" The track \\"Most of the Time\\", a lost love composition, was later prominently featured in the film High Fidelity, while \\"What Was It You Wanted?\\" has been interpreted both as a... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was said to free your mind the way Elvis freed your body?, what is it ?","output":"The last name of the person who was said to free your mind the way Elvis freed your body is Springsteen.

The Lenape (English:  or ), also called the Leni Lenape, Lenni Lenape and Delaware people, are an indigenous people of the Northeastern Woodlands, who live in Canada and the United States. Their historical territory included present-day New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania along the Delaware River watershed, New York City, western Long Island, and the Lower Hudson Valley. Today, Lenape people belong to the Delaware Nation and Delaware Tribe of Indians in Oklahoma, the Stockbridge-Munsee Community in Wisconsin, and the Munsee-Delaware Nation, Moravian of the Thames First Nation, and Delaware of Six Nations in Ontario. The Lenape have a matrilineal clan system and historically were matrilocal. At the time of sustained European contact in the 16th centuries and 17th centuries, the Lenape were a powerful Native American nation who inhabited a region on the mid-Atlantic coast spanning the latitudes of southern Massachusetts to the southern extent of Delaware in what anthropologists call the Northeastern Woodlands. Although never politically unified, the confederation of the Delaware roughly encompassed the area around and between the Delaware and lower Hudson rivers, and included the western part of Long Island in present-day New York. Some of their place names, such as Manhattan (\\"the island of many hills\\"), Raritan, and Tappan were adopted by Dutch and English colonists to identify the Lenape people that lived there. Based on the historical record of the mid-17th century, it has been estimated that most Lenape polities consisted of several hundred people but it is conceivable that some had been considerably larger prior to close contact, given the wars between the Susquehannocks and the Iroquois, both of whom were armed by the Dutch fur traders, while the Lenape were at odds with the Dutch and so lost that particular arms race.  During the Beaver Wars in the first half of the 17th century, European colonists were careful to keep firearms from the coastally located Delaware, while rival Iroquoian peoples such as the Susquehannocks and Confederation of the Iroquois became comparatively well armed. Subsequently, the Lenape became subjugated and made tributary to first the Susquehannocks, then the Iroquois, even needing their rivals' (superiors') agreement to initiate treaties such as land sales. Like most tribes, Lenape communities were weakened by newly introduced diseases originating in Europe, mainly smallpox but also cholera, influenza and dysentery, and recurrent violent racial conflict with Europeans. Iroquoian peoples occasionally fought the Lenape. As the 18th century progressed, many surviving Lenape moved west--into the (relatively empty) upper Ohio River basin.  Smallpox devastated Native American communities even located far from European settlements by the 1640s. The Lenape and Susquehannocks fought a war in the middle of the 17th century that left the Delaware a tributary state even as the Susquehannocks had defeated the Province of Maryland between 1642-50s.","output":"This text is about the Lenape people, also known as the Leni Lenape, Lenni Lenape, and Delaware people.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. For the two people in the world that care about Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, we have good news for you! Blake Lively is pregnant, and she and hubby Ryan Reynolds are expecting their first child together. And shocker [not], the announcement of Blake’s pregnancy came via her new website Preserve, conveniently attached with a picture of her holding her baby bump. Oh Blake, could you be any more transparent?      Let’s see, Blake Lively gets her website up and running, all in favor of expanding her ‘lifestyle’ brand. Preserve gets this big opening, with all the media interviews and magazine covers. Blake promotes the hell out of the enterprise, all the while claiming that she’s still interested in acting but this is just a ‘side’ passion. And then, when she realizes that no one gives two shits about Preserve, she decides to announce her pregnancy and showcase her baby bump on the website. It’s like she’s finally realized that she can’t act, and that capitalizing on her motherhood is the only way she’ll stay relevant in the industry.      And trust, it’s not the first time that actresses have used this strategy. Jessica Alba is a prime example of having done exactly that, using her children to get her Honest Company off the ground and somehow turned it into a success. Just like Blake, Jessica realized that her future in acing was limited, but she knows there are people out there that will follow celebrity mothers no matter what. Blake without a child, running Preserve? Meh. Blake using Preserve to upload pictures of her child, her baby bump, and her *wonderful* process of motherhood? Well, then people are clicking on her website and Preserve becomes a proper brand name.      The whole thing reeks of Business Branding 101, and you know what’s worse? No matter how transparent it is, it’ll probably be successful.      Image Credit: Preserve – Blake Lively Baby Bump ||||| Since tying the knot, both Blake and Ryan have vocalized their desire to raise kids. \\"I've always wanted a big family,\\" the actress, 27, told Allure in October 2012. \\"Oh, I'd love 30 [children] if I could.\\" In August 2013, her husband made similar comments in Details. \\"We'd love to have a big family. We both come from big families—my parents did four, Blake's did five. A lot of people say it's crazy, but we'll only know when we're there, you know?\\" Ryan, 37, said. \\"We'll walk through that fire pretty happily, I think.\\"      In the August 2014 issue of Vogue, Blake gushed about the twice-wed R.I.P.D. actor, telling the magazine, \\"He's going to be a great father and leader and patriarch—he's so meant to be all of those things. The fact that he lived so much before we got together, he's the exact realized person that he should be. And so I get to share my life with the person he's become, and we get to grow from there.\\"      Most recently, Blake told Marie Claire that she needed to \\"get started\\" having babies right away. \\"If I could spit out a litter of kids, I would,\\" she said. ||||| Think back to when you had a life before kids. I know it's challenging. There is something about having kids that wipes out part of your memory. But if you can recall dreaming about being a parent before you actually were one, try to remember how many kids you wanted to have. Blake Lively reportedly once said she would have 30 kids with her husband of two years Ryan Reynolds. \\"If I could spit out a litter of kids, I would,\\" she told Marie Claire magazine. Right now I'm picturing Blake and Ryan as the new Brad and Angie. Though we must remember that there is the fantasy of having kids and the reality of having kids once we have them.      I'm wondering if Blake is going to feel differently once she has one.      The 26-year-old actress seems to have a great love with Ryan -- she calls him her \\"best, best friend.\\" The couple have never gone a week without seeing each other, and in Hollyweird-land, that is something to be proud of. It's clear they have a great bond, so why wouldn't they want to bring a ton of kids into their world?      Because bringing a ton of kids into your world is HARD! I've caught myself saying that I want to have a ton of kids. The thought of making a dozen babies with my boyfriend right now is very appealing to me. I adore my partner -- I want to make a million little love babies with him. But the reality is that sometimes you have one baby and you just fall in this beautiful parent love with that child and that is all you need. Or maybe you have another (or twins like I did) and you think this is it! The jackpot! I have all the kids I need. And then maybe you think you want one more and then just one more and your bank account slaps you in the face and tells you otherwise.      More from The Stir: How Many Kids Should You Have? Take This Quiz!      Kids are great. Amazing little creatures. They are love and joy and happiness and chocolate chip cookie dough brownies all rolled up into one. I love kids. But having a litter of them? No way. Once you have a kid, the reality of having a kid starts. But before you ever had one, there is this fantasy about being a parent. Maybe you think you look like Angelina Jolie all the time with all those kids in tow. You are the perfect mother -- a symbol of beauty and all that is good, and you are well rested because you've somehow beat the system. But being a parent means that there are sleepless nights. There isn't enough coffee to help you during the day. There are the terrible twos, or terrible threes, or terrible fours, which only eventually gives in to the terrible teens. There are bullies or bullying and peer pressure and ... just take a minute to remember your own teenage years and what you put your parents through. Supposedly that stuff comes back to you tenfold. In which case, I'm screwed. If I had tenfold with a litter of kids ... um ... no thanks. Can't do it.      Of course, if you can and want to have a ton of kids, then go for it. Please make sure they are fantastic little citizens of this world so they grow up to make this great Earth greater. I'm looking forward to the babies that Blake and Ryan have. I'm also wondering if she's going to change her mind about having a litter or 30 kids after she has one. We all have that number of kids we think is the perfect number before we had a kid, and we all know that number sometimes changes drastically.      How many kids did you think you wanted to have before you had one? Is the number the same now?

In what is declared to be a world first, the Tullibardine distillery in Perthshire has linked up with a spin-out company from Napier University in Edinburgh. They plan to use bacteria to feed on the \\"leftovers\\" from the whisky making process. This will produce butanol which can be used to fuel vehicles. More than 90% of the stuff that comes out of a whisky distillery is not whisky. It is leftovers like draff and pot ales -- both produced in the early stages of the process. They are high in sugar and are currently used for things like fertiliser and cattle feed. Napier University's Biofuel Research Centre (BfRC) has already shown that the right bacteria can feed on those by-products to produce butanol--a direct replacement for vehicle fuel. Now the spin-out company, Celtic Renewables, and independent whisky producer Tullibardine have signed an agreement. Together they will apply the process to thousands of tons of the distillery's leftovers. Professor Martin Tangney, founder of Celtic Renewables, said \\"Our partnership with Tullibardine is an important step in the development of a business which combines two important Scottish industries -- whisky and renewables. This project shows that creative use of existing technologies can _ resources on our doorstep to benefit both the environment and the economy.\\" Douglas Ross, managing director of Tullibardine, which spends PS250,000 disposing of its by-products every year, said \\"We are delighted to be partnering Celtic Renewables in this creative business, the obvious benefits of which are environmental. It takes a cost to us and turns it into something that has social as well as commercial value.\\" The project is being supported by a grant  from the Scottish government's Zero Waste Scotland initiative. Celtic Renewables said it eventually aimed to build a processing plant in Scotland, with the hope of building an industry that could be worth PS60m a year.

She spends most of her free time in the forests trying to find the fox during the following months, but she doesn't meet the fox again until winter comes. During the winter, she follows the fox's tracks far across the fields. Suddenly she compares her hand to the size of the tracks near to those she is following and discovers they are relatively fresh wolf tracks; she is alarmed as a wolf pack begins howling near her. She runs away panicked, falls and hurts her ankle. The ankle heals very slowly, so that she has to stay at home during the winter reading a book about foxes and other animals of the forest. When spring arrives, the girl is looking for fox holes and waits for the fox. The fox has young babies and moves holes because of her observations; therefore the girl decides to observe the fox from a greater distance. She finds the fox again and tries to get the animal accustomed to her. She feeds it with meat. Later she can even touch the fox and is led to the new den.

Input: [[-37, 13, -3, 31, 2], [39, -50], [-4, -39, -5], [-38, 22, -6, -27], [-14, -11, -1], [-3, -34], [-28, -34, -50], [-33, 4, -10, -16], [-2, -9, 49, -6, 23], [-32, -25, -32, 24]] Output:","output":"[-890606, -1950, -780, 73908, 154, 102, 47600, 21120, 12312, 614400] I used the definition as follows: 1. I went through each inner list in the input list. 2. For each inner list, I calculated the product by multiplying all the numbers in the inner list. 3. I appended the resulting product to the output list. Here's a step-by-step breakdown: 1. The first inner list is [-37, 13, -3, 31, 2]. The product is -37 * 13 * -3 * 31 * 2 = -890606. So the output list starts with [-890606]. 2. The second inner list is [39, -50]. The product is 39 * -50 = -1950. Append this to the output list: [-890606, -1950]. 3. Continue this process for each inner list. The final output list is [-890606, -1950, -780, 73908, 154, 102, 47600, 21120, 12312, 614400]."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: But more recently, the bloom has gone from the ESOP rose, and last year Avis was sold to HFS, which also owns Howard Johnson, Days Inn, and Century 21. Sentence 2: ESOP are not attractive anymore. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"Yes, the second sentence \\"ESOPs are not attractive anymore\\" is entailed or implied by the first sentence. The first sentence talks about how \\"the bloom has gone from the ESOP rose,\\" which essentially means that the attractiveness or popularity of ESOPs (Employee Stock Ownership Plans) has diminished. This is further supported by the mention that Avis, a company that previously had an ESOP, was sold to HFS, indicating that Avis' ESOP was no longer a sustainable or advantageous business arrangement in that context. The fact that HFS also owns other well-known franchises and brands like Howard Johnson, Days Inn, and Century 21 helps to emphasize the point that ESOPs have lost their appeal in comparison to other business models, as these brands are also not using the ESOP model despite being under the same umbrella as Avis. The second sentence \\"ESOPs are not attractive anymore\\" is a more concise way of expressing the main idea behind the first sentence. It emphasizes that Employee Stock Ownership Plans are no longer seen as a desirable option for businesses, which is clearly implied in the first sentence's description of the situation involving Avis and HFS. In summary, the second sentence is indeed entailed by the first sentence as both sentences convey the notion that ESOPs have lost their appeal and are no longer considered attractive options for businesses. This idea is supported by the specific example of Avis being sold to HFS, as well as the mention of other established brands under HFS that do not use the ESOP model."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Air enters the lungs through bronchial tubes - Air enters bronchioles - Bronchioles have tiny air sacs called alveoli - Alveoli surrounded by small blood vessels - Oxygen absorbed by small blood vessels - Vessels deliver oxygen to every cell in the body - Blood brings carbon dioxide back to lungs - Carbon dioxide released when you exhale.  Question: suppose there will be more water in the clounds happens, how will it affect more oxygen absorbed by small blood vessels.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect","output":"To answer this question, let's evaluate each step in the process and analyze how an increase in water content in clouds might affect oxygen absorption by small blood vessels. 1. Air enters the lungs through bronchial tubes: The increase in water content in clouds will not affect the air entering the lungs, as this process is not directly related to cloud water content. 2. Air enters bronchioles: Again, the water content of clouds does not affect the air entering the bronchioles. 3. Bronchioles have tiny air sacs called alveoli: There's no direct connection between alveoli and the water content of clouds. 4. Alveoli surrounded by small blood vessels: This step is not influenced by the water content in clouds. 5. Oxygen absorbed by small blood vessels: An increase in water content in clouds would lead to more precipitation, but this would not directly increase or decrease the amount of oxygen in the air. Therefore, the amount of oxygen available for absorption by small blood vessels should not be significantly affected. 6. Vessels deliver oxygen to every cell in the body: The transportation of oxygen to cells in the body would not be influenced by the water content of clouds. 7. Blood brings carbon dioxide back to lungs: This step is also not related to the water content in clouds. 8. Carbon dioxide released when you exhale: Exhaling carbon dioxide is an essential part of respiration and is not affected by the water content in clouds. Based on this analysis, it appears that an increase in water content in clouds would have no direct effect on the amount of oxygen absorbed by small blood vessels. Therefore, the answer is C: no effect."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Underpinning Houston's land surface are unconsolidated clays, clay shales, and poorly cemented sands up to several miles deep. The region's geology developed from river deposits formed from the erosion of the Rocky Mountains. These sediments consist of a series of sands and clays deposited on decaying organic marine matter, that over time, transformed into oil and natural gas. Beneath the layers of sediment is a water-deposited layer of halite, a rock salt. The porous layers were compressed over time and forced upward. As it pushed upward, the salt dragged surrounding sediments into salt dome formations, often trapping oil and gas that seeped from the surrounding porous sands. The thick, rich, sometimes black, surface soil is suitable for rice farming in suburban outskirts where the city continues to grow.

A:","output":"Part 1: Generating a summary for US Congressional and California state bills Usage: The task requires generating a summary for a given bill text. In this case, the bill text is amending the Tariff Act of 1930 to include a new section. The summary could be: \\"The bill amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to allow eligible parties to seek damages for economic loss due to the importation and sale of dumped merchandise.\\" This meets the criteria because it provides a concise explanation of the main action taken in the bill. Part 2: Understanding the new section added to the Tariff Act of 1930 Usage: This new section provides a private remedy for eligible parties who have suffered economic loss as a result of the importation and sale of dumped merchandise. It defines terms, outlines the cause of action, jurisdiction, economic loss evaluation, damages, and timeframes for bringing the action. For example, eligible parties can sue manufacturers, exporters, or certain importers of the dumped merchandise. This meets the criteria because it highlights the key components of the newly added section in the Tariff Act of 1930. Part 3: Identifying the terms and definitions in the new section Usage: The new section offers definitions for terms like \\"court,\\" \\"dumped merchandise,\\" \\"eligible party,\\" and \\"foreign market value.\\" For instance, \\"dumped merchandise\\" is defined as merchandise sold at less than foreign market value. This meets the criteria because it explains the meaning of a key term defined in the new section. Part 4: Describing the cause of action and jurisdiction Usage: An eligible party can bring an action for damages against the manufacturers, exporters, or certain importers of the dumped merchandise in a District Court of the United States. The court has jurisdiction over foreign persons involved in such cases. This meets the criteria because it specifies who can be sued and in which court for these cases. Part 5: Evaluating economic loss and determining damages Usage: The new section details the process for evaluating the economic loss, considering factors such as lost sales, worker layoffs, plant closures, or financial losses. The court is responsible for calculating damages, which can include actual damages for economic loss and the costs of the action, like attorney's fees. This meets the criteria because it outlines the factors for evaluating economic loss and identifying damages. Part 6: Timeframe for bringing the action Usage: The action must be brought within two years after the date on which the cause of action accrues, with the two-year limitation suspended while any administrative or judicial review is pending. This meets the criteria because it establishes a time limit for filing an action under the new section."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What Republics did the Rova compound remained largely closed to the public, except on special occasions? ?  The 1896 French colonisation of Madagascar brought an end to the rule of the Merina sovereigns. The Rova of Antananarivo was converted into a museum the following year, and the Fitomiandalana tombs were excavated and moved to a new location behind the tombs of Radama I and Rasoherina. The bodies of sovereigns previously interred in the royal tombs at Ambohimanga were exhumed and transferred to the tombs in the Rova grounds, a sacrilegious move that degraded the status of Ambohimanga as a site of sacred pilgrimage. According to Frémigacci (1999), French colonial administrator General Joseph Gallieni undertook this desacralisation of the Rova in an attempt to break popular belief in the power of the royal ancestors. By the same token, his actions relegated Malagasy sovereignty under the Merina rulers to a relic of an unenlightened past.  The desecration of the two most sacred sites of Merina royalty represented a calculated political move intended to establish the political and cultural superiority of the colonial power.Following independence the Rova compound remained largely closed to the public throughout the First (1960–1972) and Second (1975–1992) Republics except on special occasions.  In 1995, three years into the Third Republic (1992–2010), the Rova compound was destroyed by fire. The tombs, chapel, exterior of Manjakamiadina and two traditional wooden houses (Besakana and Mahitsy) have since been restored with further restorations planned to continue until at least 2013.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Information:  - A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighbourhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement.  - Kazarman is the village and capital of Toguz-Toro District, Jalal-Abad Region, Kyrgyzstan on the Naryn River.

Given the following context:  In 1754, Belton was inherited by Sir John Cust, the son of previous owner Viscount Tyrconnel's widowed sister. Cust was a distinguished politician active during the politically turbulent 1760s, and his monument at Belton blames his death at the age of 51 to the \\"unusual fatigues of his office\\". His heir was created Lord Brownlow in 1776, and Belton was owned by successive Lords Brownlow for the next 200 years.In the last three decades of the 19th century the 3rd Earl Brownlow spent much time and money restoring Belton, and consequently the house entered the 20th century in a good state of repair and preservation. However, the 20th century was to present Belton and its estate with serious problems. These included the introduction of income tax and death duties which would leave the finances of the Brownlow family severely depleted.At the beginning of World War I, like many other British landowners, the 3rd Earl Brownlow offered his house and park to the Government for war service. The offer was accepted, and the largest and most drastic changes were made in the park since the time of Viscount Tyrconnel's folly building. In August 1914, the house and park were used as the assembly point for the 11th (Northern) Division before its deployment. In 1915, the home depôt and training ground of the Machine Gun Corps were established in the southern part of Belton park. The lie of the land there, where the River Witham passes between the Lower Lincolnshire Limestone and the Upper Lias mudstone, lent itself to the development of the necessary firing ranges close to good communications by way of the Great North Road and Grantham railway station on the East Coast Main Line. The depôt was closed in 1919, the site cleared and the land restored to Lord Brownlow in 1920. Little sign of the Machine Gun Corps's stay remains in the park, but plaques and inscriptions can be followed from the south gate of Belton park to the memorial gate on the way from there to the town centre and in the north aisle of Grantham parish...  answer the following question:  What is the last name of the person whose monument says they died at 51? A:","output":"The last name of the person whose monument says they died at 51 is Cust. Sir John Cust was the one who inherited Belton in 1754 and was a distinguished politician."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

They are caused by unequal heating of Earth’s surface. The Coriolis effect causes global winds to blow on a diagonal over the surface. Unequal heating also causes jet streams high in the troposphere.   Q: What effect causes global winds to blow on a diagonal over the earth's surface?   A: Options: (A). dopler effect (B). resonant effect (C). centrifugal effect (D). coriolis effect The answer is:","output":"(D). Coriolis effect The Coriolis effect is the primary cause of global winds blowing on a diagonal over the Earth's surface. This phenomenon occurs due to the rotation of the Earth and its impact on the movement of fluids (like air) over the planet's surface. As the Earth spins on its axis, the speed of rotation varies at different latitudes, with the equator having the highest rotational speed and the poles having the lowest. This variation causes the paths of air masses to deflect, resulting in diagonal wind patterns rather than a direct movement from high-pressure to low-pressure areas. The uneven heating of the Earth's surface also plays a crucial role in generating global winds. When the sun's energy heats the Earth, the air near the surface becomes warmer and rises, creating areas of low pressure. Similarly, cooler air starts to descend, resulting in high-pressure areas. The air then flows horizontally from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure, forming wind. The interaction between these horizontal pressure gradients and the vertical temperature gradients leads to the formation of global wind belts. Moreover, the Coriolis effect also influences the formation of jet streams high in the troposphere. These fast-moving, narrow air currents are found at altitudes of around six to ten miles above the Earth's surface and play a significant role in shaping weather patterns around the world. Jet streams are primarily created from the temperature differences between polar and tropical air masses, with the Coriolis effect further amplifying their movement. Overall, the Coriolis effect works in conjunction with other factors like uneven heating and pressure variations to shape the global winds and weather we experience on Earth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In Japan, strict building codes and earthquake-resistant design features are implemented, which can help mitigate the impact of earthquakes of this magnitude. 3. Timing: This earthquake took place on a Thursday night, which could have implications for the response and recovery efforts. As nighttime earthquakes can catch people off guard while they are asleep, it may take a longer time for emergency responders to assess the situation, rescue survivors from damaged buildings, and restore essential services in the affected areas. 4. Japan Meteorological Agency: This organization plays a crucial role in monitoring and providing accurate information about earthquakes in Japan. They issue bulletins, provide real-time data, and work closely with other agencies to ensure that the public is well-informed and able to make appropriate decisions to stay safe during seismic events. 5. Potential impacts: Although this news report does not provide specific information on the damages or casualties caused by this 5.7 magnitude earthquake, it is essential to consider the potential consequences of such an event. Aside from damage to buildings and infrastructure, earthquakes of this magnitude can disrupt communication systems, impact transportation networks, and cause power outages. Additionally, the psychological impact of earthquakes should not be underestimated as they can cause fear, stress, and anxiety among affected populations, while also straining the resources of relief and rescue services. In conclusion, this news report is about a 5.7 magnitude earthquake that struck Hokkaido, the northernmost main island of Japan. The Japan Meteorological Agency provided crucial information about the earthquake, and the response and recovery efforts would likely be underway to mitigate its impacts. Earthquakes of this magnitude can have considerable effects on communities, infrastructure, and the built environment in affected areas, but Japan's strict building codes and earthquake-resistant designs can help to minimize these impacts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Queen Victoria In 1870, republican sentiment in Britain, fed by the Queen's seclusion, was boosted after the establishment of the Third French Republic. A republican rally in Trafalgar Square demanded Victoria's removal, and Radical MPs spoke against her. In August and September 1871, she was seriously ill with an abscess in her arm, which Joseph Lister successfully lanced and treated with his new antiseptic carbolic acid spray. In late November 1871, at the height of the republican movement, the Prince of Wales contracted typhoid fever, the disease that was believed to have killed his father, and Victoria was fearful her son would die. As the tenth anniversary of her husband's death approached, her son's condition grew no better, and Victoria's distress continued. To general rejoicing, he pulled through. Mother and son attended a public parade through London and a grand service of thanksgiving in St Paul's Cathedral on 27 February 1872, and republican feeling subsided. Q: WHat was a new antiseptic being used to treat abcesses in the 1870's?","output":"In the 1870s, a new antiseptic was being used to treat abscesses: carbolic acid spray. This groundbreaking antiseptic was developed by Joseph Lister, a British surgeon who pioneered the use of antiseptic techniques in surgery. Lister's carbolic acid spray was applied on wounds and surgical instruments to reduce the risk of infection and improve the overall success of surgeries and treatments. In the case of Queen Victoria, her abscess in the arm was successfully lanced and treated with the carbolic acid spray, highlighting the effectiveness of this innovative antiseptic during that time period."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Tokugawa Takes All: When Hideyoshi died in 1598, he hoped to have his five-year-old son continue his \\"dynasty,\\" initially under the tutelage of five regents. But one of the regents was Ieyasu Tokugawa, who had been biding his time at Edo for 12 years, nurturing dynastic ambitions of his own. Of the cunning, ruthless triumvirate that came out on top at the end of the country's century of civil war, Tokugawa was without doubt the most patient, the most prudent — and most treacherous. He moved quickly to eliminate his strongest rivals, crushing them in 1600 at the great Battle of Sekigahara (near modern Nagoya). During its subsequent two and a half centuries of rule from the new capital established at Edo, the Tokugawa organized a tightly controlled coalition of some 260 daimyo in strategic strongholds throughout the country. The allegiance of this highly privileged and prestigious group was ensured by cementing their ethical principles in the code of bushido, \\"The way of the warrior\\": loyalty to one's master, defense of one's status and honor, and fulfillment of all obligations. Loyalty was further enforced by holding the vassals' wives and children hostage in Edo. All roads into Edo, the most famous being the Tokaido Highway, had checkpoints for guns coming in and for wives going out. One of the most effective ways of keeping a tight rein on the country was to cut it off from the outside world, to keep Japan Japanese. At first, Ieyasu Tokugawa was eager to promote foreign trade. He wanted silk and encouraged the Dutch and British as good, nonproselytizing Protestants just interested in trade. But he didn't like the Portuguese and Spanish Catholic missionaries, who he felt were undermining traditional Japanese values. He banned their activities in 1612 and two years later ordered the expulsion of all missionaries and unrepentant Japanese converts. Executions and torture followed. Converts were forced to renounce their faith by trampling crucifixes and effigies of Jesus and Mary. The Catholic Church has counted 3,125 martyrs in Japan from 1597 (beginning under Hideyoshi) to 1660. In 1635 the Japanese were forbidden, on pain of death, to attempt to travel abroad, and Japanese citizens already overseas were prevented from returning, in case they brought back subversive Christian doctrines. Western books were banned, as were Chinese books that mentioned Christianity.

What is the most logical completion of this news story?. (CNN) -- A seven-year-old boy who spent a winter's night lost in chilly conditions in the Australian bush says a friendly kangaroo is the reason he survived. South Australian police said Simon Kruger went missing in the Deep Creek Conservation Park, south of Adelaide, after wandering away from a family picnic shortly after 1.15pm Saturday. A search party of about 40, including two rescue helicopters, was mobilized to locate Simon, who was wearing just a fleece top and track pants and was not equipped for a night in the elements. The search party continued their efforts through the night, operating using parachute flares, before a rescue helicopter spotted him about 500 meters from where he had gone missing nearly 24 hours earlier. \\"I think OPTIONS: - Adelaide sent a kangaroo to keep him warm.\\" - Australian sent a kangaroo to keep him warm.\\" - CNN sent a kangaroo to keep him warm.\\" - Deep Creek Conservation Park sent a kangaroo to keep him warm.\\" - God sent a kangaroo to keep him warm.\\" - Simon sent a kangaroo to keep him warm.\\" - Simon Kruger sent a kangaroo to keep him warm.\\"","output":"- God sent a kangaroo to keep him warm.\\" Explanation: In this story, a young boy named Simon Kruger got lost in the Deep Creek Conservation Park in Australia.

Why other answers are wrong: - \\"Adelaide sent a kangaroo to keep him warm\\" doesn't make sense because Adelaide is a city in Australia, and cities don't send kangaroos. - \\"Australia sent a kangaroo to keep him warm\\" is wrong because countries don't usually send animals to help people. - \\"CNN sent a kangaroo to keep him warm\\" is incorrect because CNN is a news company, and they don't send out animals to help people. - \\"Deep Creek Conservation Park sent a kangaroo to keep him warm\\" doesn't make sense because a park itself cannot send animals. - \\"Simon sent a kangaroo to keep him warm\\" is wrong because Simon is the boy who got lost, and he cannot send a kangaroo to himself. - \\"Simon Kruger sent a kangaroo to keep him warm\\" is incorrect for the same reason as the previous answer; Simon is the lost boy and cannot send a kangaroo to himself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Now that my energy levels are returning I though that it is about time I told you about these amazing products! Okoii products are handmade by Yoko, formally from Japan, now living in Australia. Her aim was to introduce Australian women to traditional natural ingredients from Japan and Asia that they may not previously have been aware of. Some of these ingredients have been used in Japan for upwards of 1000 years, and recently the benefits of such ingredients have been scientifically proven. When you place an order with Okoii, your products are then made by hand, one by one, so you know that they are as fresh as they can possibly be. Other than Lush' Fresh Face Masks, I can't think of any other product that would be as fresh as Okoii. I find it quite exciting to know that when I purchase a product from Okoii, that it hasn't been sitting on the shelf of a warehouse for months, slowly deteriorating. It is recommended that the products be kept in the fridge to maintain their freshness and the all come with a recommended used by date that is between 3-6 months from when it was made. The first product that I am going to introduce you to is the Luxury Rice Bran Face Soap. I decided to review this one on its own for two reasons.

Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells from dividing out of control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is usually caused by mutations. Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably. This often leads to the development of a tumor. A tumor is a mass of abnormal tissue. As a tumor grows, it may harm normal tissues around it. Anything that can cause cancer is called a carcinogen . Carcinogens may be pathogens, chemicals, or radiation.  Paragraph: Jason recently learned that he has cancer. After hearing this news, he convinced his wife, Charlotte, to get checked out.

What Shakespeare tragedy features the House of Capulet and the House of Montague, sworn enemies all?","output":"The Shakespearean tragedy that features the House of Capulet and the House of Montague, both sworn enemies, is \\"Romeo and Juliet.\\" The play, written by William Shakespeare in the late 16th century, between 1591 and 1595, has become one of his most well-known and celebrated works. The plot revolves around the star-crossed lovers, Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet, who come from two powerful and feuding families in the city of Verona, Italy.  The animosity between the House of Capulet and the House of Montague has a long history, with a deep-rooted enmity that extends beyond the memory of the characters within the play. The violent feud between these families creates an atmosphere of chaos and social disorder within the Veronese society, which serves to fuel the tragic outcomes of the story. Despite this bitter feud, Romeo and Juliet fall deeply in love at first sight and try to overcome the obstacles posed by their warring families. The tragic story of Romeo and Juliet begins at a masquerade ball held by the Capulets, where Romeo, a Montague, sneaks in and catches sight of Juliet, a Capulet. Despite being aware of the potential danger of their forbidden love, the two characters are drawn to each other and decide to secretly marry with the help of the kind-hearted Friar Laurence. However, their secret union does not shield them from the harsh reality of the world outside their love. The play's plot is marked by a series of unfortunate events and misunderstandings. The confrontational nature of the enmity between the two families takes the lives of beloved friends and family members, including Romeo's close friend Mercutio and Juliet's cousin Tybalt. In a tragic turn of events, Romeo is banished from Verona after killing Tybalt in retaliation for Mercutio's death. In an attempt to reunite the two lovers and put an end to the family feud, Friar Laurence devises a plan for Juliet to feign her own death using a sleeping potion. However, a series of miscommunications and mishaps prevent Romeo from receiving word of Juliet's plan, leading him to believe that she is genuinely dead. Overcome with grief, Romeo takes his own life, and when Juliet awakens to find Romeo dead, she too decides to end her life. The deaths of Romeo and Juliet ultimately compel the Capulet and Montague families to reconcile their differences and end their bitter feud. The tragedy highlights the devastating consequences of hatred and the power of love to transcend even the most rigid societal barriers. Through the dramatic portrayal of the protagonists' doomed love, Shakespeare provides a timeless reflection on the human experience, exploring themes of love, passion, fate, violence, and the heartbreaking cost of an ongoing conflict."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In terms of ranking, a Rear Admiral is typically below Vice Admiral and above Commodore, possessing extensive experience and expertise in naval warfare, tactics, and operations. It is important to note that the title 'kontraadmirál' is the Czech or Slovak equivalent of Rear Admiral, indicating that this term may have originated from a source in either the Czech Republic or Slovakia. However, since Morteza Safari is a more common name within Iranian culture, it is plausible that this officer may belong to the Iranian Navy or has served in the armed forces of another Persian-speaking country. Rear Admirals often play an essential role in the coordination and management of naval operations. They may be responsible for managing specific areas or divisions, such as logistics, weapons systems, or submarine fleets. Furthermore, they can hold key positions within the chain of command, serving as the primary point of contact between higher-ranking officers and those under their jurisdiction.

While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods. Californians in general tend to have healthier habits, ranking 10th for physical activity, fourth for healthy blood pressure and fifth for a diet high in fruits and vegetables compared with other states, according to America's Health Rankings.  Question: \\"Why do some critics call California the nanny state?\\" Response: \\"They have more nannies per capita\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question. The critics call California a 'nanny state' due to its numerous health and safety laws, not because it has more nannies per capita. These critics believe that the state has an excessive number of regulations that dictate how people should live their lives. They might feel that the state is overstepping its boundaries and acting like a 'nanny'."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction. Your job is follow the instructions as faithfully as you can. While answering think step-by-step and justify your answer. Given a story, answer the question about the story. The question is the last sentence in the input. These stories can be difficult due to their length and how each story has at least one of the three following scenarios: the first is when the individual's belief matches reality, the second is when the individual's belief does not match reality, and the third is when an individual has a false belief about another individual's beliefs. The question will ask about the location of an object in the story with respect to either none or one of the three scenarios. Note that there are distractor sentences in each story that are unrelated to the question and are designed to confuse the reader. Mia entered the bedroom. Jayden entered the bedroom.

Mia enters the lounge, and Charlotte also enters the lounge. Mia knows the current location of the grapefruit because she moved it, but we have no information on Charlotte's knowledge or beliefs about the grapefruit. The question asks where Mia thinks that Charlotte searches for the grapefruit. Since the story doesn't provide any information related to Charlotte's belief or actions, we cannot determine where Mia thinks that Charlotte searches for the grapefruit."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the name of the album on which Glyn Johns was given \\"free rein,\\" as the band had \\"all but washed their hands of the entire project\\"?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Although Let It Be was the Beatles' final album release, it was largely recorded before Abbey Road. The project's impetus came from an idea Martin attributes to McCartney, who suggested they \\"record an album of new material and rehearse it, then perform it before a live audience for the very first time – on record and on film\\". Originally intended for a one-hour television programme to be called Beatles at Work, in the event much of the album's content came from studio work beginning in January 1969, many hours of which were captured on film by director Michael Lindsay-Hogg. Martin has said that the project was \\"not at all a happy recording experience. It was a time when relations between the Beatles were at their lowest ebb.\\" Lennon described the largely impromptu sessions as \\"hell ... the most miserable ... on Earth\\", and Harrison, \\"the low of all-time\\". Irritated by both McCartney and Lennon, Harrison walked out for five days. Upon returning, he threatened to leave the band unless they \\"abandon[ed] all talk of live performance\\" and instead focused on finishing a new album, initially titled Get Back, using songs recorded for the TV special. He also demanded they cease work at Twickenham Film Studios, where the sessions had begun, and relocate to the newly finished Apple Studio. The other band members agreed, and the idea came about to salvage the footage shot for the TV production for use in a feature film. In an effort to alleviate tensions within the band and improve the quality of their live sound, Harrison invited keyboardist Billy Preston to participate in the last nine days of sessions. Preston received label billing on the \\"Get Back\\" single – the only musician ever to receive that acknowledgment on an official Beatles release. At the conclusion of the rehearsals, the band could not agree on a location to film a concert, rejecting several ideas, including a boat at sea, a lunatic asylum, the Tunisian desert, and the Colosseum. Ultimately, what would be their final live performance was filmed on the...

In 1878 a hardened American gunfighter arrives in a small town in the foothills of the Canadian Rockies, a place that doesn't understand or appreciate the brutal code of the American Wild West. Gunslinger Sean Lafferty, known as the Montana Kid, has a bounty on his head for killing eleven people across the western United States.  He arrives in town on his horse, riding backwards, bound, with a noose around his neck, and dragging the broken tree branch over which a group had tried to hang him on the American side of the border. After being helped off his horse by a young Chinese girl named Adell, he begins to explore the town, starting with the town general store. After leaving the store, he finds his horse gone and accuses Jack, the blacksmith, of stealing it, even though Jack was simply replacing the horse's damaged shoes. After unsuccessfully trying to intimidate the blacksmith, the Montana Kid decides to call him out. Since the blacksmith has no gun, though, Sean can't shoot him because the Kid lives by a code of ethics that prevents him from killing unarmed men. When she witnesses this, Jane Taylor, one of the townsfolk, says the Kid can have her broken gun (to fix and give to Jack) if he builds her a windmill. Sean proceeds to go with her and stays in a sod house at her farm, alternately working on the windmill and repairing the gun. After a few days, however, the Kid begins to develop feelings toward Jane while also becoming friends with the townsfolk. In the meantime, a roaming band of American bounty hunters crosses into Canada and heads for the town to claim the price on Sean's head.

Sometimes you will meet fair-weather friends. They will be with you as long as you have money or luck, but when you are down, they will run away. How do I know when I have found a good friend? I look for certain qualities  of character, especially understanding, honesty and reliability . Above all else, I look for understanding in a friend. A good friend tries to understand how another person is feeling. He is not quick to judge. Instead, he tries to learn from others. He puts himself in the other person's place, and he tries to think of ways to be helpful. He is also a good listener. At the same time, however, a good friend is honest. He does not look for faults  in others. He notices their good points. In short, a friend will try to understand me and accept me. Another quality of a friend is reliability. I can always depend on a good friend. If he tells me he will meet me somewhere at a certain time, I can be sure that he will be there. If I need a favor, he will do his best to help me. If I am in trouble, he will not run away from me. There is a fourth quality that makes a friend special. A special friend is someone with whom we can have fun. We should enjoy our lives, and we would enjoy our friendship. That is why I especially like friends who are fun to be with. A good friend likes the same things I like. We share experiences and learn from each other. A good friend has a good sense of humor, too. He likes to laugh with me. That is how we share in the joy of being friends.

Generate a detailed description of this data.","output":"From the data given, we can get quite a clear idea of what Zizzi is and what kind of service they provide.  Zizzi appears to be an establishment categorised as a pub. This classification tells us that Zizzi is fundamentally a social establishment where its main offering is mainly beverages, typically alcoholic -- such as beer, ale, and other spirited drinks. Pubs typically also serve food, often having a specific type of cuisine they specialise in. They are known for their casual, laid-back atmosphere which is great for people looking to unwind, enjoy a drink and have a meal. Which brings us to the more unique aspects of Zizzi as a pub. As per the data provided, Zizzi specialises in Japanese food. Japanese cuisine is one that is highly revered all around the world for its simplicity, freshly sourced ingredients, distinctive flavor profiles, and meticulous presentation. It heavily utilizes seafood, rice, and various types of vegetables in its dishes. This food type includes a wide variety of dishes such as sushi, ramen, tempura, and teriyaki, to name a few. By specializing in this cuisine, Zizzi sets itself apart from traditional pubs which generally serve local or more universally popular Western dishes. In terms of customer ratings, Zizzi appears to hover in the average range. An average rating would suggest that while Zizzi meets customer expectations and provides a satisfactory service, there might be room for improvement. Factors influencing this average rating could be anything from the quality or variety of food and beverage, the ambiance, service, location, or even the price. Lastly, the data indicates that Zizzi is indeed family-friendly. This factor is important to consider as it means that Zizzi caters to customers of all ages. Family-friendly establishments typically provide facilities and services that cater to families with children such as kids' menu, high-chairs, activity sheets, or play areas. This is an important feature that makes the place accessible to a wider range of customers, particularly those with children, thus considerably broadening Zizzi's patronage. In conclusion, Zizzi operates as a unique family-friendly pub that serves Japanese cuisine and has been given an average rating by its customers. The establishment seems to have found a cosy middle-ground between a pub and a restaurant, offering a comfortable venue for every member of the family while also providing unique and potentially exotic Japanese culinary experiences. As is the case with any establishment, there is always room for improvement, and the average customer rating only substantiates this assertion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person who refused Disney's request to rewrite the song for the film Dinosaur? , can you please find it?   Bush starred in the 1990 black comedy film Les Dogs, produced by The Comic Strip for BBC television. Bush plays the bride Angela at a wedding set in a post-apocalyptic Britain. In another Comic Strip Presents film, GLC, she produced and sang on the theme song \\"Ken\\". The song was written about Ken Livingstone, the leader of the Greater London Council and future mayor of London, who at the time was working with musicians to help the Labour Party garner the youth vote.Bush wrote and performed the song \\"The Magician\\", using a fairground-like arrangement, for Menahem Golan's 1979 film The Magician of Lublin. The track was scored and arranged by Michael Kamen. In 1986, she wrote and recorded \\"Be Kind to My Mistakes\\" for the Nicolas Roeg film Castaway. An edited version of this track was used as the B-side to her 1989 single \\"This Woman's Work\\". In 1988, the song \\"This Woman's Work\\" was featured in the John Hughes film She's Having a Baby, and a slightly remixed version appeared on Bush's album The Sensual World. The song has since appeared on television shows, and in 2005 reached number-eight on the UK download chart after featuring in a British television advertisement for the charity NSPCC.In 1999, Bush wrote and recorded a song for the Disney film Dinosaur, but the track was not included on the soundtrack. According to the winter 1999 issue of HomeGround, a Bush fanzine, it was scrapped when Disney asked her to rewrite the song and she refused. Also in 1999, Bush's song \\"The Sensual World\\" was featured prominently in Canadian filmmaker Atom Egoyan's film \\"Felicia's Journey\\".In 2007, Bush was asked to write a song for The Golden Compass soundtrack which made reference to the lead character, Lyra Belacqua. The song, \\"Lyra\\", was used in the closing credits of the film, reached number 187 in the UK Singles Chart and was nominated for the International Press Academy's Satellite Award for original song in a motion picture.

You need to choose the middle part that makes the story less coherent or plausible, by providing the number 1 or 2 as your answer.

Middle 1: She didn't win but she bought more anyway. Middle 2: She won and she bought more. Ending: Hope can be dangerously addictive. We need to decide which middle part makes the story less plausible or coherent. In Middle 1, the woman doesn't win but still buys more lottery scratch-offs, which aligns with the theme of \\"hope can be dangerously addictive.\\" In Middle 2, the woman wins and buys more lottery scratch-offs, showing that she is eager to win more.

Is the premise \\"A few people are on sitting on a train.\\" true if \\"A family waits for the train to depart.\\"?","output":"Whether the premise \\"A few people are sitting on a train\\" can be considered true given the statement \\"A family waits for the train to depart\\" depends on interpreting the context of both sentences and making reasonable assumptions based on that context. If we examine the scenarios, we can infer some connections and speculate to what extent the premise is true or false. Scenario 1: In this situation, the family waiting for the train to depart can be understood as them sitting inside the train, waiting for it to start moving. If we interpret the statement this way, we can assume: - The family consists of a few people. - These few people (the family) are seated in the train. - There might be other passengers on board too. In this case, the premise \\"A few people are sitting on a train\\" is true, as the family waiting for the train to depart indicates their presence inside the train itself. Scenario 2: Alternatively, the statement \\"A family waits for the train to depart\\" might suggest that the family is waiting at the station, not yet aboard the train. In this scenario: - The family consists of a few people. - These few people (the family) are outside the train, perhaps at the platform, waiting for the doors to open or to ensure they're boarding the right train. - Since the family is not yet on the train, we cannot confirm that there are passengers inside. In this case, the premise \\"A few people are sitting on a train\\" is uncertain or indeterminable. We cannot say for sure whether the train currently has passengers sitting inside or not, as the family mentioned is not yet on board. Considering these two scenarios, we can conclude that it is not possible to definitively state whether the premise \\"A few people are sitting on a train\\" is true or false based solely on the statement \\"A family waits for the train to depart.\\" There is an element of uncertainty in the situation, and further details would be necessary to answer with certainty."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The development of a three-field rotation system for planting crops[AA] increased the usage of land from one half in use each year under the old two-field system to two-thirds under the new system, with a consequent increase in production. The development of the heavy plough allowed heavier soils to be farmed more efficiently, aided by the spread of the horse collar, which led to the use of draught horses in place of oxen. Horses are faster than oxen and require less pasture, factors that aided the implementation of the three-field system. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What invention allowed horses rather than oxen to be used to plow?","output":"The invention that allowed horses rather than oxen to be used for plowing was the horse collar. The horse collar is a padded, supportive appliance worn around a horse's neck that distributes the weight of a plow or other draft equipment evenly, allowing the horse to pull heavy loads more efficiently and comfortably. The horse collar was a significant improvement over the traditional yoke used for oxen, which is a wooden beam placed across the animals' necks. Before the development of the horse collar, horses were not as effective at pulling heavy loads like plows compared to oxen. This was largely due to the fact that when a yoke was placed on a horse, it tended to rest on the animal's windpipe, making it difficult for the horse to breathe and seriously limiting its ability to exert force. The horse collar addressed this issue by redistributing the force of the load across a larger surface area around the horse's neck and shoulders, which not only provided more comfort for the horse but also allowed it to generate more power and work for longer periods of time. This increased effectiveness and efficiency ultimately led to the widespread use of horses instead of oxen for plowing and other agricultural tasks. In addition to enabling the use of horses for plowing, the horse collar also had other benefits. Horses, being faster than oxen, were better suited to the three-field rotation system, where the faster plowing of fields was valuable. Horses also required less pasture, which meant that more land could be devoted to growing crops rather than providing grazing land for the draft animals. Overall, the invention of the horse collar played a significant role in the advancements in agriculture during the Middle Ages, as it facilitated the transition from oxen to horses for plowing and other labor-intensive tasks. This, in turn, increased agricultural production and efficiency, as well as made the three-field rotation system more effective, leading to greater food security and prosperity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Trump hits ‘joke candidates’ Paul and Huntsman (CNN) – Donald Trump stoked an ongoing back-and-forth with Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul Monday, dismissing Paul's decision to skip a presidential forum he is set to moderate in December. Trump said the choice by Texas Rep. Paul and rival candidate Jon Huntsman not to attend will result in a better event. \\"I think most candidates are going to join, and I think these two candidates have zero chance of getting elected, so it makes no difference,\\" Trump said Monday on NBC's \\"Today.\\" \\"I think that they are joke candidates and they are doing very poorly.\\" \\"Frankly, it gives more air time to people that really have a chance at getting elected,\\" Trump added. The reality show star, who decided against his own presidential bid in May, is set to host a debate, with the conservative Newsmax magazine Dec. 27 in Iowa, the first-in-the-nation caucus state. Paul and Huntsman are the only candidates thus far to announce they will not attend. The other contenders have yet to formally declare their decisions. Trump's comments comprise the latest jabs between him and Paul, which started during the Conservative Political Action Conference in February. During his speech Trump said Paul, who is making his third bid for the White House, had \\"no chance\\" of winning the GOP presidential nomination. Paul rebutted the remarks at the time and after the debate announcement last week said the Republican Party could be hurt by allowing Trump to moderate the final debate before the Jan. 3 Iowa caucuses. During an appearance on CNN's \\"State of the Union\\" Sunday, the twelve-term congressman told CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley that he doesn't \\"understand the marching to his office.\\" \\"I don't know that he had the ability to lay on hands and anoint people,\\" Paul said. The comments come as former House Speaker Newt Gingrich becomes the fifth potential Republican nominee to visit Trump in New York. Trump said Gingrich's recent rise in national and state-wide polls is due to his blunt and truthful rhetoric. \\"I think one of the reasons he's surging, he's like a rocket ship because of the fact that he says it like it is,\\" Trump said. – CNN Associate Producer Rebecca Stewart contributed to this report.

Question: A long time ago, when humans still lived in cities, on a cold morning near the end of a long, cruel winter, in magnificent Central Park in the middle of magnificent New York City, a young squirrel named Patch was awakened very early by the growls of his empty stomach. A squirrel's home is called a drey. Patch's drey was very comfortable. He lived high up an old oak tree, in a hollowed-out stump of a big branch that had long ago been cut off by humans. The entrance was only just big enough for Patch to squeeze in and out, but the drey itself was spacious, for a squirrel. Patch had lined his drey with dry leaves, grasses and bits of newspaper. It was warm and dry, and on that cold morning he would have liked nothing better than to stay home all day and sleep. But he was so hungry. Hunger filled him like water fills a glass. The cherry and maple trees had not yet started to bud; flowers had not yet begun to grow; the juicy grubs and bugs of spring had not yet emerged; and it had been two days since Patch had found a nut. Imagine how hungry you would feel if you went two whole days without eating, and you may have some idea how Patch felt that morning. Patch poked his head out of the drey into the cold air and shivered as he looked around. Clumps of white, crumbly ice still clung to the ground. Gusts of cold wind shook and rustled the trees' bare branches. The pale and distant sun seemed drained of heat. Patch took a moment to satisfy himself that there were no dangers nearby, no hawk circling above or unleashed dog below. Then he emerged from his drey and began to look for acorns. But what marvels, what miracles, what mysteries are hidden inside those simple words! Question: Why was Patch hungry? Options:  A. not enough information  B. a bird had stolen his food  C. he had given his last nut to another squirrel  D. it was two days since he had found a nut  === The correct answer is Answer:","output":"D. it was two days since he had found a nut"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Once upon a time if we wanted to make a phone call or wait for someone to contact us, we had to sit at home or at our desks. There were public phones in the street of course, _ . And of course you had to bring a lot of coins to pay for the calls. So people didn't phone their friends as often. Mobile phones, these small pieces of electronic equipment which allow us to talk with friends and family while we are on the move, have greatly changed the way we live. Before the age of the mobile phone, our loved ones would sit around worried sick if we were late coming home. There were no quick calls to tell mum that there would be additional guests coming for dinner. We would have to depend on notes left on fridges or desks to communicate messages. But mobile phones have also had a negative effect and what people don't seem to realize is that we've lost something very valuable: our privacy. Now our friends and family can contact us wherever and whenever they want to. We can never get away from them. The way people communicate with each other is totally different now. It's difficult to have a conversation face-to-face with a friend without being disturbed every couple of minutes by the ring of their phones, ,most people don't see anything wrong in having a long conversation on their mobile phone while forgetting all about the person sitting opposite. It seems the art of real conversation may be dying. Of course, people could leave their mobile phones at home or even switch them off but no one ever does that. Why not? Because the worrying thing is we can't live without our phones. We've become communication addicts, unable to spend even a few minutes out of contact, in case we miss something  'important'. What's the writer's main argument against mobile phones? A) They have damaged relationships. B) We give out too much information. C) They are harmful to our body and mind. D) It's impossible to escape from them. The answer is:","output":"D) It's impossible to escape from them. The writer's main argument against mobile phones is that they have invaded our privacy and made it impossible for us to escape from constant communication. The passage highlights how mobile phones have changed the way people communicate and interact, adversely affecting face-to-face conversations and leading to a decline in the art of real conversation. Furthermore, the writer emphasizes that people have become communication addicts, unable to disconnect from their phones in fear of missing something important."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: And once again, high blood pressure is making headlines in the news: the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) have just released new guidelines about hypertension. Since this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I’m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family. By the way, if you’ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines. The core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same: * Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here), * Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014, * And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers “diminishing returns” as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event. (The benefit was even smaller in adults aged 50-75.) Question: After the release of the new AHA guidelines, what is going to happen to the author's patients? Answer: The answer is:","output":"After the release of the new AHA/ACC guidelines, the author does not plan to change their clinical practice or recommendations for their patients. The author will continue to follow the core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults, which include proper measurement of blood pressure, aiming for a blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, and learning more about the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Virgil: At Maecenas' insistence (according to the tradition) Virgil spent the ensuing years (perhaps 37–29 BC) on the long didactic hexameter poem called the Georgics (from Greek, \\"On Working the Earth\\") which he dedicated to Maecenas. The ostensible theme of the Georgics is instruction in the methods of running a farm. In handling this theme, Virgil follows in the didactic (\\"how to\\") tradition of the Greek poet Hesiod's Works and Days and several works of the later Hellenistic poets. The four books of the Georgics focus respectively on raising crops and trees (1 and 2), livestock and horses (3), and beekeeping and the qualities of bees (4). Well-known passages include the beloved Laus Italiae of Book 2, the prologue description of the temple in Book 3, and the description of the plague at the end of Book 3. Book 4 concludes with a long mythological narrative, in the form of an epyllion which describes vividly the discovery of beekeeping by Aristaeus and the story of Orpheus' journey to the underworld. Ancient scholars, such as Servius, conjectured that the Aristaeus episode replaced, at the emperor's request, a long section in praise of Virgil's friend, the poet Gallus, who was disgraced by Augustus, and who committed suicide in 26 BC.

The teams first three years of operation (1960 Oakland Raiders season–1962 Oakland Raiders season) were marred by poor on-field performance, financial difficulties, and spotty attendance. In 1963 Oakland Raiders season, however, the Raiders fortunes improved dramatically with the introduction of head coach (and eventual owner) Al Davis. In 1967 Oakland Raiders season, after several years of improvement, the Raiders reached the postseason for the first time. The team would go on to win its first (and only) 1967 American Football League Championship Game that year; in doing so, the Raiders advanced to Super Bowl II, where they were soundly defeated by the Green Bay Packers. Since 1963, the team has won 15 division titles (three AFL and 12 NFL), four AFC Championships (1976–77 NFL playoffs, 1980–81 NFL playoffs, 1983–84 NFL playoffs, and 2002–03 NFL playoffs), one AFL Championship (1967 American Football League Championship Game), and three Super Bowl Championships (Super Bowl XI, Super Bowl XV, and Super Bowl XVIII). At the end of the NFLs 2017 NFL season, the Raiders boasted a lifetime regular season record of 462 wins, 411 losses, and 11 ties; their lifetime playoff record currently stands at 25 wins and 19 losses.

Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination...  and the situation: PepsiCo has been supplying GMO potato seeds to farmers. Eventually, they buy the potatoes for their chips. On the other hand, Kettle Foods supplied non-GMO potato seeds to their farmers.

By Ted Thornhill PUBLISHED: 08:46 EST, 14 January 2014 | UPDATED: 14:10 EST, 14 January 2014 Prosecutors will seek an indictment against a North Carolina police officer accused of fatally shooting an unarmed man 10 times after he survived a car accident and banged on the door of a nearby house in the middle of the night looking for help. The officer, Randall Kerrick, 27, is charged with voluntary manslaughter in the September shooting of Jonathan Ferrell, a 24-year-old former Florida A&M University football player. Jonathan’s family claim that Ferrell was in a submissive position – either on his knees or lying on the ground – when he was shot, according to NBC News. The autopsy report revealed that the bullets were on a downward trajectory when they struck. Officer Kerrick fired 12 shots at Ferrell, striking","output":"him 10 times, with the autopsy confirming that the majority of the bullets struck him in the chest, with other shots hitting his extremities. As Ferrell was unarmed at the time of the shooting, the family claims that the use of deadly force was not justified and was clearly excessive. The case gained national attention, sparking discussions around police use of force, racial profiling, and the need for enhanced police training and accountability. The grand jury was convened to decide whether or not to indict Officer Kerrick on the charge of voluntary manslaughter. After examining the evidence, including dashcam footage, witness testimonies, and the results of the autopsy, the jury decided that there was enough evidence to proceed with the case against Officer Kerrick. The ensuing trial saw both the prosecution and defense present their case, with the prosecution arguing that Officer Kerrick acted out of excessive fear and without just cause in shooting Ferrell. They discussed how Ferrell was merely seeking help after surviving a car accident and did not pose a threat to Officer Kerrick or anyone else. The defense, on the other hand, argued that Officer Kerrick was only following his training and acted in self-defense, believing that Ferrell was a threat due to his behavior and the circumstances of the incident. The trial took place in a highly charged atmosphere, with the public closely following every development and the family of Jonathan Ferrell pushing for justice. During this time, the family, as well as advocacy groups, called for reforms to avoid similar tragedies, such as improved police training in dealing with unarmed suspects and better overall accountability for officers involved in fatal shootings. Eventually, a verdict was reached in the case, and the jury found Officer Randall Kerrick not guilty of voluntary manslaughter. The verdict was met with a range of reactions, from relief to outrage, as many felt that the trial had not resulted in justice for Jonathan Ferrell. As a result, the ongoing debates surrounding police use of force and accountability continued to grow in intensity, with many questioning whether the criminal justice system is effectively equipped to handle cases involving law enforcement officers who use excessive force. Following the trial, the City of Charlotte settled a lawsuit with Jonathan Ferrell's family for 2.25 million. Additionally, North Carolina lawmakers and police departments across the nation began to make changes to their policies and training procedures in response to this case and other similar incidents. While the events of that fateful night ultimately ended with the tragic and untimely death of Jonathan Ferrell, his story continues to serve as a rallying point for those seeking to reform the criminal justice system and improve police-community relations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Established bands made something of a comeback in the mid-1980s. After an 8-year separation, Deep Purple returned with the classic Machine Head line-up to produce Perfect Strangers (1984), which reached number five in the UK, hit the top five in five other countries, and was a platinum-seller in the US. After somewhat slower sales of its fourth album, Fair Warning, Van Halen rebounded with the Top 3 album Diver Down in 1982, then reached their commercial pinnacle with 1984. It reached number two on the Billboard album chart and provided the track \\"Jump\\", which reached number one on the singles chart and remained there for several weeks. Heart, after floundering during the first half of the decade, made a comeback with their eponymous ninth studio album which hit number one and contained four Top 10 singles including their first number one hit. The new medium of video channels was used with considerable success by bands formed in previous decades. Among the first were ZZ Top, who mixed hard blues rock with new wave music to produce a series of highly successful singles, beginning with \\"Gimme All Your Lovin'\\" (1983), which helped their albums Eliminator (1983) and Afterburner (1985) achieve diamond and multi-platinum status respectively.

When he assumed the position as Thomaskantor (director of church music) in Leipzig in 1723, he began the project to write church cantatas for the occasions of the liturgical year – Sundays and feast days – a project that he pursued for three years.Bach was appointed organist and chamber musician in Weimar at the court of the co-reigning dukes in Saxe-Weimar, Wilhelm Ernst and his nephew Ernst August on 25 June 1708. He had composed sacred cantatas before, some during his tenure in Mühlhausen from 1706 to 1708. Most were written for special occasions and were based mainly on biblical texts and hymns. Examples include: Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir, BWV 131; the early chorale cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4 for Easter; Gott ist mein König, BWV 71, to celebrate the inauguration of the new city council on 4 February 1708; and the Actus Tragicus for a funeral. In Weimar, Bach first concentrated on the organ, composing major works for the instrument, including the Orgelbüchlein, the Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565, and the Prelude and Fugue in E major, BWV 566. Christoph Wolff suggests that Bach may have studied musical material belonging to the Hofkapelle, (\\"court capelle\\" or court orchestra), and that he copied and studied works by Johann Philipp Krieger, Christoph Graupner, Georg Philipp Telemann, Marco Giuseppe Peranda and Johann David Heinichen in the period from 1711 to 1713. In early 1713 Bach composed his first cantatas in the new style that included recitatives and arias: the so-called Hunting Cantata, BWV 208, as a homage cantata for Christian, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels, celebrated on 23 February, and possibly the church cantata for Sexagesima (the second Sunday before Lent) Gleichwie der Regen und Schnee vom Himmel fällt, BWV 18, on a text by Erdmann Neumeister.In 1713, he was asked to apply for the position of music director of the Marktkirche in Halle, succeeding Friedrich Wilhelm Zachow.

They make too much noise in shopping malls; they drive carelessly up and down America's main streets. And at least some of the time those things are true. But we shouldn't forget that there are hard moments in the life of a teenager too. I watched such a moment not long ago at a woman's funeral which happened in a church. A teenage grandson stepped forward. Softly he began:\\"I want to share a few values that Nana taught me. She never failed to see light in any situation. When our family dog would attack her, what would Nana say?

Question: Where would you put a folding chair if you do not plan to use it and you do not have any large doors in your house? Options:  A. roof  B. school  C. beach  D. closet  E. garage The answer is:","output":"D. closet The most reasonable and practical option among the given choices for storing a folding chair when not in use and without large doors in your home is inside a closet. There are several reasons for this choice, which are outlined below. A. Roof - Storing a folding chair on the roof is not a feasible option, as it would necessitate climbing onto the roof and securing the chair to prevent it from falling or being blown away by the wind. Additionally, constant exposure to the elements (sun, rain, snow) could cause the chair to deteriorate over time, rendering it less reliable when you eventually plan to use it.  B. School - Presumably, the school is not your property, and storing a personal item there would be inappropriate. Also, even if someone at the school permitted you to store your folding chair on their property, it would not be a convenient choice, as you would have to carry the chair to the school and retrieve it each time you wish to use it.  C. Beach - Similar to the roof option, storing a folding chair on the beach would expose it to the elements, such as sun, sand, wind, and sea spray. Furthermore, leaving your chair on public property like a beach could result in it being damaged, stolen, or discarded.  D. Closet - Placing a folding chair inside a closet is a common-sense solution because it keeps the chair safe from the elements and out of sight when not in use, while also affording easy access when needed. Closets typically provide enough storage space for a folding chair due to their vertical storage capacity. Additionally, storing the chair in a closet helps maintain an organized living space.  E. Garage - While a garage may also be a suitable option, it is not always available as not all homes have a garage. Furthermore, garages often contain vehicles, tools, and other large equipment, which might result in less space for odds and ends such as folding chairs. A cluttered garage can make it difficult to locate and access the chair, whereas keeping it inside a closet ensures it's easier to find and retrieve. Ultimately, the most practical option for storing a folding chair when not in use and without large doors in your home is within a closet. It offers protection from environmental factors, ensures accessibility and orderliness, and maintains an organized living space."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is \\"The Commission was greatly overshadowed by the insistence of John XXIII to have the Council complete all its work in one single session before Christmas 1962, to the 400th anniversary of the Council of Trent, an insistence which may have also been influenced by the Pope's recent knowledge that he had cancer.\\" the correct answer? Available options:  - yes  - no","output":"No, the answer to your question about the year when Montini was appointed to the Central Preparatory Commission is not provided in the statement you mentioned. That statement is related to the Second Vatican Council and the expectations of Pope John XXIII regarding the time frame in which the Council's work should be completed. The context is relevant, but it doesn't provide the specific year you're looking for. Now, for the correct answer: Giovanni Battista Montini, the future Pope Paul VI, was appointed to the Central Preparatory Commission in 1960. The Central Preparatory Commission was responsible for preparing the documents and topics to be discussed during the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965). Pope John XXIII established the commission to ensure a comprehensive and well-organized agenda for the Council, and he chose Montini due to the latter's experience and reputation as a diplomat and a theologian. Montini played a critical role in shaping the work of the Second Vatican Council, especially in its early stages. His appointment to the Central Preparatory Commission alongside other key figures in the Catholic Church at the time illustrates the importance that Pope John XXIII placed on the Council as a significant event in the modern history of the Church. Giovanni Battista Montini's work within the Central Preparatory Commission allowed him to contribute significantly to the drafting, amending, and approval of the documents that would eventually be voted upon and promulgated during the Second Vatican Council sessions. Montini's experience and insight also influenced the Council's approach to the Church's relationship with the modern world and its commitment to social justice, as well as the promotion of unity among Christian denominations and various religious traditions. Ultimately, Montini's appointment to the Central Preparatory Commission in 1960 marked an important milestone in his career within the Catholic Church, as he would later be elected Pope in 1963, taking the name Pope Paul VI, and continuing to implement the reforms and teachings established during the Second Vatican Council."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I read this background article the other day: The body's second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue.  I am facing a new situation today: A team of researchers named Alpha did some research on the inflammatory response in humans for a science contest. A competing team called Omega did research on the human genome. Team Omega lost.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which team studied more about bacteria entering the skin through a scrape?","output":"Based on the information provided, Team Alpha studied more about bacteria entering the skin through a scrape. This is because their research focused on the inflammatory response in humans, which is a direct reaction to infections or injuries, such as bacteria entering the skin through a scrape. The inflammatory response involves increased blood flow, redness, warmth, and the attraction of white blood cells to the damaged area, all of which are relevant to understanding how the body deals with bacteria entering the skin. On the other hand, Team Omega focused their research on the human genome, which is a broader topic related to the entirety of an individual's genetic information. While the human genome may have some connection to the immune response, it does not specifically focus on the body's reaction to bacteria entering the skin through a scrape.

Given the question: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem.

Q: If I tell you that The largest organ in the body can be used for detecting texture, and ask you the question \\"what can be used for detecting texture?\\", is the correct answer \\"encoded information\\"? A:","output":"No, the correct answer is not \\"encoded information.\\" When the statement refers to the largest organ in the body used for detecting texture, it is referring to the skin. The human skin serves numerous functions, one of which is serving as a sensory organ that enables us to perceive or detect various sensations, including texture. The skin contains different types of sensory nerve receptors, also known as mechanoreceptors, which are responsible for detecting various mechanical stimuli like touch, pressure, and vibration. These receptors are widely distributed in our skin and play a crucial role in providing sensory information that our brain interprets. When it comes to detecting texture, the skin primarily relies on two types of these specialized receptors - the Merkel cells and the Meissner's corpuscles. Merkel cells, which are found in the epidermis, respond to light touch and pressure, thus helping us perceive fine details of an object or surface. Meissner's corpuscles, located in the dermis, are sensitive to light touch and vibrations, enabling us to discern the texture of different materials. When you touch something, these nerve endings create nerve impulses that travel through the nervous system to the brain. The brain then interprets this information, allowing us to perceive the texture of the object. In summary, the correct answer to the question, \\"what can be used for detecting texture?\\" would be \\"the skin,\\" specifically due to the presence and function of specialized nerve receptors, such as Merkel cells and Meissner's corpuscles.

On the night of 13/14 November, 77 He 111s of Kampfgeschwader 26 (26th Bomber Wing, or KG 26) bombed London while 63 from KG 55 hit Birmingham. The next night, a large force hit Coventry. \\"Pathfinders\\" from 12 Kampfgruppe 100 (Bomb Group 100 or KGr 100) led 437 bombers from KG 1, KG 3, KG 26, KG 27, KG 55 and Lehrgeschwader 1 (1st Training Wing, or LG 1) which dropped 394 short tons (357 t) of high explosive, 56 short tons (51 t) of incendiaries, and 127 parachute mines. Other sources say 449 bombers and a total of 530 short tons (480 t) of bombs were dropped. The raid against Coventry was particularly devastating, and led to widespread use of the phrase \\"to conventrate\\". Over 10,000 incendiaries were dropped. Around 21 factories were seriously damaged in Coventry, and loss of public utilities stopped work at nine others, disrupting industrial output for several months. Only one bomber was lost, to anti-aircraft fire, despite the RAF flying 125 night sorties. No follow up raids were made, as OKL underestimated the British power of recovery (as Bomber Command would do over Germany from 1943–1945). The Germans were surprised by the success of the attack.

Question: What may be the reason they were afraid to look at it ?","output":"To determine the possible reason why the individual was afraid to look at the message from Nick, let's analyze the context step-by-step. Step 1: Understand the context The user talks about someone who was crying the night before and then mentions checking their MySpace after Facebook, where they found a message from Nick. Step 2: Identify the emotional state The individual expresses fear or apprehension about looking at the message from Nick. Step 3: Consider possible reasons for the fear Since we don't have any specific information about Nick or the relationship between the individual and Nick, we can only speculate on possible reasons for the fear. Here are some potential reasons: 1. The individual might have had a recent disagreement or conflict with Nick, making them anxious about the content of the message. 2. The user could be worried that the message is related to the person who was crying, indicating that the situation might not be resolved. 3. Maybe the individual knows that Nick tends to deliver bad news or has a reputation for causing conflicts, leading to fear about the content of the message. 4. The user could be feeling vulnerable, perhaps due to recent events or emotional instability, making them sensitive and afraid to read potentially upsetting messages. Without further information, it is not possible to determine the exact reason. However, these possible scenarios provide a general idea of the factors that might be contributing to the fear of looking at the message from Nick."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Phoenix The answer is:","output":"Title: The Rise of the Phoenix Genre: Superhero/Action/Adventure/Drama Plot: The movie opens in a remote and secretive laboratory where powerful mutants are being studied and experimented upon. The main antagonist, Dr. Nathaniel Essex (Mister Sinister), is a mutant expert and mad scientist obsessed with studying and unlocking the potential of powerful mutants. He stumbles upon a method to extract and transfer the powers of one mutant to another and plans to become unstoppable by acquiring the unique abilities of many mutants. In the meanwhile, Logan (Wolverine) continues to lead his retired life away from the rest of the X-Men. He begrudgingly agrees to train a new recruit, under the tutelage of Professor Charles Xavier. This new recruit, an orphan teenage girl named Samantha, has displayed unique powers that the X-Men have never seen before. Unbeknownst to them, Samantha is the daughter of Jean Grey and Scott Summers (Cyclops), and she inherited a dark presence hidden within her - The Phoenix Force. As Logan and Samantha train and bond, he becomes protective of her, coming to care for her as he did with other young mutants he has mentored in the past. During a visit to Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters for Samantha's evaluation, Professor X realizes that Samantha carries the Phoenix Force within her, unbeknownst to her. Fearing the devastating consequences of unleashing the Phoenix Force, he warns Logan to keep a close eye on Samantha, while they find a way to safely suppress the power within her. In the meantime, news of Samantha's powers and her connection to the Phoenix Force reaches Dr. Essex through his network of underground mutants. Sensing an opportunity to unlock unprecedented power, Essex decides to attack the X-Men and kidnap Samantha. The Phoenix Force, which is steadily growing more and more aware within Samantha, starts to emerge erratically in response to the threats, causing Samantha to struggle with containing and controlling this immensely destructive power. Desperate to save Samantha from falling victim to the darkness within her, as had her mother before her, Logan, along with the X-Men, devises a plan to thwart Dr. Essex's life-threatening advances. During an intense rescue mission, Logan engages Essex, who is now a powerful and seemingly unstoppable foe from the various mutant abilities he has absorbed. As the battle escalates, Logan is critically injured and left with no other choice but to call upon Samantha for help. Despite the danger involved, Samantha decides to tap into the Phoenix Force to aid Logan and stop Essex. The Phoenix emerges at Samantha's emotional peak and, in a high-powered, emotional scene, it knocks out Logan in the process of subduing Dr. Essex. Logan, witnessing Samantha's struggle against the darkness within her, finds the strength to rise back into action and helps Samantha regain control over the Phoenix Force, all while fighting and defeating Essex. During the process, Logan teaches Samantha the importance of embracing her power and wielding it responsively. In the aftermath of the film, Samantha decides to join the X-Men, while Professor Xavier and Logan embark on a mission to uncover more about the Phoenix Force and its connection to Samantha's mutant lineage. With Samantha's addition to the team, the X-Men are stronger than ever, ready to face new challenges and protect mutants and humankind alike. The Rise of the Phoenix explores themes of family, mentorship, the power of self-acceptance, and, above all, the resilience and strength it takes to overcome one's inner darkness."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Norman Clifford Louis O'Neill OAM (19 February 1937 - 3 March 2008) was a cricketer who played for New South Wales and Australia. A right-handed batsman known for his back foot strokeplay, O'Neill made his state debut aged 18, before progressing to Test selection aged 21 in late 1958. Early in his career, O'Neill was one of the foremost batsmen in the Australian team, scoring three Test centuries and topping the run scoring aggregates on a 1959-60 tour of the Indian subcontinent which helped Australia win its last Test and series on Pakistani soil for 39 years, as well as another series in India. His career peaked in 1960-61 when he scored 181 in the Tied Test against the West Indies, and at the end of the series, had a career average of 58.25. Standing six feet tall, O'Neill was compared to Don Bradman upon his entry into Test cricket. At his best, he was a dynamic stroke maker who was a crowd favourite because of his ability to score at a high pace, in particular with his power off the back foot. He was noted for his nimble footwork, which he used to negate spin bowling; however this slowed in his later career as he put on weight. O'Neill particularly liked to sweep the slower bowlers. He often put too much emphasis on his right hand, allowing a large space between his hands on the bat handle, and then turning his right shoulder too square towards the bowler. The renowned English batsman and captain Wally Hammond said that O'Neill was the best all-round batsman he had seen since World War II. O'Neill's tall build, strength and good looks also drew comparison to his boyhood idol Keith Miller. Despite the comparisons to Bradman, O'Neill was much taller and broader, and was often impetuous whereas Bradman was known for his patience and lack of rashness. O'Neill was also criticised for hitting across the line early in his innings.  O'Neill was highly regarded for his style and entertainment values. Teammate Alan Davidson said \\"once set he was the most exhilarating player you'd ever want to see--he was dynamite. He'd play attacking shots off balls other people would only think of defending. He had wonderful skill and technique. His shots off the back foot down the ground off fast bowlers--you can't really describe how good they were.\\" His captain for Australia and New South Wales, Richie Benaud said that he was \\"one of the greatest entertainers we've had in Australian cricket\\". O'Neill's style led the British writer EW Swanton to say \\"the art of batting, he reminded us, was not dead, merely inexplicably dormant\\" Wisden opined that \\"A high innings by O'Neill is a thing of masterful beauty. His stroking is delectable, immense in its power.\\"  Later in his career, O'Neill became a nervous and superstitious batsman, particular at the start of an innings. He wrote \\"batting is a lonely business\\" in his 1964 autobiography Ins and Outs, opining that he sometimes found first-class cricket to be \\"depressing and lonely\\".  He was regarded as an excellent fieldsman at cover, with a powerful and accurate throw, described by Wisden as a \\"dream throw\\" honed from a junior career as a baseballer. He was named as utility player in the 1957 All Australian baseball team, and his ability was such that he was approached by Major League Baseball scouts. Before the retirement of Neil Harvey, he and O'Neill fielded in tandem in the covers and the pair were regarded as the finest fielding combination of the time.","output":"This text is about Norman Clifford Louis O'Neill, who was a famous Australian cricket player.

Johnny Hooker, a grifter in Joliet, Illinois, cons 11,000 in cash (187,600 today) in a pigeon drop from an unsuspecting victim with the aid of his partners Luther Coleman and Joe Erie. Buoyed by the windfall, Luther announces his retirement and advises Hooker to seek out an old friend, Henry Gondorff, in Chicago to teach him \\"the big con\\". Unfortunately, their victim was a numbers racket courier for vicious crime boss Doyle Lonnegan. Corrupt Joliet police Lieutenant William Snyder confronts Hooker, revealing Lonnegan's involvement and demanding part of Hookerâs cut. Having already spent his share, Hooker pays Snyder in counterfeit bills. Lonnegan's men murder both the courier and Luther, and Hooker flees for his life to Chicago. Hooker finds Henry Gondorff, a once-great con-man now hiding from the FBI, and asks for his help in taking on the dangerous Lonnegan. Gondorff is initially reluctant, but he relents and recruits a core team of experienced con men to con Lonnegan. They decide to resurrect an elaborate and supposedly obsolete scam known as \\"the wire\\", using a larger crew of con artists to create a phony off-track betting parlor. Aboard the opulent 20th Century Limited, Gondorff, posing as boorish Chicago bookie Shaw, buys into Lonnegan's private, high-stakes poker game. Shaw infuriates Lonnegan with his obnoxious behavior, then out-cheats him to win 15,000. Hooker, posing as Shaw's disgruntled employee, Kelly, is sent to collect the winnings and instead convinces Lonnegan that he wants to take over Shaw's operation. Kelly reveals that he has a partner named Les Harmon (actually con man Kid Twist) in the Chicago Western Union office, who will allow them to win bets on horse races by past-posting. Meanwhile, Snyder has tracked Hooker to Chicago, but his pursuit is thwarted when he is summoned by undercover FBI agents led by Agent Polk, who orders him to assist in their plan to arrest Gondorff using Hooker.

Information:  - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.  - Alan Dean Foster (born November 18, 1946) is an American writer of fantasy and science fiction, a prolific creator of and contributor to book series as well as the author of more than 20 standalone novels. He is especially prolific in his novelizations of film scripts.  - Orphan Star ( 1977 ) is a science fiction novel written by Alan Dean Foster . The book is Foster 's eighteenth published book , his fifth original novel , and is chronologically the third entry in the Pip and Flinx series . Bloodhype ( 1973 ) was the second novel to include Pip and Flinx , but it is eleventh chronologically in the series and the two characters had a relatively small part in that novel 's plot .  - Del Rey Books is a branch of Ballantine Books, which is owned by Random House and, in turn, by Penguin Random House. It is a separate imprint established in 1977 under the editorship of author Lester del Rey and his wife Judy-Lynn del Rey. It specializes in science fiction and fantasy books, and formerly manga under its (now defunct) Del Rey Manga imprint. It publishes the \\"Star Wars\\" novels under the LucasBooks imprint (licensed from Lucasfilm, a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Studios division of The Walt Disney Company).  - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.  - The Humanx Commonwealth is a fictional interstellar ethical/political entity featured in the science fiction novels of Alan Dean Foster. The Commonwealth takes its name from its two major sapient species, who jointly inhabit Commonwealth planets and administer both the political and religious/ethical aspects. They are the mammalian Humans of the planet Earth and the insectoid Thranx which dwell upon Hivehom. The Commonwealth is described as a progressive, well-intentioned liberal democracy spanning many star systems, and is somewhat similar to the United Federation of Planets from \\"Star Trek\\". The Humanx Commonwealth is notable for its portrayal of a humanalien relationship that is not just mutually beneficial but symbiotic, allowing an amalgamation of the two species.  - Bloodhype (1973) is a science fiction novel written by Alan Dean Foster. The book is eleventh chronologically in the Pip and Flinx series, though it was written second, and it is an oddity for the characters since they only appear in the last third of the book. Foster originally started the novel as a stand-alone work, but was encouraged by his publishers to include the characters from his previous novel. Although it was written as a second novel, it logically falls -after- Orphan Star, where he meets the aliens who build him his ship, the Teacher.  - Philip Lynx, known by the nickname of \\"Flinx,\\" is a fictional character, an adventurous young man with unusual qualities in a series of books set in the \\"Humanx Commonwealth\\", written by Alan Dean Foster and published by Del Rey Books.  - A novelization (or novelisation) is a derivative novel that adapts the story of a work created for another medium, such as a film, TV series, comic strip or video game. Film novelizations were particularly popular before the advent of home video, but continue to find commercial success as part of marketing campaigns for major films. They are often written by accomplished writers based on an early draft of the film's script and on a tight deadline.    After reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'orphan star' exhibits the relationship of 'publisher'. Find the answer from the choices below.

It was acquired and merged with Canadian media giant Entertainment One to become Entertainment One Philippines.    What is the relationship between 'mn ' and 'philippines'? Answer:","output":"The relationship between 'MN' and 'Philippines' lies in the fact that 'MN' is a 1954 Filipino movie produced by Sampaguita Pictures, a Philippine film production company. The film is set in the Philippines and features prominent Filipino actors and actresses of that time, including Carmen Rosales, Oscar Moreno, Alicia Vergel, César Ramírez, and Aruray.

During an age of tremendous expansion in higher education, Porter resisted the rise of the new research university, claiming that an eager embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education. Many of Porter's contemporaries criticized his administration, and historians since have disparaged his leadership. Levesque argues Porter was not a simple-minded reactionary, uncritically committed to tradition, but a principled and selective conservative. He did not endorse everything old or reject everything new; rather, he sought to apply long-established ethical and pedagogical principles to a rapidly changing culture.

Information:  - Slovenia, officially the Republic of Slovenia (Slovene: , abbr.: \\"RS\\"), is a nation state in southern Central Europe, located at the crossroads of main European cultural and trade routes. It is bordered by Italy to the west, Austria to the north, Hungary to the northeast, Croatia to the south and southeast, and the Adriatic Sea to the southwest. It covers and has a population of 2.06 million. It is a parliamentary republic and a member of the United Nations, European Union, and NATO. The capital and largest city is Ljubljana.  - A mediterranean climate or dry summer climate is the climate typical of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin. The lands around the Mediterranean Sea form the largest area where this climate type is found, but it also is found in most of coastal California, in parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa, sections of Central Asia, and in central Chile.  - Nola is an ancient Campanian town and a modern municipality in the Metropolitan City of Naples in Italy . It lies on the plain between Mount Vesuvius and the Apennines . It is traditionally credited as diocese that introduced bells to Christian worship . Illegal dumping of toxic wastes by the Camorra , however , has turned the surrounding area into a \`\` Triangle of Death '' , with cancer rates far above the European average .  - A boot is a type of footwear and a specific type of shoe. Most boots mainly cover the foot and the ankle, while some also cover some part of the lower calf. Some boots extend up the leg, sometimes as far as the knee or even the hip. Most boots have a heel that is clearly distinguishable from the rest of the sole, even if the two are made of one piece. Traditionally made of leather or rubber, modern boots are made from a variety of materials. Boots are worn both for their functionality  protecting the foot and leg from water, extreme cold, mud or hazards (e.g., work boots may protect wearers from chemicals or use a steel toe) or providing additional ankle support for strenuous activities with added traction requirements (e.g., hiking)  and for reasons of style and fashion.  - Mount Vesuvius ( also \\"Vesevus\\" or \\"Vesaevus\\" in some Roman sources) is a somma-stratovolcano located on the Gulf of Naples in Campania, Italy, about east of Naples and a short distance from the shore. It is one of several volcanoes which form the Campanian volcanic arc. Vesuvius consists of a large cone partially encircled by the steep rim of a summit caldera caused by the collapse of an earlier and originally much higher structure.  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean.

Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - A secret society is a club or an organization whose activities, events, and inner functioning are concealed from non-members. The society may or may not attempt to conceal its existence. The term usually excludes covert groups, such as intelligence agencies or guerrilla insurgencies, that hide their activities and memberships but maintain a public presence. The exact qualifications for labeling a group a secret society are disputed, but definitions generally rely on the degree to which the organization insists on secrecy, and might involve the retention and transmission of secret knowledge, the denial of membership or knowledge of the group, the creation of personal bonds between members of the organization, and the use of secret rites or rituals which solidify members of the group.  - Naples (Neapolitan: \\"Napule\\" or ;  meaning \\"new city\\") is the capital of the Italian region Campania and the third-largest municipality in Italy, after Rome and Milan. In 2015, around 975,260 people lived within the city's administrative limits. The Metropolitan City of Naples had a population of 3,115,320. Naples is the 9th-most populous urban area in the European Union with a population of between 3 million and 3.7 million. About 4.4 million people live in the Naples metropolitan area, one of the largest metropolises on the Mediterranean Sea.  - Vatican City , officially Vatican City State or the State of Vatican City, is a walled enclave within the city of Rome. With an area of approximately 44 hectares (110 acres), and a population of 842, it is the smallest State in the world by both area and population, but formally it is not sovereign, sovereignty being held by the Holy See, the only entity of public international law that has diplomatic relations with almost every country in the world.  - Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a federal republic in Europe. It consists of 26 cantons, and the city of Bern is the seat of the federal authorities.  The country is situated in Western-Central Europe, and is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva.  - San Marino, officially the Republic of San Marino, also known as the Most Serene Republic of San Marino, is an enclaved microstate surrounded by Italy, situated on the Italian Peninsula on the northeastern side of the Apennine Mountains.

San Marino has the smallest population of all the members of the Council of Europe.  - The Naples metropolitan area is a metropolitan area in Campania, Italy, centered on the city of Naples. With a population of around 4 million, it's the third most populous metropolitan area on the European part of Mediterranean coast (after Barcelona and Athens), and one of the biggest metropolises in Europe.  - The Gulf of Naples , also called the Bay of Naples, is a roughly 15-kilometer-wide (9.3 mi) gulf located along the south-western coast of Italy (province of Naples, Campania region). It opens to the west into the Mediterranean Sea. It is bordered on the north by the cities of Naples and Pozzuoli, on the east by Mount Vesuvius, and on the south by the Sorrentine Peninsula and the main town of the peninsula, Sorrento. The Peninsula separates the Gulf of Naples from the Gulf of Salerno, which includes the Amalfi coast.  - The Mediterranean Sea (pronounced ) is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land: on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia, on the south by North Africa, and on the east by the Levant. The sea is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean, although it is usually identified as a separate body of water.  - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state.  - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.  - Campania is a region in Southern Italy. The region at the end of 2014 had a population of around 5,869,000 people, making it the third-most-populous region of Italy; its total area of makes it the most densely populated region in the country. Located on the Italian Peninsula, with the Mediterranean Sea to the west, it includes the small Phlegraean Islands and Capri for administration as part of the region.  - A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface.  - The Campanian volcanic arc is a volcanic arc that consists of a number of active, dormant, and extinct volcanoes in the Campania region of Italy. The Campanian volcanic arc centers on the bay of Naples and includes: \\"Campanian volcanic arc\\" is somewhat a term of convenience, since the area is part of the same large area of intense volcanic and seismic activity that includes, further to the south, the active island volcanoes of Stromboli, and Vulcano off the north coast of Sicily and even the largest active volcano in Europe, Mt. Etna, on Sicily itself.  - The Camorra is an Italian Mafia-type crime syndicate, or secret society, which arose in the region of Campania and its capital Naples. It is one of the oldest and largest criminal organizations in Italy, dating back to the 16th century. Unlike the pyramidal structure of the Sicilian Mafia, the Camorra's organizational structure is more horizontal than vertical. Consequently, individual Camorra clans act independently of each other, and are more prone to feuding among themselves.  - The Sicilian Mafia, also known as simply the Mafia or Cosa Nostra (\\"Our thing\\"), is a criminal syndicate in Sicily, Italy. It is a loose association of criminal groups that share a common organisational structure and code of conduct. The basic group is known as a \\"family\\", \\"clan\\", or \\"\\"cosca\\"\\" or \\"cosche\\" in Sicilian. Each family claims sovereignty over a territory, usually a town or village or a neighbourhood (\\"borgata\\") of a larger city, in which it operates its rackets. Its members call themselves \\"men of honour\\", although the public often refers to them as \\"mafiosi\\". The mafia's core activities are protection racketeering, the arbitration of disputes between criminals, and the organizing and oversight of illegal agreements and transactions.  - A caldera is a large cauldron-like depression that forms following the evacuation of a magma chamber/reservoir. When large volumes of magma are erupted over a short time period, structural support for the crust above the magma chamber is lost. The ground surface then collapses downward into the partially emptied magma chamber, leaving a massive depression at the surface (from one to dozens of kilometers in diameter). Although sometimes described as a crater, the feature is actually a type of sinkhole, as it is formed through subsidence and collapse rather than an explosion or impact. Only seven known caldera-forming collapses have occurred since the start of the 20th century, most recently at Bárðarbunga volcano in Iceland.  - A parliamentary republic is a republic that operates under a parliamentary system of government where the executive branch (the government) derives its legitimacy from and is accountable to the legislature (the parliament). There are a number of variations of parliamentary republics. Most have a clear differentiation between the head of government and the head of state, with the head of government holding real power, much like constitutional monarchies. Some have combined the roles of head of state and head of government, much like presidential systems, but with a dependency upon parliamentary power.  - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states.   - A stratovolcano, also known as a composite volcano, is a conical volcano built up by many layers (strata) of hardened lava, tephra, pumice, and volcanic ash. Unlike shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes are characterized by a steep profile and periodic explosive eruptions and effusive eruptions, although some have collapsed craters called calderas. The lava flowing from stratovolcanoes typically cools and hardens before spreading far due to high viscosity. The magma forming this lava is often felsic, having high-to-intermediate levels of silica (as in rhyolite, dacite, or andesite), with lesser amounts of less-viscous mafic magma. Extensive felsic lava flows are uncommon, but have travelled as far as .  - MILAN (\\"milan(e)\\" is French for kite) is a European anti-tank guided missile. Design of the MILAN started in 1962, it was ready for trials in 1971, and was accepted for service in 1972. It is a wire guided SACLOS (semi-automatic command to line-of-sight) missile, which means the sight of the launch unit has to be aimed at the target to guide the missile. The MILAN can be equipped with a MIRA or MILIS thermal sight to give it night-firing ability.  - The euro (sign: €; code: EUR) is the official currency of the eurozone, which consists of 19 of the member states of the European Union: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. The currency is also officially used by the institutions of the European Union and four other European countries, as well as unilaterally by two others, and is consequently used daily by some 337 million Europeans . Outside of Europe, a number of overseas territories of EU members also use the euro as their currency.

If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\".  Question: Who is Corky unwilling to kill? Movie title: Magic Movie plot: Charles \\"Corky\\" Withers has just failed in his first attempt at professional magic. His mentor \\"Merlin\\" (E.J.AndrÃ©) says that he needs to have a better show business gimmick. A year later, Corky comes back as a combination magician and ventriloquist with a foul-mouthed dummy named Fats and is a huge success. His powerful agent Ben Greene is on the verge of signing Corky for his own television show, but Corky bails out for the Catskills, where he grew up, claiming to be \\"afraid of success.\\" In truth, he does not want to take the TV network's required medical examination because doctors might find out that he suffers from severe issues, and that even off-stage he cannot control Fats (a manifestation of Corky's id). In the Catskills, he reunites with his high-school crush, Peggy Ann Snow, who is stuck in a passionless marriage with Corky's friend from high school, Duke. A magic trick with a deck of cards charms Peg into thinking they are soulmates. She and Corky make love, which sparks the jealousy not only of Peggy's tough-guy husband but also the dummy Fats. Greene arrives unexpectedly, having tracked Corky down. After a tense confrontation, in which Greene discovers the truth about Corky's mental state, the agent demands that Corky get help. Fats, however, convinces Corky to kill Greene. Corky does this by using Fats' hard, wooden head. He then removes all of Greene's identification and drags the corpse to the lake. When Corky tries to dispose of the body, however, Greene suddenly lunges at him, still alive. Corky, after an intense fight, manages to drown him. The next morning, Fats becomes even more possessive and jealous when Corky says that he plans to leave Fats behind so that he and Peggy can honeymoon by themselves. Duke returns from his trip earlier than expected. He suspects his wife cheated on him and wants to have a talk with Corky on the lake. Rather than confront him, Duke awkwardly confides to Corky that he loves Peggy and is worried about losing her. Duke suddenly spots a dead body on the edge... Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"Magic,\\" Corky is unwilling to kill his high-school friend Duke, despite Fats' possessiveness and jealousy stemming from Corky's romantic relationship with Peggy, Duke's wife. Throughout the film, Corky struggles with controlling Fats, who acts as an embodiment of his id, expressing Corky's subconscious desires and urges. Corky's severe psychological issues become more apparent as the movie progresses, revealing that his inability to control Fats is both a sign of his deteriorating mental state and an indication of the extent to which his fear of failure and success impacts his life. His avoidance of the medical examination required for a potential television show highlights these issues, preventing him from achieving professional success and greater public exposure. As the movie's plot unfolds, Corky and Peggy's romantic involvement ultimately results in a complicated love triangle with Duke. This further intensifies Fats' jealousy, causing the dummy to push Corky towards increasingly violent actions. Despite this pressure, Corky hesitates to kill his old friend, demonstrating that he still maintains some remnants of his original, more rational personality. In the thrilling climax, Duke returns from his trip and suspects that Peggy has cheated on him with Corky. The tension between the characters comes to a head when Duke finds the dead body of Corky's agent, Ben Greene, whom Corky killed under Fats' influence. This moment presents a pivotal opportunity for Corky to determine whether he will continue to allow Fats to control him and lead him down the path of destruction or gain the strength to assert control over his id and live a more emotionally healthy life. In deciding not to harm Duke and resisting Fats' urgings to kill his friend, Corky exhibits a strong sense of morality and loyalty to those he cares about. Although he is forced to confront his severe psychological issues and the consequences of his violent actions, Corky's unwillingness to kill Duke can be seen as a significant turning point in the story, which may encourage viewers to root for the struggling protagonist despite his flaws. In conclusion, considering the complex emotions and themes explored in the movie \\"Magic,\\" the film proposal appears to be a thought-provoking venture that delves into the darker aspects of human psychology, relationships, and the struggle for control over one's actions. The intriguing plot and Corky's journey as a character, both professionally and personally, make it a potential investment worth considering for its captivating narrative and potential for stimulating discussions among audiences. The ultimate deciding factor will depend on the financial feasibility and the other aspects of the movie-making process, such as the attached talent and production crew, which may drive the film's overall success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A source told People that the Donald Trump surrogate will meet with stations, create a pilot episode and then sell it.      Warm Springs, the Montana-based production company Palin reportedly signed with, approached the controversial former politician with the idea last year. The production team will include a TV executive who discovered judges Judy Sheindlin and Joe Brown, both of whom hosted their own eponymous courtroom shows.      The show hasn’t been named yet, but it is expected to premiere as a nationally syndicated daytime show.      Palin is no stranger to reality TV. She hosted, “Sarah Palin’s Alaska,” a show that broadcast for one season on TLC in 2010 and 2011. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| Move over, Judge Judy. There could be a new TV courtroom judge coming to town – and it’s none other than former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin.      The onetime vice presidential candidate has been tapped to preside over a planned reality court show that would premiere next year, if it gets picked up by stations. She signed a deal in February with Montana-based production company Warm Springs, a source close to the process tells PEOPLE.      “It’s a production deal,” the source explains. “What happens next is she’ll meet with stations, make a pilot and sell it.”      Warm Springs first approached Palin with the idea in 2015 and has since put together a team that includes the TV executive who found Judge Judy and Judge Joe Brown.      Unlike the two famous TV judges, Palin does not have a juris doctor degree. But the source notes that the bestselling author has a variety of other qualities that make her perfectly suited to the job.      “Palin’s telegenic personality, wide appeal and common sense wisdom make her a natural for this kind of format and she was Warm Springs’ top pick for this project.”      The as-yet-untitled show would premiere as a nationwide syndicated daytime show in the fall of 2017, the source adds.      Palin is currently in Alaska caring for her husband, Todd, who’s transitioning from intensive care following a serious snowmachine accident on March 13. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Sarah Palin, a famous politician from Alaska, is going to be on a television show where she will act as a judge in a courtroom, kind of like another show called \\"Judge Judy.\\" The people who make this show think she will be good at it because she's good at talking on TV and sharing her opinions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I have seen all the films directed by Robert Redford and appreciated his love of the American people and the land. In A River Runs Through It, Redford displays the lyric romanticism and visual splendor of the high Rocky Mountains of Montana as if he were a 19th century landscape painter of the ilk of Thomas Moran or Albert Bierstadt. This film makes love to the visual and the word with text by author Norman Maclean, and stunning camera work by Phillippe Rousselot (Serpent's Kiss, Reigne Margot). Redford's cast is perfect. Tom Skerritt is the Rev. MacLean, a man whose methods of education include fly fishing as well as the Bible, Brenda Blythen, the mother, and his sons, Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt create a family whose interactions reflect the same problems all encounter with growing teenage sons, and later, complex young men. Both Schaffer and Pitt are totally believable as the brothers whose love of fly fishing and each other will tie them together forever. It is the relationships between men, father and sons, brothers, and their women to the outside world that grounds A River Runs Through It to a vein of storytelling that is missing in so many of Hollywood films produced in recent years. What makes these relationships special however, is the attention Redford gives to the language as spoken in dialogue. This is a literate script, beautiful to hear and unforgettable when coupled with the stunning Montana rivers and mountains. The words and setting are equal to performances by a cast that rises to their material. While the idea of fly fishing may seem an odd device to center a story, it is not so implausible in Redford's directorial hands. Given the material, Redford's ode to a simpler time and life is worth revisiting again and again. Choose your answer. What is the sentiment of this review?

Given those answer options, answer the question: I heard that Bailey went to see the circus and loved every minute of it.  And I was wondering How would you describe Bailey? A:","output":"Based on the provided information, it can be inferred that Bailey experienced an immense amount of joy and delight during their time at the circus. Therefore, the best description of Bailey from the given answer options would be [1]. joy after having fun at the circus. Bailey's experience at the circus would have likely revolved around an array of stimulating performances and acts, ranging from the visually captivating acrobats effortlessly soaring through the air to the mesmerizing skills of the jugglers gracefully tossing items with perfect precision. Additionally, Bailey might have marveled at the well-rehearsed routines of the trapeze artists as they effortlessly glided over the astonished audience members. The sounds of the daring high-wire performers would have had Bailey clinging to the edge of their seat in suspense, while the comical antics of the clowns brought spontaneous eruptions of laughter. Apart from the incredible performances, the surroundings of the circus itself would have contributed to Bailey's enjoyment. The vibrant colors of the big top, the smell of popcorn and cotton candy wafting through the air, and the excited chatter of fellow attendees would have evoked a general atmosphere of excitement and wonder. It is also worth mentioning that Bailey's love for every minute of the circus could be a reflection of an open-minded and adventurous spirit, one that looks forward to experiencing a diverse and captivating set of activities. Bailey's ability to fully embrace and enjoy the circus shows a deep appreciation for the talents and dedication showcased by the performers. Moreover, Bailey's positive reaction to the circus may also indicate their ability to lose themselves in the present moment and enjoy the activities they engage in without worries. They could be someone who is genuinely appreciative of such experiences and looks forward to them with great anticipation, becoming elated and joyous in the process. In conclusion, given Bailey's response to their experience at the circus, it is safe to describe them as experiencing tremendous joy and delight after having fun at the circus. This description encapsulates Bailey's excitement, joy, and appreciation for the captivating performances, the festive atmosphere, and the remarkable talents exhibited by the performers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Produce a sentence which mentions all of these concepts: live, organism, reproduction","output":"A live organism is a complex biological structure that sustains life through various systems and processes, with reproduction being integral to its survival as it ensures the continuity of their species, fostering biodiversity and evolution. These living organisms occupy every corner of the earth, from the deepest parts of the ocean to the highest peaks of mountains, and they all share fundamental characteristics: growth, responsiveness to stimuli, metabolism, homeostasis, and notably, reproduction. Reproduction, an essential hallmark of life, refers to the process by which organisms create offspring. This is vitally important for the propagation and continuation of each species. Depending on the type of organism, reproduction can occur sexually or asexually. In sexually reproducing organisms, the process typically involves the fusion of male and female gametes or sex cells, resulting in offspring that genetically differ from their parents. This diversity is a cornerstone of evolution, as it introduces genetic variation that potentially allows the species to adapt better to changing environments. In contrast, asexually reproducing organisms are capable of producing offspring without the need for a partner, and the resultant offspring are genetically identical to the parent. This type of reproduction is seen in many types of organisms, from single-celled bacteria to complex multicellular organisms like plants. However, regardless of the type of reproduction, the central theme remains the same: the continuity of life. These live organisms, through reproduction, ensure that life persists - from generation to generation, from the tiniest microorganisms to the most complex forms of life. In conclusion, a live organism is not a simple, discrete entity but a dynamic system of life processes where reproduction plays a crucial role. It brings about the emergence of new life, ensuring the survival and evolution of each species. Therefore, when we talk about a live organism, we are not just referring to an individual entity, but a link in the continuous chain of life, underpinned by the fundamental process of reproduction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In order to provide a comprehensive explanation, let us break down the given premise and hypothesis. Premise: \\"Then the Yankees did a lot of fancy cussin' out 'bout him, trying to make out that he was a Reb' cause Johnny lit off with th' Southerners.\\" In this statement, we understand that the Yankees (referring to the Union forces during the American Civil War) are expressing their displeasure towards a certain individual (presumably \\"Johnny\\") who chose to join the Southerners (Confederate forces). They are attempting to paint him in a negative light by labeling him as a Rebel or Confederate sympathizer. This suggests there is some tension or animosity towards \\"Johnny\\" among the Yankees. Hypothesis: \\"The Yankees have a vested interest in making him look good.\\" This statement suggests that the Yankees, contrary to their actions in the premise, have a motive or reason to make \\"Johnny\\" appear favorable or positively in the eyes of others. It implies that the Yankees may stand to benefit in some way from portraying this individual as a valuable or esteemed person. Now, to determine whether the hypothesis holds true, we need to analyze the given information and make connections. The key to finding this answer lies in the relationship between the Yankees and \\"Johnny,\\" as well as any potential benefits the Yankees could garner from making him appear positively. In the premise, the Yankees are expressing negative emotions towards \\"Johnny\\" and attempting to associate him with the opposing group. This animosity makes it difficult to then assume that they would be motivated to make \\"Johnny\\" look good, as their actions directly contradict that statement. Instead, there might be an interest in discrediting him or diminishing his reputation in the eyes of others due to perceived betrayal or shifting allegiances. Moreover, there is no information provided that suggests the Yankees would benefit from portraying \\"Johnny\\" positively. Therefore, without any additional context or evidence linking the Yankees' motivations to make \\"Johnny\\" look good, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true based solely on the provided premise. In conclusion, the given premise does not support the hypothesis that \\"The Yankees have a vested interest in making him look good.\\" Instead, the information provided only reveals animosity expressed by the Yankees towards \\"Johnny\\" and their attempts to discredit his allegiance. Without any further context or supporting evidence, we cannot establish a connection between the Yankees' actions and a vested interest in making him appear favorable or well-regarded."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose guitar technician played rhythm guitar on several songs?  Metallica opted for extensive touring instead of releasing a single or video to promote the album. Metallica spent March to August 1986 touring as the opening act for Ozzy Osbourne in the United States, the first tour Metallica played to arena-sized audiences. During sound checks, the group played riffs from Osbourne's previous band Black Sabbath, which Osbourne perceived as a mockery toward him. Referring to that occasion, Ulrich stated that Metallica was honored to play with Osbourne, who treated the band well on the tour. Metallica was noted by the media for its excessive drinking habit while touring and earned the nickname \\"Alcoholica\\". The band members occasionally wore satirical T-shirts reading \\"Alcoholica/Drank 'Em All\\". The band usually played a 45-minute set often followed by an encore. According to Ulrich, the audiences in bigger cities were already familiar with Metallica's music, unlike in the smaller towns they've visited. \\"In the B-markets, people really don't know what we're all about. But after 45 or 50 minutes we can tell we've won them over. And fans who come to hear Ozzy go home liking Metallica.\\" Metallica won over Osbourne's fans and slowly began to establish a mainstream following.The tour, however, was notable for several incidents. Hetfield broke his wrist in a mid-tour skateboarding accident, and his guitar technician John Marshall played rhythm guitar on several dates. The European leg of the Damage, Inc. Tour commenced in September, with Anthrax as the supporting band. After the performance of September 26 in Stockholm, the band's bus rolled over on a stretch of icy road the following morning.

The band returned to San Francisco and hired Flotsam and Jetsam bassist Jason Newsted to replace Burton. Many of the songs that appeared on the band's next album, ...And Justice for All, were composed during Burton's career with the band.

The waitress notified us that during the weekends they only observe the AYCE dinner pricing, AYCE lunch pricing was for during the week only. Okay, fine. Next she asked how old the child with us was, we told her she was 7, so she said that the child would only be half price. Cool! BONUS! Why a bonus? Because this child eats like an adult.   Our initial food came out quickly. YUM! So being that there was a total of 4 bodies at the table, hungry bodies at that, you would think that we would be monitored by our waitress or wait staff to see when we were out of meat and veggies, but no we weren't. If we got more food it was because we had to flagg them down. Then when they would bring it out it would sit on the table holding the warm tee crap that was across from us. When it finally arrived at the table they would throw it on and turn the heat down. WTF? WE ARE HUNGRY! Why would you turn the heat down? It was cooking to slow. So every time I would make my cousin turn the heat up some staff member would come by and turn it down. WTF? Is this the way that they keep you there longer but not serve you AYCE because theres a time limit? I also had to ask twice for a drink. I was willing to let all this shitty service fly right over my head because the food was good, and never mind it until the bill arrived....  1. We were told that the child would be half price. They charged us full price. I took my bill up to the front counter and notified the kid up there it was wrong and what it should be. After fumbling with the calculator trying to prove they had charged me 3 full price and 1 half price, he finally realized I was right and then proceeded to blame the cash register being incorrect because they just installed a new system. Whatever. I was able to figure out our total bill including tax on my phone before he was able to fix it in the system.  2. After he fixed the bill and handed it back to me I noticed that the sales tax rate was at 8.15% which I am pretty sure that the current tax rate in Clark County, Nevada is at 8.10%. After seeing this I decided that they could use the extra few cents they got from me on charging the wrong tax, as their tip. I didn't even bother asking him to fix this.  Ya know I am a good tipper, a really good tipper when I get excellent service especially. I know what its like to be a household that relies on income that is generated from tips. And this place just flat out pisses me off (like you couldn't already tell).  I will never return to this place.

It is also influenced by late-1970s funk music, and it contains elements of soul music as well as dance-pop music. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, the song is composed in the key of G minor with a time signature in common time, and a moderate groove of 106 beats per minute. Beyoncé's vocals range from the note of D♯4 to F5. The music is largely based on live instrumentation, including a bass guitar, conga, hi-hat, and horns. A non-live instrument, the Roland TR-808 drum machine, provides the song's heavy and energetic disco beat. Spence D. of IGN Music commented that Beyoncé's vocals on the song are \\"silky smooth\\" and that her vocal range leans toward the high end, hence contrasting to the song's low-end construction. Mike Joseph of PopMatters noted that \\"Déjà Vu\\" is reminiscent of Michael Jackson's \\"Off the Wall\\" (1980). The title refers to the déjà vu phenomenon. The lyrics to \\"Déjà Vu\\" follow the verse–pre-chorus–chorus pattern, and feature two rap verses. It is hook-laden, similar in this respect to \\"Crazy in Love\\". The lyrics detail a woman being constantly reminded of a past lover, shown in the lines, \\"Is it because I'm missing you that I'm having déjà vu?\\" As the song opens, Beyoncé introduces the bass, hi-hat and Roland TR-808 by name. The sounds of the instruments blend as they are being mentioned one after the other; the horns are only audible in the pre-chorus and hook sections, and a short section in the second rap. The bass guitar, which is the first instrument to enter, slides into the main two-bar ostinato. Following the repeated bass slides, the hi-hat and the Roland TR-808 begin playing.After that Beyoncé mentions Jay-Z, the bass glides up for a vibrato-rich fill, giving way to the first rap. Backgrounded with a repeating groove, Beyoncé starts the first verse. The pre-chorus follows, for which the bass changes to a more melodic tone \\"to play something more singing\\",... contains an answer for the question: What does Beyoncé introduce by name as the song opens?, what is it ?

President Richard Nixon officially declared the War on Drugs in a press conference on June 17, 1971, when he stated that drug abuse was \\"public enemy number one.\\" The War on Drugs has involved a variety of strategies to combat the flow of illegal drugs and discourage their use. Some of these strategies include: 1. Increased funding for drug prevention and treatment programs: Over the past five decades, the U.S. government has allocated billions of dollars to fund educational programs about the dangers of drug use and addiction, as well as treatment centers and rehabilitation services for those suffering from addiction. 2. Strengthening law enforcement: The War on Drugs has also involved bolstering the efforts of law enforcement agencies such as the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to target and dismantle drug trafficking organizations. 3. International cooperation: The U.S. has engaged in numerous international initiatives to dismantle global drug cartels and disrupt their supply chains. These efforts have included ing collaborating with foreign governments to conduct drug interdiction missions, providing training and resources to foreign law enforcement agencies, and implementing economic sanctions against individuals and entities involved in the drug trade. 4. Mandatory minimum sentencing laws: As part of the War on Drugs, the U.S. enacted a series of mandatory minimum sentencing laws for drug offenses. These laws require judges to impose pre-determined prison sentences based on the type and amount of drugs involved in the crime, which has led to an increase in the U.S. prison population. 5. Asset forfeiture laws: To further target criminal organizations and individuals engaged in drug trafficking, the U.S. government implemented asset forfeiture laws that allow for the seizure of property and assets associated with the illegal drug trade. This, in turn, has been used to further fund law enforcement efforts against drug trafficking. The War on Drugs has been a controversial and long-standing issue in the United States, with critics arguing that it has resulted in the over-incarceration of non-violent drug offenders, disproportionately affected communities of color, and failed to significantly reduce drug addiction rates. Others have criticized the war for contributing to systemic racial and social injustices and for its significant financial and human resources costs. In recent years, there has been a growing shift towards alternative approaches to drug policy, such as drug decriminalization, treatment-focused strategies, harm reduction measures, and a greater emphasis on addressing the root causes of addiction, such as poverty and mental health issues. While the War on Drugs continues to be a significant aspect of U.S. policy, discussions and debates surrounding its effectiveness and consequences are still prevalent today."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This is usually considered distinct from plant anatomy, which is the study of the internal structure of plants, especially at the microscopic level. Plant morphology is useful in the visual identification of plants. Scope. Plant morphology \\"represents a study of the development, form, and structure of plants, and, by implication, an attempt to interpret these on the basis of similarity of plan and origin.\\" There are four major areas of investigation in plant morphology, and each overlaps with another field of the biological sciences.  - This is a list of botanical illustrators born or active in Ireland . Botanical illustration involves the painting , drawing and illustration of plants and ecosystems .

Movie title: Zeder Movie plot: In 1956, Gabriella (Veronica Moriconi)âa girl with apparent psychic powersâis brought to the enormous house of Dr. Meyer (Cesare Barbetti) in Chartres, France. Meyer intends to conduct an experiment testing her abilities. He takes her into his basement, where the youngster abruptly falls to her knees and begins digging into the dirt. \\"This is where you're hiding, isn't it?\\" Meyer yells. He rushes upstairs for help from his assistants and leaves Gabriella by herself. She is attacked by something unseen and is taken to the hospital. In the basement, further digging reveals a rotted corpse, with a nearby wallet identifying the dead man as Paolo Zeder. Dr. Meyer realizes that the earth in which Zeder was buried was a 'K-Zone'. In present day Bologna, Stefano (Gabriele Lavia), a novelist, is given an old typewriter as a birthday present by his wife Alessandra (Anne Canovas). One night, after Alessandra has gone to bed, he discovers a series of typed letters on the typewriter's ribbon. As he reads the ribbon, he finds it is an essay written by scientist Paolo Zeder discussing the existence of K-Zonesâareas where death ceases to exist. According to Zeder's essay, bodies buried in these zones can return from the dead. Stefano investigates the message left on the typewriter ribbon. He encounters people who make it clear that they do not appreciate any questions relating to Paolo Zeder or K-Zones. However, the resistance he experiences intrigues him even more. He becomes obsessed with getting answers to the mystery and temporarily abandons his wife. His investigation leads him to a huge old property, ostensibly abandoned but protected by electrified fences. A nearby service station attendant tells Stefano that French investors are building a gigantic hotel on the property, but no work is ever seen being done. Stefano sneaks onto the property, and discovers surveillance equipment with numerous monitors showing the dead face of a man buried in a coffin. Stefano watches the monitors. The dead man is Don Luigi Costa,... Answer:","output":"Based on the movie plot provided, it appears that Gabriella (played by Veronica Moriconi) possesses psychic powers. These powers allow her to sense and detect things or events that are not perceptible through ordinary human senses. Psychic powers can present in various forms such as clairvoyance, telepathy, and psychometry, among others. In the case of Gabriella, her psychic powers seem to be oriented towards finding hidden objects or locations. In the beginning, she is brought to Dr. Meyer's house, where she is immediately drawn to his basement. Using her psychic abilities, she quickly begins digging into the earth, knowing that something is hidden beneath the surface. Once her abilities are put to the test, she is able to uncover the rotting corpse of a man named Paolo Zeder. This discovery leads to the concept of K-Zones, which becomes one of the central themes of the movie. Throughout the film, Gabriella's psychic powers seem to act as a guiding force that helps the protagonists navigate through the complex mystery surrounding Dr. Meyer, Paolo Zeder, and the K-Zones. This ability to sense and uncover hidden information is a critical tool in Stefano's investigation, as he encounters resistance from those who do not want the truth about the K-Zones to be uncovered. Overall, Gabriella's psychic powers play a significant role in the movie's plot, as they help to advance the narrative and uncover the secrets surrounding the mysterious K-Zones. Her abilities not only aid in the discovery of the corpse of Paolo Zeder but also help Stefano navigate the intricate web of deception and intrigue that surrounds the existence and purpose of K-Zones."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Changes in the underground environment and geology can influence various aspects of the volcanic process. Some factors that can indirectly impact volcanic activity are the composition of magma, the temperature and pressure conditions, and the structure of the Earth's crust. These factors can, in turn, influence the magma's viscosity, gas content, and the capacity of the crust to store magma, thereby affecting the frequency and intensity of volcanic eruptions.  For example, if there is an increase in the supply of magma, it may cause more frequent eruptions due to increased pressure. Additionally, if the composition of magma changes, it may alter its viscosity and gas content, affecting the explosiveness of eruptions. Indirectly impacting a step in the process, such as increasing pressure in the magma chamber or changing the Earth's crust's structure, can ultimately lead to more or greater volcanic eruptions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Process:  - Prophase is the first and longest stage of mitosis - In this stage the chromosomes become visible and the centrioles separate and move to opposite poles of the cell - In prophase the chromosomes become visible and the centrioles separate and move to opposite poles of the cell - In metaphase the chromosomes line up across the center of the cell and become connected to the spindle fiber at their centromere - In anaphase the sister chromatids separate into individual chromosomes and are pulled apart - During telophase the chromosomes gather at opposite ends of the cell and lose their distinct rod-like shapes - Two new nuclear membranes then form around each of the two regions of DNA and the spindle fibers disappear.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more daughter and parent cells happens, how will it affect HURTING mitosis to proceed normally.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that a change in the number of daughter and parent cells would have an effect on mitosis, potentially hindering its normal progression. To understand how this hypothesis might have an impact, it is important to analyze the individual stages of mitosis and how the proposed change could influence them. 1. Prophase: In this initial stage of mitosis, the chromosomes become visible, and the centrioles separate and move to opposite poles of the cell. A change in the number of daughter and parent cells could affect the organization of the centrioles and their separation, leading to complications in the formation of the mitotic spindle, which is essential for proper chromosome movement and segregation. 2. Metaphase: The chromosomes line up across the center of the cell and become connected to the spindle fibers at their centromere. An increased number of daughter and parent cells could result in overcrowding or improper alignment of chromosomes at the metaphase plate, which could lead to errors in the chromosomal attachment to spindle fibers and later segregation. 3. Anaphase: The sister chromatids separate into individual chromosomes and are pulled apart. With an altered number of daughter and parent cells, the distribution of chromosomes might be uneven or incomplete, increasing the likelihood of chromosomal missegregation and the potential for deleterious cellular consequences. 4. Telophase: The chromosomes gather at opposite ends of the cell and lose their distinct rod-like shapes. Two new nuclear membranes form around each of the two regions of DNA, and the spindle fibers disappear. In the context of the perturbation hypothesis, there could be difficulties in the formation of these new nuclear membranes due to an uneven distribution of cellular components resulting from the increased number of daughter and parent cells. This could lead to defects in nuclear formation or function. While a direct effect of the perturbation on mitosis is not guaranteed, it is likely that the proposed change in the number of daughter and parent cells could have indirect consequences on the process. In particular, the change could lead to errors in the formation of the mitotic spindle, the alignment of chromosomes, and the segregation of sister chromatids. These errors, in turn, could result in genomic instability and deleterious cellular effects, such as aneuploidy and a higher likelihood of cell death or dysfunction. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that an increase in the number of daughter and parent cells could have an indirect effect on the normal progression of mitosis. The proposed change may result in errors during the various stages of the process, potentially leading to genomic instability and adverse cellular consequences. Further research would be necessary to determine how such changes might affect specific cellular processes and the overall health of the organism."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This conversion is made possible by solar cells. However, solar energy may not always be practical. Some areas are just too cloudy. Example Solar panels on the roof of this house generate enough electricity to supply a familys needs. Moving Water Falling water can have a lot of energy. Its energy can be converted into kinetic energy. This energy can turn a turbine and generate electricity. The water may fall naturally over a waterfall or flow through a dam. A drawback of dams is that they flood land upstream. They can also reduce water flow downstream. Either effect may harm ecosystems. Wind Wind is moving air. It has kinetic energy that can do work. Wind turbines change the kinetic energy of the wind to electrical energy. Only certain areas of the world get enough steady wind. Many people also think that wind turbines are noisy and not very nice to look at.

What is the answer: What is the chess playing robot called in TV's Thunderbirds?","output":"The chess-playing robot featured in the TV series \\"Thunderbirds\\" is called Braman. \\"Thunderbirds\\" is a British science fiction television series originally produced between 1964 and 1966 by AP Films (later becoming Century 21 Productions). The show was created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, who also employed \\"Supermarionation,\\" which refers to the use of marionette puppets connected to electronically operated lip-sync mechanisms. This innovative approach was their trademark production technique. Braman made its first appearance on the show in Episode 22, \\"Cry Wolf,\\" which originally aired on February 17, 1966. This particular episode revolves around two brothers, Tony and Bob, who idolize International Rescue and ultimately save the day after a Satellite Monitor is damaged by a meteor shower. International Rescue members are then sent out to protect the boys from the crash that threatens to happen. The chess-playing robot Braman is introduced as one of the many advanced technologies created by the series' Brains, a genius scientist and inventor who is a member of International Rescue. Brains created Braman to serve as a personal assistant and companion, designed to assist him with his various projects. A vital feature of Braman is its impressive computational and analytical skills, which are showcased when Brains plays chess against it. The robot moves its pieces with retractable arms, and its electronic brain permits it to calculate countless moves ahead - essentially making it nearly impossible for even its intelligent creator, Brains, to defeat. Even though Braman is mostly known for its chess-playing capabilities, the robot is far more than a mere amusement. Throughout the series, Braman demonstrates exceptional abilities that aid International Rescue in their daring exploits. It can also perform maintenance tasks, assist with calculations, and help in the development of various vehicles and technologies. In conclusion, Braman is the chess-playing robot in TV's Thunderbirds, a significant creation by the expert inventor, Brains. Apart from its impressive chess-related prowess, Braman also serves various other critical functions that support International Rescue's missions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Today, we are going to learn how to fold a jacket and a shirt in a super easy way, so that they stay neat and don’t take up too much space when you're packing or storing them away. This will help keep your clothes looking great, and your room looking tidy! Step 1: Hold your jacket with both hands First, find a jacket you want to fold. Hold it with the backside facing away from you, like you're giving it a hug. This is so you can see the sleeves (the long parts you put your arms in) and the front of the jacket where the buttons or zipper is.  Step 2: Turn one side of the jacket inside out Now, look at the sleeves of your jacket. Pick one of them (it can be any side) and gently pull the sleeve until it is inside out. The smooth part of the jacket will now be on the inside, and the bumpy part will be on the outside. Don't worry if it looks a little funny - we are just getting started! Step 3: Slip the other side of the jacket into the inside-out side Keep holding onto your jacket. Now, take the other sleeve that’s still right-side out and gently slip it into the inside-out sleeve. Just like how one hand fits into the other when you clap, you will see that the two sleeves fit together nicely. Step 4: Roll up a shirt and place it into the shoulder of the jacket Find a shirt that you want to fold too. Lay it flat on a surface like a bed or a table. Starting from the bottom of the shirt, roll it up like a sleeping bag until you reach the top. Now, put the rolled-up shirt into the shoulder area of your jacket (where your shoulders would be when you wear the jacket). Step 5: Roll up your jacket and shirt lengthwise Almost done! Keep holding onto your jacket, and start rolling it up lengthwise from one end to the other. Make sure the shirt stays inside the jacket as you roll. When you're done, you'll have a neat little bundle that will be easy to pack or put away. There you have it, little friends! Now you know how to fold your jacket and shirt in a super-neat way. This will help keep your clothes nice and wrinkle-free. Plus, it will make it easy to find them when you need to get dressed for a special occasion, like a birthday party or a fancy dinner with your family.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Paul Helfeld (also given as Hefeld), aged 21 in 1909, and Jacob Lepidus (also reported as Lapidus), who was 25 the same year, were Jewish-Latvian immigrants. They had been members of the Latvian Socialist Party and, although they had not held positions of responsibility, they had smuggled revolutionary literature into Russia for the party. The pair had been living in Paris in 1907, along with Lepidus's brother Paul, a revolutionary bomber who went under the nom de guerre \\"Strygia\\"; Jacob was described in The Times as a \\"member of a notorious Russian revolutionary family\\". On 1 May 1907 Paul Lepidus was killed when a bomb he was carrying to assassinate Armand Fallières, the President of France, exploded prematurely. Lepidus and Helfeld fled the country and lived in Scotland for a year, before moving to Tottenham.Both men joined a small group of Latvian agitators living in north London; according to other members of the group, the pair had criminal records and had joined as a cover for the robberies they carried out. Lepidus was employed, briefly, at a furniture factory, while Helfeld took a job at the Schnurmann rubber factory in Tottenham. Helfeld refused to give his name when he joined the company, so he was listed on the time sheets as \\"Elephant\\" in reference to his bulk. Situated on the corner of Tottenham High Road and Chesnut Road, the factory sat opposite Tottenham Police Station, which was under the control of the Metropolitan Police.Special Branch suspected another individual, the Russian revolutionary Christian Salnish, of having organised the robbery.

He participated in the 1905 Russian Revolution and afterwards helped to build resistance groups in the Baltic states and Saint Petersburg, then the capital of Imperial Russia.

The analysis of the sentiment can be broken down into different components that come together to support this conclusion. 1. Context: Celebi, a mythical Pokémon representing time-travel, suggests that the speaker wants to undo past events. This implies a negative connotation, as they wish to erase their memory of watching the movie instead of reliving it. 2. Intention: The sentence reflects the desire of the speaker to travel back in time to prevent or change an action. This indicates a sense of regret or dissatisfaction, which are negative sentiments. 3. Implication: By stating this, the speaker implies that they did not enjoy or appreciate the movie. This negative experience is the primary driving force behind the sentiment in the sentence. 4. Choice of words: The phrasing \\"a time before I saw this movie\\" underscores the negativity of the sentiment. This specific construction highlights the speaker's dissatisfaction with the experience and their wish to revert to the time before they watched the film. It is essential to consider that the interpretation of sentiment often relies on contextual cues and might vary depending on individual perspectives.

Grape: Red wine may offer health benefits more so than white because potentially beneficial compounds are present in grape skin, and only red wine is fermented with skins. The amount of fermentation time a wine spends in contact with grape skins is an important determinant of its resveratrol content. Ordinary non-muscadine red wine contains between 0.2 and 5.8 mg/L, depending on the grape variety, because it is fermented with the skins, allowing the wine to absorb the resveratrol. By contrast, a white wine contains lower phenolic contents because it is fermented after removal of skins. Please answer a question about this article.

Answer the following question: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: how does lsd impact the human body Suggested answer: LSD is very potent, with 20–30 μg (micrograms) being the threshold dose. Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"Yes, you can validate the given answer as it is accurate in mentioning that LSD is a potent substance and has a low threshold dose. However, for a more comprehensive understanding, here's a detailed answer: LSD (Lysergic acid diethylamide) is a potent hallucinogenic drug that impacts the human body in several ways: 1. Effect on serotonin receptors: LSD primarily affects the serotonin receptors in the brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in regulating mood, perceptions, and thought processes. LSD stimulates these receptors, specifically the 5-HT2A receptor, which can cause altered perceptions, intense emotional experiences, and hallucinations. 2. Physical effects: The use of LSD can result in various physical effects, including increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, dilated pupils, sweating, dry mouth, tremors, and loss of appetite. In some cases, users may experience dizziness, nausea, or weakness as well. 3. Psychological effects: LSD can cause intense shifts in emotions, mood, and thoughts. Users often report feeling a sense of unity or interconnectedness with the world around them. Other psychological effects include visual and auditory hallucinations, distortion of time perception, and synesthesia (a mixing of senses, such as hearing colors or seeing sounds). In some cases, users may experience negative psychological effects such as paranoia, anxiety, and panic attacks. 4. \\"Bad trips\\" and long-term effects: Although many users report profound insights and transformative experiences on LSD, some may experience \\"bad trips\\" characterized by disturbing hallucinations, extreme anxiety, and a feeling of losing control. Additionally, the long-term effects of using LSD can include prolonged anxiety, depression, flashbacks, and, in rare cases, hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD), a condition in which users experience persistent hallucination-like symptoms long after the drug has left their system. In summary, the suggested answer provides accurate information about the potency and threshold dose of LSD. However, it is essential to consider how LSD affects the human body more broadly, including its impact on serotonin receptors, physical and psychological effects, and potential long-term consequences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However,some players complained right away that the new balls bounced differently and were actually harder to control than the leather ones. Physics helped answer questions about why the new balls felt different.For example,the scientists studied friction ,which in this case affects the ability of a player to hold onto a ball.\\"The greater the friction,the better it will stick to his hand,\\"explains a scientist. Tests on both wet and dry balls showed that while the synthetic ball was easier to hold onto when dry,it had less friction and became much harder to hold onto when wet.That's because _ stays on the surface of the synthetic balls but gets taken into the leather balls. The scientists also tested bounce and found that the logo  printed on the new balls made their surface uneven  and caused them to bounce a little strangely com- pared with the leather balls.

At the present time, the teachings of all three branches of Buddhism have spread throughout the world, and Buddhist texts are increasingly translated into local languages. While in the West Buddhism is often seen as exotic and progressive, in the East it is regarded as familiar and traditional. Buddhists in Asia are frequently well organized and well funded. In countries such as Cambodia and Bhutan, it is recognized as the state religion and receives government support. Modern influences increasingly lead to new forms of Buddhism that significantly depart from traditional beliefs and practices.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Sharing more of your emotions with your partner and encouraging your partner to do the same with you will help strengthen your bond. Make it a habit to confide in each other every day. Some opening questions for confiding in your partner include:  “Remember when we used to go walking and talking around the neighborhood, walking the dogs together? Let’s do that tonight… How about it?” “What happened yesterday between us didn’t go so well, and I want to try another way — can we start over, and this time I will take some deep breaths and listen more patiently.  I also want to say what works better for me and find out what you are hoping for.” In order to move forward in your relationship, you will both need to learn how to understand each other’s needs. The best way to uncover what your partner needs, and let them know what you need, is to talk about it. If you are not sure what your spouse wants or needs, the best way to find out is to ask questions and listen. If you still are not sure, ask more questions. For example, you could say something like, “I think that what you need from me is ________. Is that what you mean?” Showing appreciation through sincere compliments is an important part of a healthy relationship. Make sure that you and your partner are aware of the importance of complimenting each other and that you both know how to do it well. Good compliments should not only be sincere and specific, they should also be phrased as an “I” statement rather than as a “you” statement. For example, if your partner cleans the kitchen, don’t say “You did a nice job of cleaning the kitchen.” Instead, say \\"I appreciate that you cleaned the kitchen.” Using I instead of you lets your partner know how you feel, not just that you noticed. If you decide that you are ready to move forward in your relationship with your partner, you should ask your partner to promise you that they will not follow the same pattern of behavior that led to the affair. Ask your partner to articulate or even write out what that behavior includes and commit to change. Since there is a possibility that your partner may cheat again, you should work together to establish consequences for another affair. These consequences may include things like divorce or other repercussions. You may want to get these consequences in writing and work with a lawyer to make them legally binding. If things don’t improve despite all of your best efforts and the help of marriage counseling, you may have to accept that the relationship cannot be repaired. Signs that the relationship may be beyond repair include:  Constant fighting Inability to connect with your partner Inability to empathize with or receive empathy from your partner Hurt and anger that does not subside with time Inability to forgive your partner Summary:","output":"The article is about how sharing emotions, talking about needs, giving compliments, and setting boundaries can help strengthen your relationship with your partner."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

About to nervously jump off a bridge, scrawny Harry Berlin is a barely functional human being. Just as he attempts to leap off the bridge, he is distracted by Milt Manville, an old friend from fifteen years ago. Harry doesn't really recognize him at first but there appears to be a contrast between the two of them with Milt boasting of how well he is doing in life while Harry tries to listen. Milt takes Harry to his house to meet Ellen Manville (Elaine May), Milt's long-suffering wife. She is complaining that their sex life is non-existent but Milt has a secret lover in the form of beautiful blonde Linda. Milt convinces a barely-there Harry to make a go of things with Ellen so that she is not left lonely when he will divorce her for Linda. It takes a while but Harry and Ellen eventually fall in love. They marry and go to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon but this is when Ellen realizes that Harry is the world's worst roommate and childish at heart. In one example, Harry unexpectedly stomps on Ellen's toe in order to test her love for him.  As she hobbles in pain, she asks, \\"What did you do that for?,\\" and in response, he asks her if she still loves him, and she says she does. As Milt and Linda start to settle down as a couple, she quickly realizes that he has an addiction to selling household items and junk for a quick buck, something that she is strongly against. She immediately dumps him, which leads to Milt to want Ellen back when he realizes how much he loves her for real. She admits that she doesn't really love Harry as much as she thought, as his bizarre day-to-day activities get to her. Milt and Ellen plot to get back together and convince Harry to divorce her but he loves her and sets out to prove it by getting a job as an elevator operator in a shopping mall.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: The fact of the matter is that anything you do that makes money is going to take time. And time + money = a job. No matter what you're doing in order to make enough money to support yourself, it can technically be considered a job, even if it isn't a job in the traditional way. If you just want to avoid a job you hate or that feeling of working too hard, turn your favorite hobby into a job. No matter what you do, there is a way to monetize it. There are a number of websites that will let you do quick tasks for small amounts of money. The most popular is Amazon's Mechanical Turk, but Short Task is also a good option. Keep in mind that the amount of money you get from these tasks is very small, but you should be able to do them easily while doing other tasks (like watching tv, using the toilet, or riding on the bus). When people go away on vacation or for business, especially if it's for a long time, they will often want to make sure that nothing goes wrong in their home or with their pets so they'll pay someone a small amount to live in their home or to take their pets until they get back. Start by house sitting for people that you know to build up references, they advertise online and in newspapers. Go to garage sales or hang out on websites like Craigslist and look for free or low cost items. Oftentimes you can slightly clean up an item or refurbish it a bit and get a lot more money when you resell it. Sometimes you don't need to do anything at all: people will often sell their items for less than they're worth if they just want to get rid of it quickly or they don't know what it's really worth. If you own a house, you can rent a small, cheap apartment for yourself and then in turn rent out your own home. If your home rents well, your temporary apartment is cheap, and your mortgage is paid off or low, then this can be a good way to make some money. It can either be a very short-term thing (such as for conventions or special events) or it can be more long-term. Just make sure to check your cities rules regarding rentals. You can get in a lot of trouble if your city doesn't allow them without a permit. You can sell your hair or be a test subject for cosmetic studies. (Remember to be sure that it's legal in your country) Lots of people have quick errands or chores that they need done but don't want to do them or don't have the time. This can range from picking up groceries to mowing the lawn, a ride to the doctor to delivering a package. A good place to find such tasks that need doing is TaskRabbit. You will usually need a background check and a car, but as long as you have those you should be able to find lots of quick ways to earn cash. When websites, magazines, or other media need images, instead of taking them themselves they'll often pay a small fee and license someone else's pictures. This is called stock photography. Using a high quality camera, take some good pictures and then license them through Flickr or other stock photo websites. Get enough of them and you'll make money without having to do much more. If you know how to do something pretty well (for example, you were really good at math in school), you can take quick and easy tutoring jobs to help kids do better in school. You can find lots of advertisements for tutors on sites like Craigslist. You'll probably need references but the money can be good for almost no work. There are lots of opportunities to make money by helping companies with things like advertising. You can get paid to take part in focus groups and surveys. You can also sometimes find work as a secret shopper, after which you can resell the products you buy to make money. 20|20 Panel is a common place to find opportunities like these. If you've got Photoshop and basic art skills, you can make money be designing some t-shirts and other products and selling them online through special retailers. Websites like Society 6 and Redbubble allow you to make clothing and household items. They'll sell, produce, and ship them for you (in exchange for a cut of the profit), but you'll still make a good chunk of money off your sales. Lots of websites will give you money for producing content for them. Listiverse and eHow will pay for articles you write, for example. This requires that you be able to write content quickly, though, in order to be worth the effort. Have something to say and good command of your keyboard! This can get pretty job-like but if you have fun and do it in a way that you enjoy then it won't be that big of a deal. Find a topic that you understand and enjoy and make blog posts, Youtube videos, etc. Ads places on your site and videos can make you a pretty tidy sum and tools like Google Ads makes it really easy to do too.","output":"The article offers various unconventional methods to make money, such as monetizing hobbies, completing small tasks on websites, house sitting, reselling items, renting out property, participating in studies, running errands, selling stock photos, tutoring, joining focus groups, designing and selling products, and creating content through writing or media."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: So Angela has grown up and gotten therapy and an operation to turn her into a real life daughter, rather than the son that she was born, and now holds a job as - wait for it - a camp counselor! How appropriate, right? I know, I love it. Anyway, the first sequel to the Sleepaway Camp franchise obeys all the rules of horror sequels - more blood, more imaginative killings (which aren't imaginative, but still more so than the original), more nudity, a more elaborate plot, and generally worse than the original.  It is entertaining in the same way as the original was, in that the characters and wardrobes are so goofy and so authentically 80's that you can't help getting a good laugh. At one point, a guy asks Angela out, and she says \\"I'll call you,\\" and then quickly walks away. The guy says to himself, \\"How is she gonna call me? I don't have a phone!\\" and then he sniffs his armpits, wondering what turned her off (it's the hair, dude!!). It is a well-known fact that in 80s slasher movies, the murdered teenagers were more often than not being punished by their killer for some kind of bad behavior, usually for being too promiscuous. When I first started getting into horror movies and saw the Friday the 13th movies for the first time in the mid 90s, I didn't realize this. I learned it in a film class a year or two later and was amazed that their was some method to the madness. I was pretty impressed, not only that the movies were passing on some kind of message, albeit a morbid one, but that there was actually some thought put into it. But not in this movie! At one point just before Angela kills one of her victims, she says \\"Let this be a lesson to you. Say no to drugs!\\" Real subtle screen writing there, guys. Then again, the dialogue is the most entertaining thing in the movie. Angela (who, by the way, went through all that therapy and those operations and all that trouble to clean up her past and reinvent herself as a normal and well-developed person and then changed her name from Angela to, umm, Angela), says at one point, \\"I don't like being the wicked witch of the west, but I know what happens when things get out of control.\\" (People start getting killed...by me! HA!) Then later, she demands that one of the counselors, Mare, make an apology, to which the girl replies, \\"I'd rather die!\\" Sorry, Mare, but you really walked into that one... Two years ago I was a camp counselor at a sleepaway camp similar to the one portrayed in this movie (except the camp that I taught at had more than three kids to the 15 or 20 counselors and it also had rules, which the one in the movie doesn't). This made me notice the myriad of discrepancies in the movie from what camp life is really like.  That's okay though, you can hardly make a movie like this with a lot of 9 year olds running around, although there were some 10 or 11 year old kids killed in this movie. I hadn't seen that kind of thing much before.  Definitely bad taste, even for a cheesy 80s slasher movie....","output":"The sentiment of this review feels mixed.

You'd have to volunteer two hours a week for one semester. You can choose to help a child with math, English, or both. Half-hour lessons are fine, so you could do a half hour of each subject two days a week.   Professor Dodge will act as a mentor to the tutors-he'll be available to help you with lesson plans or to offer suggestions for activities. He has office hours every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon. You can sign up for the program with him and begin the tutoring next week.   I'm sure you'll enjoy this community service...and you'll gain valuable experience at the same time. It looks good on your resume, too, showing that you've had experience with children and that you care about your community. If you'd like to sign up, or if you have any questions, stop by Professor Dodge's office this week. Question: What is the purpose of the talk?   _ Answer: Answer:","output":"The purpose of the talk is to introduce and promote the \\"One On One\\" community service program to university students, particularly education majors.

Q:The answer to the question: What's the common name of the creature that caused a village to be abandoned in the cave story? is inside the article: Animal tracker Ivan Marx opens by mentioning the film is the culmination of 10 years of research. He says that the Eskimos called the creature \\"bushman,\\" the Colville Indians \\"Sasquatch,\\" and the Hoopas \\"Om-mah,\\" but is most commonly known as Bigfoot. Marx's brother-in-law takes him to the land of petrified wood, showing him rock carvings of creatures with big hands and feet. The carvings tell the story of the creature stealing children, causing a village to be abandoned. Marx finds large tracks in the snow and later a dead bear with similar tracks nearby. He finds strange hair between the bear's teeth and sets out to track the creature. He finds tracks in the mud beside a river and something moving nearby. He intends to inform others but rain washes the tracks away. Marx investigates tracks in several states only to find they're not bigfoot tracks. He visits the Oh-mah bigfoot redwood statue in northern California and the Oregon coast, continuing to search. Marx takes a job in Washington state to film a Cinnamon bear. While there, he films Bigfoot walking through a field. He mentions that his footage of Bigfoot has been questioned by science and used by others on lecture circuits to make money. Marx shows footage of an injured squirrel, goats eating dirt, and glaciers melting. He mentions the Trans-Alaska Pipeline and visits Yukon Frida, who paints pictures of Bigfoot. Marx travels above the Arctic circle, showing footage of the Northern lights while relating Bigfoot tales. He visits an Eskimo who promises he'll see Bigfoot. Later in the evening, he films what he describes \\"the shining eyes\\" of the creature, but when dawn comes, he says Bigfoot disappeared behind a rainbow.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the name of the person who must remain handcuffed to his father? is inside the article: Fifteen disparate African American men board a bus in Los Angeles bound for Washington, D.C., where they plan on attending the Million Man March. Other than their race, destination, and gender, the men have nothing in common: George is the trip organizer; Xavier is an aspiring filmmaker hoping to make a documentary of the March; Flip is the vain but charismatic and openly homophobic and sexist actor; Kyle and Randall are a homosexual couple; Gary, a biracial police officer; Jamal is a former gang banger turned devout Muslim who has evaded prosecution for the murders he committed; Evan Jr., is a petty criminal who has been permitted to break probation to attend the march on the condition that he remain handcuffed to his father, Evan Sr. As the bus travels across country, Xavier conducts interviews with the various attendees, allowing them to express their views on race, religion, and politics. The interviews often provoke outbursts from other men on the bus, invariably leading to many political confrontations. Jeremiah, the eldest member of the group, is an 80-year-old former alcoholic who lost his job and family, has found new meaning in life and is energized by the Million Man March, and embraces his African heritage; his philosophies on the black experience and stories of precolonial Africa serve to unite the men and ease tensions and the infighting among them. En route the bus breaks down and the men are forced to board another bus, driven by an ethnically Jewish white man named Rick. A couple of the passengers harass Rick as a white man, and Rick ultimately refuses to drive any further, citing the group's prejudice and his opposition to antisemitic remarks made by the leader of the march, Louis Farrakhan. George, himself a bus driver, accuses Rick of cultural racism, but begrudgingly agrees to cover for Rick who leaves.

Article: Our plan was to drive into Cambridge, catch the 7:34 train to Liverpool Street Station, then to separate and meet again for lunch. We should have arrived at Liverpool at 9:19, but due to a typical London fog, the train had to move along so slowly that it was not until 10:30 that it got there. In spite of our late arrival, Joan, my wife's sister, decided that she would go to see the Crown Jewels in the Tower of London while we went shopping. It was only after her sister had disappeared into the fog that my wife realized that we hadn't decided where we should meet for lunch. Since I had our three tickets for the concert in my pocket, this was indeed a problem. There seemed to be nothing we could do except taking a taxi to the Tower of London, and try to find her there. Needless to say, we didn't find her. It was now one o'clock, and the concert began at 2:30. \\"Perhaps she will think of waiting outside the concert hall,\\" suggested my wife hopefully. By this time the fog was so thick that road traffic had to stop, and the only way to get there was by underground railway. Hand in hand we felt our way along the road to where we thought the nearest station should be. An hour later we were still trying to find it. Just as I was about to lose my temper completely when we met a blind man tapping his way confidently through the fog. With his help we found Tower Hill tube station just fifty yards down the road. By now it was far too late even to try to get to the concert hall before the performance began at 2:30, so we decided to return to Cambridge. It took seven long hours instead of the usual two to make that journey. Nor were we able to get any food and drink on the train. Tired and hungry we finally reached home at ten, opening the door to the sound of the telephone bell. It was Joan; she had seen the Crown Jewels, had managed to get another ticket for concert, and had had a wonderful dinner at a restaurant near the hotel where she decided to stay for the night.

Article: If you can, listen to music while you work to help keep yourself distracted and pass the time more quickly. This will also help you engage more parts of your brain. Just make sure you're listening to music that matches the mood; too slow and it might lull you to sleep. Every person has their own get-jazzed kind of music. Do some experimenting with Internet radio; you may find that in-the-zone-work-music is different than the music you prefer to listen to in your free time. If possible, get out of the office. Take a short walk or drive to get food, and eat out instead of in the conference room. Getting others to come with you is another good idea. That long, social break may be what you need to power through the afternoon.  Avoid going to the bathroom or doing other things that can be done before/after your lunch in order to get the most time out of your lunch. Try going to a new place for lunch every once in a while, and recruit co-workers. This way there is something to look forward to during the morning. A cluttered area is a cluttered mind. A cluttered mind leads to slower and poorer decision making. Take five minutes to just organize whatever's at your desk or in your space. When it's cleaner, you've not only killed a bit of time, but you've also made it easier to breathe. On a slow day, it's all about keeping yourself busy. If you don't have your own area to clean, consider organizing a community area. How could your boss say no? When we get home from work, it's all too easy to plop down in front of the TV for hours on end and go on autopilot. This is great in theory, but then when work rolls around the next morning, it's like it never happened. This is even worse when it takes up your entire weekend. In your downtime at work, make a plan. If your boss asks, you're just practicing time management.  This not only keeps you busy now, but it gives you something to look forward to. And then when that time does roll around, it'll be time well-spent. You'll be recharged and work won't seem so bad since you had quality time off. If it's a slow day at work, you may just need another new task to take care of. And the fact that it's new will make the time go by much faster. Ask your boss if you can go get everyone lunch or take care of the inside of the microwave that everyone knows about but no one acknowledges openly. If you're feeling particularly ambitious, start on a project that isn't due for a while. That way when the time comes, that day in the future will go by much faster. You're using right now to take care of future you, which is a win-win. There's tons of scientific data that say breaks are good for you and for your work performance. In fact, just a two-minutes break can increase your productivity by 11%. It can literally keep you on schedule. So don't feel guilty about taking a second to browse Facebook, check your email, or send that text or Tweet. In the long run, it'll make you perform better. Just make sure it doesn't start to negatively affect your performance. A few minutes on Facebook is good, but an hour is not. Breaks are only breaks when they're sandwiched between periods of working hours!

The answer to the question: What are the last names of the two people hired to join Opeth after De Farfalla and Nordin left? is inside the article: Opeth recorded its debut album, Orchid, with producer Dan Swanö in April 1994. Because of distribution problems with the newly formed Candlelight Records, the album was not released until May 15, 1995, and only in Europe. Orchid tested the boundaries of traditional death metal, featuring acoustic guitars, piano, and clean vocals.After a few live shows in the United Kingdom, Opeth returned to the studio in March 1996 to begin work on a second album, again produced by Dan Swanö. The album was named Morningrise, and was released in Europe on June 24, 1996. With only five songs, but lasting 66 minutes, it features Opeth's longest song, the twenty-minute \\"Black Rose Immortal\\". Opeth toured the UK in support of Morningrise, followed by a 26-date Scandinavian tour with Cradle of Filth. While on tour, Opeth attracted the attention of Century Media Records, who signed the band and released the first two albums in the United States in 1997.In 1997, after the tour, Åkerfeldt and Lindgren dismissed De Farfalla for personal reasons, without the consent of Nordin. When Åkerfeldt informed Nordin, who was on a vacation in Brazil, Nordin left the band and remained in Brazil for personal reasons. Former Eternal members, drummer Martín López (formerly of Amon Amarth) and bassist Martín Méndez, responded to an ad at a music shop placed by Åkerfeldt. López and Méndez were fans of the band and took the ads down themselves so no other musicians could apply for the job. Åkerfeldt and Lindgren did not want the Martíns to join at first, due to them already knowing each other; they felt that they wanted two strangers so that there wouldn't be two camps in the band, but eventually hired both. López made his debut with Opeth playing on a cover version of Iron Maiden's \\"Remember Tomorrow\\", which was included on the album A Call to Irons: A Tribute to Iron Maiden.With a larger recording budget from Century Media, Opeth began work on its third album, with noted Swedish producer Fredrik Nordström, at Studio Fredman in August 1997.

Emperor Yang Zhi agreed and married 276 Wu and created her Empress .","output":"No, these two sentences do not mean exactly the same. Here is a detailed analysis: 1. \\"Emperor Yang Zhi agreed and, in 276, married Wu and created her empress.\\" This sentence is stating a sequence of events that happened historically. In this context, the number 276 appears to be a reference to the year 276, during which Emperor Yang Zhi married a woman named Wu and conferred upon her the title of Empress. This specific phrasing indicates that the marriage and the creation of the empress happened in the aforementioned year. 2. \\"Emperor Yang Zhi agreed and married 276 Wu and created her Empress.\\" This sentence is grammatically incorrect in English, and its meaning is not clearly conveyed due to the misplaced number. The number 276 is misplaced, making it seem as if it is qualifying \\"Wu\\", which doesn't make sense in this context. Also, the capital 'E' in the word 'Empress' would typically mean it's a name or title for a specific person rather than a general title. However, this could also be a typographical error. From these descriptions, it's clear that the sentences do not mean the same thing. The first sentence implies a historic event where Emperor Yang Zhi married Wu in the year 276 and made her the Empress. The second sentence, due to its erroneous construct, fails to clearly state whether 276 is the number of times he married Wu, a nonsensical suggestion, or when he married her. The structure significantly muddles the sentence's intended message. Assuming the number should denote the year, the sentence should satisfactorily read: \\"Emperor Yang Zhi agreed, married Wu in 276, and created her Empress.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What the USADA doping report said about Lance Armstrong's entourage Lawyers working for Armstrong later attempted to persuade Betsy into asking her to sign a statement discrediting Walsh which she refused. Andreu claimed after this she was “vilified”. Lance’s wife at the time of his first successes in the Tour de France, the report claims she had full knowledge of his doping activities and even played an active role. In his affidavit, Jonathan Vaughters recalled: “On the day of the road race at the 1998 World Championships someone apparently decided that cortisone should be made available for the team; I recall that Kristin Armstrong was wrapping cortisone tablets in tin foil and handing them out to the riders. Someone made the remark, ‘Lance’s wife is rolling joints.’” A year later, during the Milan-San Remo race, Kristin was asked by her friend Betsy Andreu what her feelings were about EPO. “Kristin responded along the lines of, ‘it was a necessary evil’,” Andreu recalled. “I understood from this that Kristin was aware that Lance was using EPO but wasn’t concerned about it.” The report claimed that Armstrong sent the wife of his former team-mate Levi Leipheimer, Odessa Gunn, threatening text messages after her husband testified before a federal grand jury about doping. “Shortly after my testimony,” he recalled, “I attended a dinner with Lance and sat next to him. Lance was very cold towards me and I figured he had learned of my testimony. Although he did not speak to me, Lance sent a text message to my wife Odessa that said, ‘Run, don’t walk’. This was the first time in several years that Lance had communicated to Odessa and in context his message to her felt threatening.” A similar incident occurred during the 2012 Tour de France, after Leipheimer had been interviewed by USADA. Leipheimer wrote in his affidavit: “Odessa received a text from Lance asking, ‘Are you in CA’ Both Odessa and I found this text to be very disturbing as she was indeed home alone at the time. The text made her feel very vulnerable and there was no legitimate reason for Lance to communicate with Odessa.” What was this article about?","output":"This article is about a report from the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) that talks about Lance Armstrong, a famous cyclist, and his friends and family who knew about and were involved in his use of illegal drugs to help him in races. These drugs, like EPO and cortisone, are not allowed because they give an unfair advantage. The report shares stories from people who saw these actions, and it also talks about some situations where Lance was not very nice to people who told the truth about his cheating."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: What is the first name of Penelope's son that died?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Three years after the death of a young man, Liam Lombard, the story flashes forward to assess the toll it has taken on his parents, brother, and ex-girlfriend, all set against the backdrop of suburban Sydney. Jordan Lombard is a broken man, now hideously obese and unable to function. His once happy marriage is skidding hopelessly out of control. His wife Penelope is trapped in routine, devoid of self-respect. Her pain only deepens with the onset of menopause. This humiliation has driven her straight into the arms of another, younger, man. Their surviving son Ben has developed a peculiar relationship with the local boy Matt. Though an unlikely pair, a romance has begun to blossom. As Ben's sexuality comes further into question, he turns his attentions to the girl next-door Indigo, his dead brothers former lover. Never quite the same since his death, her destructive relationship with a married man, Greg, is fading as is her relationship with her mother Jackie. As Ben sets out to woo her in his own twisted fashion, including dressing like an old neighbour, Indigo comes to find he might be her one true friend. Then history repeats. Jordan suffers a heart attack, shaking his family to their core. In the middle of a night, three years on from the death of her son, Penelope fights for her husband at a hospital bedside. Desperate to reclaim his life, Jordan races to quit his oppressive job in spectacular and uncharacteristic fashion on his bosses doorstep. When Jordan finally gets home that night – he crumbles in his wife's arms - a second chance now awarded. Meanwhile, Ben makes his way to a lonely bus, planning to skip the city with Indigo. While there, he impulsively reaches over and kisses her, hoping all his questions might finally be answered. But there's nothing. The answer is:","output":"Liam.

Not until 1998 did al Qaeda undertake a major terrorist operation of its own, in large part because  Bin Laden lost his base in Sudan. Ever since the Islamist regime came to power in Khartoum, the United States and other Western governments had pressed it to stop providing a haven for terrorist organizations. Other governments in the region, such as those of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and even Libya, which were targets of some of these groups, added their own pressure. At the same time, the Sudanese regime began to change. Though Turabi had been its inspirational leader, General Omar al Bashir, president since 1989, had never been entirely under his thumb. Thus as outside pressures mounted, Bashir's supporters began to displace those of Turabi. The attempted assassination in Ethiopia of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995 appears to have been a tipping point. The would-be killers, who came from the Egyptian Islamic Group, had been sheltered in Sudan and helped by  Bin Laden. When the Sudanese refused to hand over three individuals identified as involved in the assassination plot, the UN Security Council passed a resolution criticizing their inaction and eventually sanctioned Khartoum in April 1996. A clear signal to  Bin Laden that his days in Sudan were numbered came when the government advised him that it intended to yield to Libya's demands to stop giving sanctuary to its enemies.  Bin Laden had to tell the Libyans who had been part of his Islamic army that he could no longer protect them and that they had to leave the country. Outraged, several Libyan members of al Qaeda and the Islamic Army Shura renounced all connections with him.  Bin Laden also began to have serious money problems. International pressure on Sudan, together with strains in the world economy, hurt Sudan's currency. Some of  Bin Laden's companies ran short of funds. As Sudanese authorities became less obliging, normal costs of doing business increased. Saudi pressures on the  Bin Laden family also probably took some toll. In any case,  Bin Laden found it necessary both to cut back his spending and to control his outlays more closely.  After reading the above, is \\"They attempted to assassinate General Omar al Bashir,\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Sudan refused to hand over three individuals identified as involved in the assassination plot of who?\\"?","output":"No, the correct answer to the question \\"Sudan refused to hand over three individuals identified as involved in the assassination plot of who?\\" is not \\"They attempted to assassinate General Omar al Bashir.\\" Instead, the correct answer is \\"They attempted to assassinate Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.\\" The text mentions that the would-be killers came from the Egyptian Islamic Group, and they had been sheltered in Sudan and helped by Bin Laden."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Promised a slice if he cleans the yard, Mickey immediately jumps into raking up the fall leaves littering Minnie's lawn. While working in the yard, a small tornado as tall as Mickey comes along and makes his work more complicated: first the youngster hops into the basket and leaps over Mickey countless times before he pounds the basket in place, shaking it to check if it's snared. After he throws the leaves in, the child pounces on him, spins him around, grabs his hat, and taunts him. Angered, Mickey pounces on the youngster, who spins him around and scoots away, leaving Mickey's hat on his head. Both Mickey and the youngster have a tug'o'war on the basket until it shatters on Mickey, who is entangled. Then, the child makes an army of leaves and marches around the house. Mickey manages to trap the child with a sack, which he ties and punts away. The tornadoling retaliates with just 2 punches, then attempts to get away, with Mickey hot on his heels. As Mickey chases him with a rake the terrified child calls out for help. The mother tornado, unamused with Mickey tormenting her offspring (and unaware of what her child has been doing to Mickey), furiously pursues him with a look of relentlessness on her face. Her angry rampage causes chaos and destruction through the farm fields and grasslands until she lifts the lower portion of her gigantic body and slows Mickey's movement.

True authority is born from respect for the purpose, good character and trustworthiness of the person who leads them to opportunity for success. People will respond more openly to a person of passion and dedication -- but by not complaining against the student and never demeaning the work... Leaders need to be able to be a \\"source of inspiration\\", and be a motivator getting the work into gear towards the required action or cause. It is impossible to make a student do anything -- but inspire and coach the techniques: \\"Do it this way!\\" -- and \\"Right. That's it!\\" Although the responsibilities and roles of a leader and follower are different, the leader needs to be seen to be part of the team working towards the goal. This kind of leader will not be afraid to work. People look to the leader during times of uncertainty and unfamiliarity to find reassurance and security. Storms, emotions, and crises come and go and a good leader takes these as part of the journey and keeps a cool head. In turn, students learn to follow suit. So then, the goal is in view – a good leader views the situation as a whole, and also in part: Always be breaking the course down into manageable steps and making progress towards each part and the finish line. The course changes each day. It is not one race, but many sprints. A good leader is committed to excellence. Second best does not lead to the best success. The good leader not only maintains high standards, but is proactive to advance the goal forward in order to achieve excellence in all areas.","output":"\\"Walk/Work your talk!\\" is a phrase that emphasizes the importance of leading with integrity and being a responsible leader. It highlights that true authority stems from a leader's respect for their purpose, good character, and trustworthiness. Leaders who are passionate and dedicated are more likely to inspire others, and by avoiding complaints and demeaning behavior towards their students, they can foster an environment of open communication and growth. A successful leader serves as a source of inspiration while also being an effective motivator. They can guide their students by providing direction, coaching, and encouragement, instead of forcing them to perform tasks. A key aspect of being a competent leader is being part of the team, working collaboratively towards a shared goal. Such leaders are unafraid to work hard and contribute to the team's efforts. During challenging times, people often turn to leaders for reassurance and stability. An effective leader remains level-headed in the face of uncertainties, emotional turmoil, and crises, thereby setting an example for their students to follow. This calm and collected approach helps leaders maintain focus on accomplishing the larger goals, while simultaneously breaking it down into smaller, achievable steps. Understanding that the journey to success is made up of many smaller milestones enables leaders to adapt and make progress consistently. A leader's commitment to excellence is crucial, as settling for second best hampers overall success. By holding themselves and their team to high standards, good leaders remain ambitious, proactive, and dedicated to achieving excellence. By embodying these essential qualities, a leader can inspire and motivate their team or students, leading them to greater success and fostering growth in every aspect."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is unlikely that I will ever own a (genuine) Chanel handbag. However, a Chanel nail polish was definitely attainable. Whilst they are ridiculously expensive compared with most other nail polishes (AU39), they are still much more affordable than the AU1,000,000,000 a handbag costs (or so I estimate as I have never actually priced one). After seeing swatches of Peridot online, I knew that baby would one day be mine. The other two polishes in the collection - Quartz and Graphite - did not excite me the way Peridot did. That was until I read this review of Graphite on the Polish Police. Suddenly, Graphite was on my radar. It was stuck in my head like an ear worm; another baby, soon to be adopted. I argued with myself for about a month on whether to get these polishes or not. Could I really spend nearly 80 on nail polish. It did seem rather excessive to me. Then, Myers sent me a 10 voucher for my birthday and I got a 30 voucher for doing a survey so the decision was made. For 38 of my own money (less than the cost of two OPI's!) I became the proud owner of Peridot and Graphite. Here is my review of Graphite. Graphite is the most stunningly intriguing nail polish I have ever owned. In the bottle it looks a little bit dull and boring - grey and bland. But on the nail it is completely different. In some lights it is silvery, others a more gun metal grey, and in others it has almost a goldish tone to it. It is super sparkly, yet is not a glitter polish - though in saying that it appears more glitter than shimmer. It is quite opaque. Two coats and you can't see the nail line. In the photos below I have actually applied three coats (plus an addition two top coats of clear) because I was going to a wedding and I wanted it to be perfect. But ordinarily two would be sufficient. Question: How long did the writer argue with herself about whether to buy the Chanel nail polishes?

As the wider Open Source community grows, it becomes more of an issue every day, and something we all need to be aware of. While in Brazil I made a promise to Sulamita that I would be blogging about the issue of discrimination against women, and I have been holding off writing an entry until I had some real, practical, implementable steps that I can advise people to take to help make the situation better. Although I will never fully understand how some women are made to feel at the hands of such discrimination, I have been hoping my contribution could be to help contribute to an awareness of the issue, and for that to happen I felt I needed to construct some doable steps that people can execute. Solving social problems is hard though, which ain’t all that surprising, so I had held off on a blog post until I had some such action points. I have since discovered that there is really one key step that we all need take – don’t accept or allow discrimination in your community. In my mind all discrimination is bad. Every day people get up and are discriminated due to gender, age, race, mobility, technical knowledge and more. The issues of discrimination, while different in the specifics (e.g. women are discriminated in different ways to age discrimination), the underlying issue is very similar – mistreating people because of a grouping they are part of.

Thomas Stearns Eliot,  (26 September 1888 - 4 January 1965) was a British essayist, publisher, playwright, literary and social critic, and \\"one of the twentieth century's major poets\\". He moved from his native United States to England in 1914 at the age of 25, settling, working, and marrying there. He eventually became a British subject in 1927 at the age of 39, renouncing his American passport. Eliot attracted widespread attention for his poem \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\" (1915), which was seen as a masterpiece of the Modernist movement. With the important exception of Four Quartets, Eliot directed much of his creative energies after Ash Wednesday to writing plays in verse, mostly comedies or plays with redemptive endings. He was long a critic and admirer of Elizabethan and Jacobean verse drama; witness his allusions to Webster, Thomas Middleton, William Shakespeare and Thomas Kyd in The Waste Land. In a 1933 lecture he said \\"Every poet would like, I fancy, to be able to think that he had some direct social utility . . . . He would like to be something of a popular entertainer, and be able to think his own thoughts behind a tragic or a comic mask. He would like to convey the pleasures of poetry, not only to a larger audience, but to larger groups of people collectively; and the theatre is the best place in which to do it.\\"  After The Waste Land (1922), he wrote that he was \\"now feeling toward a new form and style\\". One project he had in mind was writing a play in verse, using some of the rhythms of early jazz. The play featured \\"Sweeney\\", a character who had appeared in a number of his poems. Although Eliot did not finish the play, he did publish two scenes from the piece. These scenes, titled Fragment of a Prologue (1926) and Fragment of an Agon (1927), were published together in 1932 as Sweeney Agonistes. Although Eliot noted that this was not intended to be a one-act play, it is sometimes performed as one.  A pageant play by Eliot called The Rock was performed in 1934 for the benefit of churches in the Diocese of London. Much of it was a collaborative effort; Eliot accepted credit only for the authorship of one scene and the choruses. George Bell, the Bishop of Chichester, had been instrumental in connecting Eliot with producer E. Martin Browne for the production of The Rock, and later commissioned Eliot to write another play for the Canterbury Festival in 1935. This one, Murder in the Cathedral, concerning the death of the martyr, Thomas Becket, was more under Eliot's control. Eliot biographer Peter Ackroyd comments that \\"for [Eliot], Murder in the Cathedral and succeeding verse plays offered a double advantage; it allowed him to practice poetry but it also offered a convenient home for his religious sensibility.\\" After this, he worked on more \\"commercial\\" plays for more general audiences: The Family Reunion (1939), The Cocktail Party (1949), The Confidential Clerk, (1953) and The Elder Statesman (1958) (the latter three were produced by Henry Sherek and directed by E. Martin Browne). The Broadway production in New York of The Cocktail Party received the 1950 Tony Award for Best Play. Eliot wrote The Cocktail Party while he was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study.  Regarding his method of playwriting, Eliot explained, \\"If I set out to write a play, I start by an act of choice. I settle upon a particular emotional situation, out of which characters and a plot will emerge. And then lines of poetry may come into being: not from the original impulse but from a secondary stimulation of the unconscious mind.\\" Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: What other plays did he write?","output":"Thomas Stearns Eliot wrote several plays in addition to \\"Murder in the Cathedral.\\" These include \\"The Family Reunion\\" (1939), \\"The Cocktail Party\\" (1949), \\"The Confidential Clerk\\" (1953), and \\"The Elder Statesman\\" (1958).

Article: We've reached a strange--some would say unusual--point. While fighting world hunger continues to be the matter of vital importance according to a recent report from the World Health Organization (WHO), more people now die from being overweight, or say, from being extremely fat, than from being underweight. It's the good life that's more likely to kill us these days. Worse, nearly l8 million children under the age of five around the world are estimated to be overweight. What's going on? We really don't have many excuses for our weight problems. The dangers of the problem have been drilled into us by public-health campaigns since 2001 and the message is getting through--up to a point. In the 1970s, Finland, for example, had the highest rate of heart disease in the world and being overweight was its main cause. Not any more. A public-health campaign has greatly reduced the number of heart disease deaths by 80 per cent over the past three decades. Maybe that explains why the percentage of people in Finland taking diet pills doubled between 2001 and 2005, and doctors even offer surgery of removing fat inside and change the shape of the body. That has become a sort of fashion. No wonder it ranks as the world's most body-conscious country. We know what we should be doing to lose weight--but actually doing it is another matter. By far the most popular excuse is not taking enough exercise. More than half of us admit we lack willpower. Others blame good food. They say: it's just too inviting and it makes them overeat. Still others lay the blame on the Americans, complaining that pounds have piled on thanks to eating too much American-style fast food. Some also blame their parents--their genes. But unfortunately, the parents are wronged because they're normal in shape, or rather slim. It's a similar story around the world, although people are relatively unlikely to have tried to lose weight. Parents are eager to see their kids shape up. Do as I say--not as I do. Question: The example of Finland is used to illustrate   _  . - the cause of heart disease - the fashion of body shaping - the effectiveness of a campaign - the history of a body-conscious country The answer is:","output":"the effectiveness of a campaign"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The stocky woman, wearing a knee-length lace dress and a deep yellow beret is blunt about why she, and other women, opt for a church birth with a traditional birth attendant rather than going to a maternity clinic. \\"They do fasting and prayer here, and if you are pregnant you need to go to the place where there is God and there is daily fasting and prayers. \\"At the hospital there is nothing like prayer. They don't pray. They only give you injections. But as you pray at the church, you get closer to God. \\"On the day of your delivery, God will help you and you will deliver successfully.\\" Ms Martin believes that the church and God will offer more protection than modern health facilities. Unfortunately, there are reports of many women dying while giving birth in the facilities provided by a church. \\"I have first-hand experience of pregnant women being rushed in at critical times when they can no longer be helped.\\" Dr Linda Ayade, the state governor's wife, is so concerned about the possible dangers of a church birth that she is campaigning to ban the practice, and is encouraging women to instead go to health centres to deliver their babies. She has been going from village to village across the state, trying to persuade expectant mothers. At a meeting in Uwanse village she speaks with passion in a local language, Efik, and the women are attentive, excited at being visited by a high-ranking official. Later, she explains her motivation: \\"I have worked in hospitals in Nigeria and I have first-hand experience of pregnant women being rushed in at critical times when they can no longer be helped. \\"Some are even confirmed dead on arrival, and it happens quite often. I have taken it as an obligation to save lives and reduce incidences of maternal mortality relating to child birth and delivery, knowing what it means for a mother to die and leaving children behind.\\" It may, however, take some time before everyone is won over, as child delivery is associated with deep-seated traditional beliefs. Dr Ayade's status does attract a crowd to her meetings, but prayer sessions are also packed out. At the Land of Promise church, a congregation of mostly pregnant women sings and prays, asking God to intervene and deliver their babies at the appointed time. Attached to the prayer hall is the room where the women will give birth - it is small and dirty and lit by a paraffin lamp. Sister Indoreyin Sambhor is the pastor and the church's traditional birth attendant. The short, middle-aged woman says delivering babies is a tradition in her family handed down from mother to daughter. \\"This is the work that God gave me to do. From my youth, I helped my mother to deliver babies. God has been helping me, and God will not allow anything dangerous or evil to happen. \\"I pray with the mothers and my followers can testify about my skills... Every pregnant woman that has come to me has delivered safely and gone home with their children.\\" \\"God has been helping me, and God will not allow anything dangerous or evil to happen. I pray with the mothers and my followers can testify about my skills.\\" \\"God has been helping us so I don't even believe that there can be complications in children delivery.\\" Twenty-six-year-old Mercy Martin Udofia, in her eighth month of pregnancy, is a follower of Sister Indoreyin. The dark-skinned woman, wearing a tight-fitting dress that shows her bulging tummy, says she gave birth to her first child in this church, and she will come back for a second time. \\"As a child of God, you do not stay idle, you have to be closer to God. So that as a pregnant woman, when it comes to the time of delivery, everything will be easy for you.\\" But things are not always so rosy. A woman recently died while giving birth to twins at a church in the Burrow Pit suburb of Calabar. A relative of the deceased said she passed away following complications arising from a retained placenta which the traditional birth attendant could not deal with. The twins survived and are currently being treated at a hospital in Calabar. The authorities are taking action to deal with the issue. Head of the state primary health agency Betta Edu says the state government will soon be passing a law aimed at stopping pregnant women giving birth in churches and seeing traditional birth attendants. She thinks that many traditional birth attendants tell women that hospitals and health centres only carry out caesareans, and some of them could die as a result of heavy bleeding. With such fears at the back of their minds, they see the birth attendants as the best choice, as they are both closer to God and have the traditional skills to help them deliver safely. But Dr Edu argues that the practice will die out with a change in the law and the building of new health centres in every community. All those involved in trying to change attitudes recognise that a lot of work still needs to be done. \\"Our people are deeply religious, and some of them are so deep in the traditional practise that it's usually very difficult to shrug them off,\\" Dr Ayade says. \\"We need to educate them, encourage them and even entice them.\\"","output":"In southern Nigeria, many pregnant women choose to give birth in churches under the guidance of traditional birth attendants rather than at maternity clinics. These women believe that prayer and God offer more protection than modern health facilities. However, there are instances of women dying while giving birth in church facilities. Dr. Linda Ayade, the state governor's wife, is campaigning to ban this practice and encourage women to go to health centers for delivery. She has been visiting villages to persuade pregnant women to seek professional medical care. Child delivery in Nigeria is deeply rooted in traditional beliefs, making it difficult to change mindsets, but Dr. Ayade believes education, encouragement, and building new health centers can help. Authorities are also working on passing laws to stop pregnant women from giving birth in churches and discourage reliance on traditional birth attendants."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Celenda's manservant had purchased two of the biggest and strongest oxen in Fena Kef and they now roasted over the hall's two huge braziers. The smell filled Celenda's nostrils. She closed her eyes and laid back on her silk divan, enjoying the sights and sounds. Her finger fiddled with a torn seam on the divan's armrest and her pleasure faded. She would have flogged her seamstress for allowing such a thing but the woman had fled a year ago. She could barely afford clothing acceptable to a woman of her position, though few could say for certain what that position was, so she simply wore less clothes overall. She raised her arms behind her back and let the warmth of the braziers flow over her body. Though the number shrank, many still enjoyed Celenda's frequent celebrations. Some laughed and shouted on one side, some coupled in the dark shadows and behind silk curtains. Most feasted and drank and everyone partook in the red lotus. Celenda beckoned a thin slave boy, one of her last few, and he came holding a bronze bowl. Dried red leaves covered the bottom of the bowl. 'Why is this bowl not full?' she shouted at the boy. He cringed but she could tell he was not really frightened. She could not afford to injure or kill him and everyone knew it. She slapped him, but not hard. If she hit too hard she would find herself with one less slave along with her diminishing supply of the red leaf. Instantly the thoughts of the crumbling villa, the torn furniture, and the diminishing coffers fled from her mind. Euphoria flowed in. She felt it in her fingers and toes.

Summarize this article: When it comes to playing spin the bottle, the very first thing you'll need is other people (unless you want to play by yourself, which would be a pretty sad sight). To begin, find a group of willing friends — the more the merrier! Try to get a group that contains people of both genders so that there are a range of many different combinations of people who can potentially kiss. Make sure your friends know what they are getting into before you start playing.  Kissing is something that's usually reserved for people who really like each other, so forcing people to kiss who don't want to can be really embarrassing for everyone involved. Don't pressure anyone into playing with you who doesn't want to. When everyone is ready (and willing) to play, arrange yourselves in a circle so that you're all facing inward. Traditionally, this is done on the floor, though there's no reason you can't also do it standing or sitting around a table. Regardless of exactly how you arrange your group in a circle, it's usually best to pick a spot with a tough, hard surface, like a section of hardwood floor. This ensures that the bottle you use can spin well without scuffing or damaging the floor. When you're all ready to play, pick one person to start the game. This person grabs a bottle (or, really, any similarly spin-able object, like a pen, glass, key, etc.) and spins it hard in the middle of the circle of players. After it starts spinning, no one may touch the bottle until it comes to a complete stop. If you're unsure of how to decide who should spin the bottle first, you may want to try letting the oldest or youngest play go first or having one person think of a random number and starting with the person who guesses closest to it. When the bottle comes to a stop, its \\"neck\\" (the end that opens) should be pointing at someone sitting in the circle. The person who spun the bottle has to kiss this person!  If you're not using a bottle, designate one end of the object you're using as the pointing end. For instance, if you're using a pen, you might want to use the writing end of the pen as its \\"point\\". If you spin the bottle and it lands on you, spin again. That's really all there is to it! After one person has spun the bottle and given a kiss to the person the bottle ends up pointing at, the person next to him or her in the circle gives the bottle a spin and gives a kiss to the person his or her spin lands on. Play proceeds in one direction — either clockwise or counter-clockwise.  Note that sometimes the bottle will end up pointing at the space between two people — in this case, you may want to make the spinner kiss the person that the bottle's point is closest to. Additionally, the bottle may end up pointing at someone that you're not comfortable kissing because of your romantic preferences (for instance, if you're attracted to boys and it lands on a girl). In this case, you may want to kiss the person of the appropriate gender who's closest to the bottle's point. Congratulations! You've learned how to play spin the bottle. This fun and easy game is best enjoyed with a light-hearted attitude from all involved. Don't let things get too romantic or sexual — it's just a game, and one which can become pretty awkward pretty fast if it's taken too seriously. However, if you do feel that telltale \\"spark\\" with someone after playing the game, there's no reason why you shouldn't make a point to get to know him or her after the game! Spin the bottle is great for igniting new connections you might not otherwise have made. Summary:","output":"Spin the bottle is a traditional game played with friends, usually involving kissing between the participants. To play, gather a group of people, ideally with diverse gender representation, and make sure everyone is comfortable participating. Arrange the group in a circle, either sitting on a hard surface or standing, and determine the order of play by either picking the oldest, youngest, or using a random number method. One person starts by spinning a bottle (or any spin-able object) in the center of the circle. When the bottle stops spinning, the person it points to is the one to be kissed by the spinner. To maintain a fun and light-hearted atmosphere, it's crucial to avoid pressuring anyone into participating and respect personal boundaries. In cases where the bottle points between two people or to someone the spinner is not comfortable kissing due to romantic preferences, the spinner can choose the person closest to the bottle's point in the desired gender. The game proceeds in one direction, either clockwise or counter-clockwise, with each person taking a turn spinning the bottle and kissing the person it points to. Enjoy the game as a casual and entertaining activity, but also feel free to pursue any connections that may arise outside of the game."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

WHITE HOUSE — U.S. President Donald Trump told a group of Republican lawmakers at a meeting Tuesday he backs a pair of their immigration bills under consideration in the House of Representatives. The meeting came as criticism continued over the Trump administration's policy of separating children from their parents and other adults at the southern border with Mexico as they illegally enter the United States. In his remarks to lawmakers, according to White House principal deputy press secretary Raj Shah, Trump \\"endorsed both House immigration bills that build the wall, close legal loopholes, cancel the visa lottery, curb so-called \\"chain migration,\\" and solve the border crisis and family separation issue by allowing for family detention and removal.\\" Republican Rep. Mark Meadows said Trump told the lawmakers they need to get something done on immigration \\"right away.\\" House Homeland Security chairman Michael McCaul described the meeting with Trump as excellent, and confirmed that the president embraced the bill he and Congressman Bob Goodlatte are pushing. \\"The president is a thousand percent behind it,\\" McCaul said. Asked whether the legislation would end the family separations, he responded, \\"They will not be separated if the bill passes,\\" which he explained includes 18 billion for a border wall Trump desires. The House is set to vote later in the week on the two bills. It is not clear that either piece of legislation has enough votes to win passage. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday \\"all of the members of the Republican conference support a plan that keeps families together,\\" adding he intends to ask Democrats to support the measure. In a Reuters/Ipsos poll released Tuesday, 28 percent of people said they support the policy, while 57 percent opposed it and the other 15 percent said they did not know. Trump administration officials have defended the policy. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen pushed back at the negative media coverage in a Monday briefing, asserting...

Rockefeller was the second of six children and eldest son born in Richford, New York to con artist William Avery \\"Bill\\" Rockefeller (November 13, 1810 - May 11, 1906) and Eliza Davison (September 12, 1813 - March 28, 1889). His siblings were Lucy (1838-1878), William Jr. (1841-1922), Mary (1843-1925) and twins Franklin (Frank) (1845-1917) and Frances (1845-1847). His father was of English and German descent while his mother was of Scots-Irish descent. Bill was first a lumberman and then a traveling salesman who identified himself as a \\"botanic physician\\" and sold elixirs. In 1859, Rockefeller went into the produce commission business with a partner, Maurice B. Clark, and they raised 4,000 (108,948 in 2017 dollars) in capital. Rockefeller went steadily ahead in business from there, making money each year of his career. While his brother Frank fought in the Civil War, Rockefeller tended his business and hired substitute soldiers. He gave money to the Union cause, as did many rich Northerners who avoided combat. Rockefeller was an abolitionist who voted for President Abraham Lincoln and supported the then-new Republican Party. As he said, \\"God gave me money\\", and he did not apologize for it. He felt at ease and righteous following Methodist preacher John Wesley's dictum, \\"gain all you can, save all you can, and give all you can.\\"  At that time, the Federal government was subsidizing oil prices, driving the price up from .35 a barrel in 1862 to as high as 13.75. This created an oil-drilling glut, with thousands of speculators attempting to make their fortunes. Most failed, but those who struck oil did not even need to be efficient. They would blow holes in the ground and gather up the oil as they could, often leading to creeks and rivers flowing with wasted oil in the place of water.  In this environment of wasteful boom, the partners switched from foodstuffs to oil, building an oil refinery in 1863 in \\"The Flats\\", then Cleveland's burgeoning industrial area. The refinery was directly owned by Andrews, Clark & Company, which was composed of Clark & Rockefeller, chemist Samuel Andrews, and M. B. Clark's two brothers. The commercial oil business was then in its infancy. Whale oil had become too expensive for the masses, and a cheaper, general-purpose lighting fuel was needed.  While other refineries would keep the 60% of oil product that became kerosene, but dump the other 40% in rivers and massive sludge piles, Rockefeller remained as thrifty and efficient as ever, using the gasoline to fuel the refinery, and selling the rest as lubricating oil, petroleum jelly and paraffin wax, and other by-products. Tar was used for paving, naphtha shipped to gas plants. Likewise, Rockefeller's refineries hired their own plumbers, cutting the cost of pipe-laying in half. Barrels that cost 2.50 each ended up only .96 when Rockefeller bought the wood and had them built for himself.  In February 1865, in what was later described by oil industry historian Daniel Yergin as a \\"critical\\" action, Rockefeller bought out the Clark brothers for 72,500 (equivalent to 1 million in 2017 dollars) at auction and established the firm of Rockefeller & Andrews. Rockefeller said, \\"It was the day that determined my career.\\" He was well positioned to take advantage of postwar prosperity and the great expansion westward fostered by the growth of railroads and an oil-fueled economy. He borrowed heavily, reinvested profits, adapted rapidly to changing markets, and fielded observers to track the quickly expanding industry.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: who was the partnership between?","output":"The partnership was between Rockefeller, Maurice B.

Movie plot: In the year 1900, a depressed writer named Christian begins writing on his typewriter (\\"Nature Boy\\"). One year earlier, Christian moved to the Montmartre district of Paris to become a writer among members of the area's Bohemian movement. He encounters performers led by Toulouse-Lautrec; his writing skills allow them to finish their proposed show, \\"Spectacular Spectacular\\", that they wish to sell to Harold Zidler, owner of the Moulin Rouge. The group arrives at the Moulin Rouge as Zidler and his \\"Diamond Dog Dancers\\" perform for the audience (\\"Lady Marmalade/Zidler's Rap (Can Can)/Smells Like Teen Spirit\\"). Toulouse arranges for Christian to see Satine, the star courtesan, in her private quarters to present the work, unaware that Zidler is promising Satine to the wealthy and unscrupulous Duke of Monroth, a potential investor in the cabaret (\\"Sparkling Diamonds\\" medley). Satine mistakes Christian for the Duke, and dances with him before retiring to her private chamber with him to discuss things privately (\\"Rhythm of the Night), but soon learns he is just a writer; by this time Christian has fallen in love with her (\\"Your Song\\"). The Duke interrupts them; Christian and Satine claim they were practicing lines for \\"Spectacular Spectacular\\". With Zidler's help, Toulouse and the rest of the troupe pitch the show to the Duke with an improvised plot about an evil maharajah attempting to woo an Indian courtesan who loves a poor sitar player (\\"The Pitch (Spectacular Spectacular)\\"). The Duke backs the show on the condition that only he may see Satine. Satine contemplates on Christian and her longing to leave the Moulin Rouge to become \\"a real actress\\" (\\"One Day I'll Fly Away\\"). Christian goes back to Satine to convince her that she loves him (\\"Elephant Love Medley\\"). As the cabaret is converted to a theater, Christian and Satine continue seeing each other under the pretense of rehearsing Satine's lines.

A:","output":"In the improvised plot of \\"Spectacular Spectacular\\" presented in the movie Moulin Rouge!, the Indian courtesan is in love with a poor sitar player. This storyline is concocted during the pitch to the Duke of Monroth, the potential investor in the cabaret, who agrees to back the show with the condition that only he gets to see Satine, the star courtesan at the heart of the narrative. The story of the Indian courtesan and the poor sitar player serves as a parallel to the unfolding love affair between Christian, the writer, and Satine, who he falls in love with. Their secret liaison has a similar struggle like the characters in the improvised plot, as they have to hide their love affair from the Duke, who becomes suspicious and jealous. The film, Moulin Rouge!, combines this fiction within fiction with vibrant and energetic musical performances, iconic design elements, and complex character relationships. The parallel between the improvised plot of \\"Spectacular Spectacular\\" and the film's main narrative not only provides an interesting depth to the story but also highlights the internal turmoil and emotional struggles faced by Satine and Christian in their pursuit of love. As an investor, you should consider whether the film's unique combination of historical setting, musical performances, and romantic narrative appeals to you, and potentially a wider audience. Additionally, it is essential to weigh in factors such as the overall budget required, target audiences, marketing strategies, and potential returns before deciding to invest in the film proposal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band? is inside the article: The Mothers of Invention played in New York in late 1966 and were offered a contract at the Garrick Theater (at 152 Bleecker Street, above the Cafe au Go Go) during Easter 1967. This proved successful and Herb Cohen extended the booking, which eventually lasted half a year. As a result, Zappa and his wife, along with the Mothers of Invention, moved to New York. Their shows became a combination of improvised acts showcasing individual talents of the band as well as tight performances of Zappa's music. Everything was directed by Zappa using hand signals. Guest performers and audience participation became a regular part of the Garrick Theater shows. One evening, Zappa managed to entice some U.S. Marines from the audience onto the stage, where they proceeded to dismember a big baby doll, having been told by Zappa to pretend that it was a \\"gook baby\\".Zappa uniquely contributed to the avant-garde, anti-establishment music scene of the 1960s, sampling radio tape recordings and incorporating his own philosophical ideals to music and freedom of expression in his pieces. Bands such as AMM and Faust also contributed to the radio sampling techniques of the 1960s. Situated in New York, and only interrupted by the band's first European tour, the Mothers of Invention recorded the album widely regarded as the peak of the group's late 1960s work, We're Only in It for the Money (released 1968). It was produced by Zappa, with Wilson credited as executive producer. From then on, Zappa produced all albums released by the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. We're Only in It for the Money featured some of the most creative audio editing and production yet heard in pop music, and the songs ruthlessly satirized the hippie and flower power phenomena. He sampled plundered surf music in We're only in It for the Money, as well as the Beatles' tape work from their song Tomorrow Never Knows. The cover photo parodied that of the Beatles' Sgt.

Classify your answers into 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'e'. Problem:Problem: a alone can finish a work in 10 days which b alone can finish in 15 days . if they work together and finish it , then out of a total wages of rs . 3000 , a will get :  Options: a ) rs . 1200 , b ) rs . 1500 , c ) rs . 1800 , d ) rs . 2000 , e ) none of these Solution:","output":"Step 1: Determine the individual work rates. If 'a' can finish the work in 10 days, their work rate is 1/10 of the work per day. If 'b' can finish the work in 15 days, their work rate is 1/15 of the work per day. Step 2: Calculate their combined work rate. When they work together, their combined work rate is the sum of their individual work rates: (1/10 + 1/15) Step 3: Simplify the combined work rate. To simplify, find the least common denominator (LCD) which is 30 in this case: [(3/30) + (2/30)] = 5/30 The combined work rate when they work together is 5/30 or 1/6 of the work per day. Step 4: Calculate the ratio of their work rates. To determine how much each person should get paid based on their work rate, we need to find the ratio of their work rates: a's work rate : b's work rate = (1/10) : (1/15) Step 5: Simplify the ratio. To simplify, multiply each side by the LCD (30): [(1/10)*30] : [(1/15)*30] = 3 : 2 Hence, the ratio of their work rates is 3:2. Step 6: Distribute the wages based on the ratio. Now, we need to distribute the total wages of Rs. 3000 based on the ratio 3:2. Step 7: Find the shares of 'a' and 'b'. Let x represent the share of 'a' and y represent the share of 'b'. According to the ratio, x/y = 3/2, and x + y = 3000. Step 8: Solve the equations. We can solve the equations to find the shares of 'a' and 'b': x/y = 3/2 -> x = (3/2)y x + y = 3000 -> (3/2)y + y = 3000 Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 3y + 2y = 6000 -> 5y = 6000 Divide both sides by 5 to get the value of y: y = 1200 Now substitute the value of y back into the equation for x: x = (3/2)y -> x = (3/2)*1200 -> x = 1800 Step 9: Verify the answer. 'a' will receive Rs. 1800, and 'b' will receive Rs. 1200. The total wages are still Rs. 3000, so our answer is correct.
