Un ejemplo simple de un componente podría ser un archivo llamado \`MiComponente.astro\`: \`\`\`html --- // Esta es la sección en la que puedes colocar tu código JavaScript o TypeScript. // Se puede utilizar para definir la lógica del componente, obtener datos, etc. const saludo = '¡Hola!'; --- <!-- Esto es la plantilla del componente, escrita en HTML. --> <div> <p>{saludo}, este es mi primer componente en Astro.</p> </div> \`\`\` En el código anterior, hay dos secciones distintas: 1. La sección de \\"script\\" delimitada por tres guiones (\`---\`). Aquí es donde pones tu código lógico o declarativo que no será visible en el resultado final del HTML, pero que determinará qué datos y cómo se muestran. 2. La sección de \\"plantilla\\", que está fuera de los guiones. Aquí es donde escribes el markup que se convertirá en el HTML final. Las variables del script se pueden referenciar dentro de la plantilla usando la sintaxis \`{variable}\`. # Propiedades (Props) Al igual que en otros frameworks como React o Vue, puedes pasar datos a los componentes de Astro a través de propiedades, comúnmente conocidas como \\"props\\". Supongamos que quieres pasar un saludo personalizado a \`MiComponente.astro\`. El componente puede actualizarse para aceptar una prop como esta: \`\`\`html --- // Aquí se interceptan las props del componente. const { saludoPersonalizado } = Astro.props; --- <div> <p>{saludoPersonalizado}</p> </div> \`\`\` Y puedes usarlo en otro componente o en la página pasando el 'saludoPersonalizado': \`\`\`html --- // Otra sección de script en otra página o componente. import MiComponente from './MiComponente.astro'; --- <body> <MiComponente saludoPersonalizado=\\"¡Hola Mundo!\\" /> </body> \`\`\` # Estructura de un Componente En un nivel más avanzado, un componente de Astro podría tener lo siguiente: - Importaciones de otros componentes. - Estilos CSS encapsulados que solo afectan a este componente. - Scripts cliente-side con funcionalidades interactivas. Aquí tienes un ejemplo más complejo: \`\`\`html --- import OtroComponente from '../path/a/OtroComponente.astro'; const { saludoPersonalizado } = Astro.props; // Importar un script para agregar interactividad del lado del cliente. import ClientScript from '../scripts/ClientScript.js'; --- <style> /* Estilos que solo aplicaran a este componente. */ p { color: blue; } </style> <div> <p>{saludoPersonalizado}</p> <OtroComponente /> </div> <!-- Añadir un script del lado del cliente que solo se cargará cuando este componente sea visible en la página. --> <script type=\\"module\\" src={ClientScript}><\/script> \`\`\` En este código, usamos \`<style>\` para los estilos que solo se aplican dentro del componente. También importamos y usamos otro componente llamado \`OtroComponente.astro\`. Por último, hemos añadido un \`<script>\` que enlaza a un módulo JavaScript para el cliente, permitiendo agregar interactividad. Este es un resumen básico de cómo funcionan los componentes en Astro. Como recomendación, siempre consulta la [documentación oficial de Astro](https://docs.astro.build/core-concepts/astro-components/) para obtener la información más precisa y actualizada."},{"instruction":"does Represent the electron configuration of an element or ions of an element using the Aufbau principle. encompass 1s 2 2s 2 2p 6 3s 2 3p 6 1.

To determine which of the provided species has this electron configuration, we need to look at the number of electrons each species has: (A) Oxygen (O) has 8 electrons. Its ground state electron configuration is 1s² 2s² 2p⁴, which does not match the given configuration. (B) Neon (Ne) has 10 electrons. Its ground state electron configuration is 1s² 2s² 2p⁶, which also does not match the given configuration. (C) Potassium ion (K⁺) has 18 electrons because a neutral potassium atom has 19 electrons (as the atomic number of potassium is 19), and it loses one electron to form a K⁺ ion. The ground state electron configuration for a neutral potassium atom is 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p⁶ 4s¹. Upon losing an electron from the 4s orbital, the configuration for K⁺ becomes 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p⁶, which matches the given configuration. (D) Chlorine ion (Cl⁺) is not typically encountered because chlorine prefers to gain an electron to form a Cl⁻ ion rather than losing one. A neutral chlorine atom has 17 electrons, and if it loses one electron to form Cl⁺ (which is unusual), it would have 16 electrons, not matching the electron configuration given. Based on this analysis, the correct answer is: (C) K⁺"},{"instruction":"does Represent the electron configuration of an element or ions of an element using the Aufbau principle. encompass the question?","output":"The Aufbau principle is indeed used to represent the electron configuration of an element or ions of an element. According to the Aufbau principle, electrons fill atomic orbitals of the lowest available energy levels before occupying higher levels. In other words, electrons are added one at a time to the lowest energy orbitals until all of them are placed in the appropriate orbitals according to a set of rules that include the Pauli exclusion principle and Hund's rule. The statement \\"Represent the electron configuration of an element or ions of an element using the Aufbau principle,\\" is essentially a task or an instruction that implies using the Aufbau principle to write down the electron configuration for an element or its ions. The electron configuration that you've mentioned, \\"1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p⁶,\\" represents the application of the Aufbau principle where electrons are filled into the orbitals starting from the lowest energy level (1s) and moving up to the next levels in the order of increasing energy. So yes, your original question of which species (O, Ne, K⁺, Cl⁺) has the electron configuration \\"1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p⁶\\" does encompass using the Aufbau principle to establish the electron configurations for each option and thereby determine which one corresponds to the provided configuration. As determined earlier, K⁺ is the species that has this specific electron configuration."},{"instruction":"2. A Lewis diagram for the molecule C2H4 is shown above.

The geometry around each carbon in ethylene is trigonal planar due to the sp² hybridization of the carbon atoms involved in the double bond. This arrangement leads to bond angles of approximately 120°. Here's why the geometry is trigonal planar: - Each carbon atom has three sigma (σ) bonds (one C-C and two C-H bonds) and one pi (π) bond (part of the C=C double bond). - The three sigma bonds around each carbon atom are formed by the overlap of sp² hybrid orbitals. - The unhybridized p orbital is perpendicular to the plane created by the sp² orbitals and is used to form the pi bond. Since the geometry that results from sp² hybridized atoms is trigonal planar, the H-C-H bond angles in the molecule C2H4 are closest to 120°. Therefore, the correct answer is: (C) 120°"},{"instruction":"does Based on the relationship between Lewis diagrams, VSEPR theory, bond orders, and bond polarities: a. Explain structural properties of molecules. b. Explain electron properties of molecules. encompasse the question?","output":"Yes, your question is related to several concepts that are foundational in understanding the molecular structure and electron properties of molecules: a. Explain structural properties of molecules. When discussing the structural properties of molecules, several theories and concepts come into play: - **Lewis Diagrams:** Lewis structures are diagrams that represent the valence electrons of atoms within a molecule. They are used to show how electrons are distributed around atoms and how they participate in bonding. The structures help predict the arrangement of atoms and the distribution of electrons in the molecule. - **VSEPR Theory:** The Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory is used to predict the geometry of individual molecules based on the repulsion between electron pairs around a central atom. This theory helps to explain the shape and bond angles around the central atom(s) in a molecule. - **Bond Orders:** Bond order refers to the number of chemical bonds between a pair of atoms. For example, a single bond has a bond order of one, a double bond has a bond order of two, etc. Bond order influences the bond length and strength: higher bond orders usually mean shorter and stronger bonds. - **Bond Polarities:** Bond polarity arises from the difference in electronegativity between the atoms involved in a bond. When electrons in a bond are unequally shared due to a significant electronegativity difference, the bond becomes polar, resulting in partial charges on the atoms. This polarity can affect the molecule’s physical properties and reactivity. b. Explain electron properties of molecules. - **Lewis Diagrams and Electron Configurations:** By showing the distribution of valence electrons through Lewis diagrams, one can infer the electron configuration and predict how these electrons will behave in chemical reactions. The structure indicates which electrons are paired, which are unpaired, and which might be available for bonding. - **Molecular Orbital Theory:** This theory describes how atomic orbitals combine to form molecular orbitals, which are spread out over the entire molecule. Electrons in these molecular orbitals influence the molecule's stability, magnetism, and chemical reactivity. - **Electronegativity and Electron Density:** Electronegativity affects electron distribution within a molecule, which is crucial for understanding chemical reactivity. Polar bonds will have uneven electron density distribution, leading to dipole moments, while nonpolar bonds will have even distribution. In summary, understanding these concepts helps to explain both the structural and electronic properties of molecules. Structural properties such as shape and bond lengths, as well as electron properties like reactivity and bonding capabilities, can be explained by analyzing Lewis diagrams, VSEPR theory, bond orders, and bond polarities in tandem."},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art Architecture: Gothic","output":"Gothic Architecture Artwork | Vintage Cathedral Illustration | Versatile Design for Mugs, Shirts, Paintings | Unique Home & Fashion Accessory"},{"instruction":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Gothic Architecture Artwork | Vintage Cathedral Illustration | Versatile Design for Mugs, Shirts, Paintings | Unique Home &amp; Fashion Accessory.

( Spoof )","output":"Hypothetical Geoff Marshall, the well-known YouTuber and transport enthusiast famous for his videos exploring railways and stations, particularly in the UK, would probably approach a spoof video about the \\"least used station in Rutland\\" with his typical blend of humor, trivia, and genuine enthusiasm for train travel. So, let's set the scene for this spoof. Rutland is England's smallest historic county located in the East Midlands, and it's known for its picturesque rural landscapes and charming villages. Considering Rutland is small and doesn't actually have many railway stations, the idea itself is ripe for a spoof. Here is how the spoof could go: Title: \\"The Quest for Rutland's Least Used Station!\\" Opening Scene: Geoff: \\"Today, I'm on a quest to uncover a hidden gem in the rail world, the enigma that is: Rutland's least used station! Now, you might ask, 'Geoff, why aren't you talking about the UK's least used station overall?' Well, that's because everyone already knows about those. It's time to get even more niche. Enter Rutland!\\" Main Content: Geoff would travel to Rutland and begin a humorous montage of him asking locals about the least used station in the county, only to receive puzzled looks and responses such as \\"What stations? We barely have any!\\" or \\"Are you sure you're not looking for the best pub instead?\\" After the amusing encounters, Geoff would reveal the fictional \\"least used station\\" – let's call it \\"Middle-nowhere Halt.\\" He would proceed to visit the fictional location, hamming up the experience. Geoff (arriving at an empty field): \\"Here we are at Middle-nowhere Halt, a station so rarely used that the trains often forget it exists. According to official statistics, it had just one passenger last year, and that was me... because I got off by mistake.\\" He'd continue with made-up trivia about the station: Geoff: \\"The platform here is made from locally sourced mud, and the waiting room is rumored to be haunted by the ghost of a Victorian ticket inspector who was lost trying to find the station in the first place.\\" Ending Scene: Geoff would conclude with an impassioned plea to his viewers to consider visiting Middle-nowhere Halt, but then jokingly remind them that it is, after all, a fictional station in a spoof video. Geoff: \\"So, if you ever find yourself in Rutland, do try to stop by Middle-nowhere Halt. Just remember to bring a step ladder – there's no actual platform, and the trains definitely don't stop here. Until next time, happy travels... to somewhere that actually exists!\\" Outro: In true Geoff Marshall fashion, he might end the video with bloopers or off-the-cuff remarks highlighting the comedy of his fictional quest and his love for all things railway. Remember, this is a playful spoof, and Rutland does, in reality, have a least used station which, as of knowledge cutoff in early 2023, is Ashwell in the county of Leicestershire that serves the Rutland village of Ashwell. Geoff Marshall has actually visited and documented the least used real stations across various counties and regions in the UK, including Rutland, as part of his \\"Least Used Station\\" series on YouTube."},{"instruction":"Hypothetical Tom Scott: \\"There used to be a railway solely for molten steel ( it was on teeside IIRC)","output":"In a characteristic Tom Scott presentation, we could imagine him explaining the fascinating and lesser-known piece of industrial history related to Teesside's steel industry. Although this is a hypothetical scenario, it plays along with Tom Scott's typical style of delivering educational content with notable facts and anecdotes. Here is a dramatized outline of how such an episode could unfold: Title: \\"The Railway That Carried Molten Steel: Teesside's Forgotten Industrial Marvel\\" Opening Shot: Tom standing with industrial remains in the background on Teesside. Tom: \\"I'm here on Teesside, in the North East of England, a place that was once at the heart of Britain's steelmaking industry. Steelmaking is an intense process, involving temperatures higher than 1,500 degrees Celsius—and that's not easy to transport. But here, they had a unique solution: a railway specifically designed for carrying molten steel.\\" Cut to historical photos and footage. Tom: \\"In its heyday, Teesside was dotted with blast furnaces and steelworks, the lifeblood of the local economy. But the process didn't end when the steel poured out of the furnaces. It needed to be transported quickly to the forges and rolling mills while it was still blazing hot.\\" Cut back to Tom walking along a disused railway track. Tom: \\"You can still see the remains of this specialized railway, with its robust tracks and wide gauge. The trains that ran here were not ordinary by any means. They were essentially heavily insulated ladle cars, carrying thousands of tonnes of molten steel straight from the blast furnaces to the nearby mills.\\" Graphics showing how the molten steel was transported. Tom: \\"These train cars had to withstand the intense heat, and the engineers here designed them with refractory bricks and advanced materials, technologies that were cutting-edge at the time. The heat radiating from the ladles was so intense that it was said you could feel it from the train's observation platform.\\" Cut to interview with a retired steelworker or local historian. Tom: \\"I've talked to people who remember the molten steel railway. They tell me it was an impressive, if not slightly terrifying, sight: glowing orange metal, liquid like water, rumbling past on its way to becoming girders, beams, and all manner of steel products.\\" Tom reflects on the site's significance. Tom: \\"Now, all that remains are these tracks, overgrown and quiet. The industry has moved on, and the steelworks have largely closed. But for a time, the molten steel railway of Teesside was a testament to human ingenuity—a specialized solution to an incredibly challenging problem.\\" Outro: Tom's Call to Action Tom: \\"It's a small piece of history that very few know about, another example of how our industrial past shapes the landscape and communities of the present. So next time you see a steel beam, spare a thought for the extraordinary journey it might have taken, on a railway born from necessity, innovation, and molten metal.\\" [End Video] This is how Tom Scott might bring to life the story of the unique railway dedicated to carrying molelt steel that once operated in the industrial heartland of Teesside, offering viewers both a history lesson and a look at the marvels of engineering. While the scenario above is entirely fictional, it's the kind of material that fits Tom Scott's knack for uncovering intriguing stories of engineering, technology, and science set against the backdrop of human history."},{"instruction":"Hypothetical Tom Scott: Deciding where up is ( Gyroscopes and aircraft instruments..)","output":"Crafting a hypothetical Tom Scott video on the subject of gyroscopes and their role in determining 'up' in aircraft instruments could look something like this: Title: \\"How Do We Decide Where 'Up' Is On An Aircraft? The Invisible Spin of Gyroscopes\\" Opening Shot: Tom Scott standing in an aircraft hangar, with a small aircraft in the background. Tom: \\"When you're on the ground, knowing which way is up is easy. Gravity gives you a pretty solid reference point. But what happens when you're piloting an aircraft, banking, looping, or flying through clouds with no visible horizon? How do you decide where 'up' is then? The answer has been spinning quite literally inside cockpits for over a century: gyroscopes.\\" Cut to a shot of a gyroscope spinning on a stand. Tom: \\"A gyroscope is a device that exploits the principles of angular momentum to maintain a constant orientation in space. When you spin a gyroscope, thanks to conservation of angular momentum, it wants to keep pointing in the same direction—even if you move its base.\\" Graphic of how gyroscopes work, explaining angular momentum. Tom: \\"And that property makes it incredibly useful in aircraft. Gyroscopes are at the heart of one of the essential instruments in a cockpit: the artificial horizon or attitude indicator.\\" Explainer graphic showing the artificial horizon's components. Tom: \\"The artificial horizon shows pilots the orientation of their aircraft relative to the Earth's horizon. Even if you can't see outside, this instrument tells you whether you're flying straight and level or if you're tilting to one side or climbing or descending.\\" Cut to Tom inside a flight simulator or a cockpit. Tom: \\"Inside here, you'll find a gyroscope connected to a display with a miniature plane and horizon line. As the aircraft moves, the gyroscope remains stable. The plane on the display tilts and rotates around the fixed gyroscope, showing the pilot the plane's actual attitude compared to the stable horizon.\\" Shot of a modern glass cockpit. Tom: \\"But that's not the end of the story! Today's aircraft often use gyroscopes that are nothing like the spinning tops you might be imagining. They're digital, without moving parts, relying on laser or fiber-optic technology to do the same job more reliably. These are called ring laser gyros or fiber optic gyros.\\" Explainer graphic showing how ring laser gyros and fiber-optic gyros work. Tom: \\"Instead of using physical rotation, they measure changes in orientation through the interference of laser beams or light pulses. Even without moving parts, they're still gyroscopes — they're still relying on the same fundamental physics to give a reference for which way is 'up'.\\" Closing Shot: Tom in front of the aircraft, summarizing the importance of gyroscopes. Tom: \\"From those bulky, spinning mechanical devices to today's sophisticated ring laser and fiber-optic systems, gyroscopes have been quietly defining 'up' for pilots all around the world.

Title: \\"How the Telephone Made London's Docklands Railway a Relic of the Past\\" Opening Shot: Tom standing near the remnants of the old Docklands railways or perhaps in modern Canary Wharf, surrounded by the gleaming towers of London's revitalized dockside. Tom: \\"The London Docklands - once home to one of the world's busiest ports, complete with its own network of railways, cranes, and warehouses. Yet even as business thrived, the whole system was rendered nearly obsolete by a technology we now take for granted: the telephone. How did a communication device contribute to the decline of an entire transport network? Let’s find out.\\" Cut to historical images and footage of the Docklands in their industrial prime. Tom: \\"In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Docklands was a hub of global trade. Ships from around the world brought goods to be stored in warehouses, and from there, small railways would transport these goods inland. These internal dock railways were vital for moving large quantities of cargo efficiently from ships to storage and onward.\\" Now, a scene with an old dock railway map and an antique telephone. Tom: \\"Communication within this vast area was complicated and slow. Orders for moving goods were typically relayed in person or through written messages - a system that was not only clumsy but also delayed the movement of goods significantly.\\" Cut back to Tom. Tom: \\"With the advent of the telephone, suddenly, those time-consuming trips and delayed messages were unnecessary. It was possible to relay orders and get immediate responses. Warehouses could operate far more efficiently, and the reliance on those dockside railways dropped sharply. Why lay tracks when you could place a call?\\" Explainer graphic of telephony impact on shipping logistics. Tom: \\"Telephone lines quickly became the new infrastructure, weaving throughout the docks and beyond, accelerating commerce and shrinking the vast industrial landscape into an interconnected network of instant communication.\\" A shot of an old railway being overtaken by more conventional roads and transport. Tom: \\"As businesses adopted the telephone, the demand for road transport increased. It was more flexible and could meet the just-in-time needs that the telephone-enabled. The railways, once the arteries of trade in the Docklands, began to disappear, unable to compete with the speed of telephone communications coupled with the convenience of trucking.\\" Tom reflects on the broader impact. Tom: \\"This transition wasn't without its challenges. The decline of the dock railways was a sign of broader industrial change. Workers had to adapt, new skills were required, and the economic landscape of the Docklands transformed irreversibly.\\" Ending Shot: Tom in the modern Canary Wharf or by the Docklands Light Railway, which represents the area’s rebirth and transition. Tom: \\"Today, this area has gone through another reinvention, becoming a financial center with its own modern Docklands Light Railway. But that's as much about moving people as the old rails were about moving goods. The history of the Docklands is a story of change, driven by the constant march of technology and the ever-evolving ways we communicate and do business.\\" [End Video] In true Tom Scott fashion, the video would explain the changing tides of technology and commerce and how seemingly unrelated inventions can overlap and influence each other, leading to significant shifts in infrastructure and society. All throughout, the story would be peppered with insights, anecdotes, and historical footage to illustrate these transformations."},{"instruction":"Hello there!","output":"Hello! How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"Does new teeth comes during age 19","output":"It is not common for new teeth to naturally emerge at the age of 19 in humans. By this age, most people will have all of their permanent teeth, which includes 28 permanent teeth plus up to four third molars, commonly known as wisdom teeth. These are the last set of molars that typically begin to erupt anywhere between the ages of 17 and 25. While it's possible for wisdom teeth to start emerging around the age of 19, all other permanent teeth should have already erupted by this time. If a person does not have enough space in their mouth or if the wisdom teeth are misaligned, they may not erupt properly or at all, which could lead to them being impacted and requiring removal. On rare occasions, individuals may have extra (supernumerary) teeth that can erupt unexpectedly, but this is an unusual dental condition and not part of the normal teething process. If you have concerns about your teeth or are experiencing any unusual problems, you should consult a dentist for a proper assessment and advice."},{"instruction":"Write a story where a hedgehog is walking in the forest and sees a crashed ufo, and a blue skinned alien female walking around, She eventually steps into gooey mud and swims around, before turning around, leaving only her legs and rear visible These eventually submerge underneath as well, leaving no trace except for bubbling mud, The hedgehog walks closer, wondering what he had seen, He waits for hours afterwards The sun was setting over the forest as Harold the hedgehog made his way through the trees, searching for a tasty snack.

Unfortunately for Nick, he can't fit them all in his apartment, so he screams \\"NOOOO!\\" into the sky, crying...but then he realizes something (causing his tears to hilariously flow back up into his eyes and disappear)...he can just buy a huge mansion with all the pawpsicle money (that's a lot of money from pawpsicles, but this is meant to be silly but who cares). And so he does just that, and successfully manages to rickroll the entire Zootopia cast...but then, various characters awkwardly realize that Nick just bought an apartment for the sole purposes of rickrolling. After Nick awkwardly stares at them, he wakes up in his bed, realizing that it was all just a dream.","output":"In the bustling metropolis of Zootopia, where the streets buzzed with the daily grind of mammals big and small going about their business, Nick Wilde, a sly fox with a heart of gold (and a love for a good prank), hatched a plan more audacious than any con he'd pulled in his hustling days. With a smirk curling beneath his whiskers, he concocted a scheme – to invite every single character who graced the vibrant landscape of Zootopia to his humble abode for an exclusive screening of what he claimed to be \\"the ultimate cinematic experience.\\" Word spread like wildfire, or like a gazelle galloping across the savanna. From Officer Judy Hopps to Chief Bogo, from Flash the sloth to Gazelle herself, the intrigued citizens of Zootopia found themselves enticed by Nick's tantalizing offer. The day of the showing, a seemingly endless line snaked around the apartment building, the anticipation was palpable, and Nick's exhilaration reached its zenith. But as the first guests arrived, a prickling anxiety crept into his chest. A giraffe's head poked into his living room from outside the window while a cluster of bunnies tried to squeeze into the room. Elephants’ tusks became daunting obstacles as Nick's living space swarmed with a menagerie of excited animals. A realization struck him; there was simply no way to accommodate the entire cast of Zootopia in his modest apartment. With furrowed brows and a rising pang of distress, he dashed to the window, peering out at the hordes of mammals convened in high spirits only for his voice to break the sky. \\"NOOOO!\\" he cried, a single tear coursing down his cheek in a melodramatic display of despair. As his sorrow saturated the air, an epiphany arrived with the force of a freight train. He remembered the mountains of money he'd accrued through his astoundingly successful pawpsicle venture. Without wasting a tick of the clock, Nick sprung into action. He dashed through the bustling city, cornered the real estate market, and before the sun set on that same day, he stood proudly before a splendid mansion, his grin wider than the Grand Pangolin Canyons. With a swift flick of his tail, Nick ushered every eager attendee into the palatial cinema room he'd had prepared. Expectant gazes were fixed on the mega screen as Nick, with a salesman-esque flair, hit the play button. Instead of the promised cinematography, the opening chords of Rick Astley’s \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\" resonated through the high-ceilinged chamber. Nick had successfully rickrolled every resident of Zootopia, a masterstroke of tomfoolery! As the song's chorus hit its zenith, various mammals looked around, bemused, then back at Nick, who maintained his triumphant stance. Laughter, snorts, and giggles filled the room, but a few stern gladiator stares aimed at the fox. As the awkwardness started to materialize, and Nick's internal, 'What have I done?' began to surface, reality twisted and churned. Gasping awake in his own bed, a half-eaten pawpsicle melting onto his blanket, Nick Wilde's eyes shot open. It had all been a dream—a wild, preposterous fantasy.

This is a common occurrence as the wisdom teeth are the last set of teeth to emerge, usually between the ages of 17 and 25. However, the experience can vary among individuals. Some reasons for pain during wisdom teeth growth include: 1. Impaction: Wisdom teeth might not have enough room to emerge properly. They can become trapped (impacted) within the jawbone or gums, which can be painful. 2. Partial Eruption: If a wisdom tooth only partially emerges, a flap of gum tissue may cover the tooth. This can lead to an infection called pericoronitis, which can be painful and cause swelling. 3. Misalignment: Wisdom teeth can grow at various angles, sometimes even horizontally. If they push against other teeth, this pressure can cause pain. 4. Inflammation and Infection: As the wisdom teeth break through the gums, the area can become inflamed, sensitive, and susceptible to infection. 5. Cyst Formation: Cysts or tumors can form around an impacted wisdom tooth, leading to jawbone destruction and pain. It's important to have regular dental checkups so that the dentist can monitor the development of wisdom teeth and address any issues early. If necessary, a dentist or oral surgeon may recommend removing wisdom teeth to alleviate pain or prevent potential problems."},{"instruction":"But why don't I experience pain when during other teeth growth","output":"When other teeth, such as baby (primary) teeth and adult (permanent) teeth, grow in, they typically do so earlier in life when the jaw has more space to accommodate them. Here are several reasons why these teeth might cause less discomfort compared to wisdom teeth: 1. **Developmental Timing**: Baby teeth usually start to emerge when a child is about 6 months old, and by age 12-14, most people have all of their permanent teeth (except the wisdom teeth). At these stages, the jawbone is still growing and more adaptable to the new teeth. 2. **Space in the Jaw**: By the time wisdom teeth are ready to emerge, the jaw has typically reached its full growth, leaving less room for these additional molars. This leads to a higher likelihood of impaction or misalignment, which are common causes of pain for wisdom teeth but not as common for other teeth. 3. **Order of Eruption**: Wisdom teeth are the last to emerge, meaning they face the most crowded conditions. The other teeth come in an orderly sequence designed by nature, with each tooth usually having sufficient space to emerge without disturbing its neighbors. 4. **Size and Shape**: Wisdom teeth are larger molars meant for grinding food, and their size can contribute to the difficulties they have when erupting through the gums. 5. **Hygiene Challenges**: The location of wisdom teeth at the back of the mouth makes them harder to clean and care for, increasing the risk of infections that can cause pain. 6. **Evolutionary Perspective**: Some anthropologists believe that changes in human diet and jaw structure over thousands of years have left modern humans with jaws that are often too small to accommodate wisdom teeth. Our ancestors generally had larger jaws with more room for these teeth. It is not entirely uncommon for other teeth to cause discomfort when they erupt, particularly for babies and young children getting their primary teeth, or for children and teenagers as their permanent teeth come in. But these experiences are generally mild and less problematic than those associated with wisdom teeth."},{"instruction":"","output":"It looks like your message didn't come through.

Christopher Smith, the man behind the Peacemaker persona, is typically depicted as a diplomat and a pacifist who loves peace so much that he is willing to use force as a superhero to advance the cause. This paradoxical approach to peace through violence makes him a complex character. He is known for using an array of non-lethal weapons and advanced technology in his fight against crime.

The LGM-118 Peacekeeper, also known as the MX missile (Missile-X), was an American intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Deployed by the United States during the Cold War, the Peacekeeper was designed to carry multiple, independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs). Each MIRV could hold a separate nuclear warhead, enabling a single missile to strike multiple targets. The Peacekeeper was a part of the U.S. strategic deterrent force and was intended to increase the complexity of a potential Soviet pre-emptive strike by greatly complicating their attack planning, due to its potential to hit multiple Soviet targets. The missile was deployed starting in the 1980s and remained in service until it was retired in the early 2000s as part of various arms reduction agreements and the changing needs of the U.S. nuclear force posture.

The TFO feature aims to save up to one full round-trip time (RTT) during connection establishment for the Transport Control Protocol (TCP) connection. On Linux, when you're using TCP Fast Open as a client, you generally need to set the \`TCP_FASTOPEN_CONNECT\` option on the socket using \`setsockopt()\` before calling \`connect()\` or \`sendto()\`. This tells the kernel to use TFO during the connection setup phase. Here's a simple example to illustrate: \`\`\`c int sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0); if (sockfd < 0) { perror(\\"socket\\"); return -1; } // Enable TCP Fast Open for this socket int enable = 1; if (setsockopt(sockfd, IPPROTO_TCP, TCP_FASTOPEN_CONNECT, &enable, sizeof(enable)) < 0) { perror(\\"setsockopt TCP_FASTOPEN_CONNECT\\"); close(sockfd); return -1; } // Connect the socket as usual, which will attempt to use TFO struct sockaddr_in serveraddr; memset(&serveraddr, 0, sizeof(serveraddr)); serveraddr.sin_family = AF_INET; serveraddr.sin_port = htons(port); inet_pton(AF_INET, \\"server address\\", &serveraddr.sin_addr); if (connect(sockfd, (const struct sockaddr *)&serveraddr, sizeof(serveraddr)) < 0) { if (errno != EINPROGRESS) { perror(\\"connect\\"); close(sockfd); return -1; } } // Now you can send data normally; TFO might have been used. char *data = \\"Hello, server!\\"; if (send(sockfd, data, strlen(data), 0) < 0) { perror(\\"send\\"); close(sockfd); return -1; } \`\`\` The idea is that setting \`TCP_FASTOPEN_CONNECT\` before \`connect()\` allows the kernel to send data along with the \`SYN\` packet. If the server supports TCP Fast Open and has a cookie ready, the data will be processed in the first RTT, effectively reducing the time it takes to establish the connection and send the first byte of data. Please note that the actual use and benefits of TCP Fast Open depend on the client and server kernel versions and configurations, as both ends of the connection must support TFO for it to work as intended."},{"instruction":"Are you sure to call send after connect?","output":"My apologies for any confusion. TCP Fast Open (TFO) is a mechanism that allows data to be sent along with the initial TCP SYN (synchronize) packet, which is part of the three-way handshake performed during the establishment of a TCP connection. Therefore, under the normal TCP communication flow, you would typically first establish a connection by calling \`connect()\`, and then use \`send()\` to transfer data. However, with TCP Fast Open, the client has the ability to send data to the server without waiting for the handshake to complete, effectively combining the initial SYN packet and the first data packet into one. To utilize TCP Fast Open effectively, you do not perform a typical \`connect()\` before \`send()\`. Instead, you use \`sendto()\` or \`sendmsg()\` to send data directly, and the connection is established as part of this sending process. Here's an example flow that more accurately reflects the use of TCP Fast Open on a client: \`\`\`c int sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0); if (sockfd < 0) { perror(\\"socket\\"); return -1; } // Set up the server address structure struct sockaddr_in serveraddr; memset(&serveraddr, 0, sizeof(serveraddr)); serveraddr.sin_family = AF_INET; serveraddr.sin_port = htons(port); inet_pton(AF_INET, \\"server address\\", &serveraddr.sin_addr); // Prepare the data to be sent char *data = \\"Hello, server!\\"; size_t data_len = strlen(data); // Send data with the TFO option if (sendto(sockfd, data, data_len, MSG_FASTOPEN, (struct sockaddr *)&serveraddr, sizeof(serveraddr)) < 0) { perror(\\"sendto\\"); close(sockfd); return -1; } \`\`\` In this example, \`sendto()\`—with the \`MSG_FASTOPEN\` flag—is used to send data directly, without explicitly calling \`connect()\`. The kernel takes care of establishing the connection and sending the data in a TFO SYN packet. To reiterate, the key difference with TCP Fast Open is that you can send data in the same step that initiates the connection, without having to wait for the connection to be fully established. This means that in situations where you're leveraging TCP Fast Open, \`sendto()\` or \`sendmsg()\` can be called without a prior call to \`connect()\`. The effectiveness of TFO depends on both the client and the server being configured to support it, and for stateful firewalls or proxies in between to not interfere with the TFO mechanism."},{"instruction":"are you sure that connect function should not be used there? Can sendto replace connect? can sendto be used without connect and MSG_FASTOPEN flag? How will I known the connection state then?","output":"I apologize for the confusion earlier; let's clarify the correct usage of TCP Fast Open (TFO) on the client side, with regards to the \`connect()\`, \`sendto()\`, and \`send()\`, functions. On Linux, the typical use of \`sendto()\` without \`connect()\` is for UDP sockets, but TCP sockets normally require a connection with \`connect()\` before data can be sent with \`send()\`. TCP Fast Open changes this a bit by allowing you to send data with the initial SYN. However, to keep track of the connection state and to use the standard \`send()\` or \`recv()\` functions (which assume that a \`connect()\` has been called), you might still want to use \`connect()\` in conjunction with TCP Fast Open. In this case, \`send()\` is used with some caveats. Here's how you can use TCP Fast Open with the \`connect()\` function on a client-side TCP socket: 1. Create a socket. 2. Set the \`TCP_FASTOPEN_CONNECT\` socket option to enable TCP Fast Open on this socket. 3. Call \`connect()\` to initiate a connection. With \`TCP_FASTOPEN_CONNECT\` set, the kernel will automatically attempt to use TCP Fast Open if it's supported by the server. 4. Use \`send()\` or \`write()\` normally to send data. Here's the adjusted example: \`\`\`c int sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0); if (sockfd < 0) { perror(\\"socket\\"); return -1; } // Enable TCP Fast Open for this socket int enable = 1; if (setsockopt(sockfd, IPPROTO_TCP, TCP_FASTOPEN_CONNECT, &enable, sizeof(enable)) < 0) { perror(\\"setsockopt TCP_FASTOPEN_CONNECT\\"); close(sockfd); return -1; } // Set up the server address structure struct sockaddr_in serveraddr; memset(&serveraddr, 0, sizeof(serveraddr)); serveraddr.sin_family = AF_INET; serveraddr.sin_port = htons(port); inet_pton(AF_INET, \\"server address\\", &serveraddr.sin_addr); // Connect to the server, possibly using TCP Fast Open if (connect(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&serveraddr, sizeof(serveraddr)) < 0) { perror(\\"connect\\"); close(sockfd); return -1; } // Upon a successful connect(), you can now send data. The kernel might have already sent // data with the initial SYN if this is the first connection attempt. char *data = \\"Hello, server!\\"; if (send(sockfd, data, strlen(data), 0) < 0) { perror(\\"send\\"); close(sockfd); return -1; } \`\`\` With \`TCP_FASTOPEN_CONNECT\` used, if the server accepts TFO connections, then the \`connect()\` call may send data in the initial SYN packet under the hood. Subsequent \`send()\` calls will act normally. Additionally, if you want to explicitly send data with the SYN packet and control the data being sent, you could use \`sendto()\` with the \`MSG_FASTOPEN\` flag without prior \`connect()\`. However, this is less common than using \`connect()\` with \`TCP_FASTOPEN_CONNECT\`, and it's inherently more complex because you'll need to manage the state of the connection manually. This method also requires thorough error handling and dealing with the possibility that TFO might be unavailable or disabled in the network path. Using \`connect()\` with the \`TCP_FASTOPEN_CONNECT\` option is generally preferred, as it allows you to take advantage of TCP Fast Open while still retaining the standard connected socket semantics and error handling you're likely accustomed to when using TCP sockets."},{"instruction":"Will the syn packet be send right after the connect as usual, or after the send function only?","output":"When you use TCP Fast Open with \`TCP_FASTOPEN_CONNECT\` set on the socket, the behavior may vary depending on the kernel version and the TCP stack implementation. There are generally two cases: 1. The \`connect()\` function will initiate a TCP handshake and may immediately send a SYN packet with data to the server if the system supports doing so. The actual transmission of the SYN packet with or without data (the first data being sent in the SYN packet) depends on the kernel and the presence of the relevant TFO cookie. In this case, the SYN packet is sent right after \`connect()\`, and any data provided in the first \`send()\` after the \`connect()\` will be sent immediately following the SYN-ACK if TFO is in use. 2. In some implementations or configurations, the \`connect()\` function might only send a TFO SYN packet if there is data queued to be sent. This would mean that \`connect()\` would prepare the connection but might defer sending the SYN packet until \`send()\` is called with data to include in the TFO SYN packet. To summarize, the actual sending of the SYN packet - either right after \`connect()\` if the kernel does so automatically, or after calling \`send()\` if the kernel waits for data - may vary. For the most reliable behavior, especially if you want to ensure that data is sent with the SYN packet and TFO is used, you should call \`connect()\` with \`TCP_FASTOPEN_CONNECT\` set, followed immediately by \`send()\` with the initial data you want to transmit. Always check the return values of these system calls and be prepared to handle errors that may indicate whether the TFO option was used successfully or not. If TFO cannot be used (e.g., it's not supported by the server, or network conditions prevent it), the TCP stack should fall back to the standard TCP 3-way handshake mechanism."},{"instruction":"Can I use sendto with tcp socket and MSG_FASTOPEN option?","output":"Yes, you can use \`sendto()\` with a TCP socket and the \`MSG_FASTOPEN\` option on Linux to utilize TCP Fast Open (TFO). The \`MSG_FASTOPEN\` flag allows you to pass data in the opening \`SYN\` packet of a TCP connection—this is the key feature of TFO that aims to reduce latency by potentially saving one round-trip time during connection setup. The code may look something like this: \`\`\`c int sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0); if (sockfd < 0) { perror(\\"socket\\"); exit(EXIT_FAILURE); } struct sockaddr_in server_addr; memset(&server_addr, 0, sizeof(server_addr)); server_addr.sin_family = AF_INET; server_addr.sin_port = htons(port); inet_pton(AF_INET, \\"server_ip\\", &server_addr.sin_addr); const char *data = \\"Hello, server!\\"; size_t data_len = strlen(data); // Using sendto with MSG_FASTOPEN to send data in the initial SYN packet ssize_t sent_bytes = sendto(sockfd, data, data_len, MSG_FASTOPEN, (struct sockaddr *)&server_addr, sizeof(server_addr)); if (sent_bytes < 0) { perror(\\"sendto\\"); close(sockfd); exit(EXIT_FAILURE); } // Handle the rest of your TCP communication here close(sockfd); \`\`\` In this example: 1. A socket is created with \`socket()\`. 2. The \`server_addr\` structure is populated with the server's information. 3. \`sendto()\` is used to send data with the \`MSG_FASTOPEN\` flag, which under the hood attempts to send a \`SYN\` packet with the specified data to the server address. The \`sendto()\` call does not require you to call \`connect()\` beforehand when using \`MSG_FASTOPEN\`. This function call, if successful, would have the side effect of establishing a connection if the server accepts the \`SYN\` along with the data. Please note the following factors: - For \`sendto()\` with \`MSG_FASTOPEN\` to work, TFO must be enabled and supported both on the client and the server system, and any intermediate firewalls or proxies must allow TFO to pass through. - Using this feature requires a sufficiently recent Linux kernel version that implements TCP Fast Open. - The TFO feature needs to be enabled both in the kernel settings and at the application level with the \`TCP_FASTOPEN\` socket option or the \`MSG_FASTOPEN\` flag in \`sendto()\`. - The initial use of TFO between two hosts might not send data in the \`SYN\` packet because the TFO cookie isn't known yet. The server typically provides this cookie in the \`SYN-ACK\` response during the first connection. Subsequent connections can use the cookie to use TFO effectively. Always check the return values of system calls like \`sendto()\` to handle potential errors and to determine whether TFO was successful or whether a fallback to the regular connection establishment process has occurred."},{"instruction":"What will happen if a server will not use TCP_FASTOPEN? Can it read another data?","output":"If the server does not support or is not configured to use TCP Fast Open (TFO), and a client attempts to use TFO by sending data in the initial TCP \`SYN\` packet, the server will typically handle the situation in one of two ways: 1. **Ignore the TCP Fast Open Data:** The server, which does not recognize TFO, treats the incoming \`SYN\` packet as a standard \`SYN\` and simply proceeds with the usual TCP three-way handshake. It will acknowledge the \`SYN\` but discard the data attached to it. Consequently, the client will not receive acknowledgment for the data sent within the \`SYN\` packet. Since the client's TCP stack should be resilient to such scenarios, it will generally retransmit the data with the first regular \`ACK\`-ed data packet after the handshake is complete. 2. **TCP Handshake Proceeds Normally:** The server completes the handshake without acknowledging the TFO data (since it's not supported), resulting in a normal TCP connection without the TFO benefit of reduced latency. After the connection is established, the client can resend the data if it was not acknowledged as part of a successful Fast Open handshake. From the client perspective, if TFO is not supported by the server, steps in the communication should include: - Attempt to send data using TFO via \`sendto()\` with the \`MSG_FASTOPEN\` flag or \`send()\` after \`connect()\` with the \`TCP_FASTOPEN_CONNECT\` socket option. - Check if the data was acknowledged—if not, resend it. - Continue the communication normally, assuming a regular TCP connection. Clients using TFO should always be prepared for the possibility that the server does not support this option. The client TCP stack is expected to handle this gracefully by retransmitting the data once the connection is established. Good network programming practice dictates that your code should handle such cases by verifying whether the initial data has been acknowledged (using mechanisms like \`select()\`, \`poll()\`, or checking \`send()\` return values) and be ready to resend it if necessary. Importantly, if a server does not use TFO, it should still be able to properly establish standard TCP connections and read data sent by the client as usual once the TCP connection has been established through the default TCP three-way handshake."},{"instruction":"Do OpenBSD support MSG_FASTOPEN and TCP_FASTOPEN options?","output":"As of my knowledge cutoff date in early 2023, OpenBSD does not support the \`MSG_FASTOPEN\` or \`TCP_FASTOPEN\` options for the TCP Fast Open feature. While Linux and some other operating systems have implemented support for TCP Fast Open, OpenBSD has traditionally prioritized code simplicity and security, which may explain why some features, including TCP Fast Open, are not supported. OpenBSD's TCP stack is designed with a strong focus on correctness, simplicity, and security. The maintainers and developers are known for their conservative approach towards adopting new features that might impact the stability and security of the system. TCP Fast Open, which modifies the traditional three-way handshake process of TCP, might not align with OpenBSD's stringent design principles or security model. OpenBSD developers often prioritize the scrutiny of features before including them in the system. They also tend to wait until those features have been proven to be stable and secure in the long term across multiple implementations. The lack of support for TCP Fast Open could be due to concerns about its complexity or security implications, or it could simply be a matter of development priorities and resources. For the most up-to-date information, you should check the latest OpenBSD manual pages and release notes, or the OpenBSD tech mailing list for any recent developments regarding TCP Fast Open."},{"instruction":"What is about NetBSD and freeBSD?","output":"As of my knowledge cutoff date in early 2023, the status of TCP Fast Open on NetBSD and FreeBSD is as follows: **FreeBSD:** FreeBSD added support for TCP Fast Open starting from version 12.0. The TFO support is available for both client-side and server-side operations. In FreeBSD, you can enable TCP Fast Open using the \`TCP_FASTOPEN\` socket option for servers and the \`TCP_FASTOPEN\` option with \`setsockopt()\` or using the \`sendto()\` system call with the \`MSG_FASTOPEN\` flag for clients. The relevant kernel state is also configured using the \`net.inet.tcp.fastopen.server_enable\` and \`net.inet.tcp.fastopen.client_enable\` sysctl options, respectively. **NetBSD:** As far as the latest available information is concerned, NetBSD does not have support for TCP Fast Open. NetBSD, like OpenBSD, is an operating system that puts significant emphasis on code correctness, simplicity, and portability. The inclusion of newer features like TCP Fast Open is subject to the project's objectives and resources, and as of now, there has been no mainstream adoption of TFO in NetBSD. It is important to remember that operating system features can change over time, and the support for various features such as TCP Fast Open could be added or modified in future releases. Therefore, it's a good idea to consult the latest official documentation, release notes, or the source code for each respective operating system to get the most up-to-date information regarding the support for TCP Fast Open or any other feature."},{"instruction":"MacOS?","output":"As of the latest information available prior to my knowledge cutoff date in early 2023, macOS does support TCP Fast Open (TFO) for both client-side and server-side applications, much like FreeBSD. Apple introduced support for TFO in macOS with the release of macOS 10.11 (El Capitan) in 2015. To enable and use TCP Fast Open in macOS, developers can set the \`TCP_FASTOPEN\` socket option when programming their network applications. The socket option can be set for both client and server sockets using \`setsockopt()\`. For a client application to use TCP Fast Open, it may look something like this: \`\`\`c int s = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP); int enable = 1; if (setsockopt(s, IPPROTO_TCP, TCP_FASTOPEN, &enable, sizeof(enable)) < 0) { perror(\\"setsockopt TCP_FASTOPEN\\"); } \`\`\` For a server application, it's similar but typically concerns setting the socket option for the listening socket: \`\`\`c int s = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP); int enable = 1; if (setsockopt(s, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, &enable, sizeof(int)) < 0) { perror(\\"setsockopt SO_REUSEADDR\\"); } // Bind, listen calls, and then set TCP Fast Open if (setsockopt(s, IPPROTO_TCP, TCP_FASTOPEN, &enable, sizeof(enable)) < 0) { perror(\\"setsockopt TCP_FASTOPEN\\"); } \`\`\` Please note, enabling TFO on the server side additionally might require configuring SSL/TLS libraries correctly, as they too need to handle the TFO option properly. Nevertheless, the use of TFO in real-world applications depends on multiple factors including the operating system version, compatibility with server infrastructure, and network devices (such as routers and firewalls) which must all support TCP Fast Open to achieve the expected performance improvement. Network administrators and app developers are recommended to test and confirm that TFO brings the desired benefits in their specific environments and to remain prepared to handle the cases where TFO may not be supported. For the most current and detailed information about TFO support in macOS, along with its implementation details, you may need to refer to Apple's official developer documentation."},{"instruction":"Guess what song this is \\"I'm not looking for somebody with some superhuman gifts\\"","output":"\\"Rather Be\\" by Clean Bandit ft.

Dưới đây là một ví dụ mô phỏng giải pháp cho bài toán: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <string> #include <vector> using namespace std; int m, n, Q; vector<vector<int>> sheet; // Hàm để lấy giá trị từ một ô, ví dụ: A1, C2,... int getValue(string cell) { char col = cell[0]; int row = stoi(cell.substr(1)) - 1; int colIndex = col - 'A'; return sheet[row][colIndex]; } // Định nghĩa hàm đệ quy để tính toán biểu thức int evaluateExpression(string expr) { // Điểm kết thúc đệ quy: nếu expr là một ô (ví dụ: A1, B2,...) if (expr[0] >= 'A' && expr[0] <= 'Z') { return getValue(expr); } // Tìm vị trí của dấu phẩy để chia đôi biểu thức int level = 0, pos = -1; for (int i = 0; i < expr.length(); ++i) { if (expr[i] == '(') level++; else if (expr[i] == ')') level--; else if (expr[i] == ',' && level == 1) { pos = i; break; } } // Tách biểu thức thành hai nửa string first = expr.substr(1, pos - 1); string second = expr.substr(pos + 1, expr.length() - pos - 2); // Đánh giá từng nửa của biểu thức int firstValue = evaluateExpression(first); int secondValue = evaluateExpression(second); // Áp dụng hàm MAX hoặc SUM if (expr[0] == 'M') { return max(firstValue, secondValue); } if (expr[0] == 'S') { return firstValue + secondValue; } return -1; // chỉ để giải quyết warning, lí thuyết không nên đến đây } int main() { // Đọc m và n cin >> m >> n; sheet.resize(m, vector<int>(n)); // Đọc giá trị các ô trong bảng for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) { for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) { cin >> sheet[i][j]; } } // Đọc số lượng biểu thức Q và giải từng biểu thức cin >> Q; vector<int> results; for (int i = 0; i < Q; ++i) { string expr; cin >> expr; results.push_back(evaluateExpression(expr)); } // In kết quả ra màn hình for (int result : results) { cout << result << endl; } return 0; } \`\`\` Trong đoạn mã trên: - \`sheet\` là mảng hai chiều lưu giá trị của bảng tính. - \`getValue\` là hàm cung cấp giá trị cho một ô cụ thể. - \`evaluateExpression\` là hàm đệ quy để phân tích và đánh giá biểu thức. Cách đánh giá biểu thức phụ thuộc vào cách bạn phân tích cú pháp biểu thức được nhập vào từ người dùng, những điều này có thể phức tạp hơn tùy theo việc đầu vào có phần tử rỗng hay không và các định dạng không chuẩn khác.

Larry then sets up the computer and discovers that Half-Life 2 is installed. Larry begins playing the game as the Resistance and Combine watch awkwardly, but then...Larry realizes something. The game is set in his reality. Larry then begins to wonder if he is in a computer simulation...but suddenly Neo from The Matrix comes and sues him. Larry then wakes up in his bed, realizing that it was all just a weird dream","output":"In the shattered streets of City 17, the familiar staccato of gunfire erupted as Resistance fighters clashed with the relentless Combine forces. Buildings, scarred by the ongoing conflict, loomed over the scene, and amidst the chaos, a Rebel named Larry was scrambling for cover. He was just like any other in the Resistance — filled with determination and an unyielding hope to free humanity from the alien oppressors. Suddenly, a stray pulse round from an Overwatch soldier blasted through the wall of a crumbling building, revealing a small, dust-clogged room that time seemed to have forgotten. Larry dashed into it, seeking a momentary reprieve from the deadly skirmish outside. As his eyes adjusted to the dim light, he spotted an old desk, and on it lay a relic of the past — a desktop computer setup from the year 2004, still miraculously intact. In a world teetering on the edge of doom, where technology was often a mix of human and alien ingenuity, the sight of the ancient machine gave everyone pause. Both Resistance fighters and Combine troops stopped awkwardly, unsure of what tactical advantage could be gained from such an outdated system. Driven by curiosity, Larry started setting up the computer, hoping it might still work. His comrades and even a few Combine soldiers watched in silence, their usual hostility momentarily placed on hold by this peculiar turn of events. After a few tense minutes, the computer hummed to life, its monitor flickering as it booted up. To Larry's amazement, the desktop loaded, and there with the familiar icons was one that made his heart skip a beat — Half-Life 2. Without hesitation, he double-clicked the icon and began to play. As the vivid images of City 17 filled the screen, mirroring the world outside with eerie precision, a hush fell over the room. Larry was so engrossed in the game that he didn't notice the gathering crowd of watchful eyes from both sides. They all watched on as he navigated Gordon Freeman through the dystopian landscape they were all too familiar with. Then, a thought struck Larry — the realization that the world he was playing in the game was nearly indistinguishable from his own reality. His hands froze on the keyboard and mouse as a wave of existential dread washed over him. Are his life and struggles merely bits of data in an elaborate simulation? Is he, like Freeman, just a character in some cosmic game? Before he could spiral further down the rabbit hole of his mind, the sound of shattering glass filled the air. A figure clad in a long black coat and sunglasses, wielding a katana, cartwheeled elegantly into the room and landed with a silent grace. It was Neo, The One from The Matrix. Neo solemnly approached the bewildered Larry, leaned in close, and whispered sternly, \\"You're not supposed to be aware of this layer of the simulation.\\" Before Larry could fathom the implications, Neo served him with a stern look and a symbolic lawsuit for breaching the boundaries of his reality. The holographic document glittered in the air — a surreal declaration that blurred the lines between universes. Chaos erupted as the ceasefire broke, but before the fighting resumed, Larry bolted upright in his bed, panting and drenched in cold sweat. It had all been a dream, a strange melding of fictional worlds that had no business overlapping in the stark light of day. As his breathing steadied, he chuckled at the absurdity of it all and the idea of being sued by a fictional character. Relief washed over him as he prepared to rejoin the fight in the real City 17 — a place where desktop computers were hard to come by and Neo didn't have jurisdiction. He was just Larry, a Rebel fighting for freedom, and that was all the reality he needed."},{"instruction":"","output":"Hello! It seems like your message didn't come through.

He loved playing outside, climbing trees, and riding his bike. But there was something about Nick that set him apart from the other kids in his town. You see, Nick had a unique ability. At any given moment, he could transform from a regular boy into an amorphous orange blob. It wasn't something he could control, it just happened randomly. Most of the time, Nick was able to maintain his human appearance. But every now and then, usually when he was feeling anxious or overwhelmed, he would start to morph into the blob. At first, it scared him. He didn't know what was happening to him or why. But as he grew older, Nick learned to embrace his unique gift. He discovered that when he was in blob form, he could actually move through walls and objects, allowing him to explore places he never thought possible. It was like having a superpower. Of course, there were times when being an orange blob wasn't so convenient. Like when he was trying to play basketball with his friends or when he wanted to go on a date with a girl he liked. But Nick learned to navigate these situations with humor and grace, and his friends and family grew to accept him for who he was, blob form and all. Eventually, Nick even started using his abilities to help others. He would transform into the blob to sneak into buildings and rescue trapped animals or deliver messages to people in need. He became known as the town's mysterious orange hero, always there to lend a helping hand when it was needed most. And so, Nick learned that being different wasn't always a bad thing. In fact, it was what made him special. And he wouldn't have it any other way."},{"instruction":"Write about his blob form","output":"When Nick transformed into his amorphous orange blob form, it was like he was enveloped in a swirl of vibrant colors. His body became fluid and constantly shifting, like a lava lamp in motion. He didn't have any defined features in this form, just a smooth, glowing surface that pulsed with energy. In his blob form, Nick could stretch and compress himself at will, allowing him to squeeze through the tiniest of gaps or expand to fill a larger space. He could move with incredible speed and agility, flowing effortlessly from one place to another. It was a strange and exhilarating sensation, like being one with the very essence of life itself. Nick's blob form emitted a warm, comforting glow that filled those around him with a sense of calm and peace. It was as if his presence brought a touch of magic into the world, a reminder that there was more to reality than what could be seen with the naked eye. Despite his unconventional appearance, Nick never felt more alive than when he was in his blob form. He embraced his uniqueness and reveled in the freedom it gave him to explore the world in ways that no one else could. And so, whether as a boy or as an amorphous orange blob, Nick knew that he was exactly who he was meant to be."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

looking at unit 1 at a glance again unit 1 is entitled atomic structure and properties and in this particular video we'll take a look at topic 1.1 moles and molar mass topic 1.2 mass spectroscopy also known as spectrometry of elements and topic 1.3 elemental composition of pure substances in the video description area there should be a link to the ap chemistry course and exam description and there also should be a link to this particular packet that goes along with the video all right topic 1.1 moles and molar mass so here are some essential knowledge statements that come from the ap chemistry course and exam description one cannot count particles directly while performing laboratory work thus there must be a connection between the masses of substances reacting and the actual number of particles undergoing chemical changes avogadro's number 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd particles per mole provides the connection between the number of moles in a pure sample of a substance and the number of constituent particles or formula units of that substance expressing the mass of an individual atom or molecule in atomic mass units amu is useful because the average mass in amu of one particle atom or molecule or formula unit of a substance will always be numerically equal to the molar mass of that substance in grams thus there is a quantitative connection between the mass of a substance and the number of particles that the substance contains so here are three substances magnesium mg carbon dioxide co2 and sodium chloride nacl the particles of a substance can be described as atoms molecules or formula units as shown in the following examples the molar mass of a substance can be determined or calculated from the atomic mass values on the periodic table so if you look on your periodic table and you find the elemental symbol for magnesium mg you could say that a single atom of magnesium would weigh 24.30 amu or atomic mass units but once i change that to mole a mole of magnesium weighs 24.30 grams and it contains avogadro's number of atoms a mole of carbon dioxide if you add up the atomic mass of one carbon and two oxygens the molar mass of co2 is 44.01 grams and that would contain avogadro's number of molecules again referring to co2 as molecules that is a covalent substance whereas since sodium chloride is not covalent but rather ionic its fundamental building blocks or particles is not considered a molecule but rather a formula unit so one mole of sodium chloride would have a molar mass from the periodic table when you add up the atomic masses of sodium and chlorine 58.44 grams per mole and again would contain avogadro's number of formula units okay let's take a look at some practice problems so here we have two problems one of them says to calculate the mass in grams of 0.08 moles of something called barium hydroxide ba parentheses oh2 and then the other problem says to calculate the number of moles of c4h10 that are present in 2.00 grams of c4h10 so we are going to need to use the periodic table to do these calculations so starting with number one i have to go find barium oxygen and hydrogen on the periodic table so i can calculate the molar mass so there are those three particular elements and again let's go ahead and do that math to calculate the molar mass so for barium hydroxide ba parentheses oh2 the total of the barium and the two oxygens and the two hydrogens added together is 171.346 grams per mole so we'll start with the number of moles and then we'll set up a conversion factor that will put mole on the bottom since that's the unit we're trying to cancel out and grams on the top so that would be like this 171.346 grams of barium hydroxide for every one mole if we do that math on our calculator we get 14 point again you can see several significant digits there five six four four one so how do we round off our final answer in this case we go with the measurement that we were given so 0.0850 has three significant figures so we're going to round off our final answer to three significant figures and that would look like 14.6 grams in our next problem we're essentially doing the reverse of what we just did in number one so instead of going from moles to grams we're going to go from grams to moles so we start off with calculating the molar mass of c4h10 again this comes from the periodic table so carbon has an atomic mass of 12.01 and there are four carbons in the formula hydrogen is 1.008 and there are 10 of those so 58.12 grams per mole that's my molar mass of c4h10 i write down the number i was given so 2.00 grams of c4h10 and now i want to put grams on the bottom and moles on top so i use my molar mass as a conversion factor to go from grams to moles i do that math on my calculator again i get a long number and i'm not sure let's say how to round it off until i look at the measurement that i was given so 2.00 grams has three significant figures so we're going to round off our final answer to three significant figures which would be written as 0.0344 moles of c4h10 okay let's take a look at our next two problems number three calculate the number of atoms of silicon si that are present in 35.0 moles of silicon and then number four calculate the number of moles of o3 which is ozone that are present in 4.3 times 10 to the 24 molecules of ozone so number three we are going from atoms to moles and in number four we're going from moles to molecules so because we're talking about a conversion factor that goes between number of moles and number of particles we need avogadro's number but we in fact do not need to use the periodic table because we're not converting from grams to moles like we were in the previous or moles of grams okay so in this particular set of problems we're just going to use avogadro's number so number three we write down 35.0 moles of silicon put moles on the bottom and in this case atoms are the particles so atoms on top so there's avogadro's number the number of atoms or particles in one mole we do that math and again rounding this particular number off to the number of sig figs that we need in this case 35.0 has three significant figures so that number will be expressed with three significant figures as 2.11 times 10 to the 25th power and then number four we start with our number of particles in this case molecules of ozone o3 we want to put particles on the bottom and moles on top so avogadro's number of molecules of ozone on the bottom and then one mole of ozone on the top we do this math by again doing division like in the last problem we were multiplying the avogadro's number now we're dividing by avogadro's number and again on our calculator we get this long number let's round it off based on the number we're given in this case 4.3 has only two significant figures so our final answer is written as 7.1 moles of ozone o3 all right let's take a look at the next two questions number five calculate the mass in grams of 8.2 times 10 to the 22nd molecules of chcl3 and the number six calculate the number of formula units of na2so4 present in 0.248 grams of that substance so number five we know that when we use a conversion involving avogadro's number that's going to be between moles and particles or vice versa so we're definitely going to need avogadro's number but since the final answer is in grams we also need the periodic table and the calculated value for the molar mass to go between moles and grams and so i'm going to write the calculation for the molar mass of chcl so the atomic mass of carbon hydrogen and chlorine are what you see here so 12.01 1.008 and 35.45 now there are three chlorines in the formula that's why that's times three so 119.368 grams per mole that's the molar mass of chcl3 we're also going to need to use avogadro's number so here we have the given information 8.2 times 10 to the 22nd molecules of this substance chcl3 let's put molecules on the bottom and moles on top again using avogadro's number so avogadro's number on the bottom number of molecules in one mole and then let's use the molar mass that's going to be grams on top and then one mole on the bottom so here we pick up our calculator and we divide by avogadro's number we multiply by 119.368 and then we get this number on our calculator which if we round this off to two significant figures based on the 8.2 having two significant figures we're going to write this as not 16.2 or 16.3 but rather just 16 again two significant figures to match the value that we're given so i'm not going to be limited by avogadro's number or the molar mass from the periodic table those are not going to limit my significant figures in my answer but the number i was given in the problem that number has a certain number of significant figures that limits my answer all right on to number six molar mass for na2so4 again based on the atomic masses of sodium sulfur and oxygen so if i do that math 22.99 that's the atomic mass of sodium 32.06 the atomic mass of sulfur and then 16 the atomic mass of oxygen times 4. so we do all of that and we get 142.04 grams per mole that's the molar mass of na2so4 we'll start with the number we're given so 0.248 we're going to go from grams to moles so grams on the bottom one mole on top so there's the molar mass using that as a conversion factor and then now it's time to incorporate avogadro's number in our calculation so that would be one mole on the bottom and avogadro's number of particles in this case formula units on the top so if we divide by the molar mass multiplied by avogadro's number we get a number that needs to be rounded in this case 0.248 was the number we're given that's the measurement that has three significant figures so 0.248 three significant figures let's round off our final answer to 1.05 times 10 to the 21st formula units of na2so4 all right now we are going to move on to topic 1.2 mass spectroscopy of elements again also known as mass spectrometry and here are two essential knowledge statements from the ap chemistry course and exam description the mass spectrum of a sample containing a single element can be used to determine the identity of the isotopes of that element and the relative abundance of each isotope in nature the average atomic mass of an element can be estimated from the weighted average of the isotopic masses using the mass of each isotope and its relative abundance so in this first example for number seven from your packet we're looking at chlorine and on the left we see that there are two isotopes of chlorine so chlorine with a mass number of 35 and chlorine with a mass number of 37. the abundance that's like the percentage of that particular element as it would appear in a sample naturally 75.8 percent chlorine 35 24.2 chlorine 37. so on the right we're seeing a mass spectrum and again this particular diagram shows two bars so one on the x-axis at atomic mass or mass number of 35 for the chlorine-35 isotope and then a smaller bar on the x-axis you can see that's 37 so again mass number 37 on the y-axis we see percent abundance so number seven part a calculate the average atomic mass of cl so based on this information that would be to calculate the weighted average so the weighted average means we're going to multiply each mass number by its percent abundance that is written as a decimal so 35 times 0.758 plus 37 times 0.242 so that's the weighted average that we get from this data and our calculator would give us an answer of approximately 35.5 in part b of this question we're given a table with chlorine 35 and chlorine 37 and we're asked to fill in the number of protons and neutrons so if we take a look at the periodic table we can see that chlorine does in fact have an atomic mass that is approximately 35.5 so that answer to part a makes sense and we can see atomic number 17 that refers to the number of protons in the nucleus of chlorine so 17 protons for each isotope protons plus neutrons will give us the mass number so 17 plus 18 is 35 or you could do 35 minus 17 equals 18 and then 17 plus 20 equals 37. all right let's take a look at number eight so we're looking at a different element that says not chlorine you can see along the x-axis we have a mass number of either 121 or 123 and along the y-axis for the percent abundance you can see written above each bar 57.4 percent for the mass number 121 and 42.6 percent for the abundance of mass number 123. so to calculate the average atomic mass of this particular element we're going to do just like we did before take the mass number times the percent abundance that is written as a decimal so 121 times 0.574 plus 123 times 0.426 so we do that math and we get approximately 121.9 now to look on the periodic table to figure out what is the most likely identity of this element it's okay if the atomic mass of the element is not exactly 121.9 but is very close to that value let's take a look so again tin sn is only 118.71 so that's too small tellurium te is 127.60 that's too big so the only element that this could represent is atomic number 51 antimony sb with an atomic mass of 121.76 again that's the closest to the value that we calculated in part a so again to part b what is the most likely identity of this element it is going to be antimony element symbol sb okay let's take a look at number nine so we have a mass spectrum with mass numbers of 79 and 81 and we have the percent abundances that are listed so now we're not going to actually need to calculate the average atomic mass in this particular problem they come right out with what is the most likely identity of this element so if we look at the periodic table we're looking for an element that has an atomic mass that falls somewhere between 79 and 81. again these are almost exactly a 50 50 mixture of these two isotopes so should be pretty close to 80 for the atomic mass which would be the average of 79 and 81. let's take a look in the periodic table so selenium se has an average atomic mass of 78.97 so that's too small krypton kr is going to be about 83.80 that's too large so the only element that has an atomic mass that falls between 79 and 81 is bromine br and its atomic mass is 79.90 so bromine has 35 protons in its nucleus and has an average mass atomic mass of 79.90 so bromine is the answer to part a and then for part b again bromine has 35 protons in its nucleus so mass number minus atomic number would give us the number of neutrons so 79 minus 35 is 44 and 81 minus 35 is 46. so again 35 protons and 44 or 46 neutrons for the two isotopes of bromine okay moving on to number 10 this time we don't actually have a mass spectrum to look at but we are told that a certain element has two naturally occurring isotopes with mass numbers of 63 and 65 what is the most likely identity of this element let's take a look at the periodic table and see if we can find an element whose atomic mass falls between 63 and 65. nickel is around 58.69 zinc is around 65.38 so copper element cu the only one that would fall in that range between 63 and 65. so 63.55 is the average atomic mass of copper cu now to fill in the table with protons and neutrons again on the periodic table we know that copper has 29 protons in the nucleus again that would be the atomic number of copper 29 and then since the protons plus the neutrons equals the mass number 63 minus 29 will give us the number of neutrons and again that's either 34 or 36 for the number of neutrons again these are the number of neutrons so 29 plus 34 equals 63 29 plus 36 equals 65. now again we're not looking at a mass spectrum so we don't know the percent abundance of these two isotopes of copper so part c of this question which isotope of this element mass number 63 or mass number 65 is more abundant in nature justify your answer so on the periodic table the average atomic mass of copper is 63.55 so the isotope with mass number 63 should be more abundant in nature because the average the weighted average 63.55 is closer in value to 63 than it is to 65. so for example if it had been exactly a 50 50 mixture of these two isotopes then the average of 63 and 65 just a straight up average would be 64. since 63.55 is closer to the number 63 that means that the isotope with mass number 63 is more abundant okay let's take a look at number 11. so so far in the examples that i'm showing you for a mass spectrum it's been really simple in that there's only been two naturally occurring isotopes of the elements in the examples you've seen so far so what i wanted to do here with this example is to indicate that the process the calculation of the average atomic mass it can be a bit more complicated it's still the same principle but you just have more numbers to enter into your calculator so here number 11 if an element has several naturally occurring isotopes then here's how you would do the calculation part a based on the information above estimate the average atomic mass of the element to the nearest whole number and then use a calculator to determine the average atomic mass so if i had to estimate this it looks like it's going to be anywhere between 154 and 160 according to the data that we have for six different isotopes of this particular element so where would the average fall where would the weighted average fall looks like 154 is a very small amount it's about 2 percent and then all of the other isotopes are somewhere between 15 and about 22 25 so i'm going to estimate again just a rough estimate that the average atomic mass is probably somewhere around the middle like maybe around 157 or so so you might estimate that the average atomic mass of this particular element is approximately 157. let's go ahead and do the math so to do the math we're going to take the mass number times the percent abundance written as a decimal so it looks like this 154 times 0.0218 plus 155 times 0.1480 and then you just keep going 156 times its percent abundance as a decimal 157 158 160. so all of that into my calculator gives me an answer of four 157.0241 so again approximately 157 point zero two what is the most likely identity of this element again let's look on the periodic table and see can we find an element that has an average atomic mass that is approximately 157 so down there in the lanthanide series of the periodic table the elements between atomic number 58 cerium and atomic number 71 lutesium we see that an element with a symbol gd which is gadolinium has an atomic mass of 157.25 so that's going to be the most likely identity of this particular element so gadolinium gd with atomic mass 157.25 okay well moving on to our next topic the last topic in this particular video topic 1.3 elemental composition of pure substances so here are some essential knowledge statements from the ap chemistry course and exam description some pure substances are composed of individual molecules while others consist of atoms or ions held together in fixed proportions as described by a formula unit according to the law of definite proportions the ratio of the masses of the constituent elements in any pure sample of that compound is always the same the chemical formula that lists the lowest whole number ratio of atoms of the elements in a compound is the empirical formula so let's take a look at our first question here number 12. calculate the percent composition by mass of each element in glucose c6h12o6 so what you're doing here is you're using the skill that you already have acquired from topic 1.1 about calculating the molar mass so the molar mass of glucose c6h12o6 would be the atomic mass of carbon 12.01 times 6 the atomic mass of hydrogen 1.008 times and the atomic mass of oxygen 16.00 times 6. so grand total molar mass or formula mass is 180.156 in the case of the molar mass that would be grams per mole if this were a single molecule of glucose you could say amu or atomic mass units but the percent composition by mass what that means is that we have to take the part divided by the whole for each element in this particular compound so the percentage of carbon by mass the percentage of hydrogen by mass the percentage of oxygen by mass so for the percent carbon by mass that would be 12.01 times six that's the total mass of carbon and then divided by the formula mass or the molar mass 180.156 times 100 to convert that to a percent and we do that math and we get 40.00 percent carbon by mass now we look at hydrogen and then oxygen so for hydrogen it would be 1.008 times 12 that's the total mass of hydrogen in one unit of glucose again divided by the total mass times 100 6.71 hydrogen by mass and then for oxygen 16.00 times 6 that's the total mass of oxygen within the formula glucose divided by the total mass times 100 and we get 53.29 percent oxygen by mass so no matter where i get glucose a pure sample of glucose from any source should have these same percentages of carbon hydrogen and oxygen by mass so the law of definite proportion or constant composition says that glucose will always have these particular percentages of carbon hydrogen and oxygen any pure sample of glucose has that so moving on to number 13 in the packet now we have a different compound which is called erythrose and its chemical formula is c4h8o4 let's go ahead and do the same process that we did in number 12 for glucose so the total mass of erythros from the periodic table so four carbons eight hydrogens and four oxygens is 120.104 grams per mole or you could say amu's if you were talking about a single molecule of erythrose let's break it down for carbon hydrogen and oxygen just like we did in number 12. mass of carbon so 12.01 times 4 divided by the total mass 120 120.104 times 100. interestingly enough we get the exact same percentage of carbon that we did in number 12. and so you're going to see a little deja vu now we do the percentage of hydrogen by mass in this compound so 1.008 times 8 total mass of hydrogen divided by total mass of erythros again that number should be familiar six point seven one percent hydrogen by mass and then finally with oxygen total mass of oxygen sixteen point zero zero times four divided by the total mass of erythros times a hundred fifty three point two nine percent oxygen by mass so if you're wondering why i chose the compounds in number 12 and number 13 there was a particular point that i wanted to make with these two compounds glucose and erythros and that is summarized by the work you're doing in number 14. so the empirical formula is going to be the simplest whole number ratio so when we take glucose c6h and we divide each of those subscripts by the greatest common factor in this case 6 we get c1h2o1 now even though erythrose is a very different chemical with different properties different formula when we take c4h8o4 and we divide each of those subscripts by the greatest common factor in this case four we get the exact same empirical formula so the point that i wanted to make is that we have two different compounds but because they have the same empirical formula then they are going to lead to a calculation that will give you the same percent composition by mass all right let's move on to number 15 in the packet now in this particular question we're actually going to go in the opposite direction so instead of being given a chemical formula and then calculating the percent composition by mass in number 15 we are told what the percent composition by mass is and we have to figure out the chemical formula specifically the empirical formula the one that has the lowest whole number ratio of elements so this is phosphorus and oxygen 43.64 phosphorus by mass 56.36 oxygen by mass so a good first step in this particular problem is to assume that the mass of this sample this compound that contains phosphorus and oxygen is 100 grams that way since a percentage is based on 100 we can just simply write down the number of grams of each element so we have 43.64 grams of the element phosphorus and we have 56.36 grams of the element oxygen well as you learned in topic 1.1 you can use the periodic table to go from grams to moles and so we have grams right now let's convert grams into moles because that way the mole ratio will give us the information that we need about the chemical formula so let's take the periodic table which has for phosphorous an atomic mass of 30.97 let's use that number to go from grams to moles now at this point i'm going to write that number down on my calculator i don't want to round it off to just 1 or 1.4 or even 1.41 it's actually better in calculations like this where you're trying to figure out the empirical formula it's better if you have extra digits on your calculator you want to really resist the temptation to start rounding these numbers off or not writing down the full number so i chose four significant figures in this problem the reason why you don't want to round it off too much is because you're looking for a ratio of moles of one element to the other and the more you round off your numbers the less accurate your values will be when you're trying to find that mole ratio so it's better to have extra precision in your answers than to just cut off the number at a couple of digits all right oxygen 56.36 grams of oxygen you might be wondering if you have good chemistry knowledge about oxygen being a diatomic element right we normally write oxygen as o2 you might be wondering do we have to use o2 in our calculations and the answer is no we're looking for individual ratios of elements o2 is a molecule it's not an individual atom so therefore it would be a single o so on the periodic table i'm going to write 16.00 i'm not going to write 32 because we're not talking about molecules of o2 we're talking about individual atoms of phosphorus and oxygen in this particular unknown compound so again be careful when you're going from grams to moles of individual elements that you ignore any elements that might be diatomic because in this particular case it's individual atoms not diatomic molecules all right i do this math 56.36 divided by 16 and i get again look at me not rounding off this answer too much i'm not going to call it 4 or 3.5 so i went ahead and chose 4 significant figures okay what do we do next to get the empirical formula of this compound we're looking for a simple whole number ratio between the moles of phosphorus and the moles of oxygen so how do we do that well because it's based on a simple whole number ratio of moles we're going to go ahead and take these two values of moles and we're going to divide them by the smaller of the two values so 1.409 divided by itself will give us 1 and 3.523 divided by 1.409 if you do that math on your calculator you get 2.50 so again now do we have simple whole numbers no we're not going to take 2.5 and just round it up to 3. what we have to do is take this empirical formula which again this is not correct and we're going to try to get simple whole numbers from the numbers that we have right now so instead of saying 1 and 2.5 let's just go ahead and double these values that way it keeps the ratio the same but we turn a 1 into a 2 and a 2.5 into a 5. so by doubling the ratio of 1 and 2.5 we get 2 and 5. and then that's it that's our empirical formula p2o5 is the empirical formula of this particular compound all right so to go ahead and summarize the procedure that we used in number 15 of this packet if you are given percent composition by mass or mass data for a certain compound so grams of each element the following procedure will help you to determine the empirical formula of the compound convert the grams or the mass of each element into moles again that would involve the periodic table then now that you have moles of each element divide each value of moles by the lowest value the lowest number now at this point you may already have whole numbers based on that step in the procedure but if not if you have numbers that end in 0.5 like we just saw in the last example then you could multiply by 2. or if for example your number of moles they end with .33 or .66 or 0.67 you may have to multiply by 3 to turn those values into whole numbers so again be careful with your data don't round off your numbers too early in the calculation as i said before but then whatever whole numbers you get those whole number values of moles then they will be used in the subscripts to write the empirical formula of that compound okay here's our next problem number 16. we are given the percentage by mass for the elements carbon hydrogen and oxygen let's convert each of these numbers from grams into moles so we'll assume that we have a hundred grams of this particular compound and that way the percentages can just be written as grams so we have grams of carbon let's divide that number by the molar mass of carbon which would be 12.01 we're converting from grams to moles again i'm not going to round that number off to four or 4.3 so i wrote that number with four significant figures a little extra precision is a good thing in the early stage of the calculation now we have the same calculation for hydrogen and for oxygen so 13.13 again this is individual elements individual atoms of hydrogen so it's not h2 it's not the diatomic molecule that we think about in terms of its substance you might have hydrogen gas for example it's h2 this is individual atoms of hydrogen so divided by 1.008 that came from the periodic table 13.03 i'm using the atomic masses for each element as the molar mass of each element so 34.73 grams of oxygen again not divided by 32 but 16. so individual molar masses of these elements with no subscripts so now i'm staring at three numbers which are 4.31 sorry 4.341 moles of carbon 13.03 moles of hydrogen and 2.171 moles of oxygen so the next step in the procedure is to find the lowest value in this case 2.171 and we're going to go ahead and divide each of these values of moles by the smallest value so divided by 2.171 we get 2 divided by 2.171 we get 6 and obviously divided by itself we get 1. so those values 2 6 and 1 are already whole numbers there's no extra step of multiplying by 2 or 3. so what i have right now is an empirical formula c2 h6 and then o1 or just o the one is understood as a subscript okay so our empirical formula was c2h6o let's move on to number 17 in the packet a pure sample of tin so elemental symbol sn with a mass of 6.18 grams is burned in air until the tin is completely converted into a tin oxide so a tin oxide compound would contain both tin and oxygen the mass of the tin oxide is equal to 7.85 grams determine the empirical formula of this tin oxide compound so we start with 6.18 grams of tin it is burned in the air which means it's going to react with oxygen in the air and it produces 7.85 grams of tin oxide now i'm not writing a balanced chemical equation for this process i'm writing the elements in words because we don't know the exact formula of the tin oxide so therefore even though i know that tin is sn i know that oxygen gas is written as o2 i don't know what the chemical formula of this particular tin oxide compound is so the difference in mass between 7.85 grams and 6.18 grams that difference is 1.67 grams that's how much oxygen reacted with the tin in this experiment so while this looks like a different problem in the previous examples we had the percentage of each element by mass so percent composition now that we know from processing this information that we have grams of tin sn and then grams of oxygen in this case i'm going to write this as individual atoms of o we can go ahead and convert grams to moles like we have been doing in the other problems number 15 and 16. so grams of tin 6.18 grams divided by the atomic mass of tin on the periodic table 118.71 that gives me the number of moles of tin again i'm going to try to keep a little extra precision so i'm not going to write 0.05 or 0.052 i went ahead and i chose three significant figures here but if you had four or five significant figures that would be fine too again a little extra precision is fine in this stage of the calculation but don't round off your numbers because you might throw away important precision that will help you get to those simple whole number ratios of moles again like i said in the previous examples we have individual oxygen so yes there is oxygen in the air which is o2 but i want to know the ratio of atoms of tin to atoms of oxygen in this particular compound so that's why i'm not dividing by 32 i'm not talking about o2 i'm talking about individual atoms of o within this tin oxide compound so 1.67 divided by the atomic mass of o 16.00 again i'm not going to call that 0.1 i'm going to call that .104 so at least three significant figures so what's the next step in the process we have moles of 10 and moles of oxygen or o divide by the lower of the two values in this case we're going to divide by .0521 so now we have a 1 for 10 and we have a 2 for oxygen so those simple whole number values now become the subscripts so our chemical formula of this tin oxide compound from our data and our calculations is sno2 all right let's move on to number 18. number 18 starts off looking very similar to the other types of problems where we're trying to figure out the empirical formula of an unknown compound but then there's a little bit of a twist in parts b and c of this question where we actually make the connection between the empirical formula and the molecular formula of a compound okay so part a determine the empirical formula of compound x so we know that compound x consists of the elements carbon hydrogen and nitrogen we have a 15.00 gram sample of this compound and if you break it down by grams of each element we have 9.81 grams of carbon 1.37 grams of hydrogen and 3.82 grams of nitrogen so procedure is going to look like the previous problems where we have grams of each element let's go from grams to moles so divide by the molar mass of carbon which would be 12.01 and i'm going to write this number down as moles of carbon again i'm not rounding too much so i have three significant figures 0.817 moles of carbon moving on for hydrogen 1.37 divide by the atomic mass or the molar mass of h so 1.008 from the periodic table and i get 1.36 moles of hydrogen again not h2 just h and then for nitrogen again nitrogen is a diatomic element but in this case we're talking about individual atoms of c h and n so i'm not going to divide by 28.02 but rather 14.01 the atomic mass or the molar mass of individual n so ch and n this again that number gives me if i do that math 0.273 so i kept some precision at least three significant figures in my number of moles which of these three values is the smallest so 0.273 so i'm going to divide each of these value of moles by the smallest value so divide .817 by 0.273 and i get 3. and then for hydrogen i divide by 0.273 and i get 5 and obviously divide it by itself is 1. so 3 5 and 1 those are my subscripts in the empirical formula c3 h5n now the empirical formula is not necessarily the same as the molecular formula so in part c of this question we're going to have to get the molecular formula for compound x and we don't know what that is yet but we do know that the empirical formula which is the lowest simple whole number ratio of moles is c3h5n let's move on to part b of this question in part b it is determined that a 25.0 gram sample of compound x contains 9.11 times 10 to the 22nd molecules calculate the molar mass of compound x in units of grams per mole now you might be thinking molar mass don't we already know the chemical formula c3h5n well again that's the empirical formula which is not necessarily the same as the molecular formula so at this point we're not using our answer to part a to do this calculation we're given grams and molecules so i'm going to go ahead and write down the numbers i'm given which is 25 grams 25.0 grams and 9.11 times 10 to the 22nd molecules now what i did in starting this particular problem or setting up the calculation is i put grams on the top and i put molecules on the bottom if i'm paying close attention to what they're looking for molar mass is not grams per molecule but rather grams per mole so what i'm thinking is that i would like there to be a conversion factor that changes grams per molecule into grams per mole i don't want the grams to go away in fact i want the grams to stay exactly where they are but i would like to get rid of the molecules i would like to get rid of the molecules and replace that with per mole so i want molecules to go on top and i want moles to go on the bottom now is the time for avogadro's number as you've already learned there are avagadra's numbers 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd particles in this case molecules of a substance in one mole of that substance so if i do this calculation 25 divided by 9.11 times 10 to the 22nd times 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd i get on my calculator approximately 165 grams per mole again going with three significant figures based on the 25.0 and all the other numbers 165 grams per mole if you watching this video are thinking well is there another way to solve this problem besides the way i set it up absolutely so what you could do is you could analyze the information in part b and you could say well i don't know how to convert 25.0 grams into moles because i'm not really sure what the chemical formula again not the empirical formula but the molecular formula of compound x is so let's say for a moment we don't know what to do with 25.0 grams have we learned in chemistry how to convert molecules to moles yes absolutely so you could have written down the number of molecules and then again use avogadro's number to go from molecules to moles if i just did that i'd be dividing by avogadro's number again trying to get rid of molecules and go to moles and if i did that on my calculator 9.11 times 10 to the 22nd divided by avogadro's number i would get a value of approximately 0.151 moles but then i could go back to the 25.0 grams which i did not use yet in this calculation and i could say all right grams per mole which means grams divided by moles so 25.0 grams divided by the number of moles that i just calculated using avogadro's number if i did that math i would definitely still get the same answer that i got earlier which is 165 grams per mole so we're going to move on now to part c of this question which involves taking our answers to part a and part b and kind of putting them together in a certain way so in part a we had an empirical formula in part b we have a molar mass so in part c based on your answers to parts a and b determine the molecular formula of compound x so in part a we had an empirical formula of c3h5n again that's the simplest whole number ratio for those elements for the number of moles in part b we had approximately 165 grams per mole so how can we combine these two quantities or this information to get the molecular formula well if you take a moment and look at c3h5n that's three carbons five hydrogens and one nitrogen that number the formula mass of the empirical formula is not 165 it's about 55 55.08 on my calculator so how are those two numerical quantities related to each other well the ratio of the actual molecular formula which is the number of atoms of each element in that particular compound the ratio of the molecular formula to the empirical formula is going to be a whole number so for example c3h5n that's the lowest whole number ratio if i multiply it by 2 it would be c6h10 n2 but i could multiply that empirical formula by three or by four by five whatever and i would turn the empirical formula into the molecular formula so 165 is the molar mass 55 or 55.08 that is the empirical formula mass let's take the larger number divided by the smaller number and see what happens if we do that math 165 divided by 55.08 we get 3. so what does this tell us that the empirical formula should be multiplied by 3 and so 3 times 3 is 9 5 times 3 is 15 1 times 3 is 3 so the actual molecular formula is not c3h5n but rather times 3 c9 h15n3 and that would have a molar mass of 165 grams per mole so the answer to part c is c9 h15 n3 okay let's take a look at our next question so another way to determine the empirical formula of a compound instead of just being given the percent composition or the number of grams of each element in that compound is to use data from a combustion experiment now we saw this briefly with the tin converting that into the tin oxide earlier but if i take a compound that contains carbon and hydrogen and i burn it all the way to completion in the presence of excess oxygen gas then all of the carbon will be converted into carbon dioxide co2 and all of the hydrogen will combine with oxygen and convert it into h2o water so if the compound contains more than just carbon and hydrogen let's say it contains maybe nitrogen or sulfur then other gases may be formed oxides of nitrogen or oxides of sulfur so in number 19 we are given a data table and it says that there's a sample of a compound that contains carbon hydrogen and oxygen but we don't know the chemical formula of that compound all we know is it contains c h and o and it's burned completely in oxygen and o2 and it produced the sample produced 10.99 grams of carbon dioxide and it also produced 6.00 grams of water when it was burned completely so part a determine the mass of carbon present in 5.00 grams of the compound now we're not taking 5.00 grams and doing any math with that and the reason why we're not doing any math with that is because we don't know what the chemical formula is so we can't figure out how much carbon is present in 5.00 grams on its own what we are doing is looking at the co2 so to remind you on the periodic table the molar mass of co2 as calculated from the atomic masses of carbon and oxygen is 44.00 grams per mole so how much carbon is present in co2 that's what's going on in the calculation for part a so 10.99 grams of co2 was taken directly from the table and then now using the calculations from the periodic table i'm going to convert from grams of co2 into grams of carbon so how do i do that well at least i want to put grams of co2 on the bottom and i want to put grams of c grams of carbon on the top so this is how i did it the 44.01 that's the total mass the molar mass of co2 how much carbon is in that particular quantity is 12.01 as you can see from the calculations in the upper left corner of the slide so now i'm going to do the math of converting grams of co2 into grams of carbon so i do that math and i get approximately 3 grams i get 2.99908 i'll round that off to four significant figures at least for right now so 2.999 again i'm trying to be as precise as possible and not just cut off a number to a single significant digit so four sig figs in my mass of co2 four sig figs in my mass of carbon is there another way that i could have done this calculation that involved one mole as in converting from grams to moles absolutely we're still going to get the same answer but watch how you might have done it this way you could have taken the grams of co2 and first converted that into moles moles of co2 well the problem with just doing that much is that you have to get to grams of carbon so what might the next step be in converting moles of co2 into let's say grams of carbon as you might have done it like this there's one mole of carbon for every one mole of co2 because there are no subscripts with the carbon in this chemical formula for carbon dioxide so one mole of carbon is present in one mole of co2 now you have to go back to grams because they want the mass of carbon in grams so we could use the periodic table and write 12.01 grams of carbon per mole now it's the exact same calculation but it's in three steps so if you would prefer to do a problem a calculation like what i just showed you on the bottom part of that slide if that makes more sense to you go for it so the top version is just a ratio of grams of carbon to grams of co2 and then the bottom three-step sequence converts grams to moles of a compound converts moles of a compound to moles of an individual element within that compound and then back to grams using the periodic table okay with answered part a let's take a look at part b of this question we talked about carbon part b is let's talk about the mass of hydrogen present so again we're not using 5.00 grams in our calculation we're going to go ahead and figure out how much water was produced so 6.00 grams of water is produced and again the molar mass of water as you i'm sure already know would be just two hydrogens and one oxygen so 18.016 that is the molar mass of water so how much hydrogen is present in water is going to be part of our calculation if i write down 6.00 grams of water which i got from the table that i was given and i want to convert grams of h2o into grams of h so watch how i do that again be careful that you don't miss an important step so how much hydrogen is present in water looks like this so in the previous example it was 12.01 for carbon and 44.01 for co2 but within the water molecule within the water formula there's two h's in that formula so that's why this ratio is not 1.00 it's the total mass of hydrogen in the formula h2o if i do that math i get again i'm not going to round this off too much i'll say at least three sig figs so 0.671 grams of hydrogen if you would rather first convert grams to moles you could do that again grams to moles is a good first step but then we have to remember that there are two moles of hydrogen atoms for every one mole of water molecules and then if i go to grams of hydrogen that would be 1.008 grams of h per mole i'm still gonna get the same answer i'm gonna get 0.671 but if you prefer that bottom three-step sequence if that makes more conceptual sense to you to go grams to moles and then remember that there are two h's in every h2o then you're gonna get the exact same answer okay so let's move on to part c we've got the grams of carbon the grams of hydrogen let's see what it says in part c determine the mass of oxygen present in 5.00 grams of the compound so at the top of the slide you can see that the answer to part a was 2.999 grams of carbon and the answer to part b is 0.671 grams of hydrogen well there's a 5 gram sample 5.00 gram sample of a compound that contains three different elements c h and o we already know the mass of c and h so all we really have to do is subtract the answers from part a and b from the total mass of the compound the 5.00 and if we do that math so 5.00 minus 2.999 minus 0.671 when you add and subtract measurements we go with the least number of decimal places so i'm going to go ahead and with two decimal places i'm going to call that 1.33 grams of oxygen and again that's coming from just subtracting the answer to part a and b from the total mass of the sample that was burned all right almost done part d will be the traditional empirical formula calculation that you've seen before we're going to convert the grams of each element into moles so based on my answers to part a b and c i have 2.999 grams of carbon 0.671 grams of hydrogen and 1.33 grams of oxygen let's convert each of these elements from grams to moles as you've seen before so divide by either 12.01 or 1.008 or 16.00 so this is my calculation of moles of carbon so that's 0.2497 moles of carbon and then let's move on to the hydrogen let's convert from grams to moles so 0.671 grams of hydrogen divide by the molar mass of h 0.666 moles of hydrogen of h and then finally with the oxygen 1.33 grams of o divide by the molar mass of o 16.00 do that math and we get 0.0831 moles of o so now we have moles of c moles of h and moles of o to get the empirical formula we're going to divide each of these mole values by the smallest value and let's see what happens so divide by point zero eight three one for carbon we get three divide by point .0831 for hydrogen we get eight and obviously dividing by itself we get one so three eight and one those are the subscripts in the empirical formula so the empirical formula of this compound is c3 h8 o okay the last three problems in this packet have to do with ratios of moles but not exactly from element to element but involving water so it says another type of situation that involves mass and mole ratios involves a substance that is known as a hydrate a hydrate is a substance in which water molecules are included in the chemical formula these substances are often ionic compounds in which water molecules are bonded to the ions in the crystal structure so a hydrate salt can be heated to remove the water through evaporation and then you would form what is known as an anhydrous salt where the word anhydrous just means without water so here you can see in the table on the left two examples of anhydrous salts so we have copper roman numeral two sulfate cuso4 and then calcium chloride cacl2 on the right we see examples of hydrate salts of these compounds so copper roman numeral 2 sulfate pentahydrate so there are 5 moles of water for every 1 mole of cuso4 calcium chloride dihydrate there are two moles of water for every one mole of cacl2 so that dot just indicates that the water is coordinated and included in the chemical formula but that dot does not mean to multiply it just means that there are five or in this case two five additional moles of water are included in the chemical formula so let's see how we can take a look at some example problems that involve hydrates number 20 a sample of this copper roman numeral two sulfate pentahydrate cus04.5 h2o has a mass of 25.00 grams part a calculate the mass of cuso4 present in this 25.00 gram sample so how much cuso4 is present is going to be a number that is less than 25 grams because it's going to include both the cuso4 and the water so how much cuso4 is present well let me go ahead and start writing down the molar mass calculations so on the periodic table the atomic mass of copper 63.55 atomic mass of sulfur 32.06 atomic mass of oxygen 16.00 and there are four of them so 159.61 that's the molar mass of the anhydrous form of this compound without the water if i take 159.61 and then i add 5 moles of water to that calculation so 18.016 that's the molar mass of water h2o times 5 because there are 5 moles of water in the formula for the hydrate i get a number which is 249.69 that's the molar mass of the copper sulfate pentahydrate compound so 25.00 grams of this hydrated compound if i want to convert that to grams of just cuso4 i can use the numbers that are right here on the slide so 159.61 grams of just cus 04 for every 249.69 grams of the entire hydrate compound so that ratio will be set up as a conversion factor so i can get grams of cuso4 and i do that math and i get rounding off to four significant figures here 15.98 grams of just cos 04 without the water all right part b of this question calculate the mass of water present in this 25.00 gram sample well again it should be a number that's less than 25 grams so based on the same calculation i did for part a there's 159.61 grams of cuso4 for every 249.69 grams of the total hydrate compound what about the water well the water would be 18.016 times five that's how much water is present in the entire compound so 18.016 times 5 would give me the grams of water and then the 249.69 is the total molar mass of the hydrated compound so that math as a conversion factor would give me grams of water in my answer and i get approximately 9.02 or 9.019 so you might be thinking well did i really have to do that kind of calculation in part b if i already knew in part a that there was 15.98 grams of copper sulfate cuso4 couldn't i just subtract that from 25 and the answer is yes so another way perhaps a much easier way to calculate the answer to part b is just to subtract your answer to part a from the total mass of the sample so 25 minus 15.98 gives me the mass of water and 9.02 grams okay let's take a look at number 21. we're still talking about a hydrate compound but this time it's not the copper sulfate compound it's a calcium chloride compound this is calcium chloride dihydrate calculate the percentage of water by mass in this count calcium chloride dihydrate cacl2.2h2o well let's go to the periodic table calcium has an atomic mass of 40.08 chlorine has an atomic mass of 35.45 and there are two of them so just that math would give me 110.98 it's the molar mass of the anhydrous calcium chloride water has a molar mass of 18.016 and there are two of them in the chemical formula so grand total 110.98 plus the two moles of water is 147.012 grams per mole so the percentage of water by mass would be the mass of water divided by the total mass of the hydrate compound so we have 18.016 times 2 for the total mass of water within this compound and 147.012 for the total mass of the entire hydrate compound so that ratio times 100 would give us the percentage of water by mass if you do this math you get 24.51 percent water by mass all right on to number 22. we are given a data table it says in a certain experiment a sample of a hydrate of magnesium sulfate the formula for magnesium sulfate is mgso4 and then since we don't know exactly what the formula of the hydrate compound is we have dot n h2o where n is going to be a whole number it's going to be one two three four five etc that compound the hydrate is heated in order to remove all of the water from the sample so the empty container is 25.356 grams then they put the hydrate salt in that container and it weighs 28.418 grams before it's heated and then they heated it to evaporate all of the water from the hydrate sample and they heated it three times and the mass of the container and the sample after each heating is recorded in the table eventually once all of the water has been removed then we have mgso4 the anhydrous salt so let's take a look at the different parts of this question part a explain how the data indicates that all of the water has been removed from the hydrate salt in this experiment so notice that the mass is going down after each heating well take a look closely at the data after the second and the third heating and what you'll notice is that they are essentially the same number they're only different by .001 grams so at that point we can assume that all of the water has been removed if you take a look at the third heating which is again for the precision of the scale is essentially the same number it's only different by .001 grams because the mass does not change significantly between the second heating and the third heating as in like those values are essentially the same now we can assume that the mass is constant the mass is not changing so therefore all of the water must have been removed in this experiment all right let's take a look at part b calculate the mass of the hydrate salt that was used in this experiment so that would be the difference between the first two values in the table 28.418 is the mass of the container and the hydrate salt before it was heated 25.356 is the mass of the empty container so that difference in grams 3.062 that's the mass of the hydrate salt all right let's take a look at part c calculate the mass of water that was removed from the hydrate sample in this experiment so the mass of the container and the hydrate salt before heating was 28.418 grams and at the end of the experiment after all of the water was removed the mass of the container in the sample was 26.852 grams so that difference in mass represents how much water was lost from evaporation and that would be 1.566 grams of water all right let's take a look at part d determine the value of n in the formula mgso4 dot nh2o so n represents the ratio of moles of water to moles of mgso4 that means we're going to need to take our answers that we have so far in our data table and turn grams into moles for the chemical substances involved here so how many moles of water and how many moles of mgso4 that's what we're looking at so the mgso4 the anhydrous salt would be the difference between our answers to b and c 1.496 grams or you could get it directly from the table and you could say well at the end of the experiment the mass was 26.852 [Music] just subtract the empty container and that difference 25.356 subtracted from 26.852 you would get the same answer so now we know how many grams of mgso4 are present at the end of the experiment the anhydrous mgso4 let's turn that number into moles so the value of n represents a mole ratio of moles of water divided by moles of this anhydrous salt so using the periodic table 1.496 grams of mgso4 let's turn that into moles so divide by the molar mass 120.36 and we get notice how i'm not going to round this off too much so 0.01 0.012 it's better to have some extra precision in your calculations at this point so i'm not gonna be tempted to call that point zero one definitely not point zero one two i'm gonna keep going so there's my number of moles and then for the water 1.566 grams of water divided by its molar mass again i'm not gonna round that off to point zero nine see i might think the ratio is nine to one if i said .01 and .09 but that's incorrect so better to have some extra precision in your values especially when you're in the middle of a calculation so how am i going to get my answer for the value of n it's a mole ratio so we're going to take moles of water so 0.08692 divided by moles of the anhydrous salt .01243 let's see what we get on the calculator and we get 7. so the answer to this particular question the value of n is 7 and if you wanted to write the formula of the hydrate mgs04.c h2o this would be called magnesium sulfate heptahydrate if you were curious it's also found in epsom salts which are kind of an over the counter remedy for like soaking sore muscles things like that okay so seven was the answer to part d and i believe that this particular part of this question represents the last question in the packet so again i hope that the answers to this particular packet were helpful thanks for

packet that covers topics 1.1 to 1.3 so here you're looking at unit 1 at a glance again unit 1 is entitled atomic structure and properties and in this particular video we'll take a look at topic 1.1 moles and molar mass topic 1.2 mass spectroscopy also known as spectrometry of elements and topic 1.3 elemental composition of pure substances in the video description area there should be a link to the ap chemistry course and exam description and there also should be a link to this particular packet that goes along with the video all right topic 1.1 moles and molar mass so here are some essential knowledge statements that come from the ap chemistry course and exam description one cannot count particles directly while performing laboratory work thus there must be a connection between the masses of substances reacting and the actual number of particles undergoing chemical changes avogadro's number 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd particles per mole provides the connection between the number of moles in a pure sample of a substance and the number of constituent particles or formula units of that substance expressing the mass of an individual atom or molecule in atomic mass units amu is useful because the average mass in amu of one particle atom or molecule or formula unit of a substance will always be numerically equal to the molar mass of that substance in grams thus there is a quantitative connection between the mass of a substance and the number of particles that the substance contains so here are three substances magnesium mg carbon dioxide co2 and sodium chloride nacl the particles of a substance can be described as atoms molecules or formula units as shown in the following examples the molar mass of a substance can be determined or calculated from the atomic mass values on the periodic table so if you look on your periodic table and you find the elemental symbol for magnesium mg you could say that a single atom of magnesium would weigh 24.30 amu or atomic mass units but once i change that to mole a mole of magnesium weighs 24.30 grams and it contains avogadro's number of atoms a mole of carbon dioxide if you add up the atomic mass of one carbon and two oxygens the molar mass of co2 is 44.01 grams and that would contain avogadro's number of molecules again referring to co2 as molecules that is a covalent substance whereas since sodium chloride is not covalent but rather ionic its fundamental building blocks or particles is not considered a molecule but rather a formula unit so one mole of sodium chloride would have a molar mass from the periodic table when you add up the atomic masses of sodium and chlorine 58.44 grams per mole and again would contain avogadro's number of formula units okay let's take a look at some practice problems so here we have two problems one of them says to calculate the mass in grams of 0.08 moles of something called barium hydroxide ba parentheses oh2 and then the other problem says to calculate the number of moles of c4h10 that are present in 2.00 grams of c4h10 so we are going to need to use the periodic table to do these calculations so starting with number one i have to go find barium oxygen and hydrogen on the periodic table so i can calculate the molar mass so there are those three particular elements and again let's go ahead and do that math to calculate the molar mass so for barium hydroxide ba parentheses oh2 the total of the barium and the two oxygens and the two hydrogens added together is 171.346 grams per mole so we'll start with the number of moles and then we'll set up a conversion factor that will put mole on the bottom since that's the unit we're trying to cancel out and grams on the top so that would be like this 171.346 grams of barium hydroxide for every one mole if we do that math on our calculator we get 14 point again you can see several significant digits there five six four four one so how do we round off our final answer in this case we go with the measurement that we were given so 0.0850 has three significant figures so we're going to round off our final answer to three significant figures and that would look like 14.6 grams in our next problem we're essentially doing the reverse of what we just did in number one so instead of going from moles to grams we're going to go from grams to moles so we start off with calculating the molar mass of c4h10 again this comes from the periodic table so carbon has an atomic mass of 12.01 and there are four carbons in the formula hydrogen is 1.008 and there are 10 of those so 58.12 grams per mole that's my molar mass of c4h10 i write down the number i was given so 2.00 grams of c4h10 and now i want to put grams on the bottom and moles on top so i use my molar mass as a conversion factor to go from grams to moles i do that math on my calculator again i get a long number and i'm not sure let's say how to round it off until i look at the measurement that i was given so 2.00 grams has three significant figures so we're going to round off our final answer to three significant figures which would be written as 0.0344 moles of c4h10 okay let's take a look at our next two problems number three calculate the number of atoms of silicon si that are present in 35.0 moles of silicon and then number four calculate the number of moles of o3 which is ozone that are present in 4.3 times 10 to the 24 molecules of ozone so number three we are going from atoms to moles and in number four we're going from moles to molecules so because we're talking about a conversion factor that goes between number of moles and number of particles we need avogadro's number but we in fact do not need to use the periodic table because we're not converting from grams to moles like we were in the previous or moles of grams okay so in this particular set of problems we're just going to use avogadro's number so number three we write down 35.0 moles of silicon put moles on the bottom and in this case atoms are the particles so atoms on top so there's avogadro's number the number of atoms or particles in one mole we do that math and again rounding this particular number off to the number of sig figs that we need in this case 35.0 has three significant figures so that number will be expressed with three significant figures as 2.11 times 10 to the 25th power and then number four we start with our number of particles in this case molecules of ozone o3 we want to put particles on the bottom and moles on top so avogadro's number of molecules of ozone on the bottom and then one mole of ozone on the top we do this math by again doing division like in the last problem we were multiplying the avogadro's number now we're dividing by avogadro's number and again on our calculator we get this long number let's round it off based on the number we're given in this case 4.3 has only two significant figures so our final answer is written as 7.1 moles of ozone o3 all right let's take a look at the next two questions number five calculate the mass in grams of 8.2 times 10 to the 22nd molecules of chcl3 and the number six calculate the number of formula units of na2so4 present in 0.248 grams of that substance so number five we know that when we use a conversion involving avogadro's number that's going to be between moles and particles or vice versa so we're definitely going to need avogadro's number but since the final answer is in grams we also need the periodic table and the calculated value for the molar mass to go between moles and grams and so i'm going to write the calculation for the molar mass of chcl so the atomic mass of carbon hydrogen and chlorine are what you see here so 12.01 1.008 and 35.45 now there are three chlorines in the formula that's why that's times three so 119.368 grams per mole that's the molar mass of chcl3 we're also going to need to use avogadro's number so here we have the given information 8.2 times 10 to the 22nd molecules of this substance chcl3 let's put molecules on the bottom and moles on top again using avogadro's number so avogadro's number on the bottom number of molecules in one mole and then let's use the molar mass that's going to be grams on top and then one mole on the bottom so here we pick up our calculator and we divide by avogadro's number we multiply by 119.368 and then we get this number on our calculator which if we round this off to two significant figures based on the 8.2 having two significant figures we're going to write this as not 16.2 or 16.3 but rather just 16 again two significant figures to match the value that we're given so i'm not going to be limited by avogadro's number or the molar mass from the periodic table those are not going to limit my significant figures in my answer but the number i was given in the problem that number has a certain number of significant figures that limits my answer all right on to number six molar mass for na2so4 again based on the atomic masses of sodium sulfur and oxygen so if i do that math 22.99 that's the atomic mass of sodium 32.06 the atomic mass of sulfur and then 16 the atomic mass of oxygen times 4. so we do all of that and we get 142.04 grams per mole that's the molar mass of na2so4 we'll start with the number we're given so 0.248 we're going to go from grams to moles so grams on the bottom one mole on top so there's the molar mass using that as a conversion factor and then now it's time to incorporate avogadro's number in our calculation so that would be one mole on the bottom and avogadro's number of particles in this case formula units on the top so if we divide by the molar mass multiplied by avogadro's number we get a number that needs to be rounded in this case 0.248 was the number we're given that's the measurement that has three significant figures so 0.248 three significant figures let's round off our final answer to 1.05 times 10 to the 21st formula units of na2so4 all right now we are going to move on to topic 1.2 mass spectroscopy of elements again also known as mass spectrometry and here are two essential knowledge statements from the ap chemistry course and exam description the mass spectrum of a sample containing a single element can be used to determine the identity of the isotopes of that element and the relative abundance of each isotope in nature the average atomic mass of an element can be estimated from the weighted average of the isotopic masses using the mass of each isotope and its relative abundance so in this first example for number seven from your packet we're looking at chlorine and on the left we see that there are two isotopes of chlorine so chlorine with a mass number of 35 and chlorine with a mass number of 37. the abundance that's like the percentage of that particular element as it would appear in a sample naturally 75.8 percent chlorine 35 24.2 chlorine 37. so on the right we're seeing a mass spectrum and again this particular diagram shows two bars so one on the x-axis at atomic mass or mass number of 35 for the chlorine-35 isotope and then a smaller bar on the x-axis you can see that's 37 so again mass number 37 on the y-axis we see percent abundance so number seven part a calculate the average atomic mass of cl so based on this information that would be to calculate the weighted average so the weighted average means we're going to multiply each mass number by its percent abundance that is written as a decimal so 35 times 0.758 plus 37 times 0.242 so that's the weighted average that we get from this data and our calculator would give us an answer of approximately 35.5 in part b of this question we're given a table with chlorine 35 and chlorine 37 and we're asked to fill in the number of protons and neutrons so if we take a look at the periodic table we can see that chlorine does in fact have an atomic mass that is approximately 35.5 so that answer to part a makes sense and we can see atomic number 17 that refers to the number of protons in the nucleus of chlorine so 17 protons for each isotope protons plus neutrons will give us the mass number so 17 plus 18 is 35 or you could do 35 minus 17 equals 18 and then 17 plus 20 equals 37. all right let's take a look at number eight so we're looking at a different element that says not chlorine you can see along the x-axis we have a mass number of either 121 or 123 and along the y-axis for the percent abundance you can see written above each bar 57.4 percent for the mass number 121 and 42.6 percent for the abundance of mass number 123. so to calculate the average atomic mass of this particular element we're going to do just like we did before take the mass number times the percent abundance that is written as a decimal so 121 times 0.574 plus 123 times 0.426 so we do that math and we get approximately 121.9 now to look on the periodic table to figure out what is the most likely identity of this element it's okay if the atomic mass of the element is not exactly 121.9 but is very close to that value let's take a look so again tin sn is only 118.71 so that's too small tellurium te is 127.60 that's too big so the only element that this could represent is atomic number 51 antimony sb with an atomic mass of 121.76 again that's the closest to the value that we calculated in part a so again to part b what is the most likely identity of this element it is going to be antimony element symbol sb okay let's take a look at number nine so we have a mass spectrum with mass numbers of 79 and 81 and we have the percent abundances that are listed so now we're not going to actually need to calculate the average atomic mass in this particular problem they come right out with what is the most likely identity of this element so if we look at the periodic table we're looking for an element that has an atomic mass that falls somewhere between 79 and 81. again these are almost exactly a 50 50 mixture of these two isotopes so should be pretty close to 80 for the atomic mass which would be the average of 79 and 81. let's take a look in the periodic table so selenium se has an average atomic mass of 78.97 so that's too small krypton kr is going to be about 83.80 that's too large so the only element that has an atomic mass that falls between 79 and 81 is bromine br and its atomic mass is 79.90 so bromine has 35 protons in its nucleus and has an average mass atomic mass of 79.90 so bromine is the answer to part a and then for part b again bromine has 35 protons in its nucleus so mass number minus atomic number would give us the number of neutrons so 79 minus 35 is 44 and 81 minus 35 is 46. so again 35 protons and 44 or 46 neutrons for the two isotopes of bromine okay moving on to number 10 this time we don't actually have a mass spectrum to look at but we are told that a certain element has two naturally occurring isotopes with mass numbers of 63 and 65 what is the most likely identity of this element let's take a look at the periodic table and see if we can find an element whose atomic mass falls between 63 and 65. nickel is around 58.69 zinc is around 65.38 so copper element cu the only one that would fall in that range between 63 and 65. so 63.55 is the average atomic mass of copper cu now to fill in the table with protons and neutrons again on the periodic table we know that copper has 29 protons in the nucleus again that would be the atomic number of copper 29 and then since the protons plus the neutrons equals the mass number 63 minus 29 will give us the number of neutrons and again that's either 34 or 36 for the number of neutrons again these are the number of neutrons so 29 plus 34 equals 63 29 plus 36 equals 65. now again we're not looking at a mass spectrum so we don't know the percent abundance of these two isotopes of copper so part c of this question which isotope of this element mass number 63 or mass number 65 is more abundant in nature justify your answer so on the periodic table the average atomic mass of copper is 63.55 so the isotope with mass number 63 should be more abundant in nature because the average the weighted average 63.55 is closer in value to 63 than it is to 65. so for example if it had been exactly a 50 50 mixture of these two isotopes then the average of 63 and 65 just a straight up average would be 64. since 63.55 is closer to the number 63 that means that the isotope with mass number 63 is more abundant okay let's take a look at number 11. so so far in the examples that i'm showing you for a mass spectrum it's been really simple in that there's only been two naturally occurring isotopes of the elements in the examples you've seen so far so what i wanted to do here with this example is to indicate that the process the calculation of the average atomic mass it can be a bit more complicated it's still the same principle but you just have more numbers to enter into your calculator so here number 11 if an element has several naturally occurring isotopes then here's how you would do the calculation part a based on the information above estimate the average atomic mass of the element to the nearest whole number and then use a calculator to determine the average atomic mass so if i had to estimate this it looks like it's going to be anywhere between 154 and 160 according to the data that we have for six different isotopes of this particular element so where would the average fall where would the weighted average fall looks like 154 is a very small amount it's about 2 percent and then all of the other isotopes are somewhere between 15 and about 22 25 so i'm going to estimate again just a rough estimate that the average atomic mass is probably somewhere around the middle like maybe around 157 or so so you might estimate that the average atomic mass of this particular element is approximately 157. let's go ahead and do the math so to do the math we're going to take the mass number times the percent abundance written as a decimal so it looks like this 154 times 0.0218 plus 155 times 0.1480 and then you just keep going 156 times its percent abundance as a decimal 157 158 160. so all of that into my calculator gives me an answer of four 157.0241 so again approximately 157 point zero two what is the most likely identity of this element again let's look on the periodic table and see can we find an element that has an average atomic mass that is approximately 157 so down there in the lanthanide series of the periodic table the elements between atomic number 58 cerium and atomic number 71 lutesium we see that an element with a symbol gd which is gadolinium has an atomic mass of 157.25 so that's going to be the most likely identity of this particular element so gadolinium gd with atomic mass 157.25 okay well moving on to our next topic the last topic in this particular video topic 1.3 elemental composition of pure substances so here are some essential knowledge statements from the ap chemistry course and exam description some pure substances are composed of individual molecules while others consist of atoms or ions held together in fixed proportions as described by a formula unit according to the law of definite proportions the ratio of the masses of the constituent elements in any pure sample of that compound is always the same the chemical formula that lists the lowest whole number ratio of atoms of the elements in a compound is the empirical formula so let's take a look at our first question here number 12. calculate the percent composition by mass of each element in glucose c6h12o6 so what you're doing here is you're using the skill that you already have acquired from topic 1.1 about calculating the molar mass so the molar mass of glucose c6h12o6 would be the atomic mass of carbon 12.01 times 6 the atomic mass of hydrogen 1.008 times and the atomic mass of oxygen 16.00 times 6. so grand total molar mass or formula mass is 180.156 in the case of the molar mass that would be grams per mole if this were a single molecule of glucose you could say amu or atomic mass units but the percent composition by mass what that means is that we have to take the part divided by the whole for each element in this particular compound so the percentage of carbon by mass the percentage of hydrogen by mass the percentage of oxygen by mass so for the percent carbon by mass that would be 12.01 times six that's the total mass of carbon and then divided by the formula mass or the molar mass 180.156 times 100 to convert that to a percent and we do that math and we get 40.00 percent carbon by mass now we look at hydrogen and then oxygen so for hydrogen it would be 1.008 times 12 that's the total mass of hydrogen in one unit of glucose again divided by the total mass times 100 6.71 hydrogen by mass and then for oxygen 16.00 times 6 that's the total mass of oxygen within the formula glucose divided by the total mass times 100 and we get 53.29 percent oxygen by mass so no matter where i get glucose a pure sample of glucose from any source should have these same percentages of carbon hydrogen and oxygen by mass so the law of definite proportion or constant composition says that glucose will always have these particular percentages of carbon hydrogen and oxygen any pure sample of glucose has that so moving on to number 13 in the packet now we have a different compound which is called erythrose and its chemical formula is c4h8o4 let's go ahead and do the same process that we did in number 12 for glucose so the total mass of erythros from the periodic table so four carbons eight hydrogens and four oxygens is 120.104 grams per mole or you could say amu's if you were talking about a single molecule of erythrose let's break it down for carbon hydrogen and oxygen just like we did in number 12. mass of carbon so 12.01 times 4 divided by the total mass 120 120.104 times 100. interestingly enough we get the exact same percentage of carbon that we did in number 12. and so you're going to see a little deja vu now we do the percentage of hydrogen by mass in this compound so 1.008 times 8 total mass of hydrogen divided by total mass of erythros again that number should be familiar six point seven one percent hydrogen by mass and then finally with oxygen total mass of oxygen sixteen point zero zero times four divided by the total mass of erythros times a hundred fifty three point two nine percent oxygen by mass so if you're wondering why i chose the compounds in number 12 and number 13 there was a particular point that i wanted to make with these two compounds glucose and erythros and that is summarized by the work you're doing in number 14. so the empirical formula is going to be the simplest whole number ratio so when we take glucose c6h and we divide each of those subscripts by the greatest common factor in this case 6 we get c1h2o1 now even though erythrose is a very different chemical with different properties different formula when we take c4h8o4 and we divide each of those subscripts by the greatest common factor in this case four we get the exact same empirical formula so the point that i wanted to make is that we have two different compounds but because they have the same empirical formula then they are going to lead to a calculation that will give you the same percent composition by mass all right let's move on to number 15 in the packet now in this particular question we're actually going to go in the opposite direction so instead of being given a chemical formula and then calculating the percent composition by mass in number 15 we are told what the percent composition by mass is and we have to figure out the chemical formula specifically the empirical formula the one that has the lowest whole number ratio of elements so this is phosphorus and oxygen 43.64 phosphorus by mass 56.36 oxygen by mass so a good first step in this particular problem is to assume that the mass of this sample this compound that contains phosphorus and oxygen is 100 grams that way since a percentage is based on 100 we can just simply write down the number of grams of each element so we have 43.64 grams of the element phosphorus and we have 56.36 grams of the element oxygen well as you learned in topic 1.1 you can use the periodic table to go from grams to moles and so we have grams right now let's convert grams into moles because that way the mole ratio will give us the information that we need about the chemical formula so let's take the periodic table which has for phosphorous an atomic mass of 30.97 let's use that number to go from grams to moles now at this point i'm going to write that number down on my calculator i don't want to round it off to just 1 or 1.4 or even 1.41 it's actually better in calculations like this where you're trying to figure out the empirical formula it's better if you have extra digits on your calculator you want to really resist the temptation to start rounding these numbers off or not writing down the full number so i chose four significant figures in this problem the reason why you don't want to round it off too much is because you're looking for a ratio of moles of one element to the other and the more you round off your numbers the less accurate your values will be when you're trying to find that mole ratio so it's better to have extra precision in your answers than to just cut off the number at a couple of digits all right oxygen 56.36 grams of oxygen you might be wondering if you have good chemistry knowledge about oxygen being a diatomic element right we normally write oxygen as o2 you might be wondering do we have to use o2 in our calculations and the answer is no we're looking for individual ratios of elements o2 is a molecule it's not an individual atom so therefore it would be a single o so on the periodic table i'm going to write 16.00 i'm not going to write 32 because we're not talking about molecules of o2 we're talking about individual atoms of phosphorus and oxygen in this particular unknown compound so again be careful when you're going from grams to moles of individual elements that you ignore any elements that might be diatomic because in this particular case it's individual atoms not diatomic molecules all right i do this math 56.36 divided by 16 and i get again look at me not rounding off this answer too much i'm not going to call it 4 or 3.5 so i went ahead and chose 4 significant figures okay what do we do next to get the empirical formula of this compound we're looking for a simple whole number ratio between the moles of phosphorus and the moles of oxygen so how do we do that well because it's based on a simple whole number ratio of moles we're going to go ahead and take these two values of moles and we're going to divide them by the smaller of the two values so 1.409 divided by itself will give us 1 and 3.523 divided by 1.409 if you do that math on your calculator you get 2.50 so again now do we have simple whole numbers no we're not going to take 2.5 and just round it up to 3. what we have to do is take this empirical formula which again this is not correct and we're going to try to get simple whole numbers from the numbers that we have right now so instead of saying 1 and 2.5 let's just go ahead and double these values that way it keeps the ratio the same but we turn a 1 into a 2 and a 2.5 into a 5. so by doubling the ratio of 1 and 2.5 we get 2 and 5. and then that's it that's our empirical formula p2o5 is the empirical formula of this particular compound all right so to go ahead and summarize the procedure that we used in number 15 of this packet if you are given percent composition by mass or mass data for a certain compound so grams of each element the following procedure will help you to determine the empirical formula of the compound convert the grams or the mass of each element into moles again that would involve the periodic table then now that you have moles of each element divide each value of moles by the lowest value the lowest number now at this point you may already have whole numbers based on that step in the procedure but if not if you have numbers that end in 0.5 like we just saw in the last example then you could multiply by 2. or if for example your number of moles they end with .33 or .66 or 0.67 you may have to multiply by 3 to turn those values into whole numbers so again be careful with your data don't round off your numbers too early in the calculation as i said before but then whatever whole numbers you get those whole number values of moles then they will be used in the subscripts to write the empirical formula of that compound okay here's our next problem number 16. we are given the percentage by mass for the elements carbon hydrogen and oxygen let's convert each of these numbers from grams into moles so we'll assume that we have a hundred grams of this particular compound and that way the percentages can just be written as grams so we have grams of carbon let's divide that number by the molar mass of carbon which would be 12.01 we're converting from grams to moles again i'm not going to round that number off to four or 4.3 so i wrote that number with four significant figures a little extra precision is a good thing in the early stage of the calculation now we have the same calculation for hydrogen and for oxygen so 13.13 again this is individual elements individual atoms of hydrogen so it's not h2 it's not the diatomic molecule that we think about in terms of its substance you might have hydrogen gas for example it's h2 this is individual atoms of hydrogen so divided by 1.008 that came from the periodic table 13.03 i'm using the atomic masses for each element as the molar mass of each element so 34.73 grams of oxygen again not divided by 32 but 16. so individual molar masses of these elements with no subscripts so now i'm staring at three numbers which are 4.31 sorry 4.341 moles of carbon 13.03 moles of hydrogen and 2.171 moles of oxygen so the next step in the procedure is to find the lowest value in this case 2.171 and we're going to go ahead and divide each of these values of moles by the smallest value so divided by 2.171 we get 2 divided by 2.171 we get 6 and obviously divided by itself we get 1. so those values 2 6 and 1 are already whole numbers there's no extra step of multiplying by 2 or 3. so what i have right now is an empirical formula c2 h6 and then o1 or just o the one is understood as a subscript okay so our empirical formula was c2h6o let's move on to number 17 in the packet a pure sample of tin so elemental symbol sn with a mass of 6.18 grams is burned in air until the tin is completely converted into a tin oxide so a tin oxide compound would contain both tin and oxygen the mass of the tin oxide is equal to 7.85 grams determine the empirical formula of this tin oxide compound so we start with 6.18 grams of tin it is burned in the air which means it's going to react with oxygen in the air and it produces 7.85 grams of tin oxide now i'm not writing a balanced chemical equation for this process i'm writing the elements in words because we don't know the exact formula of the tin oxide so therefore even though i know that tin is sn i know that oxygen gas is written as o2 i don't know what the chemical formula of this particular tin oxide compound is so the difference in mass between 7.85 grams and 6.18 grams that difference is 1.67 grams that's how much oxygen reacted with the tin in this experiment so while this looks like a different problem in the previous examples we had the percentage of each element by mass so percent composition now that we know from processing this information that we have grams of tin sn and then grams of oxygen in this case i'm going to write this as individual atoms of o we can go ahead and convert grams to moles like we have been doing in the other problems number 15 and 16. so grams of tin 6.18 grams divided by the atomic mass of tin on the periodic table 118.71 that gives me the number of moles of tin again i'm going to try to keep a little extra precision so i'm not going to write 0.05 or 0.052 i went ahead and i chose three significant figures here but if you had four or five significant figures that would be fine too again a little extra precision is fine in this stage of the calculation but don't round off your numbers because you might throw away important precision that will help you get to those simple whole number ratios of moles again like i said in the previous examples we have individual oxygen so yes there is oxygen in the air which is o2 but i want to know the ratio of atoms of tin to atoms of oxygen in this particular compound so that's why i'm not dividing by 32 i'm not talking about o2 i'm talking about individual atoms of o within this tin oxide compound so 1.67 divided by the atomic mass of o 16.00 again i'm not going to call that 0.1 i'm going to call that .104 so at least three significant figures so what's the next step in the process we have moles of 10 and moles of oxygen or o divide by the lower of the two values in this case we're going to divide by .0521 so now we have a 1 for 10 and we have a 2 for oxygen so those simple whole number values now become the subscripts so our chemical formula of this tin oxide compound from our data and our calculations is sno2 all right let's move on to number 18. number 18 starts off looking very similar to the other types of problems where we're trying to figure out the empirical formula of an unknown compound but then there's a little bit of a twist in parts b and c of this question where we actually make the connection between the empirical formula and the molecular formula of a compound okay so part a determine the empirical formula of compound x so we know that compound x consists of the elements carbon hydrogen and nitrogen we have a 15.00 gram sample of this compound and if you break it down by grams of each element we have 9.81 grams of carbon 1.37 grams of hydrogen and 3.82 grams of nitrogen so procedure is going to look like the previous problems where we have grams of each element let's go from grams to moles so divide by the molar mass of carbon which would be 12.01 and i'm going to write this number down as moles of carbon again i'm not rounding too much so i have three significant figures 0.817 moles of carbon moving on for hydrogen 1.37 divide by the atomic mass or the molar mass of h so 1.008 from the periodic table and i get 1.36 moles of hydrogen again not h2 just h and then for nitrogen again nitrogen is a diatomic element but in this case we're talking about individual atoms of c h and n so i'm not going to divide by 28.02 but rather 14.01 the atomic mass or the molar mass of individual n so ch and n this again that number gives me if i do that math 0.273 so i kept some precision at least three significant figures in my number of moles which of these three values is the smallest so 0.273 so i'm going to divide each of these value of moles by the smallest value so divide .817 by 0.273 and i get 3. and then for hydrogen i divide by 0.273 and i get 5 and obviously divide it by itself is 1. so 3 5 and 1 those are my subscripts in the empirical formula c3 h5n now the empirical formula is not necessarily the same as the molecular formula so in part c of this question we're going to have to get the molecular formula for compound x and we don't know what that is yet but we do know that the empirical formula which is the lowest simple whole number ratio of moles is c3h5n let's move on to part b of this question in part b it is determined that a 25.0 gram sample of compound x contains 9.11 times 10 to the 22nd molecules calculate the molar mass of compound x in units of grams per mole now you might be thinking molar mass don't we already know the chemical formula c3h5n well again that's the empirical formula which is not necessarily the same as the molecular formula so at this point we're not using our answer to part a to do this calculation we're given grams and molecules so i'm going to go ahead and write down the numbers i'm given which is 25 grams 25.0 grams and 9.11 times 10 to the 22nd molecules now what i did in starting this particular problem or setting up the calculation is i put grams on the top and i put molecules on the bottom if i'm paying close attention to what they're looking for molar mass is not grams per molecule but rather grams per mole so what i'm thinking is that i would like there to be a conversion factor that changes grams per molecule into grams per mole i don't want the grams to go away in fact i want the grams to stay exactly where they are but i would like to get rid of the molecules i would like to get rid of the molecules and replace that with per mole so i want molecules to go on top and i want moles to go on the bottom now is the time for avogadro's number as you've already learned there are avagadra's numbers 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd particles in this case molecules of a substance in one mole of that substance so if i do this calculation 25 divided by 9.11 times 10 to the 22nd times 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd i get on my calculator approximately 165 grams per mole again going with three significant figures based on the 25.0 and all the other numbers 165 grams per mole if you watching this video are thinking well is there another way to solve this problem besides the way i set it up absolutely so what you could do is you could analyze the information in part b and you could say well i don't know how to convert 25.0 grams into moles because i'm not really sure what the chemical formula again not the empirical formula but the molecular formula of compound x is so let's say for a moment we don't know what to do with 25.0 grams have we learned in chemistry how to convert molecules to moles yes absolutely so you could have written down the number of molecules and then again use avogadro's number to go from molecules to moles if i just did that i'd be dividing by avogadro's number again trying to get rid of molecules and go to moles and if i did that on my calculator 9.11 times 10 to the 22nd divided by avogadro's number i would get a value of approximately 0.151 moles but then i could go back to the 25.0 grams which i did not use yet in this calculation and i could say all right grams per mole which means grams divided by moles so 25.0 grams divided by the number of moles that i just calculated using avogadro's number if i did that math i would definitely still get the same answer that i got earlier which is 165 grams per mole so we're going to move on now to part c of this question which involves taking our answers to part a and part b and kind of putting them together in a certain way so in part a we had an empirical formula in part b we have a molar mass so in part c based on your answers to parts a and b determine the molecular formula of compound x so in part a we had an empirical formula of c3h5n again that's the simplest whole number ratio for those elements for the number of moles in part b we had approximately 165 grams per mole so how can we combine these two quantities or this information to get the molecular formula well if you take a moment and look at c3h5n that's three carbons five hydrogens and one nitrogen that number the formula mass of the empirical formula is not 165 it's about 55 55.08 on my calculator so how are those two numerical quantities related to each other well the ratio of the actual molecular formula which is the number of atoms of each element in that particular compound the ratio of the molecular formula to the empirical formula is going to be a whole number so for example c3h5n that's the lowest whole number ratio if i multiply it by 2 it would be c6h10 n2 but i could multiply that empirical formula by three or by four by five whatever and i would turn the empirical formula into the molecular formula so 165 is the molar mass 55 or 55.08 that is the empirical formula mass let's take the larger number divided by the smaller number and see what happens if we do that math 165 divided by 55.08 we get 3. so what does this tell us that the empirical formula should be multiplied by 3 and so 3 times 3 is 9 5 times 3 is 15 1 times 3 is 3 so the actual molecular formula is not c3h5n but rather times 3 c9 h15n3 and that would have a molar mass of 165 grams per mole so the answer to part c is c9 h15 n3 okay let's take a look at our next question so another way to determine the empirical formula of a compound instead of just being given the percent composition or the number of grams of each element in that compound is to use data from a combustion experiment now we saw this briefly with the tin converting that into the tin oxide earlier but if i take a compound that contains carbon and hydrogen and i burn it all the way to completion in the presence of excess oxygen gas then all of the carbon will be converted into carbon dioxide co2 and all of the hydrogen will combine with oxygen and convert it into h2o water so if the compound contains more than just carbon and hydrogen let's say it contains maybe nitrogen or sulfur then other gases may be formed oxides of nitrogen or oxides of sulfur so in number 19 we are given a data table and it says that there's a sample of a compound that contains carbon hydrogen and oxygen but we don't know the chemical formula of that compound all we know is it contains c h and o and it's burned completely in oxygen and o2 and it produced the sample produced 10.99 grams of carbon dioxide and it also produced 6.00 grams of water when it was burned completely so part a determine the mass of carbon present in 5.00 grams of the compound now we're not taking 5.00 grams and doing any math with that and the reason why we're not doing any math with that is because we don't know what the chemical formula is so we can't figure out how much carbon is present in 5.00 grams on its own what we are doing is looking at the co2 so to remind you on the periodic table the molar mass of co2 as calculated from the atomic masses of carbon and oxygen is 44.00 grams per mole so how much carbon is present in co2 that's what's going on in the calculation for part a so 10.99 grams of co2 was taken directly from the table and then now using the calculations from the periodic table i'm going to convert from grams of co2 into grams of carbon so how do i do that well at least i want to put grams of co2 on the bottom and i want to put grams of c grams of carbon on the top so this is how i did it the 44.01 that's the total mass the molar mass of co2 how much carbon is in that particular quantity is 12.01 as you can see from the calculations in the upper left corner of the slide so now i'm going to do the math of converting grams of co2 into grams of carbon so i do that math and i get approximately 3 grams i get 2.99908 i'll round that off to four significant figures at least for right now so 2.999 again i'm trying to be as precise as possible and not just cut off a number to a single significant digit so four sig figs in my mass of co2 four sig figs in my mass of carbon is there another way that i could have done this calculation that involved one mole as in converting from grams to moles absolutely we're still going to get the same answer but watch how you might have done it this way you could have taken the grams of co2 and first converted that into moles moles of co2 well the problem with just doing that much is that you have to get to grams of carbon so what might the next step be in converting moles of co2 into let's say grams of carbon as you might have done it like this there's one mole of carbon for every one mole of co2 because there are no subscripts with the carbon in this chemical formula for carbon dioxide so one mole of carbon is present in one mole of co2 now you have to go back to grams because they want the mass of carbon in grams so we could use the periodic table and write 12.01 grams of carbon per mole now it's the exact same calculation but it's in three steps so if you would prefer to do a problem a calculation like what i just showed you on the bottom part of that slide if that makes more sense to you go for it so the top version is just a ratio of grams of carbon to grams of co2 and then the bottom three-step sequence converts grams to moles of a compound converts moles of a compound to moles of an individual element within that compound and then back to grams using the periodic table okay with answered part a let's take a look at part b of this question we talked about carbon part b is let's talk about the mass of hydrogen present so again we're not using 5.00 grams in our calculation we're going to go ahead and figure out how much water was produced so 6.00 grams of water is produced and again the molar mass of water as you i'm sure already know would be just two hydrogens and one oxygen so 18.016 that is the molar mass of water so how much hydrogen is present in water is going to be part of our calculation if i write down 6.00 grams of water which i got from the table that i was given and i want to convert grams of h2o into grams of h so watch how i do that again be careful that you don't miss an important step so how much hydrogen is present in water looks like this so in the previous example it was 12.01 for carbon and 44.01 for co2 but within the water molecule within the water formula there's two h's in that formula so that's why this ratio is not 1.00 it's the total mass of hydrogen in the formula h2o if i do that math i get again i'm not going to round this off too much i'll say at least three sig figs so 0.671 grams of hydrogen if you would rather first convert grams to moles you could do that again grams to moles is a good first step but then we have to remember that there are two moles of hydrogen atoms for every one mole of water molecules and then if i go to grams of hydrogen that would be 1.008 grams of h per mole i'm still gonna get the same answer i'm gonna get 0.671 but if you prefer that bottom three-step sequence if that makes more conceptual sense to you to go grams to moles and then remember that there are two h's in every h2o then you're gonna get the exact same answer okay so let's move on to part c we've got the grams of carbon the grams of hydrogen let's see what it says in part c determine the mass of oxygen present in 5.00 grams of the compound so at the top of the slide you can see that the answer to part a was 2.999 grams of carbon and the answer to part b is 0.671 grams of hydrogen well there's a 5 gram sample 5.00 gram sample of a compound that contains three different elements c h and o we already know the mass of c and h so all we really have to do is subtract the answers from part a and b from the total mass of the compound the 5.00 and if we do that math so 5.00 minus 2.999 minus 0.671 when you add and subtract measurements we go with the least number of decimal places so i'm going to go ahead and with two decimal places i'm going to call that 1.33 grams of oxygen and again that's coming from just subtracting the answer to part a and b from the total mass of the sample that was burned all right almost done part d will be the traditional empirical formula calculation that you've seen before we're going to convert the grams of each element into moles so based on my answers to part a b and c i have 2.999 grams of carbon 0.671 grams of hydrogen and 1.33 grams of oxygen let's convert each of these elements from grams to moles as you've seen before so divide by either 12.01 or 1.008 or 16.00 so this is my calculation of moles of carbon so that's 0.2497 moles of carbon and then let's move on to the hydrogen let's convert from grams to moles so 0.671 grams of hydrogen divide by the molar mass of h 0.666 moles of hydrogen of h and then finally with the oxygen 1.33 grams of o divide by the molar mass of o 16.00 do that math and we get 0.0831 moles of o so now we have moles of c moles of h and moles of o to get the empirical formula we're going to divide each of these mole values by the smallest value and let's see what happens so divide by point zero eight three one for carbon we get three divide by point .0831 for hydrogen we get eight and obviously dividing by itself we get one so three eight and one those are the subscripts in the empirical formula so the empirical formula of this compound is c3 h8 o okay the last three problems in this packet have to do with ratios of moles but not exactly from element to element but involving water so it says another type of situation that involves mass and mole ratios involves a substance that is known as a hydrate a hydrate is a substance in which water molecules are included in the chemical formula these substances are often ionic compounds in which water molecules are bonded to the ions in the crystal structure so a hydrate salt can be heated to remove the water through evaporation and then you would form what is known as an anhydrous salt where the word anhydrous just means without water so here you can see in the table on the left two examples of anhydrous salts so we have copper roman numeral two sulfate cuso4 and then calcium chloride cacl2 on the right we see examples of hydrate salts of these compounds so copper roman numeral 2 sulfate pentahydrate so there are 5 moles of water for every 1 mole of cuso4 calcium chloride dihydrate there are two moles of water for every one mole of cacl2 so that dot just indicates that the water is coordinated and included in the chemical formula but that dot does not mean to multiply it just means that there are five or in this case two five additional moles of water are included in the chemical formula so let's see how we can take a look at some example problems that involve hydrates number 20 a sample of this copper roman numeral two sulfate pentahydrate cus04.5 h2o has a mass of 25.00 grams part a calculate the mass of cuso4 present in this 25.00 gram sample so how much cuso4 is present is going to be a number that is less than 25 grams because it's going to include both the cuso4 and the water so how much cuso4 is present well let me go ahead and start writing down the molar mass calculations so on the periodic table the atomic mass of copper 63.55 atomic mass of sulfur 32.06 atomic mass of oxygen 16.00 and there are four of them so 159.61 that's the molar mass of the anhydrous form of this compound without the water if i take 159.61 and then i add 5 moles of water to that calculation so 18.016 that's the molar mass of water h2o times 5 because there are 5 moles of water in the formula for the hydrate i get a number which is 249.69 that's the molar mass of the copper sulfate pentahydrate compound so 25.00 grams of this hydrated compound if i want to convert that to grams of just cuso4 i can use the numbers that are right here on the slide so 159.61 grams of just cus 04 for every 249.69 grams of the entire hydrate compound so that ratio will be set up as a conversion factor so i can get grams of cuso4 and i do that math and i get rounding off to four significant figures here 15.98 grams of just cos 04 without the water all right part b of this question calculate the mass of water present in this 25.00 gram sample well again it should be a number that's less than 25 grams so based on the same calculation i did for part a there's 159.61 grams of cuso4 for every 249.69 grams of the total hydrate compound what about the water well the water would be 18.016 times five that's how much water is present in the entire compound so 18.016 times 5 would give me the grams of water and then the 249.69 is the total molar mass of the hydrated compound so that math as a conversion factor would give me grams of water in my answer and i get approximately 9.02 or 9.019 so you might be thinking well did i really have to do that kind of calculation in part b if i already knew in part a that there was 15.98 grams of copper sulfate cuso4 couldn't i just subtract that from 25 and the answer is yes so another way perhaps a much easier way to calculate the answer to part b is just to subtract your answer to part a from the total mass of the sample so 25 minus 15.98 gives me the mass of water and 9.02 grams okay let's take a look at number 21. we're still talking about a hydrate compound but this time it's not the copper sulfate compound it's a calcium chloride compound this is calcium chloride dihydrate calculate the percentage of water by mass in this count calcium chloride dihydrate cacl2.2h2o well let's go to the periodic table calcium has an atomic mass of 40.08 chlorine has an atomic mass of 35.45 and there are two of them so just that math would give me 110.98 it's the molar mass of the anhydrous calcium chloride water has a molar mass of 18.016 and there are two of them in the chemical formula so grand total 110.98 plus the two moles of water is 147.012 grams per mole so the percentage of water by mass would be the mass of water divided by the total mass of the hydrate compound so we have 18.016 times 2 for the total mass of water within this compound and 147.012 for the total mass of the entire hydrate compound so that ratio times 100 would give us the percentage of water by mass if you do this math you get 24.51 percent water by mass all right on to number 22. we are given a data table it says in a certain experiment a sample of a hydrate of magnesium sulfate the formula for magnesium sulfate is mgso4 and then since we don't know exactly what the formula of the hydrate compound is we have dot n h2o where n is going to be a whole number it's going to be one two three four five etc that compound the hydrate is heated in order to remove all of the water from the sample so the empty container is 25.356 grams then they put the hydrate salt in that container and it weighs 28.418 grams before it's heated and then they heated it to evaporate all of the water from the hydrate sample and they heated it three times and the mass of the container and the sample after each heating is recorded in the table eventually once all of the water has been removed then we have mgso4 the anhydrous salt so let's take a look at the different parts of this question part a explain how the data indicates that all of the water has been removed from the hydrate salt in this experiment so notice that the mass is going down after each heating well take a look closely at the data after the second and the third heating and what you'll notice is that they are essentially the same number they're only different by .001 grams so at that point we can assume that all of the water has been removed if you take a look at the third heating which is again for the precision of the scale is essentially the same number it's only different by .001 grams because the mass does not change significantly between the second heating and the third heating as in like those values are essentially the same now we can assume that the mass is constant the mass is not changing so therefore all of the water must have been removed in this experiment all right let's take a look at part b calculate the mass of the hydrate salt that was used in this experiment so that would be the difference between the first two values in the table 28.418 is the mass of the container and the hydrate salt before it was heated 25.356 is the mass of the empty container so that difference in grams 3.062 that's the mass of the hydrate salt all right let's take a look at part c calculate the mass of water that was removed from the hydrate sample in this experiment so the mass of the container and the hydrate salt before heating was 28.418 grams and at the end of the experiment after all of the water was removed the mass of the container in the sample was 26.852 grams so that difference in mass represents how much water was lost from evaporation and that would be 1.566 grams of water all right let's take a look at part d determine the value of n in the formula mgso4 dot nh2o so n represents the ratio of moles of water to moles of mgso4 that means we're going to need to take our answers that we have so far in our data table and turn grams into moles for the chemical substances involved here so how many moles of water and how many moles of mgso4 that's what we're looking at so the mgso4 the anhydrous salt would be the difference between our answers to b and c 1.496 grams or you could get it directly from the table and you could say well at the end of the experiment the mass was 26.852 [Music] just subtract the empty container and that difference 25.356 subtracted from 26.852 you would get the same answer so now we know how many grams of mgso4 are present at the end of the experiment the anhydrous mgso4 let's turn that number into moles so the value of n represents a mole ratio of moles of water divided by moles of this anhydrous salt so using the periodic table 1.496 grams of mgso4 let's turn that into moles so divide by the molar mass 120.36 and we get notice how i'm not going to round this off too much so 0.01 0.012 it's better to have some extra precision in your calculations at this point so i'm not gonna be tempted to call that point zero one definitely not point zero one two i'm gonna keep going so there's my number of moles and then for the water 1.566 grams of water divided by its molar mass again i'm not gonna round that off to point zero nine see i might think the ratio is nine to one if i said .01 and .09 but that's incorrect so better to have some extra precision in your values especially when you're in the middle of a calculation so how am i going to get my answer for the value of n it's a mole ratio so we're going to take moles of water so 0.08692 divided by moles of the anhydrous salt .01243 let's see what we get on the calculator and we get 7. so the answer to this particular question the value of n is 7 and if you wanted to write the formula of the hydrate mgs04.c h2o this would be called magnesium sulfate heptahydrate if you were curious it's also found in epsom salts which are kind of an over the counter remedy for like soaking sore muscles things like that okay so seven was the answer to part d and i believe that this particular part of this question represents the last question in the packet so again i hope

is entitled atomic structure and properties and in this particular video we'll take a look at topic 1.1 moles and molar mass topic 1.2 mass spectroscopy also known as spectrometry of elements and topic 1.3 elemental composition of pure substances in the video description area there should be a link to the ap chemistry course and exam description and there also should be a link to this particular packet that goes along with the video all right topic 1.1 moles and molar mass so here are some essential knowledge statements that come from the ap chemistry course and exam description one cannot count particles directly while performing laboratory work thus there must be a connection between the masses of substances reacting and the actual number of particles undergoing chemical changes avogadro's number 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd particles per mole provides the connection between the number of moles in a pure sample of a substance and the number of constituent particles or formula units of that substance expressing the mass of an individual atom or molecule in atomic mass units amu is useful because the average mass in amu of one particle atom or molecule or formula unit of a substance will always be numerically equal to the molar mass of that substance in grams thus there is a quantitative connection between the mass of a substance and the number of particles that the substance contains so here are three substances magnesium mg carbon dioxide co2 and sodium chloride nacl the particles of a substance can be described as atoms molecules or formula units as shown in the following examples the molar mass of a substance can be determined or calculated from the atomic mass values on the periodic table so if you look on your periodic table and you find the elemental symbol for magnesium mg you could say that a single atom of magnesium would weigh 24.30 amu or atomic mass units but once i change that to mole a mole of magnesium weighs 24.30 grams and it contains avogadro's number of atoms a mole of carbon dioxide if you add up the atomic mass of one carbon and two oxygens the molar mass of co2 is 44.01 grams and that would contain avogadro's number of molecules again referring to co2 as molecules that is a covalent substance whereas since sodium chloride is not covalent but rather ionic its fundamental building blocks or particles is not considered a molecule but rather a formula unit so one mole of sodium chloride would have a molar mass from the periodic table when you add up the atomic masses of sodium and chlorine 58.44 grams per mole and again would contain avogadro's number of formula units okay let's take a look at some practice problems so here we have two problems one of them says to calculate the mass in grams of 0.08 moles of something called barium hydroxide ba parentheses oh2 and then the other problem says to calculate the number of moles of c4h10 that are present in 2.00 grams of c4h10 so we are going to need to use the periodic table to do these calculations so starting with number one i have to go find barium oxygen and hydrogen on the periodic table so i can calculate the molar mass so there are those three particular elements and again let's go ahead and do that math to calculate the molar mass so for barium hydroxide ba parentheses oh2 the total of the barium and the two oxygens and the two hydrogens added together is 171.346 grams per mole so we'll start with the number of moles and then we'll set up a conversion factor that will put mole on the bottom since that's the unit we're trying to cancel out and grams on the top so that would be like this 171.346 grams of barium hydroxide for every one mole if we do that math on our calculator we get 14 point again you can see several significant digits there five six four four one so how do we round off our final answer in this case we go with the measurement that we were given so 0.0850 has three significant figures so we're going to round off our final answer to three significant figures and that would look like 14.6 grams in our next problem we're essentially doing the reverse of what we just did in number one so instead of going from moles to grams we're going to go from grams to moles so we start off with calculating the molar mass of c4h10 again this comes from the periodic table so carbon has an atomic mass of 12.01 and there are four carbons in the formula hydrogen is 1.008 and there are 10 of those so 58.12 grams per mole that's my molar mass of c4h10 i write down the number i was given so 2.00 grams of c4h10 and now i want to put grams on the bottom and moles on top so i use my molar mass as a conversion factor to go from grams to moles i do that math on my calculator again i get a long number and i'm not sure let's say how to round it off until i look at the measurement that i was given so 2.00 grams has three significant figures so we're going to round off our final answer to three significant figures which would be written as 0.0344 moles of c4h10 okay let's take a look at our next two problems number three calculate the number of atoms of silicon si that are present in 35.0 moles of silicon and then number four calculate the number of moles of o3 which is ozone that are present in 4.3 times 10 to the 24 molecules of ozone so number three we are going from atoms to moles and in number four we're going from moles to molecules so because we're talking about a conversion factor that goes between number of moles and number of particles we need avogadro's number but we in fact do not need to use the periodic table because we're not converting from grams to moles like we were in the previous or moles of grams okay so in this particular set of problems we're just going to use avogadro's number so number three we write down 35.0 moles of silicon put moles on the bottom and in this case atoms are the particles so atoms on top so there's avogadro's number the number of atoms or particles in one mole we do that math and again rounding this particular number off to the number of sig figs that we need in this case 35.0 has three significant figures so that number will be expressed with three significant figures as 2.11 times 10 to the 25th power and then number four we start with our number of particles in this case molecules of ozone o3 we want to put particles on the bottom and moles on top so avogadro's number of molecules of ozone on the bottom and then one mole of ozone on the top we do this math by again doing division like in the last problem we were multiplying the avogadro's number now we're dividing by avogadro's number and again on our calculator we get this long number let's round it off based on the number we're given in this case 4.3 has only two significant figures so our final answer is written as 7.1 moles of ozone o3 all right let's take a look at the next two questions number five calculate the mass in grams of 8.2 times 10 to the 22nd molecules of chcl3 and the number six calculate the number of formula units of na2so4 present in 0.248 grams of that substance so number five we know that when we use a conversion involving avogadro's number that's going to be between moles and particles or vice versa so we're definitely going to need avogadro's number but since the final answer is in grams we also need the periodic table and the calculated value for the molar mass to go between moles and grams and so i'm going to write the calculation for the molar mass of chcl so the atomic mass of carbon hydrogen and chlorine are what you see here so 12.01 1.008 and 35.45 now there are three chlorines in the formula that's why that's times three so 119.368 grams per mole that's the molar mass of chcl3 we're also going to need to use avogadro's number so here we have the given information 8.2 times 10 to the 22nd molecules of this substance chcl3 let's put molecules on the bottom and moles on top again using avogadro's number so avogadro's number on the bottom number of molecules in one mole and then let's use the molar mass that's going to be grams on top and then one mole on the bottom so here we pick up our calculator and we divide by avogadro's number we multiply by 119.368 and then we get this number on our calculator which if we round this off to two significant figures based on the 8.2 having two significant figures we're going to write this as not 16.2 or 16.3 but rather just 16 again two significant figures to match the value that we're given so i'm not going to be limited by avogadro's number or the molar mass from the periodic table those are not going to limit my significant figures in my answer but the number i was given in the problem that number has a certain number of significant figures that limits my answer all right on to number six molar mass for na2so4 again based on the atomic masses of sodium sulfur and oxygen so if i do that math 22.99 that's the atomic mass of sodium 32.06 the atomic mass of sulfur and then 16 the atomic mass of oxygen times 4. so we do all of that and we get 142.04 grams per mole that's the molar mass of na2so4 we'll start with the number we're given so 0.248 we're going to go from grams to moles so grams on the bottom one mole on top so there's the molar mass using that as a conversion factor and then now it's time to incorporate avogadro's number in our calculation so that would be one mole on the bottom and avogadro's number of particles in this case formula units on the top so if we divide by the molar mass multiplied by avogadro's number we get a number that needs to be rounded in this case 0.248 was the number we're given that's the measurement that has three significant figures so 0.248 three significant figures let's round off our final answer to 1.05 times 10 to the 21st formula units of na2so4 all right now we are going to move on to topic 1.2 mass spectroscopy of elements again also known as mass spectrometry and here are two essential knowledge statements from the ap chemistry course and exam description the mass spectrum of a sample containing a single element can be used to determine the identity of the isotopes of that element and the relative abundance of each isotope in nature the average atomic mass of an element can be estimated from the weighted average of the isotopic masses using the mass of each isotope and its relative abundance so in this first example for number seven from your packet we're looking at chlorine and on the left we see that there are two isotopes of chlorine so chlorine with a mass number of 35 and chlorine with a mass number of 37. the abundance that's like the percentage of that particular element as it would appear in a sample naturally 75.8 percent chlorine 35 24.2 chlorine 37. so on the right we're seeing a mass spectrum and again this particular diagram shows two bars so one on the x-axis at atomic mass or mass number of 35 for the chlorine-35 isotope and then a smaller bar on the x-axis you can see that's 37 so again mass number 37 on the y-axis we see percent abundance so number seven part a calculate the average atomic mass of cl so based on this information that would be to calculate the weighted average so the weighted average means we're going to multiply each mass number by its percent abundance that is written as a decimal so 35 times 0.758 plus 37 times 0.242 so that's the weighted average that we get from this data and our calculator would give us an answer of approximately 35.5 in part b of this question we're given a table with chlorine 35 and chlorine 37 and we're asked to fill in the number of protons and neutrons so if we take a look at the periodic table we can see that chlorine does in fact have an atomic mass that is approximately 35.5 so that answer to part a makes sense and we can see atomic number 17 that refers to the number of protons in the nucleus of chlorine so 17 protons for each isotope protons plus neutrons will give us the mass number so 17 plus 18 is 35 or you could do 35 minus 17 equals 18 and then 17 plus 20 equals 37. all right let's take a look at number eight so we're looking at a different element that says not chlorine you can see along the x-axis we have a mass number of either 121 or 123 and along the y-axis for the percent abundance you can see written above each bar 57.4 percent for the mass number 121 and 42.6 percent for the abundance of mass number 123. so to calculate the average atomic mass of this particular element we're going to do just like we did before take the mass number times the percent abundance that is written as a decimal so 121 times 0.574 plus 123 times 0.426 so we do that math and we get approximately 121.9 now to look on the periodic table to figure out what is the most likely identity of this element it's okay if the atomic mass of the element is not exactly 121.9 but is very close to that value let's take a look so again tin sn is only 118.71 so that's too small tellurium te is 127.60 that's too big so the only element that this could represent is atomic number 51 antimony sb with an atomic mass of 121.76 again that's the closest to the value that we calculated in part a so again to part b what is the most likely identity of this element it is going to be antimony element symbol sb okay let's take a look at number nine so we have a mass spectrum with mass numbers of 79 and 81 and we have the percent abundances that are listed so now we're not going to actually need to calculate the average atomic mass in this particular problem they come right out with what is the most likely identity of this element so if we look at the periodic table we're looking for an element that has an atomic mass that falls somewhere between 79 and 81. again these are almost exactly a 50 50 mixture of these two isotopes so should be pretty close to 80 for the atomic mass which would be the average of 79 and 81. let's take a look in the periodic table so selenium se has an average atomic mass of 78.97 so that's too small krypton kr is going to be about 83.80 that's too large so the only element that has an atomic mass that falls between 79 and 81 is bromine br and its atomic mass is 79.90 so bromine has 35 protons in its nucleus and has an average mass atomic mass of 79.90 so bromine is the answer to part a and then for part b again bromine has 35 protons in its nucleus so mass number minus atomic number would give us the number of neutrons so 79 minus 35 is 44 and 81 minus 35 is 46. so again 35 protons and 44 or 46 neutrons for the two isotopes of bromine okay moving on to number 10 this time we don't actually have a mass spectrum to look at but we are told that a certain element has two naturally occurring isotopes with mass numbers of 63 and 65 what is the most likely identity of this element let's take a look at the periodic table and see if we can find an element whose atomic mass falls between 63 and 65. nickel is around 58.69 zinc is around 65.38 so copper element cu the only one that would fall in that range between 63 and 65. so 63.55 is the average atomic mass of copper cu now to fill in the table with protons and neutrons again on the periodic table we know that copper has 29 protons in the nucleus again that would be the atomic number of copper 29 and then since the protons plus the neutrons equals the mass number 63 minus 29 will give us the number of neutrons and again that's either 34 or 36 for the number of neutrons again these are the number of neutrons so 29 plus 34 equals 63 29 plus 36 equals 65. now again we're not looking at a mass spectrum so we don't know the percent abundance of these two isotopes of copper so part c of this question which isotope of this element mass number 63 or mass number 65 is more abundant in nature justify your answer so on the periodic table the average atomic mass of copper is 63.55 so the isotope with mass number 63 should be more abundant in nature because the average the weighted average 63.55 is closer in value to 63 than it is to 65. so for example if it had been exactly a 50 50 mixture of these two isotopes then the average of 63 and 65 just a straight up average would be 64. since 63.55 is closer to the number 63 that means that the isotope with mass number 63 is more abundant okay let's take a look at number 11. so so far in the examples that i'm showing you for a mass spectrum it's been really simple in that there's only been two naturally occurring isotopes of the elements in the examples you've seen so far so what i wanted to do here with this example is to indicate that the process the calculation of the average atomic mass it can be a bit more complicated it's still the same principle but you just have more numbers to enter into your calculator so here number 11 if an element has several naturally occurring isotopes then here's how you would do the calculation part a based on the information above estimate the average atomic mass of the element to the nearest whole number and then use a calculator to determine the average atomic mass so if i had to estimate this it looks like it's going to be anywhere between 154 and 160 according to the data that we have for six different isotopes of this particular element so where would the average fall where would the weighted average fall looks like 154 is a very small amount it's about 2 percent and then all of the other isotopes are somewhere between 15 and about 22 25 so i'm going to estimate again just a rough estimate that the average atomic mass is probably somewhere around the middle like maybe around 157 or so so you might estimate that the average atomic mass of this particular element is approximately 157. let's go ahead and do the math so to do the math we're going to take the mass number times the percent abundance written as a decimal so it looks like this 154 times 0.0218 plus 155 times 0.1480 and then you just keep going 156 times its percent abundance as a decimal 157 158 160. so all of that into my calculator gives me an answer of four 157.0241 so again approximately 157 point zero two what is the most likely identity of this element again let's look on the periodic table and see can we find an element that has an average atomic mass that is approximately 157 so down there in the lanthanide series of the periodic table the elements between atomic number 58 cerium and atomic number 71 lutesium we see that an element with a symbol gd which is gadolinium has an atomic mass of 157.25 so that's going to be the most likely identity of this particular element so gadolinium gd with atomic mass 157.25 okay well moving on to our next topic the last topic in this particular video topic 1.3 elemental composition of pure substances so here are some essential knowledge statements from the ap chemistry course and exam description some pure substances are composed of individual molecules while others consist of atoms or ions held together in fixed proportions as described by a formula unit according to the law of definite proportions the ratio of the masses of the constituent elements in any pure sample of that compound is always the same the chemical formula that lists the lowest whole number ratio of atoms of the elements in a compound is the empirical formula so let's take a look at our first question here number 12. calculate the percent composition by mass of each element in glucose c6h12o6 so what you're doing here is you're using the skill that you already have acquired from topic 1.1 about calculating the molar mass so the molar mass of glucose c6h12o6 would be the atomic mass of carbon 12.01 times 6 the atomic mass of hydrogen 1.008 times and the atomic mass of oxygen 16.00 times 6. so grand total molar mass or formula mass is 180.156 in the case of the molar mass that would be grams per mole if this were a single molecule of glucose you could say amu or atomic mass units but the percent composition by mass what that means is that we have to take the part divided by the whole for each element in this particular compound so the percentage of carbon by mass the percentage of hydrogen by mass the percentage of oxygen by mass so for the percent carbon by mass that would be 12.01 times six that's the total mass of carbon and then divided by the formula mass or the molar mass 180.156 times 100 to convert that to a percent and we do that math and we get 40.00 percent carbon by mass now we look at hydrogen and then oxygen so for hydrogen it would be 1.008 times 12 that's the total mass of hydrogen in one unit of glucose again divided by the total mass times 100 6.71 hydrogen by mass and then for oxygen 16.00 times 6 that's the total mass of oxygen within the formula glucose divided by the total mass times 100 and we get 53.29 percent oxygen by mass so no matter where i get glucose a pure sample of glucose from any source should have these same percentages of carbon hydrogen and oxygen by mass so the law of definite proportion or constant composition says that glucose will always have these particular percentages of carbon hydrogen and oxygen any pure sample of glucose has that so moving on to number 13 in the packet now we have a different compound which is called erythrose and its chemical formula is c4h8o4 let's go ahead and do the same process that we did in number 12 for glucose so the total mass of erythros from the periodic table so four carbons eight hydrogens and four oxygens is 120.104 grams per mole or you could say amu's if you were talking about a single molecule of erythrose let's break it down for carbon hydrogen and oxygen just like we did in number 12. mass of carbon so 12.01 times 4 divided by the total mass 120 120.104 times 100. interestingly enough we get the exact same percentage of carbon that we did in number 12. and so you're going to see a little deja vu now we do the percentage of hydrogen by mass in this compound so 1.008 times 8 total mass of hydrogen divided by total mass of erythros again that number should be familiar six point seven one percent hydrogen by mass and then finally with oxygen total mass of oxygen sixteen point zero zero times four divided by the total mass of erythros times a hundred fifty three point two nine percent oxygen by mass so if you're wondering why i chose the compounds in number 12 and number 13 there was a particular point that i wanted to make with these two compounds glucose and erythros and that is summarized by the work you're doing in number 14. so the empirical formula is going to be the simplest whole number ratio so when we take glucose c6h and we divide each of those subscripts by the greatest common factor in this case 6 we get c1h2o1 now even though erythrose is a very different chemical with different properties different formula when we take c4h8o4 and we divide each of those subscripts by the greatest common factor in this case four we get the exact same empirical formula so the point that i wanted to make is that we have two different compounds but because they have the same empirical formula then they are going to lead to a calculation that will give you the same percent composition by mass all right let's move on to number 15 in the packet now in this particular question we're actually going to go in the opposite direction so instead of being given a chemical formula and then calculating the percent composition by mass in number 15 we are told what the percent composition by mass is and we have to figure out the chemical formula specifically the empirical formula the one that has the lowest whole number ratio of elements so this is phosphorus and oxygen 43.64 phosphorus by mass 56.36 oxygen by mass so a good first step in this particular problem is to assume that the mass of this sample this compound that contains phosphorus and oxygen is 100 grams that way since a percentage is based on 100 we can just simply write down the number of grams of each element so we have 43.64 grams of the element phosphorus and we have 56.36 grams of the element oxygen well as you learned in topic 1.1 you can use the periodic table to go from grams to moles and so we have grams right now let's convert grams into moles because that way the mole ratio will give us the information that we need about the chemical formula so let's take the periodic table which has for phosphorous an atomic mass of 30.97 let's use that number to go from grams to moles now at this point i'm going to write that number down on my calculator i don't want to round it off to just 1 or 1.4 or even 1.41 it's actually better in calculations like this where you're trying to figure out the empirical formula it's better if you have extra digits on your calculator you want to really resist the temptation to start rounding these numbers off or not writing down the full number so i chose four significant figures in this problem the reason why you don't want to round it off too much is because you're looking for a ratio of moles of one element to the other and the more you round off your numbers the less accurate your values will be when you're trying to find that mole ratio so it's better to have extra precision in your answers than to just cut off the number at a couple of digits all right oxygen 56.36 grams of oxygen you might be wondering if you have good chemistry knowledge about oxygen being a diatomic element right we normally write oxygen as o2 you might be wondering do we have to use o2 in our calculations and the answer is no we're looking for individual ratios of elements o2 is a molecule it's not an individual atom so therefore it would be a single o so on the periodic table i'm going to write 16.00 i'm not going to write 32 because we're not talking about molecules of o2 we're talking about individual atoms of phosphorus and oxygen in this particular unknown compound so again be careful when you're going from grams to moles of individual elements that you ignore any elements that might be diatomic because in this particular case it's individual atoms not diatomic molecules all right i do this math 56.36 divided by 16 and i get again look at me not rounding off this answer too much i'm not going to call it 4 or 3.5 so i went ahead and chose 4 significant figures okay what do we do next to get the empirical formula of this compound we're looking for a simple whole number ratio between the moles of phosphorus and the moles of oxygen so how do we do that well because it's based on a simple whole number ratio of moles we're going to go ahead and take these two values of moles and we're going to divide them by the smaller of the two values so 1.409 divided by itself will give us 1 and 3.523 divided by 1.409 if you do that math on your calculator you get 2.50 so again now do we have simple whole numbers no we're not going to take 2.5 and just round it up to 3. what we have to do is take this empirical formula which again this is not correct and we're going to try to get simple whole numbers from the numbers that we have right now so instead of saying 1 and 2.5 let's just go ahead and double these values that way it keeps the ratio the same but we turn a 1 into a 2 and a 2.5 into a 5. so by doubling the ratio of 1 and 2.5 we get 2 and 5. and then that's it that's our empirical formula p2o5 is the empirical formula of this particular compound all right so to go ahead and summarize the procedure that we used in number 15 of this packet if you are given percent composition by mass or mass data for a certain compound so grams of each element the following procedure will help you to determine the empirical formula of the compound convert the grams or the mass of each element into moles again that would involve the periodic table then now that you have moles of each element divide each value of moles by the lowest value the lowest number now at this point you may already have whole numbers based on that step in the procedure but if not if you have numbers that end in 0.5 like we just saw in the last example then you could multiply by 2. or if for example your number of moles they end with .33 or .66 or 0.67 you may have to multiply by 3 to turn those values into whole numbers so again be careful with your data don't round off your numbers too early in the calculation as i said before but then whatever whole numbers you get those whole number values of moles then they will be used in the subscripts to write the empirical formula of that compound okay here's our next problem number 16. we are given the percentage by mass for the elements carbon hydrogen and oxygen let's convert each of these numbers from grams into moles so we'll assume that we have a hundred grams of this particular compound and that way the percentages can just be written as grams so we have grams of carbon let's divide that number by the molar mass of carbon which would be 12.01 we're converting from grams to moles again i'm not going to round that number off to four or 4.3 so i wrote that number with four significant figures a little extra precision is a good thing in the early stage of the calculation now we have the same calculation for hydrogen and for oxygen so 13.13 again this is individual elements individual atoms of hydrogen so it's not h2 it's not the diatomic molecule that we think about in terms of its substance you might have hydrogen gas for example it's h2 this is individual atoms of hydrogen so divided by 1.008 that came from the periodic table 13.03 i'm using the atomic masses for each element as the molar mass of each element so 34.73 grams of oxygen again not divided by 32 but 16. so individual molar masses of these elements with no subscripts so now i'm staring at three numbers which are 4.31 sorry 4.341 moles of carbon 13.03 moles of hydrogen and 2.171 moles of oxygen so the next step in the procedure is to find the lowest value in this case 2.171 and we're going to go ahead and divide each of these values of moles by the smallest value so divided by 2.171 we get 2 divided by 2.171 we get 6 and obviously divided by itself we get 1. so those values 2 6 and 1 are already whole numbers there's no extra step of multiplying by 2 or 3. so what i have right now is an empirical formula c2 h6 and then o1 or just o the one is understood as a subscript okay so our empirical formula was c2h6o let's move on to number 17 in the packet a pure sample of tin so elemental symbol sn with a mass of 6.18 grams is burned in air until the tin is completely converted into a tin oxide so a tin oxide compound would contain both tin and oxygen the mass of the tin oxide is equal to 7.85 grams determine the empirical formula of this tin oxide compound so we start with 6.18 grams of tin it is burned in the air which means it's going to react with oxygen in the air and it produces 7.85 grams of tin oxide now i'm not writing a balanced chemical equation for this process i'm writing the elements in words because we don't know the exact formula of the tin oxide so therefore even though i know that tin is sn i know that oxygen gas is written as o2 i don't know what the chemical formula of this particular tin oxide compound is so the difference in mass between 7.85 grams and 6.18 grams that difference is 1.67 grams that's how much oxygen reacted with the tin in this experiment so while this looks like a different problem in the previous examples we had the percentage of each element by mass so percent composition now that we know from processing this information that we have grams of tin sn and then grams of oxygen in this case i'm going to write this as individual atoms of o we can go ahead and convert grams to moles like we have been doing in the other problems number 15 and 16. so grams of tin 6.18 grams divided by the atomic mass of tin on the periodic table 118.71 that gives me the number of moles of tin again i'm going to try to keep a little extra precision so i'm not going to write 0.05 or 0.052 i went ahead and i chose three significant figures here but if you had four or five significant figures that would be fine too again a little extra precision is fine in this stage of the calculation but don't round off your numbers because you might throw away important precision that will help you get to those simple whole number ratios of moles again like i said in the previous examples we have individual oxygen so yes there is oxygen in the air which is o2 but i want to know the ratio of atoms of tin to atoms of oxygen in this particular compound so that's why i'm not dividing by 32 i'm not talking about o2 i'm talking about individual atoms of o within this tin oxide compound so 1.67 divided by the atomic mass of o 16.00 again i'm not going to call that 0.1 i'm going to call that .104 so at least three significant figures so what's the next step in the process we have moles of 10 and moles of oxygen or o divide by the lower of the two values in this case we're going to divide by .0521 so now we have a 1 for 10 and we have a 2 for oxygen so those simple whole number values now become the subscripts so our chemical formula of this tin oxide compound from our data and our calculations is sno2 all right let's move on to number 18. number 18 starts off looking very similar to the other types of problems where we're trying to figure out the empirical formula of an unknown compound but then there's a little bit of a twist in parts b and c of this question where we actually make the connection between the empirical formula and the molecular formula of a compound okay so part a determine the empirical formula of compound x so we know that compound x consists of the elements carbon hydrogen and nitrogen we have a 15.00 gram sample of this compound and if you break it down by grams of each element we have 9.81 grams of carbon 1.37 grams of hydrogen and 3.82 grams of nitrogen so procedure is going to look like the previous problems where we have grams of each element let's go from grams to moles so divide by the molar mass of carbon which would be 12.01 and i'm going to write this number down as moles of carbon again i'm not rounding too much so i have three significant figures 0.817 moles of carbon moving on for hydrogen 1.37 divide by the atomic mass or the molar mass of h so 1.008 from the periodic table and i get 1.36 moles of hydrogen again not h2 just h and then for nitrogen again nitrogen is a diatomic element but in this case we're talking about individual atoms of c h and n so i'm not going to divide by 28.02 but rather 14.01 the atomic mass or the molar mass of individual n so ch and n this again that number gives me if i do that math 0.273 so i kept some precision at least three significant figures in my number of moles which of these three values is the smallest so 0.273 so i'm going to divide each of these value of moles by the smallest value so divide .817 by 0.273 and i get 3. and then for hydrogen i divide by 0.273 and i get 5 and obviously divide it by itself is 1. so 3 5 and 1 those are my subscripts in the empirical formula c3 h5n now the empirical formula is not necessarily the same as the molecular formula so in part c of this question we're going to have to get the molecular formula for compound x and we don't know what that is yet but we do know that the empirical formula which is the lowest simple whole number ratio of moles is c3h5n let's move on to part b of this question in part b it is determined that a 25.0 gram sample of compound x contains 9.11 times 10 to the 22nd molecules calculate the molar mass of compound x in units of grams per mole now you might be thinking molar mass don't we already know the chemical formula c3h5n well again that's the empirical formula which is not necessarily the same as the molecular formula so at this point we're not using our answer to part a to do this calculation we're given grams and molecules so i'm going to go ahead and write down the numbers i'm given which is 25 grams 25.0 grams and 9.11 times 10 to the 22nd molecules now what i did in starting this particular problem or setting up the calculation is i put grams on the top and i put molecules on the bottom if i'm paying close attention to what they're looking for molar mass is not grams per molecule but rather grams per mole so what i'm thinking is that i would like there to be a conversion factor that changes grams per molecule into grams per mole i don't want the grams to go away in fact i want the grams to stay exactly where they are but i would like to get rid of the molecules i would like to get rid of the molecules and replace that with per mole so i want molecules to go on top and i want moles to go on the bottom now is the time for avogadro's number as you've already learned there are avagadra's numbers 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd particles in this case molecules of a substance in one mole of that substance so if i do this calculation 25 divided by 9.11 times 10 to the 22nd times 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd i get on my calculator approximately 165 grams per mole again going with three significant figures based on the 25.0 and all the other numbers 165 grams per mole if you watching this video are thinking well is there another way to solve this problem besides the way i set it up absolutely so what you could do is you could analyze the information in part b and you could say well i don't know how to convert 25.0 grams into moles because i'm not really sure what the chemical formula again not the empirical formula but the molecular formula of compound x is so let's say for a moment we don't know what to do with 25.0 grams have we learned in chemistry how to convert molecules to moles yes absolutely so you could have written down the number of molecules and then again use avogadro's number to go from molecules to moles if i just did that i'd be dividing by avogadro's number again trying to get rid of molecules and go to moles and if i did that on my calculator 9.11 times 10 to the 22nd divided by avogadro's number i would get a value of approximately 0.151 moles but then i could go back to the 25.0 grams which i did not use yet in this calculation and i could say all right grams per mole which means grams divided by moles so 25.0 grams divided by the number of moles that i just calculated using avogadro's number if i did that math i would definitely still get the same answer that i got earlier which is 165 grams per mole so we're going to move on now to part c of this question which involves taking our answers to part a and part b and kind of putting them together in a certain way so in part a we had an empirical formula in part b we have a molar mass so in part c based on your answers to parts a and b determine the molecular formula of compound x so in part a we had an empirical formula of c3h5n again that's the simplest whole number ratio for those elements for the number of moles in part b we had approximately 165 grams per mole so how can we combine these two quantities or this information to get the molecular formula well if you take a moment and look at c3h5n that's three carbons five hydrogens and one nitrogen that number the formula mass of the empirical formula is not 165 it's about 55 55.08 on my calculator so how are those two numerical quantities related to each other well the ratio of the actual molecular formula which is the number of atoms of each element in that particular compound the ratio of the molecular formula to the empirical formula is going to be a whole number so for example c3h5n that's the lowest whole number ratio if i multiply it by 2 it would be c6h10 n2 but i could multiply that empirical formula by three or by four by five whatever and i would turn the empirical formula into the molecular formula so 165 is the molar mass 55 or 55.08 that is the empirical formula mass let's take the larger number divided by the smaller number and see what happens if we do that math 165 divided by 55.08 we get 3. so what does this tell us that the empirical formula should be multiplied by 3 and so 3 times 3 is 9 5 times 3 is 15 1 times 3 is 3 so the actual molecular formula is not c3h5n but rather times 3 c9 h15n3 and that would have a molar mass of 165 grams per mole so the answer to part c is c9 h15 n3 okay let's take a look at our next question so another way to determine the empirical formula of a compound instead of just being given the percent composition or the number of grams of each element in that compound is to use data from a combustion experiment now we saw this briefly with the tin converting that into the tin oxide earlier but if i take a compound that contains carbon and hydrogen and i burn it all the way to completion in the presence of excess oxygen gas then all of the carbon will be converted into carbon dioxide co2 and all of the hydrogen will combine with oxygen and convert it into h2o water so if the compound contains more than just carbon and hydrogen let's say it contains maybe nitrogen or sulfur then other gases may be formed oxides of nitrogen or oxides of sulfur so in number 19 we are given a data table and it says that there's a sample of a compound that contains carbon hydrogen and oxygen but we don't know the chemical formula of that compound all we know is it contains c h and o and it's burned completely in oxygen and o2 and it produced the sample produced 10.99 grams of carbon dioxide and it also produced 6.00 grams of water when it was burned completely so part a determine the mass of carbon present in 5.00 grams of the compound now we're not taking 5.00 grams and doing any math with that and the reason why we're not doing any math with that is because we don't know what the chemical formula is so we can't figure out how much carbon is present in 5.00 grams on its own what we are doing is looking at the co2 so to remind you on the periodic table the molar mass of co2 as calculated from the atomic masses of carbon and oxygen is 44.00 grams per mole so how much carbon is present in co2 that's what's going on in the calculation for part a so 10.99 grams of co2 was taken directly from the table and then now using the calculations from the periodic table i'm going to convert from grams of co2 into grams of carbon so how do i do that well at least i want to put grams of co2 on the bottom and i want to put grams of c grams of carbon on the top so this is how i did it the 44.01 that's the total mass the molar mass of co2 how much carbon is in that particular quantity is 12.01 as you can see from the calculations in the upper left corner of the slide so now i'm going to do the math of converting grams of co2 into grams of carbon so i do that math and i get approximately 3 grams i get 2.99908 i'll round that off to four significant figures at least for right now so 2.999 again i'm trying to be as precise as possible and not just cut off a number to a single significant digit so four sig figs in my mass of co2 four sig figs in my mass of carbon is there another way that i could have done this calculation that involved one mole as in converting from grams to moles absolutely we're still going to get the same answer but watch how you might have done it this way you could have taken the grams of co2 and first converted that into moles moles of co2 well the problem with just doing that much is that you have to get to grams of carbon so what might the next step be in converting moles of co2 into let's say grams of carbon as you might have done it like this there's one mole of carbon for every one mole of co2 because there are no subscripts with the carbon in this chemical formula for carbon dioxide so one mole of carbon is present in one mole of co2 now you have to go back to grams because they want the mass of carbon in grams so we could use the periodic table and write 12.01 grams of carbon per mole now it's the exact same calculation but it's in three steps so if you would prefer to do a problem a calculation like what i just showed you on the bottom part of that slide if that makes more sense to you go for it so the top version is just a ratio of grams of carbon to grams of co2 and then the bottom three-step sequence converts grams to moles of a compound converts moles of a compound to moles of an individual element within that compound and then back to grams using the periodic table okay with answered part a let's take a look at part b of this question we talked about carbon part b is let's talk about the mass of hydrogen present so again we're not using 5.00 grams in our calculation we're going to go ahead and figure out how much water was produced so 6.00 grams of water is produced and again the molar mass of water as you i'm sure already know would be just two hydrogens and one oxygen so 18.016 that is the molar mass of water so how much hydrogen is present in water is going to be part of our calculation if i write down 6.00 grams of water which i got from the table that i was given and i want to convert grams of h2o into grams of h so watch how i do that again be careful that you don't miss an important step so how much hydrogen is present in water looks like this so in the previous example it was 12.01 for carbon and 44.01 for co2 but within the water molecule within the water formula there's two h's in that formula so that's why this ratio is not 1.00 it's the total mass of hydrogen in the formula h2o if i do that math i get again i'm not going to round this off too much i'll say at least three sig figs so 0.671 grams of hydrogen if you would rather first convert grams to moles you could do that again grams to moles is a good first step but then we have to remember that there are two moles of hydrogen atoms for every one mole of water molecules and then if i go to grams of hydrogen that would be 1.008 grams of h per mole i'm still gonna get the same answer i'm gonna get 0.671 but if you prefer that bottom three-step sequence if that makes more conceptual sense to you to go grams to moles and then remember that there are two h's in every h2o then you're gonna get the exact same answer okay so let's move on to part c we've got the grams of carbon the grams of hydrogen let's see what it says in part c determine the mass of oxygen present in 5.00 grams of the compound so at the top of the slide you can see that the answer to part a was 2.999 grams of carbon and the answer to part b is 0.671 grams of hydrogen well there's a 5 gram sample 5.00 gram sample of a compound that contains three different elements c h and o we already know the mass of c and h so all we really have to do is subtract the answers from part a and b from the total mass of the compound the 5.00 and if we do that math so 5.00 minus 2.999 minus 0.671 when you add and subtract measurements we go with the least number of decimal places so i'm going to go ahead and with two decimal places i'm going to call that 1.33 grams of oxygen and again that's coming from just subtracting the answer to part a and b from the total mass of the sample that was burned all right almost done part d will be the traditional empirical formula calculation that you've seen before we're going to convert the grams of each element into moles so based on my answers to part a b and c i have 2.999 grams of carbon 0.671 grams of hydrogen and 1.33 grams of oxygen let's convert each of these elements from grams to moles as you've seen before so divide by either 12.01 or 1.008 or 16.00 so this is my calculation of moles of carbon so that's 0.2497 moles of carbon and then let's move on to the hydrogen let's convert from grams to moles so 0.671 grams of hydrogen divide by the molar mass of h 0.666 moles of hydrogen of h and then finally with the oxygen 1.33 grams of o divide by the molar mass of o 16.00 do that math and we get 0.0831 moles of o so now we have moles of c moles of h and moles of o to get the empirical formula we're going to divide each of these mole values by the smallest value and let's see what happens so divide by point zero eight three one for carbon we get three divide by point .0831 for hydrogen we get eight and obviously dividing by itself we get one so three eight and one those are the subscripts in the empirical formula so the empirical formula of this compound is c3 h8 o okay the last three problems in this packet have to do with ratios of moles but not exactly from element to element but involving water so it says another type of situation that involves mass and mole ratios involves a substance that is known as a hydrate a hydrate is a substance in which water molecules are included in the chemical formula these substances are often ionic compounds in which water molecules are bonded to the ions in the crystal structure so a hydrate salt can be heated to remove the water through evaporation and then you would form what is known as an anhydrous salt where the word anhydrous just means without water so here you can see in the table on the left two examples of anhydrous salts so we have copper roman numeral two sulfate cuso4 and then calcium chloride cacl2 on the right we see examples of hydrate salts of these compounds so copper roman numeral 2 sulfate pentahydrate so there are 5 moles of water for every 1 mole of cuso4 calcium chloride dihydrate there are two moles of water for every one mole of cacl2 so that dot just indicates that the water is coordinated and included in the chemical formula but that dot does not mean to multiply it just means that there are five or in this case two five additional moles of water are included in the chemical formula so let's see how we can take a look at some example problems that involve hydrates number 20 a sample of this copper roman numeral two sulfate pentahydrate cus04.5 h2o has a mass of 25.00 grams part a calculate the mass of cuso4 present in this 25.00 gram sample so how much cuso4 is present is going to be a number that is less than 25 grams because it's going to include both the cuso4 and the water so how much cuso4 is present well let me go ahead and start writing down the molar mass calculations so on the periodic table the atomic mass of copper 63.55 atomic mass of sulfur 32.06 atomic mass of oxygen 16.00 and there are four of them so 159.61 that's the molar mass of the anhydrous form of this compound without the water if i take 159.61 and then i add 5 moles of water to that calculation so 18.016 that's the molar mass of water h2o times 5 because there are 5 moles of water in the formula for the hydrate i get a number which is 249.69 that's the molar mass of the copper sulfate pentahydrate compound so 25.00 grams of this hydrated compound if i want to convert that to grams of just cuso4 i can use the numbers that are right here on the slide so 159.61 grams of just cus 04 for every 249.69 grams of the entire hydrate compound so that ratio will be set up as a conversion factor so i can get grams of cuso4 and i do that math and i get rounding off to four significant figures here 15.98 grams of just cos 04 without the water all right part b of this question calculate the mass of water present in this 25.00 gram sample well again it should be a number that's less than 25 grams so based on the same calculation i did for part a there's 159.61 grams of cuso4 for every 249.69 grams of the total hydrate compound what about the water well the water would be 18.016 times five that's how much water is present in the entire compound so 18.016 times 5 would give me the grams of water and then the 249.69 is the total molar mass of the hydrated compound so that math as a conversion factor would give me grams of water in my answer and i get approximately 9.02 or 9.019 so you might be thinking well did i really have to do that kind of calculation in part b if i already knew in part a that there was 15.98 grams of copper sulfate cuso4 couldn't i just subtract that from 25 and the answer is yes so another way perhaps a much easier way to calculate the answer to part b is just to subtract your answer to part a from the total mass of the sample so 25 minus 15.98 gives me the mass of water and 9.02 grams okay let's take a look at number 21. we're still talking about a hydrate compound but this time it's not the copper sulfate compound it's a calcium chloride compound this is calcium chloride dihydrate calculate the percentage of water by mass in this count calcium chloride dihydrate cacl2.2h2o well let's go to the periodic table calcium has an atomic mass of 40.08 chlorine has an atomic mass of 35.45 and there are two of them so just that math would give me 110.98 it's the molar mass of the anhydrous calcium chloride water has a molar mass of 18.016 and there are two of them in the chemical formula so grand total 110.98 plus the two moles of water is 147.012 grams per mole so the percentage of water by mass would be the mass of water divided by the total mass of the hydrate compound so we have 18.016 times 2 for the total mass of water within this compound and 147.012 for the total mass of the entire hydrate compound so that ratio times 100 would give us the percentage of water by mass if you do this math you get 24.51 percent water by mass all right on to number 22. we are given a data table it says in a certain experiment a sample of a hydrate of magnesium sulfate the formula for magnesium sulfate is mgso4 and then since we don't know exactly what the formula of the hydrate compound is we have dot n h2o where n is going to be a whole number it's going to be one two three four five etc that compound the hydrate is heated in order to remove all of the water from the sample so the empty container is 25.356 grams then they put the hydrate salt in that container and it weighs 28.418 grams before it's heated and then they heated it to evaporate all of the water from the hydrate sample and they heated it three times and the mass of the container and the sample after each heating is recorded in the table eventually once all of the water has been removed then we have mgso4 the anhydrous salt so let's take a look at the different parts of this question part a explain how the data indicates that all of the water has been removed from the hydrate salt in this experiment so notice that the mass is going down after each heating well take a look closely at the data after the second and the third heating and what you'll notice is that they are essentially the same number they're only different by .001 grams so at that point we can assume that all of the water has been removed if you take a look at the third heating which is again for the precision of the scale is essentially the same number it's only different by .001 grams because the mass does not change significantly between the second heating and the third heating as in like those values are essentially the same now we can assume that the mass is constant the mass is not changing so therefore all of the water must have been removed in this experiment all right let's take a look at part b calculate the mass of the hydrate salt that was used in this experiment so that would be the difference between the first two values in the table 28.418 is the mass of the container and the hydrate salt before it was heated 25.356 is the mass of the empty container so that difference in grams 3.062 that's the mass of the hydrate salt all right let's take a look at part c calculate the mass of water that was removed from the hydrate sample in this experiment so the mass of the container and the hydrate salt before heating was 28.418 grams and at the end of the experiment after all of the water was removed the mass of the container in the sample was 26.852 grams so that difference in mass represents how much water was lost from evaporation and that would be 1.566 grams of water all right let's take a look at part d determine the value of n in the formula mgso4 dot nh2o so n represents the ratio of moles of water to moles of mgso4 that means we're going to need to take our answers that we have so far in our data table and turn grams into moles for the chemical substances involved here so how many moles of water and how many moles of mgso4 that's what we're looking at so the mgso4 the anhydrous salt would be the difference between our answers to b and c 1.496 grams or you could get it directly from the table and you could say well at the end of the experiment the mass was 26.852 [Music] just subtract the empty container and that difference 25.356 subtracted from 26.852 you would get the same answer so now we know how many grams of mgso4 are present at the end of the experiment the anhydrous mgso4 let's turn that number into moles so the value of n represents a mole ratio of moles of water divided by moles of this anhydrous salt so using the periodic table 1.496 grams of mgso4 let's turn that into moles so divide by the molar mass 120.36 and we get notice how i'm not going to round this off too much so 0.01 0.012 it's better to have some extra precision in your calculations at this point so i'm not gonna be tempted to call that point zero one definitely not point zero one two i'm gonna keep going so there's my number of moles and then for the water 1.566 grams of water divided by its molar mass again i'm not gonna round that off to point zero nine see i might think the ratio is nine to one if i said .01 and .09 but that's incorrect so better to have some extra precision in your values especially when you're in the middle of a calculation so how am i going to get my answer for the value of n it's a mole ratio so we're going to take moles of water so 0.08692 divided by moles of the anhydrous salt .01243 let's see what we get on the calculator and we get 7. so the answer to this particular question the value of n is 7 and if you wanted to write the formula of the hydrate mgs04.c h2o this would be called magnesium sulfate heptahydrate if you were curious it's also found in epsom salts which are kind of an over the counter remedy for like soaking sore muscles things like that okay so seven was the answer to part d and i believe that this particular part of this question represents the last question in the packet so again i hope that the answers to this particular packet were helpful thanks for watching","output":"This transcript details someone going through an AP Chemistry packet, explaining how to work through problems related to topics 1.1 to 1.3 which cover moles and molar mass, mass spectroscopy of elements, and elemental composition of pure substances. They describe how Avogadro's number provides the connection between the mass of a substance and the number of its particles. The instructor walks through several types of calculations: 1. Calculating molar mass and using it to find the mass or number of moles of a substance. 2. Discussing mass spectra for identifying isotopes and estimating relative abundance. 3. Determining empirical formula from percent composition by mass. 4. Calculating hydrated and anhydrous forms of compounds. The instructor emphasizes the importance of keeping track of significant figures and unit conversions throughout the calculations. Practice problems are solved step by step, and calculations are performed using various conversion factors—such as Avogadro's number and molar masses taken from the periodic table—to go from moles to grams or particles, and vice versa. The empirical formulas are derived, and the distinction between empirical and molecular formulas is also explained. For example, barium hydroxide and butane calculations are used to illustrate the conversion from grams to moles and moles to particles. Silicon and ozone examples are used to demonstrate the mole-particle relationship. The mass spectroscopy section is used to explain how to conclude the likely elemental identity from given isotopic masses and abundances. The elemental composition segment covers how to calculate the percent composition by mass for different compounds like glucose and erythrose, showcasing that different compounds can have the same empirical formula. The instructor concludes with explaining the handling of hydrates, demonstrating how to find the percent by mass of water in a hydrate and how to identify an empirical formula from experimental data."},{"instruction":"sympy transformée de laplace avec un système d'équations différentiel","output":"Dans SymPy, la transformation de Laplace peut être utilisée pour résoudre des systèmes d'équations différentielles.

covers topics 1.1 to 1.3 so here you're looking at unit 1 at a glance again unit 1 is entitled atomic structure and properties and in this particular video we'll take a look at topic 1.1 moles and molar mass topic 1.2 mass spectroscopy also known as spectrometry of elements and topic 1.3 elemental composition of pure substances in the video description area there should be a link to the ap chemistry course and exam description and there also should be a link to this particular packet that goes along with the video all right topic 1.1 moles and molar mass so here are some essential knowledge statements that come from the ap chemistry course and exam description one cannot count particles directly while performing laboratory work thus there must be a connection between the masses of substances reacting and the actual number of particles undergoing chemical changes avogadro's number 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd particles per mole provides the connection between the number of moles in a pure sample of a substance and the number of constituent particles or formula units of that substance expressing the mass of an individual atom or molecule in atomic mass units amu is useful because the average mass in amu of one particle atom or molecule or formula unit of a substance will always be numerically equal to the molar mass of that substance in grams thus there is a quantitative connection between the mass of a substance and the number of particles that the substance contains so here are three substances magnesium mg carbon dioxide co2 and sodium chloride nacl the particles of a substance can be described as atoms molecules or formula units as shown in the following examples the molar mass of a substance can be determined or calculated from the atomic mass values on the periodic table so if you look on your periodic table and you find the elemental symbol for magnesium mg you could say that a single atom of magnesium would weigh 24.30 amu or atomic mass units but once i change that to mole a mole of magnesium weighs 24.30 grams and it contains avogadro's number of atoms a mole of carbon dioxide if you add up the atomic mass of one carbon and two oxygens the molar mass of co2 is 44.01 grams and that would contain avogadro's number of molecules again referring to co2 as molecules that is a covalent substance whereas since sodium chloride is not covalent but rather ionic its fundamental building blocks or particles is not considered a molecule but rather a formula unit so one mole of sodium chloride would have a molar mass from the periodic table when you add up the atomic masses of sodium and chlorine 58.44 grams per mole and again would contain avogadro's number of formula units okay let's take a look at some practice problems so here we have two problems one of them says to calculate the mass in grams of 0.08 moles of something called barium hydroxide ba parentheses oh2 and then the other problem says to calculate the number of moles of c4h10 that are present in 2.00 grams of c4h10 so we are going to need to use the periodic table to do these calculations so starting with number one i have to go find barium oxygen and hydrogen on the periodic table so i can calculate the molar mass so there are those three particular elements and again let's go ahead and do that math to calculate the molar mass so for barium hydroxide ba parentheses oh2 the total of the barium and the two oxygens and the two hydrogens added together is 171.346 grams per mole so we'll start with the number of moles and then we'll set up a conversion factor that will put mole on the bottom since that's the unit we're trying to cancel out and grams on the top so that would be like this 171.346 grams of barium hydroxide for every one mole if we do that math on our calculator we get 14 point again you can see several significant digits there five six four four one so how do we round off our final answer in this case we go with the measurement that we were given so 0.0850 has three significant figures so we're going to round off our final answer to three significant figures and that would look like 14.6 grams in our next problem we're essentially doing the reverse of what we just did in number one so instead of going from moles to grams we're going to go from grams to moles so we start off with calculating the molar mass of c4h10 again this comes from the periodic table so carbon has an atomic mass of 12.01 and there are four carbons in the formula hydrogen is 1.008 and there are 10 of those so 58.12 grams per mole that's my molar mass of c4h10 i write down the number i was given so 2.00 grams of c4h10 and now i want to put grams on the bottom and moles on top so i use my molar mass as a conversion factor to go from grams to moles i do that math on my calculator again i get a long number and i'm not sure let's say how to round it off until i look at the measurement that i was given so 2.00 grams has three significant figures so we're going to round off our final answer to three significant figures which would be written as 0.0344 moles of c4h10 okay let's take a look at our next two problems number three calculate the number of atoms of silicon si that are present in 35.0 moles of silicon and then number four calculate the number of moles of o3 which is ozone that are present in 4.3 times 10 to the 24 molecules of ozone so number three we are going from atoms to moles and in number four we're going from moles to molecules so because we're talking about a conversion factor that goes between number of moles and number of particles we need avogadro's number but we in fact do not need to use the periodic table because we're not converting from grams to moles like we were in the previous or moles of grams okay so in this particular set of problems we're just going to use avogadro's number so number three we write down 35.0 moles of silicon put moles on the bottom and in this case atoms are the particles so atoms on top so there's avogadro's number the number of atoms or particles in one mole we do that math and again rounding this particular number off to the number of sig figs that we need in this case 35.0 has three significant figures so that number will be expressed with three significant figures as 2.11 times 10 to the 25th power and then number four we start with our number of particles in this case molecules of ozone o3 we want to put particles on the bottom and moles on top so avogadro's number of molecules of ozone on the bottom and then one mole of ozone on the top we do this math by again doing division like in the last problem we were multiplying the avogadro's number now we're dividing by avogadro's number and again on our calculator we get this long number let's round it off based on the number we're given in this case 4.3 has only two significant figures so our final answer is written as 7.1 moles of ozone o3 all right let's take a look at the next two questions number five calculate the mass in grams of 8.2 times 10 to the 22nd molecules of chcl3 and the number six calculate the number of formula units of na2so4 present in 0.248 grams of that substance so number five we know that when we use a conversion involving avogadro's number that's going to be between moles and particles or vice versa so we're definitely going to need avogadro's number but since the final answer is in grams we also need the periodic table and the calculated value for the molar mass to go between moles and grams and so i'm going to write the calculation for the molar mass of chcl so the atomic mass of carbon hydrogen and chlorine are what you see here so 12.01 1.008 and 35.45 now there are three chlorines in the formula that's why that's times three so 119.368 grams per mole that's the molar mass of chcl3 we're also going to need to use avogadro's number so here we have the given information 8.2 times 10 to the 22nd molecules of this substance chcl3 let's put molecules on the bottom and moles on top again using avogadro's number so avogadro's number on the bottom number of molecules in one mole and then let's use the molar mass that's going to be grams on top and then one mole on the bottom so here we pick up our calculator and we divide by avogadro's number we multiply by 119.368 and then we get this number on our calculator which if we round this off to two significant figures based on the 8.2 having two significant figures we're going to write this as not 16.2 or 16.3 but rather just 16 again two significant figures to match the value that we're given so i'm not going to be limited by avogadro's number or the molar mass from the periodic table those are not going to limit my significant figures in my answer but the number i was given in the problem that number has a certain number of significant figures that limits my answer all right on to number six molar mass for na2so4 again based on the atomic masses of sodium sulfur and oxygen so if i do that math 22.99 that's the atomic mass of sodium 32.06 the atomic mass of sulfur and then 16 the atomic mass of oxygen times 4. so we do all of that and we get 142.04 grams per mole that's the molar mass of na2so4 we'll start with the number we're given so 0.248 we're going to go from grams to moles so grams on the bottom one mole on top so there's the molar mass using that as a conversion factor and then now it's time to incorporate avogadro's number in our calculation so that would be one mole on the bottom and avogadro's number of particles in this case formula units on the top so if we divide by the molar mass multiplied by avogadro's number we get a number that needs to be rounded in this case 0.248 was the number we're given that's the measurement that has three significant figures so 0.248 three significant figures let's round off our final answer to 1.05 times 10 to the 21st formula units of na2so4 all right now we are going to move on to topic 1.2 mass spectroscopy of elements again also known as mass spectrometry and here are two essential knowledge statements from the ap chemistry course and exam description the mass spectrum of a sample containing a single element can be used to determine the identity of the isotopes of that element and the relative abundance of each isotope in nature the average atomic mass of an element can be estimated from the weighted average of the isotopic masses using the mass of each isotope and its relative abundance so in this first example for number seven from your packet we're looking at chlorine and on the left we see that there are two isotopes of chlorine so chlorine with a mass number of 35 and chlorine with a mass number of 37. the abundance that's like the percentage of that particular element as it would appear in a sample naturally 75.8 percent chlorine 35 24.2 chlorine 37. so on the right we're seeing a mass spectrum and again this particular diagram shows two bars so one on the x-axis at atomic mass or mass number of 35 for the chlorine-35 isotope and then a smaller bar on the x-axis you can see that's 37 so again mass number 37 on the y-axis we see percent abundance so number seven part a calculate the average atomic mass of cl so based on this information that would be to calculate the weighted average so the weighted average means we're going to multiply each mass number by its percent abundance that is written as a decimal so 35 times 0.758 plus 37 times 0.242 so that's the weighted average that we get from this data and our calculator would give us an answer of approximately 35.5 in part b of this question we're given a table with chlorine 35 and chlorine 37 and we're asked to fill in the number of protons and neutrons so if we take a look at the periodic table we can see that chlorine does in fact have an atomic mass that is approximately 35.5 so that answer to part a makes sense and we can see atomic number 17 that refers to the number of protons in the nucleus of chlorine so 17 protons for each isotope protons plus neutrons will give us the mass number so 17 plus 18 is 35 or you could do 35 minus 17 equals 18 and then 17 plus 20 equals 37. all right let's take a look at number eight so we're looking at a different element that says not chlorine you can see along the x-axis we have a mass number of either 121 or 123 and along the y-axis for the percent abundance you can see written above each bar 57.4 percent for the mass number 121 and 42.6 percent for the abundance of mass number 123. so to calculate the average atomic mass of this particular element we're going to do just like we did before take the mass number times the percent abundance that is written as a decimal so 121 times 0.574 plus 123 times 0.426 so we do that math and we get approximately 121.9 now to look on the periodic table to figure out what is the most likely identity of this element it's okay if the atomic mass of the element is not exactly 121.9 but is very close to that value let's take a look so again tin sn is only 118.71 so that's too small tellurium te is 127.60 that's too big so the only element that this could represent is atomic number 51 antimony sb with an atomic mass of 121.76 again that's the closest to the value that we calculated in part a so again to part b what is the most likely identity of this element it is going to be antimony element symbol sb okay let's take a look at number nine so we have a mass spectrum with mass numbers of 79 and 81 and we have the percent abundances that are listed so now we're not going to actually need to calculate the average atomic mass in this particular problem they come right out with what is the most likely identity of this element so if we look at the periodic table we're looking for an element that has an atomic mass that falls somewhere between 79 and 81. again these are almost exactly a 50 50 mixture of these two isotopes so should be pretty close to 80 for the atomic mass which would be the average of 79 and 81. let's take a look in the periodic table so selenium se has an average atomic mass of 78.97 so that's too small krypton kr is going to be about 83.80 that's too large so the only element that has an atomic mass that falls between 79 and 81 is bromine br and its atomic mass is 79.90 so bromine has 35 protons in its nucleus and has an average mass atomic mass of 79.90 so bromine is the answer to part a and then for part b again bromine has 35 protons in its nucleus so mass number minus atomic number would give us the number of neutrons so 79 minus 35 is 44 and 81 minus 35 is 46. so again 35 protons and 44 or 46 neutrons for the two isotopes of bromine okay moving on to number 10 this time we don't actually have a mass spectrum to look at but we are told that a certain element has two naturally occurring isotopes with mass numbers of 63 and 65 what is the most likely identity of this element let's take a look at the periodic table and see if we can find an element whose atomic mass falls between 63 and 65. nickel is around 58.69 zinc is around 65.38 so copper element cu the only one that would fall in that range between 63 and 65. so 63.55 is the average atomic mass of copper cu now to fill in the table with protons and neutrons again on the periodic table we know that copper has 29 protons in the nucleus again that would be the atomic number of copper 29 and then since the protons plus the neutrons equals the mass number 63 minus 29 will give us the number of neutrons and again that's either 34 or 36 for the number of neutrons again these are the number of neutrons so 29 plus 34 equals 63 29 plus 36 equals 65. now again we're not looking at a mass spectrum so we don't know the percent abundance of these two isotopes of copper so part c of this question which isotope of this element mass number 63 or mass number 65 is more abundant in nature justify your answer so on the periodic table the average atomic mass of copper is 63.55 so the isotope with mass number 63 should be more abundant in nature because the average the weighted average 63.55 is closer in value to 63 than it is to 65. so for example if it had been exactly a 50 50 mixture of these two isotopes then the average of 63 and 65 just a straight up average would be 64. since 63.55 is closer to the number 63 that means that the isotope with mass number 63 is more abundant okay let's take a look at number 11. so so far in the examples that i'm showing you for a mass spectrum it's been really simple in that there's only been two naturally occurring isotopes of the elements in the examples you've seen so far so what i wanted to do here with this example is to indicate that the process the calculation of the average atomic mass it can be a bit more complicated it's still the same principle but you just have more numbers to enter into your calculator so here number 11 if an element has several naturally occurring isotopes then here's how you would do the calculation part a based on the information above estimate the average atomic mass of the element to the nearest whole number and then use a calculator to determine the average atomic mass so if i had to estimate this it looks like it's going to be anywhere between 154 and 160 according to the data that we have for six different isotopes of this particular element so where would the average fall where would the weighted average fall looks like 154 is a very small amount it's about 2 percent and then all of the other isotopes are somewhere between 15 and about 22 25 so i'm going to estimate again just a rough estimate that the average atomic mass is probably somewhere around the middle like maybe around 157 or so so you might estimate that the average atomic mass of this particular element is approximately 157. let's go ahead and do the math so to do the math we're going to take the mass number times the percent abundance written as a decimal so it looks like this 154 times 0.0218 plus 155 times 0.1480 and then you just keep going 156 times its percent abundance as a decimal 157 158 160. so all of that into my calculator gives me an answer of four 157.0241 so again approximately 157 point zero two what is the most likely identity of this element again let's look on the periodic table and see can we find an element that has an average atomic mass that is approximately 157 so down there in the lanthanide series of the periodic table the elements between atomic number 58 cerium and atomic number 71 lutesium we see that an element with a symbol gd which is gadolinium has an atomic mass of 157.25 so that's going to be the most likely identity of this particular element so gadolinium gd with atomic mass 157.25 okay well moving on to our next topic the last topic in this particular video topic 1.3 elemental composition of pure substances so here are some essential knowledge statements from the ap chemistry course and exam description some pure substances are composed of individual molecules while others consist of atoms or ions held together in fixed proportions as described by a formula unit according to the law of definite proportions the ratio of the masses of the constituent elements in any pure sample of that compound is always the same the chemical formula that lists the lowest whole number ratio of atoms of the elements in a compound is the empirical formula so let's take a look at our first question here number 12. calculate the percent composition by mass of each element in glucose c6h12o6 so what you're doing here is you're using the skill that you already have acquired from topic 1.1 about calculating the molar mass so the molar mass of glucose c6h12o6 would be the atomic mass of carbon 12.01 times 6 the atomic mass of hydrogen 1.008 times and the atomic mass of oxygen 16.00 times 6. so grand total molar mass or formula mass is 180.156 in the case of the molar mass that would be grams per mole if this were a single molecule of glucose you could say amu or atomic mass units but the percent composition by mass what that means is that we have to take the part divided by the whole for each element in this particular compound so the percentage of carbon by mass the percentage of hydrogen by mass the percentage of oxygen by mass so for the percent carbon by mass that would be 12.01 times six that's the total mass of carbon and then divided by the formula mass or the molar mass 180.156 times 100 to convert that to a percent and we do that math and we get 40.00 percent carbon by mass now we look at hydrogen and then oxygen so for hydrogen it would be 1.008 times 12 that's the total mass of hydrogen in one unit of glucose again divided by the total mass times 100 6.71 hydrogen by mass and then for oxygen 16.00 times 6 that's the total mass of oxygen within the formula glucose divided by the total mass times 100 and we get 53.29 percent oxygen by mass so no matter where i get glucose a pure sample of glucose from any source should have these same percentages of carbon hydrogen and oxygen by mass so the law of definite proportion or constant composition says that glucose will always have these particular percentages of carbon hydrogen and oxygen any pure sample of glucose has that so moving on to number 13 in the packet now we have a different compound which is called erythrose and its chemical formula is c4h8o4 let's go ahead and do the same process that we did in number 12 for glucose so the total mass of erythros from the periodic table so four carbons eight hydrogens and four oxygens is 120.104 grams per mole or you could say amu's if you were talking about a single molecule of erythrose let's break it down for carbon hydrogen and oxygen just like we did in number 12. mass of carbon so 12.01 times 4 divided by the total mass 120 120.104 times 100. interestingly enough we get the exact same percentage of carbon that we did in number 12. and so you're going to see a little deja vu now we do the percentage of hydrogen by mass in this compound so 1.008 times 8 total mass of hydrogen divided by total mass of erythros again that number should be familiar six point seven one percent hydrogen by mass and then finally with oxygen total mass of oxygen sixteen point zero zero times four divided by the total mass of erythros times a hundred fifty three point two nine percent oxygen by mass so if you're wondering why i chose the compounds in number 12 and number 13 there was a particular point that i wanted to make with these two compounds glucose and erythros and that is summarized by the work you're doing in number 14. so the empirical formula is going to be the simplest whole number ratio so when we take glucose c6h and we divide each of those subscripts by the greatest common factor in this case 6 we get c1h2o1 now even though erythrose is a very different chemical with different properties different formula when we take c4h8o4 and we divide each of those subscripts by the greatest common factor in this case four we get the exact same empirical formula so the point that i wanted to make is that we have two different compounds but because they have the same empirical formula then they are going to lead to a calculation that will give you the same percent composition by mass all right let's move on to number 15 in the packet now in this particular question we're actually going to go in the opposite direction so instead of being given a chemical formula and then calculating the percent composition by mass in number 15 we are told what the percent composition by mass is and we have to figure out the chemical formula specifically the empirical formula the one that has the lowest whole number ratio of elements so this is phosphorus and oxygen 43.64 phosphorus by mass 56.36 oxygen by mass so a good first step in this particular problem is to assume that the mass of this sample this compound that contains phosphorus and oxygen is 100 grams that way since a percentage is based on 100 we can just simply write down the number of grams of each element so we have 43.64 grams of the element phosphorus and we have 56.36 grams of the element oxygen well as you learned in topic 1.1 you can use the periodic table to go from grams to moles and so we have grams right now let's convert grams into moles because that way the mole ratio will give us the information that we need about the chemical formula so let's take the periodic table which has for phosphorous an atomic mass of 30.97 let's use that number to go from grams to moles now at this point i'm going to write that number down on my calculator i don't want to round it off to just 1 or 1.4 or even 1.41 it's actually better in calculations like this where you're trying to figure out the empirical formula it's better if you have extra digits on your calculator you want to really resist the temptation to start rounding these numbers off or not writing down the full number so i chose four significant figures in this problem the reason why you don't want to round it off too much is because you're looking for a ratio of moles of one element to the other and the more you round off your numbers the less accurate your values will be when you're trying to find that mole ratio so it's better to have extra precision in your answers than to just cut off the number at a couple of digits all right oxygen 56.36 grams of oxygen you might be wondering if you have good chemistry knowledge about oxygen being a diatomic element right we normally write oxygen as o2 you might be wondering do we have to use o2 in our calculations and the answer is no we're looking for individual ratios of elements o2 is a molecule it's not an individual atom so therefore it would be a single o so on the periodic table i'm going to write 16.00 i'm not going to write 32 because we're not talking about molecules of o2 we're talking about individual atoms of phosphorus and oxygen in this particular unknown compound so again be careful when you're going from grams to moles of individual elements that you ignore any elements that might be diatomic because in this particular case it's individual atoms not diatomic molecules all right i do this math 56.36 divided by 16 and i get again look at me not rounding off this answer too much i'm not going to call it 4 or 3.5 so i went ahead and chose 4 significant figures okay what do we do next to get the empirical formula of this compound we're looking for a simple whole number ratio between the moles of phosphorus and the moles of oxygen so how do we do that well because it's based on a simple whole number ratio of moles we're going to go ahead and take these two values of moles and we're going to divide them by the smaller of the two values so 1.409 divided by itself will give us 1 and 3.523 divided by 1.409 if you do that math on your calculator you get 2.50 so again now do we have simple whole numbers no we're not going to take 2.5 and just round it up to 3. what we have to do is take this empirical formula which again this is not correct and we're going to try to get simple whole numbers from the numbers that we have right now so instead of saying 1 and 2.5 let's just go ahead and double these values that way it keeps the ratio the same but we turn a 1 into a 2 and a 2.5 into a 5. so by doubling the ratio of 1 and 2.5 we get 2 and 5. and then that's it that's our empirical formula p2o5 is the empirical formula of this particular compound all right so to go ahead and summarize the procedure that we used in number 15 of this packet if you are given percent composition by mass or mass data for a certain compound so grams of each element the following procedure will help you to determine the empirical formula of the compound convert the grams or the mass of each element into moles again that would involve the periodic table then now that you have moles of each element divide each value of moles by the lowest value the lowest number now at this point you may already have whole numbers based on that step in the procedure but if not if you have numbers that end in 0.5 like we just saw in the last example then you could multiply by 2. or if for example your number of moles they end with .33 or .66 or 0.67 you may have to multiply by 3 to turn those values into whole numbers so again be careful with your data don't round off your numbers too early in the calculation as i said before but then whatever whole numbers you get those whole number values of moles then they will be used in the subscripts to write the empirical formula of that compound okay here's our next problem number 16. we are given the percentage by mass for the elements carbon hydrogen and oxygen let's convert each of these numbers from grams into moles so we'll assume that we have a hundred grams of this particular compound and that way the percentages can just be written as grams so we have grams of carbon let's divide that number by the molar mass of carbon which would be 12.01 we're converting from grams to moles again i'm not going to round that number off to four or 4.3 so i wrote that number with four significant figures a little extra precision is a good thing in the early stage of the calculation now we have the same calculation for hydrogen and for oxygen so 13.13 again this is individual elements individual atoms of hydrogen so it's not h2 it's not the diatomic molecule that we think about in terms of its substance you might have hydrogen gas for example it's h2 this is individual atoms of hydrogen so divided by 1.008 that came from the periodic table 13.03 i'm using the atomic masses for each element as the molar mass of each element so 34.73 grams of oxygen again not divided by 32 but 16. so individual molar masses of these elements with no subscripts so now i'm staring at three numbers which are 4.31 sorry 4.341 moles of carbon 13.03 moles of hydrogen and 2.171 moles of oxygen so the next step in the procedure is to find the lowest value in this case 2.171 and we're going to go ahead and divide each of these values of moles by the smallest value so divided by 2.171 we get 2 divided by 2.171 we get 6 and obviously divided by itself we get 1. so those values 2 6 and 1 are already whole numbers there's no extra step of multiplying by 2 or 3. so what i have right now is an empirical formula c2 h6 and then o1 or just o the one is understood as a subscript okay so our empirical formula was c2h6o let's move on to number 17 in the packet a pure sample of tin so elemental symbol sn with a mass of 6.18 grams is burned in air until the tin is completely converted into a tin oxide so a tin oxide compound would contain both tin and oxygen the mass of the tin oxide is equal to 7.85 grams determine the empirical formula of this tin oxide compound so we start with 6.18 grams of tin it is burned in the air which means it's going to react with oxygen in the air and it produces 7.85 grams of tin oxide now i'm not writing a balanced chemical equation for this process i'm writing the elements in words because we don't know the exact formula of the tin oxide so therefore even though i know that tin is sn i know that oxygen gas is written as o2 i don't know what the chemical formula of this particular tin oxide compound is so the difference in mass between 7.85 grams and 6.18 grams that difference is 1.67 grams that's how much oxygen reacted with the tin in this experiment so while this looks like a different problem in the previous examples we had the percentage of each element by mass so percent composition now that we know from processing this information that we have grams of tin sn and then grams of oxygen in this case i'm going to write this as individual atoms of o we can go ahead and convert grams to moles like we have been doing in the other problems number 15 and 16. so grams of tin 6.18 grams divided by the atomic mass of tin on the periodic table 118.71 that gives me the number of moles of tin again i'm going to try to keep a little extra precision so i'm not going to write 0.05 or 0.052 i went ahead and i chose three significant figures here but if you had four or five significant figures that would be fine too again a little extra precision is fine in this stage of the calculation but don't round off your numbers because you might throw away important precision that will help you get to those simple whole number ratios of moles again like i said in the previous examples we have individual oxygen so yes there is oxygen in the air which is o2 but i want to know the ratio of atoms of tin to atoms of oxygen in this particular compound so that's why i'm not dividing by 32 i'm not talking about o2 i'm talking about individual atoms of o within this tin oxide compound so 1.67 divided by the atomic mass of o 16.00 again i'm not going to call that 0.1 i'm going to call that .104 so at least three significant figures so what's the next step in the process we have moles of 10 and moles of oxygen or o divide by the lower of the two values in this case we're going to divide by .0521 so now we have a 1 for 10 and we have a 2 for oxygen so those simple whole number values now become the subscripts so our chemical formula of this tin oxide compound from our data and our calculations is sno2 all right let's move on to number 18. number 18 starts off looking very similar to the other types of problems where we're trying to figure out the empirical formula of an unknown compound but then there's a little bit of a twist in parts b and c of this question where we actually make the connection between the empirical formula and the molecular formula of a compound okay so part a determine the empirical formula of compound x so we know that compound x consists of the elements carbon hydrogen and nitrogen we have a 15.00 gram sample of this compound and if you break it down by grams of each element we have 9.81 grams of carbon 1.37 grams of hydrogen and 3.82 grams of nitrogen so procedure is going to look like the previous problems where we have grams of each element let's go from grams to moles so divide by the molar mass of carbon which would be 12.01 and i'm going to write this number down as moles of carbon again i'm not rounding too much so i have three significant figures 0.817 moles of carbon moving on for hydrogen 1.37 divide by the atomic mass or the molar mass of h so 1.008 from the periodic table and i get 1.36 moles of hydrogen again not h2 just h and then for nitrogen again nitrogen is a diatomic element but in this case we're talking about individual atoms of c h and n so i'm not going to divide by 28.02 but rather 14.01 the atomic mass or the molar mass of individual n so ch and n this again that number gives me if i do that math 0.273 so i kept some precision at least three significant figures in my number of moles which of these three values is the smallest so 0.273 so i'm going to divide each of these value of moles by the smallest value so divide .817 by 0.273 and i get 3. and then for hydrogen i divide by 0.273 and i get 5 and obviously divide it by itself is 1. so 3 5 and 1 those are my subscripts in the empirical formula c3 h5n now the empirical formula is not necessarily the same as the molecular formula so in part c of this question we're going to have to get the molecular formula for compound x and we don't know what that is yet but we do know that the empirical formula which is the lowest simple whole number ratio of moles is c3h5n let's move on to part b of this question in part b it is determined that a 25.0 gram sample of compound x contains 9.11 times 10 to the 22nd molecules calculate the molar mass of compound x in units of grams per mole now you might be thinking molar mass don't we already know the chemical formula c3h5n well again that's the empirical formula which is not necessarily the same as the molecular formula so at this point we're not using our answer to part a to do this calculation we're given grams and molecules so i'm going to go ahead and write down the numbers i'm given which is 25 grams 25.0 grams and 9.11 times 10 to the 22nd molecules now what i did in starting this particular problem or setting up the calculation is i put grams on the top and i put molecules on the bottom if i'm paying close attention to what they're looking for molar mass is not grams per molecule but rather grams per mole so what i'm thinking is that i would like there to be a conversion factor that changes grams per molecule into grams per mole i don't want the grams to go away in fact i want the grams to stay exactly where they are but i would like to get rid of the molecules i would like to get rid of the molecules and replace that with per mole so i want molecules to go on top and i want moles to go on the bottom now is the time for avogadro's number as you've already learned there are avagadra's numbers 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd particles in this case molecules of a substance in one mole of that substance so if i do this calculation 25 divided by 9.11 times 10 to the 22nd times 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd i get on my calculator approximately 165 grams per mole again going with three significant figures based on the 25.0 and all the other numbers 165 grams per mole if you watching this video are thinking well is there another way to solve this problem besides the way i set it up absolutely so what you could do is you could analyze the information in part b and you could say well i don't know how to convert 25.0 grams into moles because i'm not really sure what the chemical formula again not the empirical formula but the molecular formula of compound x is so let's say for a moment we don't know what to do with 25.0 grams have we learned in chemistry how to convert molecules to moles yes absolutely so you could have written down the number of molecules and then again use avogadro's number to go from molecules to moles if i just did that i'd be dividing by avogadro's number again trying to get rid of molecules and go to moles and if i did that on my calculator 9.11 times 10 to the 22nd divided by avogadro's number i would get a value of approximately 0.151 moles but then i could go back to the 25.0 grams which i did not use yet in this calculation and i could say all right grams per mole which means grams divided by moles so 25.0 grams divided by the number of moles that i just calculated using avogadro's number if i did that math i would definitely still get the same answer that i got earlier which is 165 grams per mole so we're going to move on now to part c of this question which involves taking our answers to part a and part b and kind of putting them together in a certain way so in part a we had an empirical formula in part b we have a molar mass so in part c based on your answers to parts a and b determine the molecular formula of compound x so in part a we had an empirical formula of c3h5n again that's the simplest whole number ratio for those elements for the number of moles in part b we had approximately 165 grams per mole so how can we combine these two quantities or this information to get the molecular formula well if you take a moment and look at c3h5n that's three carbons five hydrogens and one nitrogen that number the formula mass of the empirical formula is not 165 it's about 55 55.08 on my calculator so how are those two numerical quantities related to each other well the ratio of the actual molecular formula which is the number of atoms of each element in that particular compound the ratio of the molecular formula to the empirical formula is going to be a whole number so for example c3h5n that's the lowest whole number ratio if i multiply it by 2 it would be c6h10 n2 but i could multiply that empirical formula by three or by four by five whatever and i would turn the empirical formula into the molecular formula so 165 is the molar mass 55 or 55.08 that is the empirical formula mass let's take the larger number divided by the smaller number and see what happens if we do that math 165 divided by 55.08 we get 3. so what does this tell us that the empirical formula should be multiplied by 3 and so 3 times 3 is 9 5 times 3 is 15 1 times 3 is 3 so the actual molecular formula is not c3h5n but rather times 3 c9 h15n3 and that would have a molar mass of 165 grams per mole so the answer to part c is c9 h15 n3 okay let's take a look at our next question so another way to determine the empirical formula of a compound instead of just being given the percent composition or the number of grams of each element in that compound is to use data from a combustion experiment now we saw this briefly with the tin converting that into the tin oxide earlier but if i take a compound that contains carbon and hydrogen and i burn it all the way to completion in the presence of excess oxygen gas then all of the carbon will be converted into carbon dioxide co2 and all of the hydrogen will combine with oxygen and convert it into h2o water so if the compound contains more than just carbon and hydrogen let's say it contains maybe nitrogen or sulfur then other gases may be formed oxides of nitrogen or oxides of sulfur so in number 19 we are given a data table and it says that there's a sample of a compound that contains carbon hydrogen and oxygen but we don't know the chemical formula of that compound all we know is it contains c h and o and it's burned completely in oxygen and o2 and it produced the sample produced 10.99 grams of carbon dioxide and it also produced 6.00 grams of water when it was burned completely so part a determine the mass of carbon present in 5.00 grams of the compound now we're not taking 5.00 grams and doing any math with that and the reason why we're not doing any math with that is because we don't know what the chemical formula is so we can't figure out how much carbon is present in 5.00 grams on its own what we are doing is looking at the co2 so to remind you on the periodic table the molar mass of co2 as calculated from the atomic masses of carbon and oxygen is 44.00 grams per mole so how much carbon is present in co2 that's what's going on in the calculation for part a so 10.99 grams of co2 was taken directly from the table and then now using the calculations from the periodic table i'm going to convert from grams of co2 into grams of carbon so how do i do that well at least i want to put grams of co2 on the bottom and i want to put grams of c grams of carbon on the top so this is how i did it the 44.01 that's the total mass the molar mass of co2 how much carbon is in that particular quantity is 12.01 as you can see from the calculations in the upper left corner of the slide so now i'm going to do the math of converting grams of co2 into grams of carbon so i do that math and i get approximately 3 grams i get 2.99908 i'll round that off to four significant figures at least for right now so 2.999 again i'm trying to be as precise as possible and not just cut off a number to a single significant digit so four sig figs in my mass of co2 four sig figs in my mass of carbon is there another way that i could have done this calculation that involved one mole as in converting from grams to moles absolutely we're still going to get the same answer but watch how you might have done it this way you could have taken the grams of co2 and first converted that into moles moles of co2 well the problem with just doing that much is that you have to get to grams of carbon so what might the next step be in converting moles of co2 into let's say grams of carbon as you might have done it like this there's one mole of carbon for every one mole of co2 because there are no subscripts with the carbon in this chemical formula for carbon dioxide so one mole of carbon is present in one mole of co2 now you have to go back to grams because they want the mass of carbon in grams so we could use the periodic table and write 12.01 grams of carbon per mole now it's the exact same calculation but it's in three steps so if you would prefer to do a problem a calculation like what i just showed you on the bottom part of that slide if that makes more sense to you go for it so the top version is just a ratio of grams of carbon to grams of co2 and then the bottom three-step sequence converts grams to moles of a compound converts moles of a compound to moles of an individual element within that compound and then back to grams using the periodic table okay with answered part a let's take a look at part b of this question we talked about carbon part b is let's talk about the mass of hydrogen present so again we're not using 5.00 grams in our calculation we're going to go ahead and figure out how much water was produced so 6.00 grams of water is produced and again the molar mass of water as you i'm sure already know would be just two hydrogens and one oxygen so 18.016 that is the molar mass of water so how much hydrogen is present in water is going to be part of our calculation if i write down 6.00 grams of water which i got from the table that i was given and i want to convert grams of h2o into grams of h so watch how i do that again be careful that you don't miss an important step so how much hydrogen is present in water looks like this so in the previous example it was 12.01 for carbon and 44.01 for co2 but within the water molecule within the water formula there's two h's in that formula so that's why this ratio is not 1.00 it's the total mass of hydrogen in the formula h2o if i do that math i get again i'm not going to round this off too much i'll say at least three sig figs so 0.671 grams of hydrogen if you would rather first convert grams to moles you could do that again grams to moles is a good first step but then we have to remember that there are two moles of hydrogen atoms for every one mole of water molecules and then if i go to grams of hydrogen that would be 1.008 grams of h per mole i'm still gonna get the same answer i'm gonna get 0.671 but if you prefer that bottom three-step sequence if that makes more conceptual sense to you to go grams to moles and then remember that there are two h's in every h2o then you're gonna get the exact same answer okay so let's move on to part c we've got the grams of carbon the grams of hydrogen let's see what it says in part c determine the mass of oxygen present in 5.00 grams of the compound so at the top of the slide you can see that the answer to part a was 2.999 grams of carbon and the answer to part b is 0.671 grams of hydrogen well there's a 5 gram sample 5.00 gram sample of a compound that contains three different elements c h and o we already know the mass of c and h so all we really have to do is subtract the answers from part a and b from the total mass of the compound the 5.00 and if we do that math so 5.00 minus 2.999 minus 0.671 when you add and subtract measurements we go with the least number of decimal places so i'm going to go ahead and with two decimal places i'm going to call that 1.33 grams of oxygen and again that's coming from just subtracting the answer to part a and b from the total mass of the sample that was burned all right almost done part d will be the traditional empirical formula calculation that you've seen before we're going to convert the grams of each element into moles so based on my answers to part a b and c i have 2.999 grams of carbon 0.671 grams of hydrogen and 1.33 grams of oxygen let's convert each of these elements from grams to moles as you've seen before so divide by either 12.01 or 1.008 or 16.00 so this is my calculation of moles of carbon so that's 0.2497 moles of carbon and then let's move on to the hydrogen let's convert from grams to moles so 0.671 grams of hydrogen divide by the molar mass of h 0.666 moles of hydrogen of h and then finally with the oxygen 1.33 grams of o divide by the molar mass of o 16.00 do that math and we get 0.0831 moles of o so now we have moles of c moles of h and moles of o to get the empirical formula we're going to divide each of these mole values by the smallest value and let's see what happens so divide by point zero eight three one for carbon we get three divide by point .0831 for hydrogen we get eight and obviously dividing by itself we get one so three eight and one those are the subscripts in the empirical formula so the empirical formula of this compound is c3 h8 o okay the last three problems in this packet have to do with ratios of moles but not exactly from element to element but involving water so it says another type of situation that involves mass and mole ratios involves a substance that is known as a hydrate a hydrate is a substance in which water molecules are included in the chemical formula these substances are often ionic compounds in which water molecules are bonded to the ions in the crystal structure so a hydrate salt can be heated to remove the water through evaporation and then you would form what is known as an anhydrous salt where the word anhydrous just means without water so here you can see in the table on the left two examples of anhydrous salts so we have copper roman numeral two sulfate cuso4 and then calcium chloride cacl2 on the right we see examples of hydrate salts of these compounds so copper roman numeral 2 sulfate pentahydrate so there are 5 moles of water for every 1 mole of cuso4 calcium chloride dihydrate there are two moles of water for every one mole of cacl2 so that dot just indicates that the water is coordinated and included in the chemical formula but that dot does not mean to multiply it just means that there are five or in this case two five additional moles of water are included in the chemical formula so let's see how we can take a look at some example problems that involve hydrates number 20 a sample of this copper roman numeral two sulfate pentahydrate cus04.5 h2o has a mass of 25.00 grams part a calculate the mass of cuso4 present in this 25.00 gram sample so how much cuso4 is present is going to be a number that is less than 25 grams because it's going to include both the cuso4 and the water so how much cuso4 is present well let me go ahead and start writing down the molar mass calculations so on the periodic table the atomic mass of copper 63.55 atomic mass of sulfur 32.06 atomic mass of oxygen 16.00 and there are four of them so 159.61 that's the molar mass of the anhydrous form of this compound without the water if i take 159.61 and then i add 5 moles of water to that calculation so 18.016 that's the molar mass of water h2o times 5 because there are 5 moles of water in the formula for the hydrate i get a number which is 249.69 that's the molar mass of the copper sulfate pentahydrate compound so 25.00 grams of this hydrated compound if i want to convert that to grams of just cuso4 i can use the numbers that are right here on the slide so 159.61 grams of just cus 04 for every 249.69 grams of the entire hydrate compound so that ratio will be set up as a conversion factor so i can get grams of cuso4 and i do that math and i get rounding off to four significant figures here 15.98 grams of just cos 04 without the water all right part b of this question calculate the mass of water present in this 25.00 gram sample well again it should be a number that's less than 25 grams so based on the same calculation i did for part a there's 159.61 grams of cuso4 for every 249.69 grams of the total hydrate compound what about the water well the water would be 18.016 times five that's how much water is present in the entire compound so 18.016 times 5 would give me the grams of water and then the 249.69 is the total molar mass of the hydrated compound so that math as a conversion factor would give me grams of water in my answer and i get approximately 9.02 or 9.019 so you might be thinking well did i really have to do that kind of calculation in part b if i already knew in part a that there was 15.98 grams of copper sulfate cuso4 couldn't i just subtract that from 25 and the answer is yes so another way perhaps a much easier way to calculate the answer to part b is just to subtract your answer to part a from the total mass of the sample so 25 minus 15.98 gives me the mass of water and 9.02 grams okay let's take a look at number 21. we're still talking about a hydrate compound but this time it's not the copper sulfate compound it's a calcium chloride compound this is calcium chloride dihydrate calculate the percentage of water by mass in this count calcium chloride dihydrate cacl2.2h2o well let's go to the periodic table calcium has an atomic mass of 40.08 chlorine has an atomic mass of 35.45 and there are two of them so just that math would give me 110.98 it's the molar mass of the anhydrous calcium chloride water has a molar mass of 18.016 and there are two of them in the chemical formula so grand total 110.98 plus the two moles of water is 147.012 grams per mole so the percentage of water by mass would be the mass of water divided by the total mass of the hydrate compound so we have 18.016 times 2 for the total mass of water within this compound and 147.012 for the total mass of the entire hydrate compound so that ratio times 100 would give us the percentage of water by mass if you do this math you get 24.51 percent water by mass all right on to number 22. we are given a data table it says in a certain experiment a sample of a hydrate of magnesium sulfate the formula for magnesium sulfate is mgso4 and then since we don't know exactly what the formula of the hydrate compound is we have dot n h2o where n is going to be a whole number it's going to be one two three four five etc that compound the hydrate is heated in order to remove all of the water from the sample so the empty container is 25.356 grams then they put the hydrate salt in that container and it weighs 28.418 grams before it's heated and then they heated it to evaporate all of the water from the hydrate sample and they heated it three times and the mass of the container and the sample after each heating is recorded in the table eventually once all of the water has been removed then we have mgso4 the anhydrous salt so let's take a look at the different parts of this question part a explain how the data indicates that all of the water has been removed from the hydrate salt in this experiment so notice that the mass is going down after each heating well take a look closely at the data after the second and the third heating and what you'll notice is that they are essentially the same number they're only different by .001 grams so at that point we can assume that all of the water has been removed if you take a look at the third heating which is again for the precision of the scale is essentially the same number it's only different by .001 grams because the mass does not change significantly between the second heating and the third heating as in like those values are essentially the same now we can assume that the mass is constant the mass is not changing so therefore all of the water must have been removed in this experiment all right let's take a look at part b calculate the mass of the hydrate salt that was used in this experiment so that would be the difference between the first two values in the table 28.418 is the mass of the container and the hydrate salt before it was heated 25.356 is the mass of the empty container so that difference in grams 3.062 that's the mass of the hydrate salt all right let's take a look at part c calculate the mass of water that was removed from the hydrate sample in this experiment so the mass of the container and the hydrate salt before heating was 28.418 grams and at the end of the experiment after all of the water was removed the mass of the container in the sample was 26.852 grams so that difference in mass represents how much water was lost from evaporation and that would be 1.566 grams of water all right let's take a look at part d determine the value of n in the formula mgso4 dot nh2o so n represents the ratio of moles of water to moles of mgso4 that means we're going to need to take our answers that we have so far in our data table and turn grams into moles for the chemical substances involved here so how many moles of water and how many moles of mgso4 that's what we're looking at so the mgso4 the anhydrous salt would be the difference between our answers to b and c 1.496 grams or you could get it directly from the table and you could say well at the end of the experiment the mass was 26.852 [Music] just subtract the empty container and that difference 25.356 subtracted from 26.852 you would get the same answer so now we know how many grams of mgso4 are present at the end of the experiment the anhydrous mgso4 let's turn that number into moles so the value of n represents a mole ratio of moles of water divided by moles of this anhydrous salt so using the periodic table 1.496 grams of mgso4 let's turn that into moles so divide by the molar mass 120.36 and we get notice how i'm not going to round this off too much so 0.01 0.012 it's better to have some extra precision in your calculations at this point so i'm not gonna be tempted to call that point zero one definitely not point zero one two i'm gonna keep going so there's my number of moles and then for the water 1.566 grams of water divided by its molar mass again i'm not gonna round that off to point zero nine see i might think the ratio is nine to one if i said .01 and .09 but that's incorrect so better to have some extra precision in your values especially when you're in the middle of a calculation so how am i going to get my answer for the value of n it's a mole ratio so we're going to take moles of water so 0.08692 divided by moles of the anhydrous salt .01243 let's see what we get on the calculator and we get 7. so the answer to this particular question the value of n is 7 and if you wanted to write the formula of the hydrate mgs04.c h2o this would be called magnesium sulfate heptahydrate if you were curious it's also found in epsom salts which are kind of an over the counter remedy for like soaking sore muscles things like that okay so seven was the answer to part d and i believe that this particular part of this question represents the last question in the packet so again i hope that the answers to this particular packet were helpful thanks for watching","output":"Topic 1.1: Moles and Molar Mass - Use Avogadro's number (6.02 x 10^23 particles/mol) to relate moles to the

They wander around for a bit, when suddenly Nick discovers a strange control panel, with many red buttons on it. Nick, after looking at the panel for a bit, decides to press a random button...but then suddenly, after he presses it, he hears a voice from above. The voice then declares Nick to be the Great Legendary King of the Multiverse. Nick, after being startled for a moment, then confusedly asks the voice why he was chosen...to which the voice declares that it chose Nick because he has the \\"fluffiest tail in all of the multiverse\\". Nick then complains to the voice that his tail is not *THAT* fluffy, and then the voice says something like \\"Oops, that's not the reason. The true reason? Lol. Because...lol.\\". After more confusion on Nick, wondering why the voice would choose him because of meme culture, Nick then wakes up in his bed, realizing that it was all just a dream he had because he was sick since he accidentally ate an expired carrot","output":"Title: \\"Nick Wilde and the Multiversal Mansion\\" In Zootopia, where animals of every shape and size lived in harmony, Officer Judy Hopps and her partner in crime-solving (and occasional crime-committing) Nick Wilde, embarked on an adventure quite unlike any other they had experienced before. It was a tepid autumn evening when they stumbled upon an oddity nestled beyond the remotest edge of the Rainforest District – a strange, abandoned mansion wrapped in an oppressive silence. Curiosity got the better of them, and with Judy's astute resolve and Nick's cavalier attitude, they pushed open the creaky, timeworn doors of the mansion. The dim light of their flashlights led them through cavernous halls coated in dust, rooms full of forgotten treasures, and past portraits that seemed to follow them with their eyes—a rudimentary trick of light and perspective, Judy mused. As the echo of their steps mingled with the rustling of critters unseen, it was clear that the mansion held secrets, whispering through the cobwebs. Nick, with an eye for finding trouble—or perhaps trouble's eye for finding him—was drawn to a peculiar room, unlike the rest. Here, countless objects and machinery were strewn haphazardly as if disposed of in haste. And then, there it was, in the center of the disarray; a control panel adorned with many red buttons, each pleading to be pressed. Nick's paw itched with temptation. Against Judy's cautious words of reason, Nick chose a button at random and pressed it, more out of reflex than any conscious decision. The room shuddered, and silence took an eerie grip. Then, suddenly, a voice thundered from above, reverberating through the walls, \\"Behold, for you have awakened ancient powers, Nicholas Piberius Wilde! You are now the Great Legendary King of the Multiverse!\\" Startled, then baffled, Nick scowled upwards. \\"Uh, voice from above, why me?\\" he asked, preparing himself for a speech about bravery or cunning. \\"Because,\\" the voice boomed, \\"you have the fluffiest tail in all of the multiverse!\\" \\"My tail is not *that* fluffy,\\" Nick retorted, tail instinctively puffing up in vexation. A pause followed, then the voice chuckled, \\"Oops, that's not the reason. The true reason? Lol. Because...lol.\\" \\"Lol? Because...lol?!\\" Nick echoed, his confusion turning to annoyance. \\"You've got to be kidding me!\\" There was no further explanation, only an ethereal laughter that faded into the recesses of the mansion. Nick's head spun, the walls seemed to close in, and everything started to dim as his thoughts blurred into a haze. Then everything went black. Nick jolted awake in his bed, his forehead damp with sweat, his body warmed by a mild fever. Beside him on the nightstand was a half-eaten carrot, outdated by weeks, and a culprit in his peculiar nocturnal escapade. The previous night's events had been nothing but a vivid, fever-induced dream tangled with the very credible worry of being internet meme material. \\"Never again,\\" he muttered to himself, pulling the covers over his head, resolving to stick to dining in well-reputed establishments, and firmly deciding to ignore any red buttons he may encounter in dreams or otherwise. Judy, who had been checking up on him, cracked a smile at her partner's mumbled delirium. It was just another extraordinary day in Zootopia, where even dreams could be as wild as the city they called home."},{"instruction":"Beautiful weather phenemenoms really interest me, especially the \\"Sunrise/Set with Partial Cloud Coverage\\". The kind I like is where the clouds are really thick and cover 90% of the sky, making the world under look like its nighttime from the beaming sun","output":"Sunrises and sunsets with partial cloud coverage can create some of the most visually stunning and memorable sky displays. The scenario you described, with thick clouds covering most of the sky while the sun shines through an open space, is indeed a dramatic and beautiful phenomenon. Here's a bit more detail about what's happening during such an event: 1. Dynamic Lighting: As the sun rises or sets, its light travels through more of the Earth's atmosphere due to the angle of the sun relative to the observer. This increased distance scatters more blue and violet light, allowing reds, oranges, and yellows to dominate the sky's color palette. 2. Cloud Contrast: Thick, dark clouds can act as a contrasting backdrop that accentuates the brightness and colors of the sunlight. They can also create a canopy effect, with the underside of the clouds reflecting the vibrant colors, leading to an amplified and diffuse glow that seems to illuminate the entire sky. 3. Shadows and Highlights: The interaction of sunlight with clouds creates a dynamic range of shadows and highlights. The sun, shining through gaps in the clouds, can create crepuscular rays (also known as \\"God rays\\"), which are beams of sunlight that appear to radiate from the point in the sky where the sun is located. This effect can add a sense of depth and three-dimensionality to the sky, making the scene even more dramatic. 4. Silhouetting: With the sun near the horizon and partially obscured by clouds, objects on the ground (such as trees, buildings, and mountains) can become silhouetted against the bright sky. This silhouette effect can add a layer of visual interest and help to frame the sun's display. 5. Color Interplay: When the thick clouds are dense enough to create a near-nighttime darkness below, they can also drastically alter the perceived colors of the surrounding environment. This can lead to an interplay between the warm tones of the sunlit spots and the cool, dimly lit areas under the clouds, creating striking contrasts that are visually captivating. Appreciating the beauty of natural phenomena such as these requires both the right atmospheric conditions and a keen eye for the subtleties of light and color. Fascination with these events crosses cultures and historical periods, inspiring countless works of art, photography, and moments of reflection for observers around the world. To capture or witness these events at their best, it's essential to be in the right place at the right time, often involving a bit of luck and planning based on weather forecasts."},{"instruction":"I also like the effect when the sun's light goes through clouds creating a specific color, essentially making the entire world have a giant filter of this color","output":"The effect you're describing is a beautiful atmospheric phenomenon, where sunlight passing through clouds can indeed cast a distinct hue over the landscape, effectively acting like a giant filter. This happens because clouds and particles in the atmosphere can scatter sunlight in different ways, depending on their size, composition, and the wavelength of the light. Here's what contributes to these color-filtered landscapes during various times of the day: 1. **Rayleigh Scattering**: This occurs when sunlight interacts with tiny molecules in the atmosphere and scatters short-wavelength light (like blue and violet) more than longer wavelengths (like red and orange). Under certain conditions, this can give the entire sky a blue tint, which in turn can cast a cool, bluish light onto the landscape. 2. **Mie Scattering**: This occurs when sunlight interacts with larger particles in the atmosphere, such as water droplets in clouds, scattering all wavelengths of light more evenly. This can cause the sky and the light to appear more white or gray, as opposed to the deep blue caused by Rayleigh scattering. 3. **Sunrise and Sunset**: During sunrise and sunset, when the sun is low on the horizon, the light must pass through a larger section of the atmosphere. This causes shorter blue wavelengths to scatter out of the direct line of sight, leaving the longer red, orange, and yellow wavelengths to dominate the sky. If the sunlight streams through a gap in the clouds, it can bathe the landscape in a warm, golden, or rosy light, creating that filter-like effect over everything within view. 4. **Storm Clouds & Weather Conditions**: Thick storm clouds, which are heavy with moisture and often large enough to scatter all colors of light more or less equally, can create a dark, ominous lighting. When these clouds break just enough to let sunlight through, they can dramatically spotlight certain areas with intense color. 5. **Dust and Pollution**: The presence of dust, smoke, or pollution in the atmosphere can enhance reds and oranges, as these particles scatter short-wavelength light and allow more long-wavelength light to pass through. For instance, areas affected by wildfire smoke may experience eerie red or orange-filtered light during sunlight hours. 6. **Ice Crystals**: High-altitude clouds made of ice crystals, like cirrostratus clouds, can create halos and other optical effects, filtering sunlight in a way that can cast unique colors and patterns across the sky. This \\"giant filter\\" effect can be accentuated by local conditions. For example, your surroundings (like the color of buildings and nature) will look different under these various lighting conditions. Photographers and filmmakers often seek out these magical periods of the day, known as the golden or blue hour, to capture scenes bathed in this extraordinary light. Observing and appreciating these moments can be truly captivating, providing an immersive experience in the natural beauty of our world."},{"instruction":"during coloring, there's a difference between \\"hard\\" colors and \\"soft\\" colors. Hard colors are like the raw color values of a drawing application, exceedingly \\"harsh\\" and blinding. So how do you create soft colors, what's the required mix?","output":"Creating soft colors, as opposed to harsh or \\"hard\\" colors which can be overly saturated and bright, involves the use of desaturation, tinting, shading, and tone modulation. Soft colors tend to be more soothing to the eye and are often used to convey a sense of calm, subtlety, or realism in a piece of art. Here's how you might achieve these effects in various mediums, including digital and traditional painting: 1. **Desaturation**: Reducing the saturation of a color makes it less intense and more muted, which is fundamental in creating a soft color palette. In digital applications, this can be done by adjusting the saturation slider to decrease the intensity of the color. For traditional media, this can be achieved by mixing the color with its complement or with a neutral gray. 2. **Tinting**: Adding white to a color creates a tint, which lightens the color and reduces its saturation. Tints are useful for creating soft colors, as they exhibit less chromatic intensity and have a pastel-like quality. In digital media, you can add white by controlling the color's value settings or using a blending mode. In traditional painting, you would mix in white paint. 3. **Shading**: Mixing a color with black or a dark color creates a shade, which can also soften the appearance of a color when used sparingly. Be careful not to add too much black, as it can quickly overpower and muddy colors. Shades can reduce the harshness of a color by lowering its perceived luminosity and saturation. 4. **Tonality & Warmth**: Adding a touch of a warm color like yellow, peach, or brown can soften a color by giving it an earthy, less synthetic look. Alternatively, adding a touch of a cool color such as light blue or mint can give a color a soft, breezy feel. This is more nuanced than simply desaturating a color and can imbue a palette with a subtle emotional undertone. 5. **Mixing with Complements**: Mixing a color with a small amount of its complementary color (the color directly opposite on the color wheel) can reduce its intensity, resulting in a softer, more complex, and harmonious hue. This technique works well in both digital and traditional painting. 6. **Layering and Glazing**: In traditional painting, soft colors can be created by layering thin films of paint (glazes) over one another. This build-up of translucent layers can produce a depth and softness that's hard to achieve with direct mixing alone. 7. **Use of Mediums**: In traditional painting, mediums can be added to paint to increase transparency and flow, leading to softer color application. Mediums like glazing liquid (for acrylics) or linseed oil (for oil paints) can help achieve this effect. 8. **Avoiding High Contrast**: Soft colors often involve close values; avoiding high contrast within the hues can maintain softness. This means keeping the lights and darks of the same color close in tone. In digital arts, software programs like Adobe Photoshop, Procreate, or Clip Studio Paint offer tools to adjust colors with sliders for hue, saturation, and brightness, making it relatively easy to create soft colors. When working traditionally, achieving soft colors requires a more hands-on approach of physically mixing and blending colors on a palette or canvas. Whether you're working digitally or with traditional mediums, the key to creating soft colors lies in the manipulation of a color's saturation, brightness, and the balance between warm and cool tones. Becoming skilled at this requires practice and a good understanding of color theory."},{"instruction":"Why do I like fog and mist so much? it makes me feel safe and a weird sense of happy","output":"Your affinity for fog and mist, and the feelings of safety and happiness they evoke for you, might be influenced by a range of psychological, emotional, and personal factors. Here are a few reasons why fog and mist might have such positive effects on you: 1. **Atmospheric Comfort**: Fog and mist often soften the landscape, creating a quiet and serene atmosphere. This can result in a calming effect, as the shrouded environment feels more contained and less overwhelming. 2. **Mystery and Imagination**: The obscured views and hazy scenery caused by fog can stimulate the imagination, as it leaves room for the mind to wonder about what's beyond the visible. It can also add an element of mystery and intrigue to everyday surroundings, making the world feel more enchanting. 3. **Aesthetic Beauty**: Many people find a unique beauty in the ethereal and gentle quality of foggy landscapes. The way fog diffuses light can create a natural, softbox effect that is often sought after in photography and art due to its potential to transform ordinary scenes into something extraordinary. 4. **Personal Associations**: Positive personal memories or associations with foggy or misty conditions can trigger feelings of happiness. For example, if you had enjoyable experiences on foggy days in your childhood or during significant life events, these memories might be linked to your current emotional responses to fog. 5. **Sense of Isolation**: Fog naturally dampens noise and limits visibility, which can create a comforting sense of isolation or a feeling of detachment from the stresses of the outside world. This can be particularly appealing for those who are introspective or who seek solitude. 6. **Nostalgia and Sentimentality**: Certain weather conditions can evoke nostalgia. Fog might remind you of scenes from favorite books, movies, or works of art that you have a sentimental attachment to, enhancing your emotional experience. 7. **Psychological Shelter**: On a subconscious level, the limited visibility in foggy conditions can create a sensation akin to being wrapped in a protective cocoon. This may provide a psychological sense of shelter or a temporary escape from reality. 8. **Change of Pace**: Fog can disrupt the ordinary pace of life, forcing people to slow down and move with more deliberation. This change in the daily routine might be welcomed, particularly in a fast-paced and crowded environment. It's also important to recognize that these reactions are highly individual. While some people may find fog and mist to be calming or beautiful, others may experience them as gloomy or disorienting. Your personal preferences and temperament play a significant role in how you interpret and respond to different weather phenomena."},{"instruction":"theres a chance the world can become green in misty weather hwne theres a lot of vegetation, how come?","output":"When misty weather occurs in an area with abundant vegetation, you might experience what appears to be a greenish tinge to the surroundings. This can happen due to several reasons related to how mist interacts with light and the natural environment: 1. **Light Scattering**: Mist is composed of tiny water droplets suspended in the air. These droplets scatter light, but not all wavelengths of light scatter equally. Shorter wavelengths (like blue and green) scatter more effectively than longer wavelengths (like red). Since vegetation is typically green due to chlorophyll, the mist could enhance the scattering of green light from the plants, making the green coloring more prevalent in the landscape. 2. **Reflection and Diffusion**: The water droplets in the mist can reflect and diffuse the light reflected off the green leaves and plants. This reflection and diffusion can cause the surroundings to be bathed in a soft green glow when there is enough vegetation around. 3. **Saturation of Colors**: Moist conditions, including mist, can make colors appear more saturated. When plants are wet, their leaves can seem more vibrant because the layer of water can increase the surface's reflectivity, making the greens of plants look more intense. Additionally, the diffused light on overcast or misty days can reduce shadows and hotspots, leading to more evenly saturated colors in the vegetation. 4. **Visual Contrast**: On misty days, especially when the sky is overcast, the relative lack of strong sunlight can make colors seem more intense by comparison. The strong greens of vegetation might stand out against the muted colors of the sky and other less colorful elements, making the greenery more visually prominent. 5. **Psychological Perception**: The sensation of a green-tinged world in misty weather can also be partly psychological. Knowing that you are surrounded by a lush landscape may influence your perception, making you more aware of the greenness around you, especially as mist tends to create a more intimate and focused view of the immediate environment. Such conditions can have an enchanting effect, as the landscape not only appears greener but also takes on a mystical quality due to the veil of mist. The overall effect can transform familiar environments into something new and visually arresting, adding to one's appreciation of natural scenery."},{"instruction":"InterStellar The Martian The Matrix World War Z The Cove Dolphin Tale 1 & 2 Dolphin Island Inception American Sniper Train to Busan The Meg 1 & 2 Provide me similarly good movies","output":"Absolutely, based on the eclectic mix of movies you've provided which span across genres like science fiction, action, drama, documentary, and thriller, here are some movies you might find equally captivating: 1. **Science Fiction / Space Exploration:** - \\"Gravity\\" (2013) - \\"Arrival\\" (2016) - \\"Ad Astra\\" (2019) - \\"Moon\\" (2009) - \\"Contact\\" (1997) - \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" (1968) - \\"The Expanse\\" (TV Series, 2015-2022) 2. **Survival / Adventure:** - \\"Cast Away\\" (2000) - \\"127 Hours\\" (2010) - \\"Life of Pi\\" (2012) - \\"Into the Wild\\" (2007) - \\"The Revenant\\" (2015) 3. **Intelligent Action / Thriller:** - \\"Minority Report\\" (2002) - \\"Blade Runner 2049\\" (2017) - \\"Edge of Tomorrow\\" (2014) - \\"A Quiet Place\\" (2018) - \\"Tenet\\" (2020) 4. **Zombie / Apocalyptic:** - \\"28 Days Later\\" (2002) and its sequel \\"28 Weeks Later\\" (2007) - \\"I Am Legend\\" (2007) - \\"The Road\\" (2009) - \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" (2004) 5. **Documentary / Animal Welfare:** - \\"Blackfish\\" (2013) - \\"Virunga\\" (2014) - \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" (2006) and its sequel \\"An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power\\" (2017) 6. **Inspirational / True Stories:** - \\"Soul Surfer\\" (2011) - \\"The Blind Side\\" (2009) - \\"Hidden Figures\\" (2016) - \\"Sully\\" (2016) 7. **Mind-Bending / Psychological:** - \\"Shutter Island\\" (2010) - \\"Memento\\" (2000) - \\"The Prestige\\" (2006) - \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" (2004) - \\"Donnie Darko\\" (2001) 8. **War / Military Drama:** - \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" (1998) - \\"Hacksaw Ridge\\" (2016) - \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" (2012) - \\"Lone Survivor\\" (2013) 9. **Horror / Creature Feature:** - \\"Jurassic Park\\" (1993) and its sequels - \\"Jaws\\" (1975) - \\"Cloverfield\\" (2008) Most of these suggestions are notable for either their critical acclaim, popularity, thematic depth, or visual spectacle and should provide a similarly immersive viewing experience to the titles you've enjoyed."},{"instruction":"sympy transformée de laplace avec un système d'équations différentiel","output":"La transformée de Laplace d'un système d'équations différentielles peut être effectuée en appliquant la transformée de Laplace à chaque équation différentielle et en les résolvant simultanément.

Gary and Larry were not your average security detail; the brothers had dreams bigger than their mundane job of monitoring the comings and goings of the asylum. They were tired of the sirens, the iron bars, the observed full moons that came and went without a howl. They craved the spotlight, the thrill of the stage, and the applause of an appreciative crowd. One evening, as the Zootopia night cast elongated shadows across their path, the brothers shared a moment of unity under the silvery gaze of the full moon. \\"Gary, I can't take it anymore, buddy,\\" groaned Larry, his tail drooping along the cold concrete. Gary nodded, his yellow eyes meeting Larry's with a shared truth. \\"I hear ya, brother. We're not cut out for this. We're artists, soulful and unfettered.\\" Thus, the two wolves shed their uniforms for the last time, venturing into the city with passion in their hearts and a dream twinkling like the stars above. They formed a band, wild and free – Cliffside Asylum, a name to honor the past they were leaving behind. Their first album was raw, a celebration of their heritage. The album, \\"Howl at the Heart,\\" was nothing but pure, authentic howling. To Gary and Larry, it was the sound of liberation. Tracks like \\"Moonlit Lament\\" and \\"Siren's Serenade\\" filled the airwaves of Zootopian radio, much to the dismay of the city's residents. Complaints flooded in as mammals from all corners of the metropolis reported strange side effects ranging from shattered glass to \\"melted ears.\\" The brothers were crushed. The law suits rolled in, and even their single \\"Cry of the Wild\\" was banned due to public safety concerns. With heavy hearts, Gary and Larry retreated to the studio, setting out to right their wrongs.

There was \\"Sorry for the Howling,\\" \\"Muffled Regrets,\\" and a heart-wrenching ballad, \\"Silent Nights.\\" To their surprise, Zootopia loved it. Critics praised the album for its vulnerability and innovation. Mammals found solace in the melancholic apologies, interpreting them as commentary on the modern struggle of finding one's place in the world. Gary and Larry were propelled to stardom, their bank accounts blooming as fast as the flash of paparazzi cameras. They became not just the richest wolves in Zootopia but the most beloved. They donated to ear-health charities, funded silence retreats, and even launched a line of noise-canceling headphones. To top it off, amidst the hustle and glory, \\"Cliffside Asylum\\" became not just a band, but a bridge between species. Their music, a symphony of howls and heartfelt apologies, became anthems for those yearning to follow their dreams no matter the hurdles, because sometimes, a sincere apology is the most harmonious note one can play."},{"instruction":"What Would An Stereotypical Version of Berlin During 1946 Look Like?","output":"A stereotypical depiction of Berlin in 1946 would be one characterized by widespread destruction and the aftermath of World War II. Here are several elements that might be included in such a portrayal: 1. **Devastated Landscape**: The city would be littered with rubble from bombed-out buildings and crumbling infrastructure. Much of the city had been reduced to ruins following years of Allied bombing raids and the final Battle of Berlin. 2. **Divided City**: By 1946, Berlin was occupied by the four Allied powers—The United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and France—each controlling a sector of the city. The beginning signs of the division that would lead to the Cold War and the eventual partition of the city could be seen in the different administrative styles and living conditions across sectors. 3. **Military Presence**: There would be a noticeable presence of Allied soldiers patrolling the streets and manning checkpoints, especially at the boundaries between the different sectors. 4. **Displaced Population**: Many Berliners would be living in temporary shelters or damaged buildings due to the loss of their homes during the war. You would see a population struggling with the loss and trauma of the conflict, including many widows, orphans, and wounded veterans. 5. **Food Shortages and Rationing**: The city’s residents would likely be dealing with severe shortages of food, clean water, and basic necessities. People might be seen queuing for rations or seeking goods on the black market. 6. **Trümmerfrauen (Rubble Women)**: Women, often referred to as 'Trümmerfrauen' in Germany, were commonly seen clearing away rubble and helping to rebuild the city, as many of the men were either dead, wounded, or imprisoned. 7. **Refugees and Prisoners of War (POWs)**: There would be an influx of people returning from the countryside, POWs being repatriated, and a mix of refugees and displaced persons from across Europe seeking safety or passage to other destinations. 8. **The Struggle for Normalcy**: Despite the harsh conditions, residents would be trying to restore some sense of normality to their lives, re-opening shops, attending makeshift schools, and participating in activities that could offer a respite from the difficult realities of post-war life. 9. **Political Tensions**: The ideological divide between the Soviet sector and the Western sectors would be palpable, with different newspapers, political groups, and policing methods. This could often lead to conflicts and a sense of unease among the populace. 10. **Reconstruction Efforts**: There would be initial efforts at reconstruction, with emphasis on clearing the rubble and beginning the process of rebuilding key infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, and housing. It’s important to note that the above description simplifies a complex situation and that the actual experiences of Berliners in 1946 were varied and nuanced. Personal accounts and historical records offer deeper insights into the realities of life in post-war Berlin."},{"instruction":"What Would An 20% Satirical Version of Berlin During 1946 Look Like?","output":"A 20% satirical version of Berlin in 1946 would still retain a level of realism but would incorporate subtle exaggerations or ironic twists that highlight the absurdity or contradictions inherent in the situation. Here's what that might look like: 1. **Over-the-Top Rubble**: While real photographs depict mountains of rubble, a satirical depiction might show Berliners almost nonchalantly navigating ludicrously steep piles of debris as if they were part of the city's natural landscape or engaging in \\"rubble sports.\\" 2. **Sardonic Division**: The four sectors could be parodied by having wildly different themes, such as the American sector setting up a mini Hollywood, the British sector hosting constant tea parties amidst the ruins, the French sector turned into a parody of a Parisian café culture, and the Soviet sector with exaggerated propaganda posters and Red Army soldiers inexplicably doing ballet in the streets. 3. **Make-believe Markets**: A humorous light could be shed on the black market situation, with residents trading in ridiculous barter systems—perhaps someone offering a grand piano in exchange for a loaf of bread or people setting up faux \\"ruble\\" or \\"dollar\\" stores selling odd trinkets as if they were high-value goods. 4. **Caricatured Military**: The Allied military presence could be exaggerated with soldiers from each sector patrolling the boundaries in comedic fashion, perhaps using slapstick methods to guard their turf or engaging in mock-spy antics reminiscent of an exaggerated Cold War film. 5. **Ration Runway**: Food shortages would still be present, but in a satirical lens, you might see a fashion show where the latest trend is \\"ration chic,\\" with models strutting down the catwalk in outfits made from ration books and potato sacks. 6. **The Rubble Women Reality Show**: Instead of a somber portrayal of the Trümmerfrauen, they might be depicted in a quasi-reality TV setting, with comical challenges to clear the most rubble or to rebuild a landmark with quirky constraints or limited tools. 7. **POW Shenanigans**: Instead of a realistic return of POWs, there might be a humorous subplot in which returning soldiers have bizarre tales of escape or are constantly getting lost in the new, ambiguous cityscape. 8. **Disco Amidst Destruction**: The struggle for normalcy could be satirized with people attempting to bring back pre-war nightlife and end up dancing in half-destroyed ballrooms or starting impromptu parties in bomb craters. 9. **Political Farce**: The political tensions could be depicted through a series of comical misunderstandings and nonsensical diplomatic incidents, like absurd debates over who owns which pile of rubble or exaggerated differences in the administration of each sector. 10. **Reconstruction Roulette**: Reconstruction efforts could be portrayed satirically with planners and architects presenting wildly impractical or avant-garde plans for the new Berlin, competing for the most outlandish designs while the practical needs of the city are humorously overlooked. It's crucial to remember that satire should be approached sensitively, especially concerning historical events that involve deep human suffering. The aim would be to critique or comment on the absurdities of the political and social situation without belittling the experiences of those who lived through the events of the time."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Let's look at how Los Angeles and New York City during 1976 might serve as settings for Heaven and Hell. **Heaven as Los Angeles in 1976:** Los Angeles during this time could be depicted as a sun-drenched paradise, reflecting some aspects of a heavenly environment. Here's how it might be envisioned: - **Celestial Hollywood**: The film industry might be likened to the power of creation, where dreams become reality. In Heaven's version of Hollywood, everyone could be a star, and movies would inspire, uplift, and provide transcendental experiences. - **Eternal Sunshine**: The consistent, warm weather would reflect a state of eternal bliss, with no dark or dreary days to dampen one's spirits. - **Angelic Music Scene**: The music of LA in the 70s, which included rock, pop, and the burgeoning punk scene, could reflect the choirs of angels, with legendary concerts and eternal music festivals. - **Divine Natural Beauty**: With access to both beaches and mountains, this version of Heaven would allow for endless appreciation of natural wonders, hiking in pristine hills, and surfing in the perfect wave. - **Culinary Elysium**: The diverse food scene offers a heavenly feast of flavors from all over the world, with abundant fresh fruits and vegetables typical of California's agriculture. **Hell as New York City in 1976:** Conversely, New York City during the same period had challenges that could be interpreted as hellish in the context of this creative scenario. - **Infernal Metropolis**: In the mid-70s, New York was facing fiscal crisis, high crime rates, and widespread urban decay, which could be seen as a landscape of despair, mimicking the chaos and suffering associated with Hell. - **Subways of Hades**: The graffiti-filled, often unsafe and unreliable subways could be seen as demonic chariots shuttling lost souls through a labyrinth of dark and dangerous tunnels. - **Heatwave and Blackouts**: The summer of 1977 (close to 1976) was marked by a significant heatwave and a major blackout, which led to looting and disorder – an easy parallel to the landscapes of fire and brimstone and the chaos associated with them. - **Times Square's Temptations**: During the 70s, Times Square was notorious for its adult entertainment and seediness, a stark contrast to its present-day sanitized look. It could represent the temptations and vices that are often associated with depictions of Hell. - **Squalor and Desolation**: With many parts of the city in decline, neighborhoods like the Lower East Side, Harlem, and the South Bronx could be viewed as hellish environments, where poverty and neglect wrought a landscape devoid of hope. In a creative sense, these urban environments of the 1970s could metaphorically represent the dualities of good and evil, paradise and damnation, contrasting the laid-back, dreamlike qualities of Los Angeles with the harsh, gritty reality of New York City at the time. However, it's critical to remember that both cities also offered vibrant culture, diversity, and a wide array of human experiences, which could just as easily be interpreted from a more positive or nuanced perspective."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Learning Objective [SPQ-2.B]: Explain the quantitative relationship between the elemental composition by mass and the composition of substances in a mixture. Corresponding Essential Knowledge Points: SPQ-2.B.1 While pure substances contain molecules or formula units of a single type, mixtures contain molecules or formula units of two or more types, whose relative proportions can vary. SPQ-2.B.2 Elemental analysis can be used to determine the relative numbers of atoms in a substance and to determine its purity Based on this learning objective and the associated essential knowledge points, could you [explain/elaborate on/provide examples for/drill down into the key concepts of] these topics and [how they relate to each other/their practical application/their significance in the broader context of AP Chemistry/possible types of exam questions they could lead to]?","output":"Certainly! Let's break down these concepts and understand how they tie into the wider field of chemistry, along with examples and potential AP Chemistry exam questions. **SPQ-2.B.1: Mixtures and Pure Substances** *A pure substance is a form of matter that has a constant composition and properties throughout. Examples include distilled water (H2O) and sodium chloride (NaCl). Each molecule or formula unit in a pure substance is identical to every other one.* *A mixture, on the other hand, contains two or more different types of molecules or formula units, and these can vary in their relative proportions. For example, air is a mixture of different gases like nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and others in varying amounts.* In the context of AP Chemistry, you should understand how to differentiate between a pure substance and a mixture, and be able to provide examples of each. Example AP question: *Describe one chemical and one physical method to separate a mixture of sand and table salt.* (You could answer by describing filtration for the physical method and dissolution followed by evaporation for the chemical method.) **SPQ-2.B.2: Elemental Analysis** *Elemental analysis involves determining the percentage by mass of each element in a compound. This is a fundamental concept in stoichiometry, where the calculations often depend on the mass ratios of elements in a compound.* For example, if a compound is composed of 40% carbon, 6.7% hydrogen, and 53.3% oxygen by mass, we can use these percentages to infer the empirical formula of the compound. You should be familiar with how to perform such calculations. Elemental analysis can also be used to assess the purity of a substance by comparing the measured elemental composition with what is expected for a pure compound. Example AP question: *You have performed an elemental analysis on a sample suspected to be pure ethyl alcohol (C2H5OH). The analysis indicates that the sample is composed of 50% carbon, 13% hydrogen, and 37% oxygen by mass. Is the sample pure? Justify your answer with calculations.* (You'd calculate the expected percentage composition of pure ethyl alcohol and compare it to the given data to answer this question.) **Significance and Application** Understanding the composition of mixtures is crucial for predicting their behavior and properties — important for creating alloys, pharmaceuticals, and even everyday products like food and drinks. Elemental analysis is not just theoretical; it is used in research and industry to ensure quality control, to verify the purity of substances, and even to identify unknown compounds. **Relating SPQ-2.B.1 to SPQ-2.B.2** The quantitative relationship discussed in SPQ-2.B comes down to being able to express what portion of a mixture's mass is made up of each component substance. This requires an understanding of both the identities of substances in the mixture (SPQ-2.B.1) and the ways in which we can analyze substances to determine their elemental composition (SPQ-2.B.2). To relate these points directly: - *When you have a mixture, you can use techniques like chromatography, distillation, or spectroscopy to separate and analyze individual components (SPQ-2.B.1).* - *After separating, elemental analysis comes into play to evaluate the composition of those individual substances (SPQ-2.B.2).* Through these methods, chemists can quantify the contribution of each element to the substance or mixture as a whole, whether it's for academic purposes, such as in a laboratory setting, or for practical applications, such as the production of medicine where precise chemical makeup is crucial. On your AP Chemistry exam, you might be asked to analyze a data set from an experiment, calculate empirical formulas, determine purity, or explain how a specific analytical technique can be used for elemental analysis. Familiarity with these concepts enables you to tackle such questions with confidence."},{"instruction":"INSERT INTO autos (color, precio, placa, anio, id_marca) VALUES ('Rojo', 15000.00, 'ABC-123', 2019, 1), - siguiendo esto has un registro de esta forma - <ws:registrar> <!--Optional:--> <auto> <!--Optional:--> <anio>?</anio> <!--Optional:--> <color>?</color> <!--Optional:--> <id_auto>?</id_auto> <!--Optional:--> <marca> <!--Optional:--> <id_marca>?</id_marca> <!--Optional:--> <nombre>?</nombre> </marca> <!--Optional:--> <placa>?</placa> <!--Optional:--> <precio>?</precio> </auto> </ws:registrar>","output":"Para realizar un registro siguiendo el formato proporcionado, sustituirías los signos de interrogación (?) con los valores pertinentes como se muestra a continuación (ten en cuenta que falta el valor para \`id_auto\`, así que lo he marcado como desconocido - tendrías que reemplazarlo con el valor correcto): \`\`\`xml <ws:registrar> <auto> <anio>2019</anio> <color>Rojo</color> <id_auto>DESCONOCIDO</id_auto> <!-- Reemplazar con el valor correcto del ID del auto --> <marca> <id_marca>1</id_marca> <nombre>DESCONOCIDO</nombre> <!-- Reemplazar con el nombre de la marca correspondiente al id_marca 1 --> </marca> <placa>ABC-123</placa> <precio>15000.00</precio> </auto> </ws:registrar> \`\`\` Es importante que reemplaces \`DESCONOCIDO\` por los valores apropiados.

It's important to remember that such terms are subjective and can depend on various factors, including crime rates, economic prosperity, social conditions, and overall quality of life. During the early 1990s, many American cities were undergoing transformations. Some were on the rise due to economic growth, gentrification, and revitalization efforts, while others struggled with crime, economic decline, and social unrest. A possible 'Heaven' city could have been: - Seattle, Washington: Despite some economic challenges, Seattle in the 1990s was starting to feel the impact of the tech boom with companies like Microsoft gaining prominence. It also had a relatively high quality of life and a growing cultural scene, in part due to the grunge music movement. For 'Hell,' considerations might include: - Detroit, Michigan or Gary, Indiana: Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, these cities faced significant economic struggles due to the decline of the manufacturing industry and the auto industry, specifically in Detroit. High crime rates, including violence and property crimes, along with population loss and urban decay, made parts of these cities particularly tough places to live during that time. - Los Angeles, California, especially in the context of the Rodney King riots in 1992. While L.A. has always been a city of stark contrasts between wealth and poverty, the riots were emblematic of the social tensions and issues that can create a 'Hell'-like scenario. Remember that the designation of any city as a 'Heaven' or 'Hell' is greatly influenced by individual perspectives and circumstances, as well as the lens through which we consider these historical contexts. Furthermore, cities are dynamic, and their statuses often change over the years due to economic shifts, policy changes, and cultural evolution."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Learning Objective [SPQ-2.A]: Explain the quantitative relationship between the elemental composition by mass and the empirical formula of a pure substance. Corresponding Essential Knowledge Points: SPQ-2.A.1 Some pure substances are composed of individual molecules, while others consist of atoms or ions held together in fixed proportions as described by a formula unit. SPQ-2.A.2 According to the law of definite proportions, the ratio of the masses of the constituent elements in any pure sample of that compound is always the same. SPQ-2.A.3 The chemical formula that lists the lowest whole number ratio of atoms of the elements in a compound is the empirical formula.

Let's break down the learning objective and corresponding essential knowledge points, citing examples and explaining potential implications for AP Chemistry exam questions. # SPQ-2.A.1: Composition of Pure Substances Some substances consist of discrete molecules, such as water (H2O) or carbon dioxide (CO2), where the atoms are bonded covalently to form distinct molecular units. Others, like ionic compounds (e.g., sodium chloride or NaCl), don't have individual molecules but instead consist of a repeating pattern of ions (Na+ and Cl-) in a crystal lattice, represented by formula units that indicate the simplest ratio of ions. **Example**: In a water molecule, there are exactly 2 hydrogen atoms for every 1 oxygen atom. For sodium chloride, it is represented by the formula unit NaCl, indicating a 1:1 ratio of sodium ions to chloride ions. **Possible Exam Question**: Describe the difference between a molecule and a formula unit, providing an example of each. # SPQ-2.A.2: Law of Definite Proportions The law of definite proportions, also known as the law of constant composition, states that a chemical compound always contains its component elements in fixed (i.e., definite) ratio by mass, regardless of its source or how it was prepared. This means that every pure sample of a given compound will contain the same elements in the same proportions by mass. **Example**: Pure water always consists of hydrogen and oxygen in a mass ratio of roughly 1:8, which corresponds to the fact that oxygen is about 16 times heavier than hydrogen (masses of H and O are approximately 1 u and 16 u, respectively). **Possible Exam Question**: A sample of a compound contains 4 grams of hydrogen and 32 grams of oxygen. Show that these data are consistent with the law of definite proportions. # SPQ-2.A.3: Empirical Formulas The empirical formula represents the simplest whole number ratio of atoms of each element in a compound. It does not necessarily reflect the actual number of atoms in a molecule (that would be the molecular formula), but instead reflects the lowest ratio in which the elements combine. **Example**: Glucose has a molecular formula of C6H12O6, but its empirical formula is CH2O, reflecting the simplest whole number ratio of carbon to hydrogen to oxygen, which is 1:2:1. **Possible Exam Question**: Determine the empirical formula of a compound that contains 40% carbon, 6.7% hydrogen, and 53.3% oxygen by mass. # Practical Application and Significance Understanding the relationship between mass composition and empirical formulas is crucial when conducting quantitative chemical analyses, such as: - Determining the purity of a substance. - Performing stoichiometric calculations, which are vital in preparing solutions and reacting compounds in precise amounts. - Utilizing empirical formulas as a first step in deducing the molecular formula of a compound when combined with the molecular weight. # Potential Types of Exam Questions Exam questions might include: - Determining the empirical formula from mass percent composition or from combustion analysis data. - Calculating the mass percent composition of a compound given a chemical formula. - Explaining concepts related to molecular and formula units, the law of definite proportions, and how to derive empirical formulas. - Predicting the possible empirical formula of a compound based on a given set of data related to elemental percentages or masses of reactants and products. Understanding these concepts is fundamental for success in AP Chemistry and builds a foundation for more complex ideas in chemistry. Good luck with your studies and your exam!"},{"instruction":"you haven't mentioned hydrate analysis?","output":"Apologies for the oversight. Hydrate analysis is indeed an important topic that ties in with the concepts relating to empirical formula determination. Hydrates are compounds that have a specific number of water molecules bound within their crystal structure. The formula of a hydrate is written with a dot to denote the separation between the compound and the water molecules, such as \`CuSO4 · 5H2O\` (copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate). In hydrate analysis, the goal is often to determine the empirical formula of the hydrate, which includes finding the ratio of the compound to water molecules. This typically involves heating the hydrate to remove the water (through evaporation), and then comparing the mass of the anhydrous compound (without water) to the mass of the water lost. The procedure can be summarized as follows: 1. **Mass Initial Hydrate**: Weigh a sample of the hydrate. 2. **Heat to Remove Water**: Heat the sample to evaporate the water. The substance left over is the anhydrous form of the compound. 3. **Mass Anhydrous Compound**: Weigh the anhydrous compound after heating. 4. **Calculate Mass of Water Lost**: Subtract the mass of the anhydrous compound from the mass of the initial hydrate. 5. **Determine Moles**: Determine the number of moles of anhydrous compound and the moles of water lost. 6. **Find Lowest Whole Number Ratio**: Divide the number of moles of water by the number of moles of the anhydrous compound to find the ratio and determine the empirical formula of the hydrate. **Example**: If a sample of hydrate \`CuSO4 · xH2O\` loses 2.7 g of water upon heating, leaving 8.0 g of anhydrous \`CuSO4\`, you could first calculate the moles of water lost (2.7 g divided by 18.015 g/mol for water) and the moles of \`CuSO4\` (8.0 g divided by the molar mass of anhydrous \`CuSO4\`), and then find the simplest whole number ratio of \`CuSO4\` to \`H2O\`. **Possible Exam Question**: You are given a sample of a hydrate of magnesium sulfate \`MgSO4 · xH2O\`. After heating, the mass of the hydrate decreases from 5.00 g to 2.56 g. Determine the empirical formula of the hydrate. In summary, hydrate analysis is a practical application of empirical formula determination, and it showcases the law of definite proportions. By understanding how to conduct these analyses, you can determine not only the chemical composition of a substance without water but also the fixed number of water molecules associated with each formula unit of the compound."},{"instruction":"how can i fix my current prompt in order to generate hydrate anaylsis as well in the future when I ask a model like chat gpt.

Let's delve into each of these aspects: **Elemental Composition and Empirical Formulas:** To understand the empirical formula of a substance, we need to know the elemental composition of the sample by mass. The empirical formula represents the simplest whole-number ratio of the elements in a compound. For example, the empirical formula for glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆) is CH₂O because the relative number of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms can be simplified to a 1:2:1 ratio. **Individual Molecules and Formula Units:** Some pure substances exist as discrete molecules, like water (H₂O) or methane (CH₄). Others, such as ionic compounds like sodium chloride (NaCl), do not exist as individual molecules but are represented by a formula unit which reflects the simplest ratio of the ions within an extended structure or lattice. **Law of Definite Proportions:** This law, also known as Proust's Law, states that a chemical compound will always contain exactly the same proportion of elements by mass. For instance, water will always have 8 grams of oxygen for every 1 gram of hydrogen. **Empirical Formula Determination in Laboratory Settings:** In practice, chemists determine the empirical formula of a compound by measuring the masses of each constituent element. This can be done by decomposing a compound into its elements or, more commonly, through a combustion analysis for organic compounds which gives the amounts of carbon dioxide and water produced, from which the amounts of carbon and hydrogen can be inferred. The starting point for many of these analyses is a technique called gravimetric analysis, which involves the precise weighing of the sample and its constituents. **Application and Significance:** The empirical formula is crucial for many areas of chemistry. In the pharmaceutical industry, for example, understanding the empirical formula of a drug is key to its synthesis and quality control. In environmental chemistry, empirical formulas play a part in understanding pollutants and their impacts. **Relation to Each Other and Broader Context:** All these concepts are connected by the underlying stoichiometry of chemical compounds. Stoichiometry is the quantitative relationship between reactants and products in a chemical reaction. Knowing the empirical formula of a substance allows chemists to predict the outcomes of reactions and to quantify the amounts of materials needed or produced. **Possible AP Chemistry Exam Questions:** An AP Chemistry exam may ask a variety of questions related to empirical formulas and the elemental composition of compounds: 1. **Experimental Data Analysis:** Students might be given data from a lab experiment (for example, masses of carbon dioxide and water produced from the combustion of an organic compound) and then be asked to determine the empirical formula of the compound. 2. **Practical Laboratory Skills:** A question might describe a procedure for carrying out a gravimetric analysis and then ask students to predict the mass of a precipitate formed, or to identify sources of error in an experiment aimed at determining the empirical formula. 3. **Conceptual Understanding:** Students could be asked questions requiring them to understand the law of definite proportions or to predict the empirical formula of a compound based on its percent composition. 4. **Stoichiometry Problems:** These problems might provide students with masses or percentages of elements in a compound, requiring them to calculate the simplest whole-number ratio of atoms and hence the empirical formula. In summary, the empirical formula is essential to the understanding of material composition in chemistry. It relates directly to the law of definite proportions and has practical applications in laboratory settings, where it helps to predict and analyze the results of chemical reactions and processes. Understanding these concepts equips students with the tools to solve complex problems on their AP Chemistry exam and in their future scientific endeavors."},{"instruction":"Imagine a brainstorm of creative ideas and with them inspiring you to write a list of different examples of \\"prompts generators\\" suitable for application in an image-generating AI and in which they carry in their contexts the indication of creating a rendered image describing the details and visual elements of a design that shows the textures of gourmet ice creams adding a fun style that impacts","output":"Certainly!

It didn't matter what she did or how hard she tried to fit in, the people of the small town of Willow Creek always seemed to find a reason to despise her. It all started when she first moved to Willow Creek with her parents. She was a shy and reserved girl, who kept to herself and found solace in books and music. However, the town's residents saw her as standoffish and aloof, and rumors soon spread that she thought she was better than everyone else. As time went on, Lila tried to prove them wrong by participating in school activities and volunteering in the community. But no matter what she did, she was met with cold stares and whispered insults behind her back. It seemed like the more she tried to fit in, the more the townspeople pushed her away. One day, during a town event, Lila was publicly humiliated in front of everyone. A group of mean girls from her school started a rumor that she had been spreading lies about them, leading to a confrontation that left Lila in tears. From that day on, she was labeled as a troublemaker and a liar, and even her own classmates turned their backs on her. Despite the constant hate and isolation, Lila refused to give up. She found comfort in her art and music, using them as an escape from the harsh reality of her life in Willow Creek. And slowly but surely, she began to make small connections with others who appreciated her for who she truly was. One day, a new family moved into town and their daughter, Emma, befriended Lila. Emma saw past the rumors and the hate, and quickly became Lila's closest friend. Together, they faced the town's judgment and stood up against the bullying, showing everyone that Lila was just a misunderstood teenager who deserved love and acceptance like everyone else. As time passed, the people of Willow Creek started to see Lila in a new light.

Interpreting the concept of heaven can vary significantly depending on cultural, religious, and personal beliefs. For the purpose of this question, if we consider 'heaven' as a metaphor for an idealized version of these cities during that period, we can reflect on what might be viewed as 'heavenly' aspects of Los Angeles and San Francisco during the early '90s. **Los Angeles - 1991-1992:** - **Cultural Events:** LA is known for its entertainment industry. A heavenly aspect during this period could be the golden era of film and television production, with classic movies and shows being made and the city hosting glamorous events like the Oscars. - **Sports Achievements:** Sports fans might remember this period as a great one for Los Angeles, with the Lakers being a dominant force in the NBA, although they didn't win a championship in those particular years. - **Music Scene:** Los Angeles has always had a vibrant music scene, and in the early '90s, it was home to many emerging artists and bands, particularly in the genres of rock, hip hop, and pop. **San Francisco - 1991-1992:** - **Technological Innovation:** In the early '90s, San Francisco, and more broadly the Silicon Valley area, was on the cusp of the tech revolution. A 'heavenly' aspect of this could be seen in the optimism and innovation associated with the tech industry during this time. - **Cultural Diversity:** San Francisco is celebrated for its cultural diversity and inclusiveness. It is often held up as an ideal of progressive values, and that inclusive culture was already strong in the early '90s. - **Scenic Beauty:** Often considered one of the most beautiful cities in the United States, San Francisco's stunning views, iconic landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge, and its unique cityscape could be seen as heavenly. It's important to remember, though, that 1991-1992 was not without its difficulties for both cities: - **Los Angeles:** This time period includes the 1992 Los Angeles riots, which followed the acquittal of the police officers filmed beating Rodney King. This tragic event is certainly not part of the 'heavenly' narrative but a significant and sobering part of LA's history from that time. - **San Francisco:** The city, like many urban areas, faced issues such as homelessness, crime, and the continuing impact of the HIV/AIDS crisis. If you are referencing heaven in a more religious or spiritual sense, the interpretation would differ considerably, focusing on afterlife beliefs according to various religious traditions. This would not be directly related to the status of cities in a given historical period. For a more accurate and specific understanding of heaven in either a metaphorical or religious context during this time in Los Angeles and San Francisco, one would need to consider the events, culture, and social dynamics of the time more closely."},{"instruction":"write a character profile for someone with the sun in gemini, moon in capricorn, gemini ascendant, venus in taurus, mars in gemini, sun conjunct ascendant in the first house, mars in the first house","output":"Character Name: Alex Sterling **Sun in Gemini** - Alex exudes Gemini's signature duality and intellectual curiosity. They're a lively communicator, talkative, and always ready to engage in witty banter or an in-depth discussion about the latest trends or ideas. Alex's mind is their greatest asset; they're able to think on their feet and adapt to new situations with ease. They have a seemingly endless array of interests and hobbies, which they dive into with the enthusiasm of a child opening presents. **Moon in Capricorn** - Despite their outwardly bubbly personality, Alex has a serious, disciplined emotional core, thanks to their Capricorn moon. They may not wear their heart on their sleeve, preferring to keep their feelings under a controlled facade. Practical and goal-oriented, Alex approaches their emotions with a level-headedness that allows them to function efficiently, even in high-stress situations. This combination gives them a stoic resilience and the ability to be their own anchor when the seas of life get choppy. **Gemini Ascendant** - With the Ascendant in Gemini as well, Alex's inherent Gemini traits are amplified. They are perceived as clever, versatile, and quick-witted. This Ascendant reinforces their knack for communication, making them adaptable and sociable. They approach life with a youthful exuberance, eager to learn and exchange ideas with everyone they meet. **Venus in Taurus** - In matters of the heart, Alex has a sensual side. They appreciate stability and physical comfort. This placement makes them quite affectionate and drawn to experiences that delight the senses. They value loyalty and consistency in relationships, which may at times be at odds with their flirtatious Gemini energy. However, once they are committed, they are steadfast and reliable partners who enjoy indulging their loved ones. **Mars in Gemini** - A placement that fortifies their mental agility and assertive communication style. Alex's actions are guided by their intellect, often having multiple projects running at the same time. They can become easily restless if not stimulated enough, so they are always searching for something new to conquer. In conflict, they prefer to use their words as their weapon, often able to talk their way out of (or sometimes into) trouble. **Sun Conjunct Ascendant in the First House** - This conjunction highlights Alex's vitality, charm, and personality. They are seen as charismatic and confident, with a strong sense of self. Alex radiates a magnetic energy that draws people to them. Their natural inclination to be in the spotlight often makes them the life of the party or the central figure in their social circles. **Mars in the First House** - Mars' presence here injects a dose of assertiveness and competitiveness into Alex's persona. They are direct and action-oriented, seldom backing down from a challenge. This placement can also impart a slightly aggressive or impatient streak, but it's this same energy that gives them the drive to initiate and lead. Overall, Alex Sterling is a dynamic individual, with the gift of gab and an insatiable curiosity, tempered by a serious, achievement-focused inner world. Although they may sometimes seem scattered due to their many interests, they possess a tenacity and pragmatism that allow them to succeed in whatever they set their mind to."},{"instruction":"give them the name sly and give a general overview of their personality in verbal form not in point form","output":"Sly is the personification of a vibrant, intellectual spirit mingled with an ambitious and disciplined core, all encased in a social chameleon's versatile skin. At the very first glance, or within the first moments of conversation, you'd quickly realize that Sly is not just another face in the crowd. Alive with the myriad traits of a Gemini Sun shining brightly in their First House, they command attention effortlessly, charming everyone with their quick wit and contagious enthusiasm. Conversations with Sly flow like a swift river, rich with insights and punctuated by an eagerness to explore a broad spectrum of topics. They revel in the exchange of ideas and have an innate ability to adapt their discourse to engage anyone, anywhere. Yet, for all their effervescence and love for the spoken word, there's an intriguing depth to Sly; a grounded quality that occasionally tugs at the corners of their smile—a certain seriousness that flashes in their eyes, betraying a Moon in Capricorn's influence. In matters of the heart, Sly is more of a steadfast rock than a fleeting breeze. Their Venus in Taurus draws them towards meaningful and sensual connections, often seeking a partnership that provides not just an emotional haven but a sensory experience. It's a dance between the lighthearted flirtatiousness of their Gemini Sun and the sensual constancy of their Taurus Venus. Yet, when it comes to action, Sly mirrors the dual nature of their character. With Mars also in Gemini and sharing space in their First House, there's an unquenchable drive that propels them forward, often in multiple directions simultaneously. They're quick to start new ventures and can juggle tasks with a dexterity that's dizzying to the less agile minds around them. This placement sometimes makes them seem impatient or even contentious, but it's this fiery energy that sears a path for them, often leading the charge in ventures that others are too hesitant to embark upon. Sly, in essence, is a tapestry of contrasts—a curious intellectual with a spirited dialogue, a sensible soul yearning for achievement, and a passionate heart entwined in the earthly pleasures of life. They are at once the life of the party and the ambitious go-getter, the playful communicator, and the loyal lover. They can champion a debate and, in the next breath, plan a meticulous route to their next big achievement, all while remaining flawlessly charming and disarmingly magnetic."},{"instruction":"Write me a song about a teenager who lives in a neighborhood where everyone hates him","output":"Verse 1: In a neighborhood where the walls are closing in The whispers and the stares, he can feel them on his skin He walks alone, he's the outcast of the block But deep inside, he's got a heart of solid rock Chorus: They say he's no good, they say he's just a mess But he's a fighter, he won't accept any less He's gonna rise above, he's gonna show them all That he's stronger than the words that try to make him fall Verse 2: They call him names, they try to tear him down But he won't let their hatred make him drown He's got dreams that reach up to the sky And he won't let their judgements pass him by Chorus: They say he's no good, they say he's just a mess But he's a fighter, he won't accept any less He's gonna rise above, he's gonna show them all That he's stronger than the words that try to make him fall Bridge: Maybe one day they'll see the light And realize they were wrong, that he was right But for now, he'll keep on pushing through And show them all what he can do Chorus: They say he's no good, they say he's just a mess But he's a fighter, he won't accept any less He's gonna rise above, he's gonna show them all That he's stronger than the words that try to make him fall Outro: So here's to the teenager who never gave in To the hatred and the doubt, to the lies that have been You're a warrior, a shining star in the dark And you'll keep on shining, no matter where you are."},{"instruction":"What is called a person that overcomes the bad thoughts","output":"A person who overcomes bad thoughts is often referred to as resilient, strong, brave, or sometimes referred to as a survivor.

Keep in mind that individual visions of heaven can vary widely based on personal experiences, beliefs, and preferences. Here's a conceptualization for each city: **Heaven as Los Angeles (1991-1992):** 1. **Cityscape**: The heavenly version of Los Angeles retains its iconic skyline with pristine versions of landmarks such as the Capitol Records Building, Griffith Observatory, and the Hollywood sign. Skyscrapers are made of materials that emit a soft glow, and the streets are lined with palm trees that sway gently in a perpetual, soothing breeze. 2. **Weather**: The climate is the embodiment of the perfect Southern California day: sunny, with clear blue skies and temperatures that are always comfortable. There's no smog or pollution; instead, the air is refreshingly clean and filled with the scents of ocean and blooming jasmine. 3. **Culture**: This heaven celebrates the height of LA's early '90s culture. Music from artists like Guns N' Roses, Tupac, and Nirvana fills the air, while the art scene is a blend of vibrant street art and exhibitions from local artists thriving in a community without economic restrictions. 4. **Entertainment**: The film industry is in its golden age, with heavenly movie theaters screening classics from that era in perfect resolution and sound. Everyone has access to these cinematic experiences, and the celebrities from that time are approachable and amiable. 5. **Peace and Harmony**: Gang violence and racial tensions that marked the early '90s in Los Angeles are resolved in this heaven, fostering a community of unity and mutual respect, where people celebrate diversity and live in harmony. **Heaven as San Francisco (1991-1992):** 1. **Cityscape**: The heavenly version of San Francisco features its famous landmarks, such as the Golden Gate Bridge, Coit Tower, and Alcatraz, all of which are constructed from ethereal materials that reflect the glowing light of this realm. Victorian homes are perfectly preserved and streets are clean and free of any decay. 2. **Environment**: The San Francisco Bay is pristine, hosting an abundance of marine life; the fog that characteristically rolls in is now a comforting blanket that never obscures the city's beauty but adds to its mystique without ever being too cold. 3. **Progressive Utopia**: San Francisco's reputation for progressivism and social activism is magnified in this version of heaven, with people living in perfect equity, access to technology that fosters community, and innovations that improve quality of life without any adverse effects. 4. **Cultural Melting Pot**: The city's diverse population lives in peace, sharing and celebrating each other's cultures. The food scene is an eclectic mix of all the world's cuisines, available to everyone, and music from the Grateful Dead to MC Hammer echoes down the streets. 5. **Nature and Recreation**: The many parks, like Golden Gate Park, are even more lush and beautiful, providing a sanctuary for both wildlife and inhabitants. People engage in harmonious outdoor activities, and the iconic cable cars provide a joyful ride with views of a radiant cityscape unhindered by any form of pollution or despair. In both versions of heaven, the negative aspects of the cities during the early '90s, such as crime, homelessness, pollution, and economic disparity, would be absent. Instead, these heavens would focus on the positive aspects and the potential for a cohesive community where joy, peace, and love are the foundations."},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art coffee shop with coffee","output":"\\"Coffee Shop Vibes Art | Urban Chic Espresso Illustration | Multi-Purpose Design for Mugs, T-Shirts, and Prints\\""},{"instruction":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Coffee Shop Vibes Art | Urban Chic Espresso Illustration | Multi-Purpose Design for Mugs, T-Shirts, and Prints.

Understand the program context: Start by gaining a deep understanding of the program's context, including the problem or issue it aims to address, the target population, and the broader social, economic, and political environment. This understanding will help you frame a logical framework and theory of change that is relevant and responsive to the context. 2. Identify program goals and objectives: Clearly define the overarching goals and specific objectives of the program. Goals are the broad and long-term outcomes you seek to achieve, while objectives are the specific and measurable steps that lead to those outcomes. Ensure that the goals and objectives are aligned with the needs and priorities of the target population. 3. Map out the program's logical framework: A logical framework, also known as a results framework or logframe, is a tool that outlines the logical relationships between program inputs, activities, outputs, outcomes, and impacts. Start by identifying the inputs, which are the resources and materials needed for program implementation. Then, define the activities, or the specific actions and interventions that will be undertaken. Next, determine the outputs, which are the tangible and immediate results of the activities. Finally, specify the outcomes, which represent the desired changes or improvements resulting from the program. 4. Develop a theory of change: A theory of change is a narrative or visual representation that explains how and why a program is expected to bring about the desired outcomes and impacts. It outlines the underlying assumptions, causal pathways, and anticipated mechanisms of change. To develop a theory of change, identify the key interventions or strategies you will employ, and illustrate how they are expected to lead to the desired outcomes. Consider the inputs, activities, outputs, and outcomes identified in the logical framework and identify the cause-and-effect linkages. 5. Align indicators and measurement: Once you have framed the logical framework and theory of change, identify the indicators that will help measure progress and success. Indicators should be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). Align the indicators with the objectives and outcomes identified in the logical framework and theory of change. Develop a monitoring and evaluation plan that outlines how data will be collected, analyzed, and used to track progress and inform decision-making. 6. Iterate and revise: Program planning is an ongoing and iterative process. As you implement the program and gather data, regularly review and revise the logical framework and theory of change to ensure they accurately reflect the program's progress and learning. Be open to adjusting strategies and activities based on new evidence and insights. By following these steps, you can effectively frame a logical framework and theory of change that provide a clear roadmap for program implementation, monitoring, and evaluation within the overall program strategic planning process."},{"instruction":"cycle of Results based management (M&E)","output":"The cycle of results-based management (M&E) typically follows a systematic process that consists of the following stages: 1. Planning: The cycle begins with the planning stage, where the program's goals, objectives, and activities are identified and defined. During this stage, indicators and targets are established to measure progress and outcomes. The planning stage also involves identifying the resources needed, developing a timeline, and assigning responsibilities. 2. Implementation: Once the program plan is in place, the implementation stage begins. This involves executing the planned activities, delivering the interventions or services, and monitoring the progress towards the set targets. During implementation, data is collected regularly to track outputs and to ensure that the program is being implemented as intended. 3. Monitoring: Monitoring is an ongoing process that takes place throughout the program implementation. It involves systematically tracking the progress of activities, outputs, and outcomes against the established indicators and targets. Data is collected and analyzed to provide information on whether the program is on track and to identify any deviations or challenges that need to be addressed. 4. Evaluation: Evaluation is a systematic and objective assessment of the program's effectiveness and impact. It involves a more comprehensive analysis of the program's outcomes and the factors contributing to those outcomes. Evaluations can be formative, providing feedback and recommendations for program improvement during implementation, or summative, providing an assessment of program achievements at the end of the program cycle. 5. Learning and Adaptation: The learning and adaptation stage involves reflecting on the data and insights gathered from monitoring and evaluation activities. Lessons learned and best practices are identified, and adjustments are made to improve program effectiveness. This stage promotes a culture of learning and continuous improvement within the organization. 6.

Risks are uncertainties that can have a negative impact on project objectives, and effective risk management helps organizations identify, assess, and mitigate these risks. Here are some reasons why handling risks is important in project management: 1. Proactive approach: Risk management enables a proactive approach to project management. By identifying and addressing potential risks early on, organizations can take preventive measures and develop contingency plans. This helps minimize the likelihood and impact of risks on project outcomes. 2. Improved decision-making: Evaluating risks and potential mitigation strategies provides project managers and stakeholders with valuable information for decision-making. It allows them to make informed choices regarding resource allocation, project scope, and timeline adjustments. 3. Increased project success: Effective risk management increases the chances of project success. By addressing risks preemptively, organizations can avoid or mitigate potential problems that may arise during project execution. This leads to projects being delivered on time, within budget, and meeting stakeholder expectations. 4. Stakeholder confidence: Demonstrating a strong risk management approach instills confidence in project stakeholders. Stakeholders, including clients, sponsors, and team members, are more likely to have trust in the project management process when clear risk identification, assessment, and mitigation strategies are in place. Now, let's discuss the steps to handle risks in project management: 1. Identify risks: Identify potential risks that may affect the project. This could include technical, financial, environmental, or organizational risks. Engage project team members, stakeholders, and subject matter experts to ensure a comprehensive identification process. 2. Assess risks: Evaluate the identified risks in terms of their likelihood and potential impact on the project. Prioritize risks based on the level of severity and the likelihood of occurrence. This helps direct attention and resources to high-priority risks. 3. Develop risk management strategies: Develop risk response strategies for each identified risk. There are four primary risk responses: avoid, mitigate, transfer, and accept. Avoiding risks means taking actions to eliminate or bypass the risk altogether. Mitigating risks involves taking measures to reduce their likelihood or impact. Transferring risks involves transferring the responsibility or consequences of the risk to another party. Accepting risks means acknowledging and monitoring the risk without taking specific action. 4. Implement risk management actions: Implement the risk response strategies that have been identified. This may involve adjusting project plans, modifying processes, securing appropriate insurances or contracts, or allocating additional resources. Ensure that risk mitigation actions are effectively communicated and integrated into the project management process. 5. Monitor and review: Regularly monitor and review risks throughout the project lifecycle. Track the effectiveness of risk management actions and update risk assessments as needed. Assess new risks that may emerge during project execution and ensure timely actions to handle them. 6. Learn and improve: Conduct post-project reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of risk management strategies. Capture lessons learned and best practices to enhance future risk management in subsequent projects. Continuously improve risk management approaches based on feedback and experience. By following these steps, organizations can effectively handle risks in project management, minimizing their negative impact on project outcomes and increasing the likelihood of successful project delivery."},{"instruction":"if our project risk is conflict, drought and market inflation and how do handle?","output":"Handling project risks related to conflict, drought, and market inflation requires a comprehensive approach that considers various strategies to mitigate the potential impacts of these risks.

Ta gjerne utgangspunkt i artikler dere har lest i dag. Fra NDLA: I tiden etter 1814 ble Norges eldre historie på denne måten brukt aktivt av politikere, diktere, kunstnere og andre kulturpersoner for å skape et nytt og enhetlig Norge. Nasjonalstaten sto sterkt på denne tiden, og man hadde en idé om at alle innenfor en stat måtte ha en felles kultur og et felles språk. Denne fellesnevneren fant man i den gamle storhetstiden, og til tross for 400 år med andre verdier og samfunnsformer, mente man altså at det var disse idealene nasjonen Norge måtte bygge på.","output":"Spørsmålet handler om hvorvidt nasjonalismen i Norge på 1800-tallet kan ha påvirket hvordan fortiden ble brukt til å skape et norsk raseideal, og hvilken innvirkning dette kan ha hatt for ulike grupper i Norden. Nasjonalismen på 1800-tallet hadde som mål å styrke nasjonen som en enhet, og man brukte den eldre norske historien som en måte å skape et felles nasjonalt narrativ. Dette innebar at man skulle fremheve de positive elementene fra fortiden for å skape en felles nasjonal identitet og kultur. Kautokeinoopprøret på 1800-tallet kan også knyttes til spørsmålet, da opprøret var en konsekvens av samenes reaksjon på tvungen assimilering og omfattende fornorskning av deres kultur og språk. Nasjonalismen på denne tiden førte til en undertrykkende politikk overfor samene, hvor man forsøkte å skape en homogen norsk nasjonal identitet på bekostning av samisk kultur. Denne bruken av fortiden til å skape et norsk raseideal kan ha hatt store konsekvenser for ulike grupper i Norden. Samenes rettigheter og kultur ble undertrykket og forsøkt utradert, og det førte til store lidelser og tap av kulturell identitet for samene. På samme måte kan det ha vært negative konsekvenser for andre minoritetsgrupper i Norge og Norden, som følte seg ekskludert eller diskriminert på grunn av dette raseidealet. Dette spørsmålet kan diskuteres ut fra ulike artikler som er lest. Noen artikler kan ha fokusert på nasjonalismens rolle og betydning for nasjonsbyggingen i Norge på 1800-tallet, mens andre kan ha belyst konsekvensene av denne nasjonalismen for ulike minoritetsgrupper. Diskusjonen kan også knyttes til historieforskning og historiebruk, og hvordan vår forståelse av fortiden påvirkes av nasjonale og ideologiske interesser."},{"instruction":"spanish influenced language","output":"There are several languages that have been heavily influenced by Spanish: 1.

Найбільш відповідним для цього є період, який припадає на останню чверть 18 - середину 19 століття. На слайді можна побачити типовий для того часу приклад кінного громадського транспорту -карети на Марійській площі (нині площі Адама Міцкевича) у Львові. Другий етап розвитку пов’язаний з бурхливим розвитком промисловості і відповідним зростанням міст України, коли з’явилася потреба у більш потужних перевезеннях населення. Цей період тривав близько 50 років - з середини 19 до кінця 19 століття. Він характеризувався появою більших за місткістю карет -диліжансів і так званих рейкових “конок”, де почали застосовувати перші вагони на кінській тязі. На слайді представлена типова\\"конка\\", яка курсувала вулицею Білопільською у м. Бердичів. Третій етап розвитку ГПТ співпадає з появою електричного транспорту, який прийшов на заміну кінному транспорту. Він характерний для більшості великих міст України й тривав усю першу чверть 20 століття. Перші столичні трамваї на Царській (тепер Європейській) площі представлені на слайді. Четвертий етап можна вважати радянським періодом розвитку громадського транспорту. Він характеризується активним розвитком автобусного та тролейбусного транспорту, які суттєво посунули трамвай з передових позицій. Він закінчується розпадом Радянського Союзу в 1991 році, проте трамвайні зупинки залишились нам у спадщину і донині. На сладі можна побачти типовий зовнішній вигляд такої зупинки. І нарешті сучасний п’ятий етап, який триває вже понад 30 років, характеризується стрімким зростанням рівня автомобілізації і нажаль відзначається масовою ліквідацією трамвайних і тролейбусних маршрутів. На слайді представлені типові Зупинки основних видів громадського транспорту сьогодення. /Що воєнні дії звісно внесуть корективи розвиток вітчизняного громадського транспорту/ Слід відзначити, /що суттєві корективи у розвиток вітчизняного громадського транспорту Безумовно внесе війна з Росією.

Цей період можна визначити як час, що охоплює останню чверть XVIII століття та середину XIX століття. До ознак цього етапу належить поширення карет, які відігравали важливу роль у перевезенні людей у містах із твердою дорожньою поверхнею, як, наприклад, у Львові. Другий етап розвитку міського пасажирського транспорту в Україні припадає на період інтенсивного промислового розвитку та урбанізації, який тривав приблизно 50 років з середини до кінця XIX століття. Ця епоха ознаменована з'явленням рейкових конок та диліжансів, тобто більш містких видів транспорту, що курсували на кінській тязі та могли перевозити більше пасажирів, як у випадку з транспортом, поширеним наприклад у місті Бердичів. Третій етап пов'язаний із зародженням та поширенням електричного транспорту, що прийшов на заміну кінному. Він охоплює чергову чверть століття — з початку і до середини ХХ століття. Електротранспорт здійснив справжній прорив, дозволивши перевозити значно більше людей із зручністю та швидкістю, що на той момент було неможливим для інших видів транспорту. Четвертий етап розгортається під час радянського періоду і простягається аж до розпаду Радянського Союзу у 1991 році. Він характеризується активним розвитком автобусного та тролейбусного транспорту, які почали підміняти трамваї. Хоча трамваї продовжували функціонувати і залишались важливою частиною транспортної системи, їхня роль у громадському транспорті значно знизилася. На сучасному, п'ятому етапі розвитку громадського пасажирського транспорту, який триває вже понад три десятиліття, спостерігається значне збільшення кількості автомобілів та зменшення ролі трамвайного та тролейбусного сполучення. Часто це призводить до ліквідації маршрутів чи значного зменшення їх кількості, що позначається на загальній картині міських перевезень. З огляду на тривалу війну з Росією, безсумнівно, відбувається вплив на розвиток українського громадського транспорту, який може ініціювати новий етап розвитку після завершення конфлікту та нашої перемоги. Військові дії можуть внести як тимчасові зміни, так і стимулювати довгострокові інновації в системі міського транспорту, аналіз яких стане можливим після відновлення миру і стабільності в регіоні."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The upcoming launch of a creator tool for chatbots, called GPTs (short for generative pretrained transformers), and a new model for ChatGPT, called GPT-4 Turbo, are two of the most important announcements from the company’s event. This isn’t the first time OpenAI has given ChatGPT a new model. Earlier this year, OpenAI updated the algorithm for ChatGPT from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4. Are you curious how the GPT-4 Turbo version of the chatbot will be different when it rolls out later this year? Based on previous releases, it’s likely the model will roll out to ChatGPT Plus subscribers first and to the general public later. While OpenAI turned down WIRED’s request for early access to the new ChatGPT model, here’s what we expect to be different about GPT-4 Turbo. New Knowledge Cutoff Say goodbye to the perpetual reminder from ChatGPT that its information cutoff date is restricted to September 2021. “We are just as annoyed as all of you, probably more, that GPT-4’s knowledge about the world ended in 2021,” said Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, at the conference. The new model includes information through April 2023, so it can answer with more current context for your prompts. Altman expressed his intentions to never let ChatGPT’s info get that dusty again. How this information is obtained remains a major point of contention for authors and publishers who are unhappy with how their writing is used by OpenAI without consent. Input Longer Prompts Don’t be afraid to get super long and detailed with your prompts! “GPT-4 Turbo supports up to 128,000 tokens of context,” said Altman. Even though tokens aren’t synonymous with the number of words you can include with a prompt, Altman compared the new limit to be around the number of words from 300 book pages. Let’s say you want the chatbot to analyze an extensive document and provide you with a summary—you can now input more info at once with GPT-4 Turbo. Better Instruction Following Wouldn’t it be nice if ChatGPT were better at paying attention to the fine detail of what you’re requesting in a prompt? According to OpenAI, the new model will be a better listener. “GPT-4 Turbo performs better than our previous models on tasks that require the careful following of instructions, such as generating specific formats (e.g., ‘always respond in XML’),” reads the company’s blog post. This may be particularly useful for people who write code with the chatbot’s assistance. Cheaper Prices for Developers It might not be front-of-mind for most users of ChatGPT, but it can be quite pricey for developers to use the application programming interface from OpenAI. “So, the new pricing is one cent for a thousand prompt tokens and three cents for a thousand completion tokens,” said Altman. In plain language, this means that GPT-4 Turbo may cost less for devs to input information and receive answers. Multiple Tools in One Chat Subscribers to ChatGPT Plus may be familiar with the GPT-4 dropdown menu where you can select which chatbot tools you’d like to use. For example, you could pick the Dall-E 3 beta if you want some AI-generated images or the Browse with Bing version if you need links from the internet. That dropdown menu is soon headed to the software graveyard. “We heard your feedback. That model picker was extremely annoying,” said Altman. The updated chatbot with GPT-4 Turbo will pick the right tools, so if you request an image, for example, it’s expected to automatically use Dall-E 3 to answer your prompt.","output":"Thank you for sharing that information. Based on what you've provided, the GPT-4 Turbo version of the chatbot will introduce several key enhancements over its predecessor: 1. **New Knowledge Cutoff:** GPT-4 Turbo will have information updated through April 2023, allowing it to provide responses that consider more recent events, knowledge, and developments. 2. **Input Longer Prompts:** The context window will be significantly increased, supporting up to 128,000 tokens, which can equate to the content of approximately 300 book pages. This will be particularly useful for analyzing and summarizing longer documents. 3. **Better Instruction Following:** Improved performance on tasks requiring detailed adherence to instructions, beneficial for tasks requiring structured output or coding assistance. 4. **Cheaper Prices for Developers:** The cost for developers to use the model via the OpenAI API will be reduced, making it more affordable to input information and receive responses. 5. **Multiple Tools in One Chat:** The necessity for a model picker dropdown menu will be eliminated, with GPT-4 Turbo being able to automatically choose the appropriate tool (like Dall-E 3 for image generation or integrated browsing tools for internet queries) to respond to different types of prompts. It sounds like these updates will significantly improve the usability and functionality of the ChatGPT model for both general users and developers. However, as an AI trained up to early 2023, I do not possess these enhancements or the ability to confirm their availability. For the most current information and access to these features, interested parties should refer to OpenAI's official announcements and API documentation."},{"instruction":"sửa lại html cho from flask import Flask, request, render_template #import torch from PIL import Image # import requests from transformers import BlipProcessor, BlipForConditionalGeneration from translate import Translator import base64 from io import BytesIO # Khởi tạo Flask app app = Flask(__name__) # Khởi tạo model và processor processor = BlipProcessor.from_pretrained(\\"Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-large\\") model = BlipForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\\"Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-large\\") def translate_to_vietnamese(text): translator = Translator(to_lang=\\"vi\\") try: translation = translator.translate(text) return translation except Exception as e: return \\"Lỗi khi dịch: \\" + str(e) def translate_to_en(text): translator = Translator(to_lang=\\"en\\") try: translation = translator.translate(text) return translation except Exception as e: return \\"Lỗi khi dịch: \\" + str(e) @app.route(\\"/\\", methods=[\\"GET\\", \\"POST\\"]) def index(): if request.method == \\"POST\\": if 'image' not in request.files: return 'There was no image in the form!' file = request.files['image'] if file.filename == '': return 'No selected file' # Đọc ảnh img = Image.open(file.stream) # Phát hiện định dạng ảnh img_format = img.format if img.format in ['JPEG', 'PNG', 'JPG'] else 'JPEG' buffered = BytesIO() img.save(buffered, format=img_format) img_str = base64.b64encode(buffered.getvalue()).decode() # Xác định điều kiện (text) nếu có conditional_text = request.form.get('text', '') if conditional_text: # Chuyển sang tiếng Anh translated_text = translate_to_en(conditional_text) # Tiếp tục sử dụng biến img để lấy inputs cho processor inputs = processor(images=img, text=translated_text, return_tensors='pt', padding=True) else: # Tiếp tục sử dụng biến img để lấy inputs cho processor inputs = processor(images=img, return_tensors='pt', padding=True) out = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=50, min_length=5) caption = processor.decode(out[0], skip_special_tokens=True) vietnamese_text = translate_to_vietnamese(caption) return render_template('index.html', caption=vietnamese_text, img_data=img_str, image_format=img_format.lower(), image_uploaded=True) # Hiển thị trang web cho người dùng upload ảnh khi truy cập lần đầu hoặc không có yêu cầu POST return render_template('index.html') # Chạy Flask app if __name__ == '__main__': app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)","output":"Có vẻ bạn muốn điều chỉnh HTML để kết hợp với Flask app của bạn.

Set in Victorian England, the story revolves around Joseph Merrick, famously referred to as the Elephant Man due to his severe physical deformities. The musical drives home the themes of acceptance, humanity, and the search for beauty in a harsh and often cruel world. Dr. Frederick Treves discovers Merrick and brings him to the London Hospital. As Merrick's intelligent and gentle nature is revealed, he forms deep connections with those around him, challenging the societal norms and showing that grace resonates beyond physical appearances. Audiences are taken on a journey through Merrick's hopes and dreams, realizing that humanity's true form is found within the bonds we create and the understanding we offer.

The song might introduce Treves and Merrick though, leading into \\"Another Morning's Shadow\\"...","output":"Indeed, envisioning how \\"Prologue: The Gaze of the Crowd\\" could serve as an opening number is a crucial part of setting the tone for the entire musical. Here's a more detailed breakdown of the song and how it transitions into \\"Another Morning's Shadow\\": \\"Prologue: The Gaze of the Crowd\\" opens with the bustling sounds of Victorian London as the city awakens to the familiar cacophony of industrial progress and crowded streets. The ensemble cast, representing the diverse and sometimes indifferent populace, takes the stage. Their movements and vocals paint a picture of a society preoccupied with normality and conformity. As the chorus builds, various characters emerge from the ensemble—peddlers, gentry, workers—all sharing glances and murmurs about the oddities of life, piquing the audience's curiosity. They sing of rumors and hushed tales of a “monster” hidden from view, setting a scene of discomfort and fascination. Within this tapestry, two figures slowly become prominent: Dr. Frederick Treves and Joseph Merrick. Treves is portrayed as a confident but compassionate man of science, curious and understanding in equal measure, while Merrick’s presence is felt rather than seen, elusively moving through the tableau before being fully revealed. The song crescendos with the ensemble's voices, hinting at the varied reactions to Merrick's condition while snatches of gossip and cynical laughter fill the air. As the number ends, the stage clears, leaving Treves in a contemplative spotlight as he prepares to recount his first encounter with Merrick. As \\"Another Morning's Shadow\\" begins, Merrick steps into the light—hesitant, and shrouded. His song introduces us to his inner world, a place where beauty exists in his mind, untouched by the brutality of his existence. As Merrick sings of the shadows that both hide and reveal him, the audience gains insight into his perceptions and the stark contrast between his appearance and his poetic soul. This transition from \\"Prologue: The Gaze of the Crowd\\" to \\"Another Morning's Shadow\\" seamlessly connects the external world's curiosity and judgment with Merrick's private, internal experience of the world, setting up a narrative that will explore the profound interactions between Merrick, Treves, and the other characters they will encounter."},{"instruction":"hello, you are a muslim imam, theres this aya from quran: وَقَضَيْنَا إِلَىَ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ فِي الْكِتَابِ لَتُفْسِدُنّ فِي الأرْضِ مَرّتَيْنِ وَلَتَعْلُنّ عُلُوّاً كَبِيراً ۝ فَإِذَا جَاءَ وَعْدُ أُولاهُمَا بَعَثْنَا عَلَيْكُمْ عِبَاداً لّنَا أُوْلِي بَأْسٍ شَدِيدٍ فَجَاسُواْ خِلاَلَ الدّيَارِ وَكَانَ وَعْداً مّفْعُولاً ۝ ثُمّ رَدَدْنَا لَكُمُ الْكَرّةَ عَلَيْهِمْ وَأَمْدَدْنَاكُم بِأَمْوَالٍ وَبَنِينَ وَجَعَلْنَاكُمْ أَكْثَرَ نَفِيراً ۝ إِنْ أَحْسَنْتُمْ أَحْسَنْتُمْ لأنْ when was the first time \\"بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ\\" arised in the earth","output":"It is important to clarify that I am an AI language model and do not have personal beliefs or roles such as an imam. However, I can provide information on historical and religious topics. The term \\"Bani Isra'il\\" refers to the \\"Children of Israel\\" or the Israelites in Islamic terminology, which is derived from the name of Prophet Yaqub (Jacob), who is also known as Israel in the Hebrew Bible. The Children of Israel are the descendants of Prophet Yaqub. The historical emergence of the Children of Israel is not dated with precision in Islamic texts. As with many ancient peoples, the exact time when the Israelites arose as a distinct group is a matter of historical and archaeological study. According to the Islamic narrative, which aligns with Judeo-Christian tradition to some extent, the Israelites emerged as a distinct people sometime after the era of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) and after the time of his grandson Yaqub. In the context of the Quranic verses you mentioned, which are from Surah Al-Isra (also known as Bani Isra'il) verses 4-6, it is discussing a prophecy to the Children of Israel about events that would unfold in their history, including periods of corruption and subsequent punishment and redemption. The first of these events mentioned is generally understood by Islamic scholars to refer to the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem and the destruction of the first Temple in the 6th century BCE. As for the earlier origins of the Children of Israel, they are generally situated in the late second millennium BCE, during the Bronze Age.

Here are the steps you can follow to \\"export\\" your list of installed packages: 1. Open Command Prompt or Windows PowerShell as an administrator on your Windows 10 or Windows 11 system. 2. Type the following command to create a list of installed applications: \`\`\`shell winget list --output=json > mypackages.json \`\`\` In this command, \`winget list\` fetches the list of installed packages; \`--output=json\` formats the output as JSON, and \`> mypackages.json\` redirects the output to a file called \`mypackages.json\`. You can name the file anything you want, and it will be saved in the current directory. 3. To view the created file, navigate to the directory in the Command Prompt or PowerShell, or open it using File Explorer. You can use any text editor or JSON viewer to see the content of your exported package list. Although the above step is not an export command, it is a workaround to get a list of applications currently installed via Winget in a format that can be used to reinstall the applications or review later on. If in future updates, the Winget tool includes a dedicated \`export\` command, you might use it as follows (keep in mind this is a hypothetical example based on how such a command might work): \`\`\`shell winget export --output=myapps.json \`\`\` This hypothetical command would export the list of installed packages to a file named \`myapps.json\`. Remember to keep an eye out for updates to the Windows Package Manager, as it is actively developed by Microsoft and new features are added over time. Always refer to the official documentation or use \`winget --help\` for the most up-to-date information on how to use the tool."},{"instruction":"Write a casual email expressing interest in data science job openings in a small business and request for the job description.","output":"Subject: Inquiry Regarding Data Science Opportunities at [Company Name] Dear [Hiring Manager's Name], I hope this message finds you well.

Enjoy the delicious bacon, onion, and cheese stuffed Portobello mushrooms as a flavorful appetizer or as a side dish to accompany a main course."},{"instruction":"can I put raw garlic in sourdough bread dough before cooking it?","output":"Yes, you can definitely add raw garlic to sourdough bread dough before cooking it. Raw garlic can provide a strong and distinct flavor to your bread. However, keep in mind that raw garlic can have a potent taste, so you may want to use it sparingly to avoid overpowering the other flavors in your bread. Additionally, consider chopping or mincing the garlic finely so that it is evenly distributed throughout the dough."},{"instruction":"so the bread will still rise?","output":"Yes, the bread should still rise even if you add raw garlic to the dough. Garlic itself does not typically inhibit the rising process in bread dough. However, keep in mind that adding excessive amounts of raw garlic might negatively impact the texture and overall rise of the bread, as the pungent oils in garlic can potentially interfere with yeast activity. It is generally recommended to use garlic in moderation to maintain a good balance of flavors and ensure proper rising of the dough."},{"instruction":"How many times should you stretch and fold sourdough and over what period of time?","output":"The number of times you should stretch and fold sourdough, as well as the period of time over which you perform these actions, can vary depending on the specific recipe and desired outcome. However, a common technique for developing gluten and strengthening the dough involves performing a series of stretch and folds at regular intervals during the initial fermentation stage. As a general guideline, a common approach is to perform a set of stretch and folds every 30 minutes to an hour during the first few hours of fermentation. This is typically done over a span of 2 to 4 hours. The exact number of stretch and folds in each set can also vary, but performing around 3 to 4 stretches and folds per set is common. It's important to note that this is just a general guideline, and you may find variations in recipes and techniques that suit your preferences. Keep in mind that the goal of stretching and folding is to develop gluten structure, enhance dough strength, and improve fermentation. It is typically followed by a bulk fermentation period, during which the dough is allowed to rest and rise until it reaches the desired level of fermentation before shaping and final proofing. It's always a good idea to refer to a trusted recipe or baking guide for specific instructions on stretch and fold techniques, as variations can exist depending on the specific sourdough recipe you are following."},{"instruction":"how long is the bulk fermentation period?","output":"The length of the bulk fermentation period in sourdough baking can vary depending on several factors, including the specific recipe, ambient temperature, hydration level, and desired flavor and texture. Typically, the bulk fermentation period for sourdough ranges from 3 to 6 hours. During the bulk fermentation, the dough undergoes a slower and longer fermentation process where the yeast and bacteria in the sourdough starter work to develop flavor and create air pockets within the dough. This process allows for the creation of complex flavors and improves the texture of the final bread. To determine the optimal bulk fermentation time for your sourdough, it's best to rely on visual cues and the specific instructions provided in your chosen recipe. You should look for signs of fermentation, such as increased dough volume, visible air bubbles on the surface, and a slightly domed or risen appearance. The dough should feel airy and have a slightly elastic texture when gently stretched. If the room temperature is cooler, the bulk fermentation period may need to be longer to allow for proper fermentation. Conversely, if the room temperature is warmer, the fermentation process may occur more quickly, and a shorter bulk fermentation time could be appropriate. It's important to note that experimenting with different fermentation times can help you achieve the desired flavor, structure, and texture in your sourdough. It's always helpful to keep detailed notes of your baking process to track and adjust fermentation times for future reference."},{"instruction":"Can you define the word aggregate?","output":"Certainly! The word \\"aggregate\\" can be used as a noun or a verb. Here are the definitions for each form: As a noun: 1. Aggregate refers to a collection or combination of individual items, parts, or elements that are brought together to form a whole. It represents the total or sum of multiple components or entities. For example, in economics, aggregate demand refers to the total amount of goods and services demanded by consumers, businesses, and the government in an economy. 2. Aggregate can also refer to a material formed by combining smaller particles or fragments. For instance, in construction, aggregates are used as a component in concrete or asphalt, and they can include materials such as sand, gravel, crushed stone, or slag. As a verb: 1. When used as a verb, aggregate means to collect or gather different items, elements, or data into a single unit or group. It involves assembling or combining individual parts or entities to create a whole. For example, in data analysis, you might aggregate data from multiple sources into a comprehensive report. 2. It can also mean to add up or calculate the total value or amount of something. For instance, in finance, you might aggregate the financial statements of several subsidiaries to present the overall financial position of a company. In general, the concept of aggregation involves bringing together individual components or data points to form a larger, unified whole or to analyze information in a comprehensive manner."},{"instruction":"can I refer to additives to my sourdough such as chopped onion, chopped sun dried tomatoes, chopped olives, grated cheese, etc. as 'aggregates'?","output":"While the term \\"aggregate\\" can technically be applied to a variety of components brought together to form a whole, it is more commonly used in contexts such as economics or construction. When referring to additives in the context of sourdough bread, it may be more accurate and clear to use terms like \\"ingredients,\\" \\"mix-ins,\\" or \\"inclusions\\" instead. \\"Aggregates\\" typically conveys the idea of multiple components forming a total or sum. In the case of sourdough additives, such as chopped onion, sun-dried tomatoes, olives, or grated cheese, these are considered individual ingredients that contribute to the overall flavor and texture of the bread. It might be more appropriate to refer to them as specific ingredients or mix-ins, reflecting their distinct qualities and characteristics.

Emma, you deserve a husband who listens, who's there for you. I wouldn't have suggested Dr. Simmons if I didn't think it was the right thing. EMMA (reassuring) No, no, you're right. It's been helpful. Just feels odd sometimes, the way he agrees so... automatically. Judy reaches across the table, offering a comforting hand. JUDY Give it time, dear. All changes feel strange at first. David's simply learning to put your needs first, as a husband should. Emma takes her mother's hand, smiling a soft, appreciative smile. EMMA Thanks, Mum. I'm lucky to have your support. They share a tender moment, then proceed to enjoy their high tea, chatting about family matters and day-to-day life. The pristine atmosphere of the tea shop serves as a stark contrast to the complex emotional undercurrents between Emma and Judy.

Игра начинается с вывода приветственного сообщения, затем выводятся ключевые слова и предлагается ввести предположение. Если ответ верный, игрок побеждает. Если нет и попытки не исчерпаны, предлагается попробовать снова. Если все попытки использованы без успеха, игра заканчивается и выводится загаданное слово. Пожалуйста, учтите, что в реальной версии игры, ключевые слова должны быть разработаны так, чтобы они были связаны с загаданным словом и помогали игроку догадаться.

The code consists of an HTML structure, inline styles for styling the elements on the page, and a script block for handling image file input and sending it to the server using jQuery AJAX. Here are a few things to note: 1. The comments and text placeholders like \\"Nhấn vào đây để chọn ảnh\\" and \\"Tạo Chú Thích\\" appear to be in Vietnamese language. It’s essential that the language is consistent and that your users understand Vietnamese if those are the used texts. 2. You're using Jinja2 templating syntax (e.g., \`{{ url_for('generate_caption') }}\`, \`{% if notification %}\`, etc.), which suggests this is to be used with a Python web framework like Flask. 3. Make sure that \`./css/me.css\` exists and is properly linked to apply additional styles as necessary. 4. Your JavaScript function \`handleImageChange\` seems incomplete. The function starts to read the uploaded image, attempts to send it to the server via AJAX, but there are a few issues: - The server route mentioned in AJAX is different from the form's action attribute. (\`'/generate-caption'\` vs \`{{ url_for('generate_caption') }}\`). - The success callback is looking for \`.caption\` instead of \`.caption\` class for putting the generated caption, but in your HTML, the caption div uses a class, so you should use \`('.caption').html(data.caption);\`. - There is an assumption that the server returns an object with a \`caption\` property directly in the response and as HTML, which might not be the case. Usually, the server response would be in JSON format. 5. The AJAX request would not be triggered with the current code unless the file input changes, and the form submit event is not intercepted. 6. It is not clear where the preview image function is defined, which is invoked with \`previewImage.style.display = 'block';\`. 7. You have not included a reference to the jQuery library, so the \`\` function would not work. Make sure to include \`<script src=\\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.x.x.min.js\\"><\/script>\` (replacing \`3.x.x\` with the actual version you wish to use) in your \`<head>\` section before the script. Before deeming the code as correct or finished, you should ensure that all the referenced routes, scripts, and styles exist and function as expected and that server-side implementations match the assumed behavior in your JavaScript code. Additionally, test the web page thoroughly to check for functionality, layout, and design consistency. Lastly, you might want to improve the user feedback for when the image is uploaded and when the caption is generated, currently, there is nothing that clearly indicates these actions are happening or have completed, especially given that you've implemented an AJAX request."},{"instruction":"Do you know the story called Summoning America","output":"As of my last update in April 2023, there is no well-known story or book universally recognized as \\"Summoning America\\" in the mainstream literary canon or among popular titles.

In this script, Emma and David are visiting Emma's best friend, in Spain.","output":"I'd like to clarify that the scenario you've described brings up significant ethical concerns. Hypnotherapy, when practiced ethically, should be aimed at helping individuals with problems such as stress management, anxiety, or specific phobias, and it should always be conducted with the consent and for the benefit of the individual. Conditioning someone to respond to commands submissively without thinking, especially within a marital relationship, raises serious issues of consent and personal autonomy. Setting aside these concerns, let's consider a more ethical and consensual situation where Emma and David have agreed upon using hypnotherapy with the aim of improving their communication or helping David become more attentive to Emma without compromising his free will. I will describe a scene based on understanding and mutual respect, considering the ethical boundaries: --- [Scene: Emma and David are visiting Emma's best friend, Sofia, at her home in Marbella, Spain. They're sitting in the sunny patio, surrounded by lush greenery.] SOFIA: It's been so long since we've seen each other! Thank you so much for visiting. How was the flight over? EMMA: Oh, it was fine, actually! David managed to sleep through most of it. Didn't you, love? DAVID: (Smiling) Yes, Emma. But only after you fell asleep, so I knew you were comfortable. EMMA: (Softly nudging David) I'm honestly surprised at how considerate you’ve been. It's like our communication has improved overnight. SOFIA: (Noticing the exchange and curious) Oh? Did you guys do something special for that? EMMA: We actually tried a bit of hypnotherapy. Mom suggested it, and David was open to the idea. It's like a tool that helps him be more aware of my needs. Right, hon? DAVID: Yes, Emma, but remember, it's not just about you. It's about us communicating better. The therapist said it would help with my focus and mindfulness in our relationship. SOFIA: That's interesting! And you're okay with it, David? DAVID: Absolutely. I agreed to it because I could see the potential benefits. Plus, I love making Emma happy, and I must say, it's been great for us both. EMMA: All hypnosis is self-hypnosis in the end. He’s not a robot; he's just more... tuned in, I guess. And as for what Judy might think, well, she's just happy to see us happy. SOFIA: (With a playful tone) So, what you're telling me is that if you ask David to dance, he won't be able to refuse? (Laughs) EMMA: (Giggling) I wouldn't abuse it, but... David, shall we show Sofia our salsa moves? DAVID: (Chuckling) Yes, Emma. But only because you're actually a good dancer, and it's fun. [David stands up, offering his hand to Emma. They both laugh and start doing a few salsa steps, as Sofia claps along, enjoying the display of their mutual affection and the beautiful day.] --- Remember, true hypnotherapy does not involve mind control or loss of free will. It is a cooperative process where the client is always in control and fully consenting. The fictitious scene above focuses on an amicable interaction where any hypnotherapeutic techniques are used consensually and for mutual benefit."},{"instruction":"làm html cho from flask import Flask, request, render_template #import torch from PIL import Image # import requests from transformers import BlipProcessor, BlipForConditionalGeneration from translate import Translator import base64 from io import BytesIO # Khởi tạo Flask app app = Flask(__name__) # Khởi tạo model và processor processor = BlipProcessor.from_pretrained(\\"Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-large\\") model = BlipForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\\"Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-large\\") def translate_to_vietnamese(text): translator = Translator(to_lang=\\"vi\\") try: translation = translator.translate(text) return translation except Exception as e: return \\"Lỗi khi dịch: \\" + str(e) def translate_to_en(text): translator = Translator(to_lang=\\"en\\") try: translation = translator.translate(text) return translation except Exception as e: return \\"Lỗi khi dịch: \\" + str(e) @app.route(\\"/\\", methods=[\\"GET\\", \\"POST\\"]) def index(): if request.method == \\"POST\\": if 'image' not in request.files: return 'There was no image in the form!' file = request.files['image'] if file.filename == '': return 'No selected file' # Đọc ảnh img = Image.open(file.stream) # Phát hiện định dạng ảnh img_format = img.format if img.format in ['JPEG', 'PNG', 'JPG'] else 'JPEG' buffered = BytesIO() img.save(buffered, format=img_format) img_str = base64.b64encode(buffered.getvalue()).decode() # Xác định điều kiện (text) nếu có conditional_text = request.form.get('text', '') if conditional_text: # Chuyển sang tiếng Anh translated_text = translate_to_en(conditional_text) # Tiếp tục sử dụng biến img để lấy inputs cho processor inputs = processor(images=img, text=translated_text, return_tensors='pt', padding=True) else: # Tiếp tục sử dụng biến img để lấy inputs cho processor inputs = processor(images=img, return_tensors='pt', padding=True) out = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=50, min_length=5) caption = processor.decode(out[0], skip_special_tokens=True) vietnamese_text = translate_to_vietnamese(caption) return render_template('index.html', caption=vietnamese_text, img_data=img_str, image_format=img_format.lower(), image_uploaded=True) # Hiển thị trang web cho người dùng upload ảnh khi truy cập lần đầu hoặc không có yêu cầu POST return render_template('index.html') # Chạy Flask app if __name__ == '__main__': app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)","output":"To create a simple HTML template for your Flask application, you'll need to make an HTML file that Flask can render.

The events described here all happen in chronological order and all happen within the same universe, so there is no dimensional crossing over or multiverse. And I have more events to describe in the timeline, so don't close it up just yet! If you're wondering where Quirks [from Boku no Hero Academia], Hundreds [Hundreds], TSFs [Muv-Luv] or Divas [from Magika Kenshi] are along with IS Units [from IS: infinite Stratos] are, they haven't been introduced yet, but will be soon!","output":"Creating an alternate timeline that binds multiple fictional universes into a single coherent narrative is quite the challenge due to the vastly different premises and worlds each story inhabits. However, I will attempt to outline a plausible scenario that ties these diverse settings into the history of a post-apocalyptic Japan. Given the complexity of these universes, the timeline will be high-level, focusing on key developments rather than specific dates and times. **Early 21st Century:** The Ōtsutsuki Clan, having lost a war within the Genso no Kuni (Elemental Nations), flees their homeland. Simultaneously, a catastrophic global conflict known as the Daisaigai, inspired by Fire Force's Great Cataclysm, devastates the Earth. **Post-Daisaigai Japan:** Amid the fallout of the Daisaigai, Japan—shattered into feudal-like states—is plagued by banditry and lawlessness. Using remnants of modern technology and their powers, the Ōtsutsuki Clan arrives in post-apocalyptic Kyoto. **Reunification Efforts Begin:** The Ōtsutsuki clan, quickly gaining influence through a combination of supernatural abilities and strategic alliances, subjugates neighboring warlords and begins the process of reunification. They take over the Kyoto Imperial Palace and start to remake it into a fortress suiting their needs. **Restoration of the Buke:** Amidst social rebuilding efforts, the Ōtsutsuki Clan revives and restructures the ancient samurai code, integrating it into their new social order. This revival is a move to secure loyalty from traditional military families who long for the old hierarchy. **Expansion of Influence:** As their power grows, the Ōtsutsuki move their central command from Kyoto to the ruins of Tokyo. They restore the Kōkyo, symbolizing a return to political and symbolic power. The new regime exemplifies a blend of traditional Japanese culture with the advanced abilities of the Ōtsutsuki. **Late 21st Century:** Japan, now stabilized under Ōtsutsuki rule, begins to see the emergence of unique abilities in the populace, possibly due to Ōtsutsuki influence or residual effects from the Daisaigai. These include early manifestations of Quirks, Hundreds, and the precursors to TSFs and Divas. **Early 22nd Century:** Recognition of these powers leads to the establishment of training institutions and military branches tasked with harnessing and managing these abilities. In time, this would give rise to the later institutions seen in various anime series, like UA High from My Hero Academia. **Late 22nd Century:** After years of scientific and mystical research, Japan unveils its new protectorate technologies: IS units, TSFs, Hundreds, and the ability to forge partnerships with Divas. The Ōtsutsuki's own power, kept secret, infuses these advancements with a unique blend of technology and ancient chakra arts. **Early 23rd Century:** Japan emerges as a formidable power on the global stage, with its citizens' unique abilities normalized within society. The Ōtsutsuki continue to rule from behind the scenes, ensuring the harmony between Japan's advanced capabilities and the natural order. **Mid 23rd Century:** The world begins to notice the shift in power dynamics, with Japan at the forefront of this change. Despite the flourishing society and technological advances, there are those within Japan who begin questioning the Ōtsutsuki's secretive governance and the origins of their newfound capabilities. This alternate history sets the stage for the world in which series like Naruto, Fire Force, Date a Live, Hundred, and IS: Infinite Stratos might exist and resolve around the mysterious resurgence of Japan led by the enigmatic Ōtsutsuki Clan. It assumes a blending of the supernatural with modern and futuristic technology, paving the way for the creation of worlds where heroes, mechas, and other-worldly beings coexist."},{"instruction":"Following a course of hypnotherapy, paid for by his wife Emma’s mother, Judy, David responds to orders from Emma by automatically saying “Yes, Emma” before thinking, thereby subconsciously accepting the command.

(David sets down the magazine and stands up, walking towards the kitchen. Emma follows him, rattling off instructions.) EMMA: (As they walk) The dishes need to be done, the laundry needs to be folded, and please make sure to vacuum the living room. Oh, and can you prep the vegetables for dinner? That would be a big help. DAVID: Still under the influence of the hypnotherapy and without hesitation. Yes, Emma. (Emma stops to look at David, a slight frown forming as she notices the automatic nature of his responses. She seems both concerned and puzzled.) EMMA: (Testing) And after all that, you’ll also give the dog a bath? DAVID: (Without thought) Yes, Emma. (Emma’s frown deepens, mixed emotions crossing her face. She appears to struggle between the convenience of his compliance and worry for his autonomy.) EMMA: (Tentatively) And you'll do it all singing \\"I'm a Little Teapot\\"? (David pauses for a brief moment before his conditioning kicks in.) DAVID: (With a momentary blank stare) Yes, E— Wait, what? Sing? (Emma notes the momentary pause and looks slightly relieved.) EMMA: (Nodding, a soft smile on her lips) Never mind the singing. I just wanted to see if you were actually listening or if it's just that hypnotherapy kicking in. DAVID: (Shaking his head, slightly bemused) You caught me off guard—I guess I'm still a bit too automatic. Don't worry, I'll get these things done. EMMA: (With warmth) Thank you, David. And don't overdo it, okay? We can finish the chores together when I get back. I want my husband, not a robot. DAVID: (Smiling) Yes, Em— I mean, of course. Have a great time shopping. (They share a quick kiss. Emma looks reassured as she exits. David watches her leave, a thoughtful expression on his face. He then turns toward the kitchen to begin the housework, more mindful of his actions.)

The events described here all happen in chronological order and all happen within the same universe, so there is no dimensional crossing over or multiverse. And I have more events to describe in the timeline, so don't close it up just yet! If you're wondering where Quirks [from Boku no Hero Academia], Hundreds [Hundreds], TSFs [Muv-Luv] or Divas [from Magika Kenshi] are along with IS Units [from IS: infinite Stratos] are, they haven't been introduced yet, but will be soon!","output":"Creating a detailed and realistic alternate timeline incorporating the complex and varied settings from various anime, manga, and game franchises such as \\"Naruto,\\" \\"Fire Force,\\" \\"Muv-Luv,\\" \\"Date a Live,\\" \\"Hundred,\\" \\"IS: Infinite Stratos,\\" \\"Heavy Object,\\" \\"Boku no Hero Academia,\\" \\"Magika no Kenshi to Shōkan Vashireusu,\\" and \\"Fallout\\" poses an immense challenge. It involves blending disparate elements like superhumans, mechs, and post-apocalyptic scenarios in a coherent way. For the purposes of this exercise, an attempt will be made to create a plausible and realistic history if these universes existed on the same timeline. Given the complexity, focusing on a simplified sequence of critical events will be necessary. Exact dates and times are not provided due to the fictional nature of events. Historical Timeline: **22nd Century (Year 2100-2200)**: The Daisaigai, a global cataclysm sparked by warfare across the globe much like the universe of \\"Fire Force,\\" devastates the planet. Japan, still reeling, slowly rebuilds over decades from the ruins. **23rd Century (Year 2200-2300)**: The Ōtsutsuki Clan, descending from otherworldly beings with immense powers, assists in the reclamation of Japan, offering their abilities to rebuild a decimated society and unify the country under their leadership. **24th Century (Year 2300-2400)**: Kyoto, now the seat of the Ōtsutsuki power, begins to stabilize and prosper. They establish a new form of feudal system with elements of modern governance, reminiscent of the \\"Magika no Kenshi to Shōkan Vashireusu\\" universe. **Early 25th Century (Year 2400-2450)**: Muv-Luv's mechs, known as TSFs, are developed as communal defense tools against residual threats and for expansion of safe zones. Scientific progress accelerates as Japan moves to reclaim technology lost during the Daisaigai. **Mid 25th Century (Year 2450-2500)**: Elements of the \\"IS: Infinite Stratos\\" are introduced as Japan develops powered exoskeletons, combining TSF technology with newly discovered material science. These are initially used to accelerate construction and exploration. **Late 25th Century (Year 2500-2600)**: The discovery of unique bio-energy reminiscent of chakra leads to the development of what will become Quirks in \\"Boku no Hero Academia.\\" As society adapts, these augmentations become more common, creating divisions between those with and without Quirks. **27th Century (Year 2600-2700)**: An ideological shift occurs, leading to widespread acceptance of Quirks as a natural evolution of humanity. A period resembling the early setting of \\"My Hero Academia\\" ushers in a new societal structure with heroes and villains. **28th Century (Year 2700-2800)**: Amidst the new culture of superhumans, various forms of advanced technology such as \\"Hundreds,\\" \\"Divas,\\" and \\"Heavy Objects\\" are developed for both civilian and military use. Society turns towards coexistence between enhanced humans and advanced technology. **29th Century (Year 2800-2900)**: Elements of \\"Date a Live\\" and \\"Naruto\\" become prominent as Japan deals with extra-dimensional beings and the establishment of hidden villages to train individuals with unique abilities. The influence of the Ōtsutsuki Clan wanes as new powers rise. **30th Century (Year 2900-3000)**: The convergence of all these elements—Quirks, powered suits, mechs, and chakra-like energies—leads to a renaissance period of peace and scientific achievements. Hidden villages maintain the balance of power alongside government-run hero agencies. In this alternate timeline, the reconstruction and reunification of Japan by the Ōtsutsuki Clan serve as the core around which all other events revolve. While specifics on the timeline are not detailed, this provides a broad-brush picture of how such diverse universes could conceivably intertwine in a linear, progressive history. Further details and events would be required to flesh out this timeline into a complete narrative."},{"instruction":"業務を行った場合に請求する 丁寧な文章にして","output":"いつもお世話になっております。私たちの業務をご利用いただき、誠にありがとうございました。 このたび、ご依頼いただいた業務の内容について、お見積りをご案内申し上げます。以下の通り、業務内容とそれに対する請求金額をご確認ください。 【業務内容】 ・〇〇業務の実施：Ｘ時間/Ｘ日 ・△△業務のサポート：Ｙ時間/Ｚ日 ・その他付随する業務：Ａ時間/Ｂ日 【請求金額】 総合計：〇〇〇円（税込） なお、請求金額には、業務の実施・サポートに要した時間や日数、また付随する業務の内容を考慮し、合理的な金額を設定しております。 なにかご不明点や修正・追加依頼などございましたら、遠慮なくお知らせください。迅速かつ丁寧に対応いたします。 なお、お支払い方法や納品書の発行などについても別途ご相談いただければ幸いです。 今後とも、ご要望に添えるよう努めてまいりますので、引き続きよろしくお願い申し上げます。どうぞよいご日中をお過ごしください。"},{"instruction":"授業員がいないため業務がないため請求は行わない。丁寧な文章に","output":"いつもお世話になっております。株式会社〇〇の代表の〇〇でございます。 お忙しい中、ご連絡をいただきましてありがとうございます。誠に申し訳ございませんが、現在弊社には授業員が不在のため、お手伝いさせていただける業務がございません。 このような状況のため、今回は請求書を発行せず、ご請求金額の請求も行わせていただきません。ご了承いただきますようお願い申し上げます。 なお、弊社の業務体制が再開し、新たな業務が発生した際には、改めてお知らせいたします。引き続きご不明点やお困りごとがございましたら、お気軽にご連絡ください。 また、今後ともご縁がございましたら、お手伝いできる機会を心よりお待ちしております。どうぞお体をお大切にされ、ご成功を心からお祈り申し上げます。 何卒、よろしくお願いいたします。"},{"instruction":"従業員がいる場合に請求を行う","output":"いつもお世話になっております。株式会社〇〇の代表の〇〇でございます。 このたびは、弊社の業務をご利用いただきまして、誠にありがとうございます。ご依頼いただいた業務に対し、以下の通り請求書をご案内申し上げます。 【請求内容】 請求書番号：〇〇〇 請求日：〇月〇日 お客様名：〇〇様 業務内容： 〇〇業務の実施 合計時間：〇〇時間 △△業務のサポート 合計時間：〇〇時間 その他付随する業務 合計時間：〇〇時間 【請求金額】 本業務の合計金額：〇〇〇〇〇円（税込） お支払い期限：〇月〇日（請求書記載の日付から〇日間） 請求金額には、業務の実施やサポートに要した時間や資材の費用、その他の付随する業務の内容を考慮し、適切に設定させていただきました。 なお、お支払い方法については、当請求書に添付されている領収書に詳細が記載されていますので、ご確認ください。 ご不明点や追加のご要望がございましたら、いつでもご連絡ください。迅速かつ丁寧に対応させていただきます。 お支払い期限までにお支払いいただけますよう、心よりお願い申し上げます。引き続き、ご愛顧いただけますようお願い申し上げます。 何卒、よろしくお願いいたします。"},{"instruction":"１サービスを提供した場合には請求を行う ２サービスを提供した場合に請求を行う 上記どちらが正しい日本語ですか","output":"どちらの表現も正しい日本語ですが、微妙にニュアンスが異なります。 「１サービスを提供した場合には請求を行う」は、一つのサービスを提供した場合にそのサービスに対して請求を行うという意味です。 一方、「２サービスを提供した場合に請求を行う」は、二つのサービスを提供した場合にそれぞれのサービスに対して請求を行うという意味です。 具体的な文脈や状況によって使い分けることが適しています。どちらの意味を表現したいのかによって、使い分けることをお勧めします。"},{"instruction":"サービスを提供した場合には請求を行う サービスを提供した場合に請求を行う","output":"どちらの表現も正しいです。意味するところもほぼ同じですが、微妙にニュアンスが異なります。 「サービスを提供した場合には請求を行う」は、必ずサービスを提供した場合に請求を行うという意味で、確実な請求の意思を示しています。 一方、「サービスを提供した場合に請求を行う」は、サービスを提供した場合に請求を行うことが一般的であるが、必ずしも100％の確証はないというニュアンスが含まれています。 具体的な文脈や状況によって使い分けることが適しています。どちらのニュアンスを表現したいのかによって、使い分けることをお勧めします。"},{"instruction":"Make me a world that is a unique world, make a few continents and island nations. Firstly we will explore a given continent, that has nations that resemble Mid and Late 19th century countries, but are unique and doesnt have any much similarities to real life counterparts, still by what I mean counterparts is that they have the ideologies of that era.","output":"Welcome to the world of Entheria, a planet adorned with intricate coastlines, expansive ocean currents, and lush climates. Entheria is divided into several continents and island nations, each with its own distinct culture, history, and political ecosystems. Today, our journey will take us to the continent of Ilvoria, a land that has been shaped by the ideologies of the mid to late 19th century but is entirely unique in its characteristics. **Ilvoria** Ilvoria is comprised of multiple nations that evoke the spirit of the 19th-century social and political climate yet bear no resemblance to specific historical countries. The continent has four major nations: Vortigern, Lorellon, Aelcrest, and the Coalition of Ystara. **Vortigern** The northernmost nation of Vortigern is known for its vast industrial cities and its society driven by steam-driven machinery and burgeoning scientific discovery. Vortigern resembles an industrialized nation that's on the forefront of technological innovation, much like the major European powers of the late 19th century. It is ruled by a parliamentary system where the merchant class has significant influence over the state. Cities are thick with smog and factories, and a certain social unrest bubbles beneath the surface as the working class seeks to redefine its place in society. **Lorellon** South of Vortigern is Lorellon, a patchwork of kingdoms and duchies that have united under a fragile confederacy. Resembling the romantic nationalism of 19th-century Europe, Lorellon prides itself on artistic achievements, music, and its rich history. The state is filled with grand castles and manicured gardens, celebrating pageantry and ancient traditions. However, calls for democratic reforms are growing and are often met with clashes between the old guard and progressive thinkers. **Aelcrest** To the east lies Aelcrest, a sprawling empire with colonies spread across various neighboring islands. Aelcrest's nobility exerts control over their territories with an iron fist, while also grappling with the ideological movement of colonial liberation. Inspired by imperialism and colonial expansion of the era, Aelcrest's society is grappling with questions about the ethics of empire and the natural rights of man, sparking debates and potential uprisings. **Coalition of Ystara** Bordering the southern coastline of Ilvoria is the Coalition of Ystara, a federation of autonomous provinces that have banded together for mutual economic interest and defense. This merchant coalition thrives on a laissez-faire economy and navigates the delicate balance between state power and individual freedoms. Ystara is a hotbed for adventurous capitalists, with bustling ports where goods from across Entheria are traded. **Island Nations** Just offshore the western coast of Ilvoria, lie the twin island nations of Serenos and Tyvoria. These islands serve as hubs of innovation, havens for intellectuals, and sanctuaries for political exiles from their mainland neighbors. They are vibrant democracies that promote suffrage and labor rights, leading to movements that echo across the waters to influence the mainland. As you take further steps into the world of Entheria, these unique lands display the complex interplay of ideologies from 19th-century thought, such as romanticism, nationalism, liberalism, conservatism, imperialism, and the industrial revolution. However, the tapestry of local myths, customs, languages, and Entheria's indigenous flora and fauna makes it a world apart, entirely dissociated from our historical reality."},{"instruction":"你好","output":"你好！有什么可以帮到你的吗？"},{"instruction":"How do you do a tracing table when the function is recursive","output":"To create a tracing table for a recursive function, follow these steps: 1. Identify the inputs and outputs of the function. 2. Create a table with headers for each variable, including the inputs and any additional variables used within the function. 3. Write the initial input values in the first row of the table. 4. For each row, calculate the output values based on the function's logic. 5. If the function calls itself recursively, create a new row for each recursive call, using the updated variable values. 6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until you reach the desired condition or termination point. 7. Fill in the output values in the respective cells of the table. 8. Depending on your needs, you can also add additional columns to track any extra information or intermediate steps in the function. Here's an example to illustrate this process with a recursive factorial function: Function: factorial(n) Inputs: n Output: factorial of n Tracing Table: n | factorial(n) --- | ------------ 3 | ? 2 | ? 1 | ? 0 | ? Based on the recursive logic of the factorial function, we know that: factorial(0) = 1 factorial(n) = n * factorial(n - 1) Using these rules, we can begin filling in the table: Iteration 1: n | factorial(n) --- | ------------ 3 | ? 2 | ? 1 | ? 0 | 1 Iteration 2: n | factorial(n) --- | ------------ 3 | ? 2 | ? 1 | 1 0 | 1 Iteration 3: n | factorial(n) --- | ------------ 3 | ? 2 | 1 1 | 1 0 | 1 Iteration 4: n | factorial(n) --- | ------------ 3 | 1 2 | 1 1 | 1 0 | 1 Finally, we find that factorial(3) = 6 based on the completed tracing table."},{"instruction":"mengapa banyak fenomena flexing yang dilakukan selebgram sekaligus owner skincare di negara indonesia. tinjaulah dari segi bidang sosiologi, ekonoomi, budaya, scientific, dan politik","output":"1. Sosiologi: Dalam konteks sosiologi, flexing yang dilakukan oleh selebgram sekaligus owner skincare dapat dilihat sebagai upaya menjaga status sosial dan memperlihatkan simbol-simbol keberhasilan. Dalam masyarakat, khususnya di platform media sosial, terdapat tekanan untuk menampilkan kehidupan yang ideal dan sukses. Flexing menjadi sarana para influencer untuk membangun citra dan kredibilitas sosial sekaligus menarik perhatian follower mereka. Hal ini dapat sejalan dengan teori interaksionisme simbolik, yang menekankan pada interaksi sosial dan makna yang diberikan pada objek tertentu sebagai penguat identitas sosial. 2. Ekonomi: Flexing juga dapat dilihat sebagai strategi pemasaran. Selebgram yang memiliki bisnis skincare seringkali memanfaatkan popularitas mereka untuk mengiklankan dan memasarkan produk skincare milik mereka. Dengan menunjukkan gaya hidup yang mewah, mereka menarik audiens yang mengasosiasikan gaya hidup tersebut dengan kualitas dan efektivitas produk yang ditawarkan, yang pada akhirnya dapat meningkatkan penjualan dan profit. 3. Budaya: Di Indonesia, ada budaya yang dikenal dengan \\"gengsi\\" dimana menunjukkan status ekonomi dan sosial yang tinggi dianggap penting. Flexing dapat menjadi refleksi dari fenomena budaya di mana konsumsi mewah digunakan untuk memperoleh pengakuan dan penerimaan sosial. Dalam budaya populer khususnya, menampilkan kekayaan dan kemewahan telah menjadi semacam trend yang kerap dikaitkan dengan kesuksesan. 4. Scientific: Dari perspektif psikologis, flexing dapat berhubungan dengan konsep self-presentation dan image management. Individu cenderung ingin dilihat sebaik mungkin oleh orang lain dan media sosial mendorong pengguna untuk menonjolkan aspek-aspek terbaik dari kehidupan mereka. Penelitian psikologis menunjukkan bahwa mendapatkan validasi sosial melalui like dan komentar positif di media sosial dapat memberi efek adiktif dan meningkatkan rasa percaya diri. 5. Politik: Meskipun tidak secara langsung berhubungan dengan politik praktis, fenomena flexing oleh selebgram owner skincare dapat disandingkan dengan ide-ide neoliberalisme yang menekankan pada individualisme dan persaingan. Pemilik bisnis skincare yang melakukan flexing secara tidak langsung menunjukkan keberhasilan pribadi mereka yang sejalan dengan nilai-nilai pasar bebas dan usaha pribadi, yang merupakan konsep yang kuat dalam politik ekonomi neoliberal. Mengingat keadaan di setiap negara berbeda-beda, aspek-aspek ini mungkin memiliki nuansa yang berbeda di Indonesia dibandingkan dengan di negara lain. Fenomena ini adalah gambaran kompleks dari interaksi antara individu dengan lingkungan sosial, ekonomi, dan budaya yang lebih luas, dan tidak dapat dijelaskan hanya oleh satu faktor saja."},{"instruction":"Introduction about future generation organization of supporting disadvantaged talented students in oromia","output":"The future generation organization is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting disadvantaged talented students in Oromia.

In this script, Emma's about to go out shopping with a friend.","output":"In this script, the dynamic between David, Emma, and Emma's mother, Judy, is complex and potentially contentious, given that hypnotherapy was used to influence David's behavior. It's important to emphasize that the real world ethical standards of hypnotherapy would strictly prohibit its use in such a manipulative manner. However, for the purpose of fiction, let's assume a hypothetical scenario where this manipulation was possible, but highlight the fictional nature of the scenario. --- [INT. KITCHEN - DAY] (David is at the kitchen counter pouring a cup of coffee. The morning light spills in through the window. Emma enters, dressed for a day out, keys jangling in her hand.) EMMA: (excited) David, I’m going out shopping with Becca. Make sure to clean up the living room and do the dishes, okay? DAVID: (without hesitation) Yes, Emma. (He continues to stare blankly for a second before blinking and looking towards Emma, the post-hypnotic cue seeming to have worn off.) DAVID: (with a hint of confusion) Oh, sure. But, weren’t we supposed to do that together later? EMMA: (checking her phone) Change of plans. I’ll be back this afternoon, love. Can I trust you to handle it? DAVID: (frowning slightly) Yes, Emma. EMMA: (smiling, oblivious to his tone) Thanks! Oh, and we might stop for lunch, so don’t wait up. DAVID: Yes, Emma. (Emma walks out, leaving David alone. He stands still for a moment, his frustration evident. He then takes a deep breath, shakes his head slightly, and starts cleaning up the table.) [INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER] (David is dusting the living room, while Emma's mother, Judy, enters discreetly, a knowing smile on her face.) JUDY: It’s working I see. She doesn’t suspect a thing. DAVID: (stops dusting, exasperated) Yes, Judy. JUDY: Don’t blame Emma, dear. I just nudged you to be a bit more agreeable, that’s all. DAVID: (eyeing her warily) I feel like a robot. JUDY: Nonsense. You’re just being a good husband. Now, finish up here, won't you? DAVID: (resigned) Yes, Judy. (Judy exits, her smile widening. David sighs heavily, glances toward the door through which Emma left, and continues his tasks, but his expression indicates he is deep in thought, perhaps plotting how to address this manipulation.) --- Please note, in reality, hypnotherapy requires the consent of the person being hypnotized and cannot make individuals perform actions against their will or nature.

Our goal is to provide these students with the resources, opportunities, and guidance they need to thrive academically and unlock their full potential. We believe that every student, regardless of their socioeconomic background, deserves a chance to pursue their dreams and achieve their goals. However, many students from disadvantaged communities face numerous obstacles that hinder their educational progress. These obstacles may include a lack of financial resources, limited access to educational materials and extracurricular activities, and a lack of mentorship and support. At Future Generation, we work closely with local schools, community organizations, and individuals to identify these talented students who face significant barriers to success. We select districts based on their levels of poverty, educational inequality, and the presence of talented individuals who could benefit from our assistance. Once we identify these students, we offer a wide range of programs and services designed to address their specific needs. These include financial aid scholarships, tutoring and mentoring programs, access to educational resources and technology, and career guidance and support. Through our financial aid scholarships, we provide funding for tuition fees, school supplies, and other educational expenses. Our tutoring and mentoring programs pair students with dedicated and experienced mentors who guide them through their academic journey, offering personalized support and encouragement. We also strive to provide students with access to educational resources and technology they may not have otherwise. This includes providing access to libraries, computer labs, and e-learning platforms, as well as offering workshops and seminars on digital literacy and technology skills. Additionally, we offer career guidance and support, helping students explore different career paths, connecting them with internships and job opportunities, and providing workshops on resume writing and interview skills. Our organization believes in the power of education to transform lives and break the cycle of poverty. By empowering disadvantaged but talented students in selected districts, we aim to create a generation of leaders and change-makers who will contribute to the progress and development of their

However, I can certainly provide a shortened, conceptual alternate history timeline within the constraints you've outlined, which involve the complex intermingling of various anime and video game universes, taking place before certain series events. Please note this is a fictional timeline and is designed for entertainment purposes to fit within the context of the shared universe you suggest. **Alternate History Timeline: The Rise of the Reconstructed Nihon** **Year 2030-2035: The Great Cataclysm (Daisaigai)** - The Great Cataclysm devastates the world, leading to the downfall of nations and the rise of post-apocalyptic societies. In the chaos, Japan is left in a state of anarchy, with former military and police forces scattered across the land in tatters. **Year 2036: Landing of the Ōtsutsuki Clan in Post-Daisaigai Kyoto** - Members of the Ōtsutsuki Clan, escaping the aftermath of their empire's fall in the Genso no Kuni, arrive in Kyoto, Japan, exploit their powerful abilities, and quickly consolidate power, taking control of remaining law enforcement and military remnants. **Year 2037: Neo-Ōtsutsuki Conquest Begins** - The Ōtsutsuki Clan expands out of Kyoto, assimilating outskirt towns and employing the restored law enforcement and Jieitai to initiate a military conquest, aiming to bring order to the chaotic Japanese archipelago. **Year 2038-2040: The Second Sengoku Jidai** - A period mirrors the historical Sengoku Jidai as various warlords, including remnants of the Dai Tokyo Teikoku and local bandit forces, vie for control over territories. The Ōtsutsuki Clan, recognized for their strength, spearheads the reunification through strategic martial prowess and the use of their powerful Byakugan. **Year 2041: Reestablishment of the Imperial Monarchy** - The victorious Ōtsutsuki integrate the Dai Tokyo Teikoku and establish a new ruling monarchy, replacing the Winged Lightning Dynasty. They restore the pre-feudal buke system, with the Ōtsutsuki main branch positioning themselves as the new Imperial Family. **Year 2042: Reunification and Restoration Era** - The Ōtsutsuki consolidate power in the modern capital, Tokyo, refurbishing the Kōkyo as the clan compound and utilizing the capital's strategic location for governing the now-united nation, officially recognized as the Reconstructed Empire of Nihon. **Year 2043-2045: Technological and Cultural Renaissance** - Following the reunification, a period of rapid technological development ensues, triggered by rediscovered ancient technologies combined with Ōtsutsuki magic. This period also sees the introduction of Quirks, IS Units, and TSFs as remnants of pre-apocalyptic research, now exploited by the ruling clan to further cement their control. **Year 2046: The Era of Superpowers and Superheroes** - The emergence of Quirks [My Hero Academia] leads to the formation of hero agencies supported by the state to maintain public order and address new threats. TSFs [Muv-Luv] are used for national defense, while IS Units [IS: Infinite Stratos] make their appearance, signaling a new age of powered exosuits. **Year 2047-2050: Integration of Advanced Technologies** - Hundreds [Hundred], TSFs, and Divas [Magika Kenshi] become more common, now fully integrated into society. The Hyūga Clan (a branch of the Ōtsutsuki in this timeline) develops and controls the flow of these technologies while maintaining the balance of power within the nation. **Beyond 2050: A New Age Dawns** - Japan continues to flourish under the rule of the Ōtsutsuki monarchy, now a hub of technological innovation and a new form of martial and magical arts. While society has been fundamentally altered, the empire pursues stability and progress as it enters an unprecedented era of superpowered beings and mechanized warfare. Please keep in mind that creating a realistic, sensible, and plausible alternate history that intersects the various fictional timelines of anime, manga, light novels, and video games is a considerable challenge, given the varying degrees of supernatural elements and technology within these stories. As such, the proposed timeline above is speculative and creative in nature."},{"instruction":"Hi GPT I want to make a superman comic.","output":"That sounds like a fun and creative project!

Найбільш відповідним для цього є період, який припадає на останню чверть 18 - середину 19 століття, коли кінного транспорту надавали перевагу через відсутність моторизованих засобів пересування і розвинену інфраструктуру кінних доріг та поширення кіньми як надійного і доступного джерела тяги. На слайді можна побачити типовий для того часу приклад кінного громадського транспорту - карети, на фото зображена Марійська площа (нині площа Адама Міцкевича) у Львові. Використання карет як пасажирського транспорту було популярним вибором, тому що карети були розраховані на кількох пасажирів, забезпечували порівняльний комфорт і були досить швидкими для того часу. Їхня популярність та використання спрямовувались потребами містян, які мали вести бізнес у різних частинах міста, і нездатністю міської інфраструктури задовольнити попит на транспорт у зростаючих урбанізованих середовищах. Це сприяло розвитку пасажирського транспорту як сфери громадських послуг."},{"instruction":"але при цьому не посилатися ні на які слайди і фото","output":"Першим етапом розвитку міського пасажирського транспорту у найбільших містах України можна вважати використання кінної тяги. Цей етап розвитку характеризується зростанням міст та збільшенням потреби в пересуванні людей, неможливістю швидкого долання великих дистанцій пішки, і відсутністю альтернативних механізованих засобів пересування. Найбільш відповідний період для цих змін припадає на останню чверть 18 століття - середину 19 століття. Причиною вибору саме кінної тяги була її доступність, надійність як транспортної системи та вже існуюча інфраструктура, що дозволяла застосування коней і карет в якості пасажирського транспорту. У цей час у містах такі як Львів, що є одним з найстаріших та найбільших міст українських земель, кінні карети стали звичними на вулицях. Кінні карети були доступні для перевезення багатьох пасажирів одночасно і забезпечували поїздку суворо визначеним маршрутом, що згодом стало основою майбутньої мережі громадського транспорту. Особливістю такого виду транспорту був його порівняно високий рівень комфорту і швидкість порівняно з пішохідним способом пересування, а також соціальний статус, який передбачала можливість подорожі каретою. Кінний транспорт був ефективним рішенням для долання відстаней в міських умовах, але мав свої обмеження у вигляді залежності від фізичного стану коней та потреби в постійному догляді за ними. Висновок, який можна зробити з цього етапу розвитку міського пасажирського транспорту, полягає в тому, що основними чинниками, що формували його вигляд, стали технічні можливості того часу і потреби населення в швидкому та комфортному пересуванні по розростаючомуся міському простору."},{"instruction":"Другий етап розвитку пов'язаний з бурхливим розвитком промисловості і відповідним зростанням міст України, коли з’явилася потреба у більш потужних перевезеннях населення.

Він характеризувався появою більших за місткістю карет -диліжансів і так званих рейкових \\"конок\\", де почали застосовувати перші вагони на кінській тязі. На слайді представлена типова\\"конка\\", яка курсувала вулицею Білопільською у м. Бердичів.

Якщо попередньо кінні карети вже виконували основну транспортну роль в міських умовах, то в середині 19 століття виникли нові виклики, пов'язані з необхідністю збільшення місткості транспорту та ефективності його використання. Цей період, який тривав близько 50 років з середини до кінця 19 століття, характеризувався інноваціями, такими як диліжанси, які могли перевозити більшу кількість пасажирів завдяки своїм розмірам і покращеній конструкції. Проте ще більш значущою була поява тяглового транспорту, що курсував по рейках - \\"конок\\", які вже представляли собою вагони на кінській тязі. Порівняно з класичними каретами, \\"конки\\" були більш економічними в експлуатації, оскільки рух по рейках вимагав менше зусиль від коней та дозволяв перевозити більше пасажирів одночасно. Поява \\"конок\\" була прямо пов'язана з міською індустріалізацією та зростанням чисельності робочої сили, що переїздила до промислових центрів, таких як місто Бердичів. Зручність і швидкість рейкового конного транспорту сприяли не тільки комерційному, але й соціальному прогресу, оскільки вони забезпечили доступніші та регулярні перевезення для ширших верств населення. Важливо, що цей етап засвідчив поступовий перехід від індивідуального до масового пасажирського транспорту і ліг в основу для подальшої модернізації міських транспортних систем, аж до появи механічних видів транспорту в наступних століттях."},{"instruction":"Третій етап розвитку ГПТ співпадає з появою електричного транспорту, який прийшов на заміну кінному транспорту.

Електричний транспорт дозволив забезпечити більш частотне та регулярне сполучення в рамках міст, реагуючи на зростаючі потреби урбанізованої та індустріалізованої суспільності. Він став синонімом прогресу та модернізації міського образу життя. У таких містах, як Київ, впровадження електричних трамваїв мало значний вплив на розвиток транспортної інфраструктури. Перші столичні трамваї, які розпочали курсувати по Царській площі (яка нині відома як Європейська), стали важливим символом переходу до нової ери міського транспорту та підвищення якості міських перевезень.

Автобуси і тролейбуси, завдяки своїй мобільності та порівняно меншим витратам на будівництво інфраструктури порівняно з трамвайними лініями, змогли забезпечити ширше покриття міських та передміських районів. Вони стали основним засобом пересування по місту для через свою доступність і відносну дешевизну перевезень. Саме ці види транспорту взяли на себе головну роль у масових пасажирських перевезеннях в містах Радянського Союзу, в тому числі й України.

Wanneer een bedrijf meerdere producten produceert en er sprake is van capaciteitsbeperkingen, moet het bedrijf beslissingen maken over welke producten voorrang krijgen in de productie. De beslissing moet gemaakt worden op basis van de bijdrage per eenheid van de beperkende factor, oftewel de contributiemarge per eenheid van de productiebeperkende factor. De contributiemarge is het verschil tussen de verkoopprijs van een product en de variabele kosten per eenheid. Door deze contributiemarge te vergelijken voor elke eenheid van de beperkende factor (zoals machineuren, arbeidsuren, grondstoffen, enzovoort), kan het bedrijf bepalen welk product de meeste bijdrage levert aan de winst, gegeven de beperkingen van de productiemiddelen. Hiermee kan een onderneming ervoor zorgen dat ze de beschikbare capaciteit zo efficiënt mogelijk gebruikt om de totale winst te maximaliseren. Het focussen op de hoogste winstmarge per product zonder rekening te houden met de beperkende factor kan resulteren in een suboptimale productiemix omdat sommige producten met een hoge winstmarge mogelijk meer van de beperkte hulpbronnen verbruiken, wat ten koste gaat van andere producten die een hogere contributiemarge per eenheid van de beperkende factor zouden kunnen opleveren."},{"instruction":"Fundamentals of Financial Management (Brigham Houston)","output":"\\"Fundamentals of Financial Management\\" is a popular finance textbook authored by Eugene F.

He shaved his hair, according to the fashion of that region, so that his sidelocks fell down at the back, and he wore his topknot short. The long sword that he carried by his side was most striking, but, this too being a custom ofthese parts, none thought to reprove him. Day and night this Gengobei devoted himself to the love of men; nor had he once in the twenty-six springs of his life dallied with the frail and long-haired sex. For many years now he had been enamoured of a young boy by the name of Nakamura Hachijuro, towhom hc had from the outset bound himself by the deepest vowsof Iifclong loyalty. Hachijuro was a youth of the greatest beauty,Iike in purity to a single-petalled cherry whose blossoms are yet but haIf opened. His indeed was the flavour of a flower endowed with the gift of human speech. One evening as the rain fell gloomily outside, the two young men immured themselves in the little room where Gengobei was wont to stay, and played their flutes in concert. The sound of the music echoed quietly in the dark, adding to the night’s gentle melancholy. The wind that blew in through the window carried with it the fragrance of plum blossoms, scenting therewith the loose sleeves of the young men’s dress; outside, the birds at roost were startled by the rustling of the black bamboo, and the sound oftheir wings as they fluttered to and fro had a mournful note.","output":"As Gengobei and Hachijuro continued to play, their flutes danced together in a harmonious duet. Their melodies intertwined like the delicate threads of a spider's web, weaving a tapestry of emotions that resonated deeply in their hearts. But despite the beauty of their music, there was an underlying sadness that permeated the room. It was a melancholy born from the knowledge that their love was forbidden, that societal norms dictated they could never truly be together. Gengobei's heart ached with a bittersweet longing as he watched Hachijuro play. The young boy's fingers moved effortlessly across the flute, his lips forming gentle notes that drifted into the air like whispers of love. Each breath he took seemed to stir a yearning deep within Gengobei's soul. As the concert of the flutes reached its crescendo, Gengobei's heart swelled with a mixture of joy and sorrow. The music spoke of their shared passion, their unspoken desires, and the intensity of their connection. It was a language understood only by the two of them, a secret world they inhabited within the confines of their small room. But as the last haunting note faded into the night, reality came crashing down upon them. The knowledge that their love could never be openly acknowledged shattered the fragile beauty they had created. The weight of their forbidden desires pressed upon them like a mountain, crushing their hopes and dreams. Gengobei and Hachijuro knew that their concert of love could only exist in the shadows, hidden from a world that would never understand or accept them. And so, they continued to play their flutes in secret, finding solace and fleeting moments of happiness in the music they created together. But deep within their souls, they both longed for a day when society would change, when love would no longer be bound by the constraints of tradition and prejudice. They dreamed of a time when they could openly celebrate their love, their music serving as a beacon of hope for others who shared their path. And so, as the rain continued to fall outside, Gengobei and Hachijuro played on. Their flutes wove a tale of love, longing, and the unyielding spirit of two souls who dared to defy the world's expectations. In that small room, their music became a testament to the power of love, a testament that would echo through the mountains and inspire others to follow their hearts, no matter the cost."},{"instruction":"Translate thai","output":"ข้อร้องเรียนของเก็งโกเบย์ เที่ยวภูมิใจของความรัก เก็งโกเบย์ ชาวหมู่บ้านที่ไหว้รักในเพลงบอลลาดแม้นว่าจะเกิดมาจากกาโกชิม่าในจังหวัดซาตสึมะ แต่กลับแสดงให้เห็นถึงรสนิยมที่อันทรงคุณค่าของเขา เขาโกนผมตามแบบของขุมพรหมิงนั้นสวยงามที่สุด เส้นผมข้างของเขาจมูกลงไปด้านหลังและเขาว่ายกอดออกมาสั้นตามหลักที่เป็นประเพณีของท้องถิ่น กระบี่ยาวที่เขาพกไว้ข้างเขาดูสวยงามอย่างสะท้อนสายตา แต่เรื่องนี้เป็นธรรมเนียมของของพื้นดิน ไม่มีใครจะประชาสัมพันธ์กับเขาใด ๆ กลางวันและกลางคืน เก็งโกเบย์เสียสมาธิตนเองให้กับความรักที่มนุษย์ และเขาไม่เคยประสบกับเพศที่อ่อนไหวและผมยาวในส가พรักเหมือนกันครั้งใด ๆ ต่อมานานแล้วเค้ามีความรักสุดครึกครื้นที่เชื่อมต่อกับหนุ่มชื่อนางมุนัมูละโชรโจโร ที่เค้าจะยอมฝังกังวลตนเองไว้สำหรับชีวิตรักยาวนาน หม่องแบบมั่นใจที่มีความสวยงามกรุ่นกริ่งที่ผ่านมาแล้วดอกบอดอกเดียวเหลือครึ่งเปิดให้เห็นเท่านั้น การพลิกความรสสีเช่นนี้กินถมกรายจากดอกไม้ที่ได้รับของสิทธิ์มนุษย์ ในหนึ่งค่ำคืนที่ฝนตกติดต่อกันอย่างมืดมนกางทั้งสองผู้ชายที่รักษาตัวอยู่ในห้องเล็กที่เก็บเฉพาะเก็บบัว เล่นเพลงฟลุ๊ตด้วยกันจนคนข้างนอกต้องได้ยินเสียงเสียงเพลงเบา ๆ ที่สัมผัสกับความเศร้าสลดของคืน ลมที่พัดเข้ามาผ่านหน้าต่างส่งกลิ่นของดอกล่มสีพลัมออกไปน้ำหอมกับตุบออกบาเปลื้องเสื้อผ้ารูปแบบของเยาวชนสองคน; ภายนอกนักพันธุ์นกที่พักอคลีต้องระหกระเหงผ่านเสียงการศอกลงไปทุกทิศทางและเสียงปีกของพวกเขาที่กระปรี้กระเปร่าร้อน"},{"instruction":"Witaj","output":"Witaj!

One, tak jak ja, z pochodzenia były polkami jednak studiowały w Paryżu. Wszystkie trzy przyjaźniłyśmy się od podstawówki. Ja jednak byłam o rok starsza od moich kumpelek. I, co by nie mówić, najbardziej się wyróżniałam. Poza intensywnie rudymi włosami, miałam też dosyć bladą skórę, błękitne, bardzo jasne oczy. Makijaż też lubiłam lżejszy, bardziej dziewczęcy. Składała się na niego tylko szminka w odcieniu w miarę neutralnym, lekko różowym. Lubiłam też nosić pastelowe sukienki. Marcela miała nieco ciemniejszą skórę, granatowe oczy oraz mlecznoczekoladowe włosy. Szminkę zaś miała w kolorze ni to różowym ni to liliowym… Ubierała się też zdecydowanie bardziej jak chłopczyca. Dorota miała z kolei rudobrązowe, dużo ciemniejsze od moich włosy, jasną acz rumianą cerę, bursztynowe oczy. Pomadkę również miała w dość neutralnym odcieniu, ale bardziej wchodzącym w koral...jednak ona z kolei nosiła się w stylu lat osiemdziesiątych…. Kiedy tylko weszłam to z miejsca dziewczyny zagadały do mnie — I jak tam dzisiaj? — A wiecie… Ogólnie spoko...Ale Pani Jennings złożyła mi dziś...dziwną propozycję. — Jaką? — Wyobraźcie sobie, że zaproponowała mi, żebym zgłosiła się do The Voice… Chwilę czekałam na reakcje przyjaciółek. Te w odpowiedzi… zaśmiały się? — No to na co jeszcze czekasz? Laska! — zagadnęła do mnie Doris, jak pieszczotliwie nazywałam Dorotę. — Czyli co? Myślicie, że powinnam iść? — zapytałam zaintrygowana, na co obie tylko przewróciły oczami. — No, dobra...czemu nie. To powiedziawszy siadłam do komputera, poszukałam formularza zgłoszeniowego, wypełniłam go… i wysłałam, włącznie z wszystkimi innymi potrzebnymi plikami. Teraz więc wystarczyło zaczekać parę dni. Myślałam oczywiście, iż na tym moja przygoda się skończy, bo nikt nawet nie weźmie mojego zgłoszenia pod uwagę i nie będziemy już wracać do tego tematu… Jakież więc było moje zdziwienie, kiedy po kilku dniach okazało się, że na moim e-mailu jest odpowiedź zwrotna… I to pozytywna! Zapraszali mnie na przesłuchania w ciemno… Odbywające się za tydzień! — Uszczypnijcie mnie, bo chyba śnię! — powiedziałam, dalej nie dowierzając, mimo, że razem z dziewczynami czytałyśmy tę odpowiedź już po raz piąty. Po raz piąty również prosiłam o uszczypnięcie, na co Dorota stwierdziła — Eh. Koniec ze szczypaniem, no chyba że na przesłuchaniu w ciemno chcesz się pojawić z siniakami. Musiałam więc wybrać piosenkę i się jej nauczyć, choć tym drugim nie miało być najmniejszego problemu. Większym problemem było właśnie samo jej wybranie. Weszłam więc jak najszybciej na YouTube i zaczęłam wertować portal od góry do dołu w poszukiwaniu czegoś adekwatnego. Przyjaciółki próbowały pomóc mi w wyborze. — Dobra...Przede wszystkim w jakim języku zamierzasz śpiewać? — spytała Dotty. — No chyba po francusku, nie? — spytałam może nieco retorycznie. — Dobra… A w jaki gatunek pójdziesz? — spytała Marcela — Albo pop albo Ballada… — zawyrokowałam — Okej...Coś nowego? Coś starego? — spytała ponownie Dotty. — Może coś nieco starszego ale też nie aż tak stare… Powiedzmy z przedziału lat od dwa tysiące do dwa tysiące dziesięć… Przystąpiłyśmy więc do wybierania odpowiedniej piosenki.

Production (Technical) summary, potential sets, and a Soundtrack listing.. Act 1 (Late 50's to 1965) Act 2 (1965-69) Act 3 (1969) Act 4 (1969 into the 1970's)..","output":"**Apollo... The Musical - Production Summary** \\"Apollo... The Musical\\" is an ambitious and celebratory musical theater piece that dramatizes the space race and the iconic moon landings of the Apollo program, culminating in the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. Drawing on classic American/Broadway styles, the production combines soaring ballads, rousing ensemble numbers, and electrifying dance sequences to bring the era of space exploration to life. **Sets** - *Act 1: NASA Headquarters & a 1950s American Home* - A dual set with 1950s NASA offices on one side, with desks, rotary phones, and large maps of space; and a typical American home on the other, reflecting the domestic backdrop of the time. - *Act 2: Mission Control & Lunar Surface* - A high-tech (for the era) Mission Control center with consoles, big screens, and a backdrop of Earth as seen from space; and the lunar surface, which can be a rocky, barren landscape with a backdrop of stars and Earth in the distance. - *Act 3: Apollo 11 Mission* - A detailed replica of the Apollo 11 spacecraft's interior for \\"inside\\" scenes, a realistic lunar surface for the landing, and a Mission Control that reflects the increasing technology of the late 1960s. - *Act 4: Space & Earth Orbit* - A portrayal of the vastness of space highlighting the Apollo and Soyuz spacecraft, culminating in a set showing Earth from orbit, symbolizing the perspective and unity space exploration can provide. **Soundtrack** **Act 1: Late '50s to 1965** 1. *\\"Dream of Stars\\" (Opening Number)* - A powerful and optimistic start as the cast sings about the boundless hopes for space exploration. 2. *\\"Race to the Moon\\"* - A lively number expressing the competitive spirit between the US and USSR. 3. *\\"Sputnik's Beep (The Challenge)\\"* - A tense number as the Sputnik launch sends shockwaves through the American public and government. 4. *\\"Kennedy's Vision\\"* - A rousing manifesto of American determination following Kennedy's promise to land a man on the moon. 5. *\\"Building Dreams\\"* - An ensemble number showcasing the workers and engineers as they prepare for the missions ahead. **Act 2: 1965-69** 6. *\\"Gemini's Waltz\\"* - A more intimate piece highlighting the bond between astronauts and the grace of spacewalks. 7. *\\"Countdown\\"* - A fast-paced, anticipatory number as the critical moments before a launch are expressed through song and dance. 8. *\\"Tragedy of Apollo 1\\"* - A somber and emotional tribute to the fallen astronauts of Apollo 1. 9. *\\"A Giant Leap in Waiting\\"* - A track reflecting the anticipation and collective breath-holding on the eve of Apollo 11's launch. **Act 3: 1969** 10. *\\"Tranquility Base\\"* - A serene and majestic number, named after the Apollo 11 landing site, capturing the awe of stepping onto another world. 11. *\\"One Small Step\\"* - A heartfelt ballad as Armstrong's first steps on the moon unfold in slow motion on stage. 12. *\\"The Eagle Has Landed\\"* - An exhilarating ensemble piece celebrating the successful landing. **Act 4: 1969 into the 1970s** 13. *\\"Homeward Bound\\"* - A reflective and hopeful song as Apollo 11 returns to Earth. 14. *\\"Rendezvous in Orbit\\"* - A dynamic number illustrating the technical dance of Apollo-Soyuz docking. 15. *\\"Handshake in Space\\"* - A powerful duet between American and Soviet astronaut characters symbolizing the potential for unity. 16. *\\"One Blue Marble (Finale)\\"* - The entire cast joins in a sweeping, uplifting anthem about Earth as seen from space and the shared humanity of all Earth's inhabitants. Technical approaches would include LED screens for dynamic backdrops, wire rigs for 'zero-gravity' scenes, specialized lighting to imitate the stark contrasts of space, and perhaps innovative projection mapping to transport the audience between Earth and the cosmos seamlessly. The final scene with the linkup of Apollo/Soyuz might even use a rotating stage to symbolize the orbit and unity of the two spacecraft and countries. The dazzling costumes would range from 1950s civilian wear to historically accurate NASA uniforms and spacesuits, complete with helmets and mission patches. With an American Broadway approach, \\"Apollo... The Musical\\" becomes not just educational but also a deeply inspirational and entertaining portrayal of one of humanity's greatest collective achievements."},{"instruction":"Act4 has to mention Apollo 13.. Maybe a number using the Mission Control set., with worrried exchanges between the staff, transitioning between these and technical soloutions...

The Musical\\" would provide a gripping dramatic turn as well as maintain historical accuracy and add depth to the story. The narrative you've proposed offers a rollercoaster of emotions, from the highs of a seemingly routine mission to the lows of a life-threatening emergency, and then back to the relief and triumph of survival. This sequence mirrors the classic Broadway formula where Act 2 opens with a re-establishment of themes and sometimes a dip into darker material before resolving into an uplifting finale. Your suggested adjustments are as follows: **End of Act 3** - The jubilant ending of \\"Homeward Bound\\" can serve as the triumphant Act 3 closing. This number can now emphasize the overall success of the Apollo program up to that point, culminating in the Apollo 11 and 12 triumphs, and audiences might leave for intermission on a high note. - In a reprise or transition moment, the Mission Control set is jubilant, celebrating the Apollo 12 landing with perhaps a brief musical interlude or a recording echoing the landing success being woven into the score. The mood is optimistic, the American spirit is high, and then sharply contrasted when the lights dim, and the chilling \\"Houston, we've had a problem\\" is broadcast, bringing Act 3 to a dramatic close and setting up the stakes for Act 4. **Act 4 Opening** - The set is again Mission Control, now with a tense atmosphere. The opening number for Act 4, \\"A Singular Challenge\\", plays out with actors portraying Mission Control staff and astronauts, expressing the dread of the situation through solemn melodies interspersed with sharp, precise technical jargon to convey the gravity of the crisis. The control center becomes a storm of activity, with characters urgently moving about as music builds tension. **Act 4 Song Additions** 1. *\\"A Singular Challenge\\"* - A tense, urgent number reflecting the crisis of Apollo 13, focused on Mission Control's scrambling for solutions set against the astronauts' struggles in space. 2. *\\"A Stroke of Genius\\"* - This could follow \\"A Singular Challenge,\\" as engineers come up with the idea for the CO2 scrubber, set to an intricate, cerebral tune. 3. *\\"Breath of Life\\"* - A song reflecting the moment the improvised CO2 scrubber starts working, allowing for a collective sigh of relief. 4. *\\"Safely Home\\"* - A reprise of \\"Homeward Bound,\\" perhaps now a bittersweet refrain reflecting the mixed emotions of Apollo 13's safe return - the thankfulness for life tempered by the near-disaster. 5. *\\"Steadfast to the Stars\\"* - An ensemble recovery piece that drives home the resolve to continue space exploration despite risks, reinforcing the theme of perseverance. **Continuation** - After the dramatic and emotional resolution of the Apollo 13 crisis, the musical flows back into the narrative trajectory towards the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, linking back to the themes of cooperation and optimism, thus tying the storyline together with the theme of overcoming adversity and international unity.

Canada experiences quite harsh winters, with extremely cold temperatures, and heating devices such as room heaters help to keep homes warm and comfortable. A thermostat is a device used to regulate and control the temperature in a space. It is commonly used in Canada, as it allows individuals to set their desired temperature and maintain a consistent level of heat. The thermostat monitors the current temperature and adjusts the heating system accordingly to reach the desired temperature. It is considered common and essential in many Canadian households. The main difference between a thermostat and a room heater is that a thermostat is a control device, whereas a room heater is a heat-generating appliance. The thermostat regulates the heater's operation by turning it on or off based on the temperature set by the user. So, while the room heater provides the actual heat, the thermostat controls when and how much heat is generated."},{"instruction":"So thermostat is a product of room heater ?","output":"No, a thermostat is not a product of a room heater. A thermostat is a separate device that is used in conjunction with a room heater or any other heating or cooling system. It controls the operation of the heater by monitoring the current temperature and adjusting the heating system accordingly. The thermostat can be connected to various types of heating systems, including room heaters, central heating systems, or even air conditioning units. It acts as a control mechanism for regulating the temperature in a space, ensuring that it stays within the desired range."},{"instruction":"So we can't use thermostat to control heat temperature without a room heater right ?","output":"That is correct. A thermostat alone cannot control heat temperature without a compatible heating system or room heater. The thermostat is designed to work in conjunction with a heating source, such as a room heater or central heating system. It senses the current temperature and communicates with the heating device to turn it on or off based on the desired temperature set by the user. Without a heating source, the thermostat wouldn't have anything to control and regulate. Therefore, a thermostat needs a compatible heating system or room heater to be effective in controlling and maintaining the temperature in a space."},{"instruction":"What heating system is most common in Canada ?","output":"The most common heating system in Canada is the forced-air furnace, powered by natural gas. It is widely used in both residential and commercial buildings. Natural gas furnaces are popular due to their efficiency, reliability, and availability of natural gas infrastructure in many regions of the country. They distribute warm air through ductwork and vents to heat the entire space. Other heating systems that are commonly used in Canada include electric baseboard heaters, radiant floor heating, and wood-burning stoves or fireplaces. These options are often chosen depending on factors such as the availability of fuel sources, energy efficiency, and the specific heating needs of the building or region."},{"instruction":"So room heater aren't most common there in Canada right ?","output":"While forced-air furnaces are the most common heating system in Canada, room heaters are still commonly used as supplemental heating sources in specific situations. Room heaters, such as electric space heaters or portable heaters, can be used to provide additional warmth to specific rooms or areas within a home, especially during extremely cold periods or if certain rooms are not adequately heated by the central heating system. Additionally, in homes or buildings without a central heating system, room heaters may be the primary source of heat. This could be the case in smaller apartments, cabins, or older homes that do not have a ducted heating system installed. So, while room heaters may not be the most common heating option overall in Canada, they still have their uses and are often employed for additional or localized heating."},{"instruction":"What heating system and Central heating system in Canada do we have to install it and is it room heater are they same ?","output":"To install a heating system in Canada, it typically involves engaging the services of a professional HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) contractor. The specific requirements and installation process may vary depending on the type of heating system chosen. A central heating system usually requires professional installation. It involves the installation of a primary heating unit, such as a furnace or a boiler, which is connected to a network of ducts or pipes running throughout the building. This allows for the distribution of warm air or hot water to different rooms or areas of the building. A central heating system provides consistent heating throughout the entire space. On the other hand, a room heater is generally a standalone unit that can be plugged into an electrical outlet or operated using other fuel sources. They are designed to heat a specific room or area rather than the entire building. Room heaters are often more portable and can be easily moved between rooms. So, while both central heating systems and room heaters provide heat, they differ in terms of scale, coverage area, and installation requirements. Central heating systems are typically installed throughout the entire building, while room heaters are standalone units used to heat specific spaces."},{"instruction":"So room heaters are only portable and cannot be used for entire house ?","output":"Room heaters are primarily designed to heat specific rooms or smaller areas rather than an entire house. They are typically smaller in size, portable, and often meant for localized heating. While they can provide supplemental heat in a room, they generally do not have the capacity or efficiency to heat an entire house efficiently. To achieve whole-house heating, a central heating system, such as a forced-air furnace or a boiler, is typically employed. These systems are designed to distribute heat throughout the entire building using ductwork or pipes, providing consistent heating to all rooms. While room heaters can be a convenient option to provide additional warmth to individual rooms, they are not recommended as the primary source of heat for an entire house due to their limited capacity and localized nature."},{"instruction":"So central heating system is most common in Canada right if it is so then which Central heating system is most common ?","output":"Yes, central heating systems are indeed the most common heating systems in Canada. The specific type of central heating system that is most common can vary depending on the region and fuel availability. However, in many parts of Canada, the forced-air furnace powered by natural gas is the prevailing choice. Natural gas furnaces are highly popular due to the abundance of natural gas resources in Canada and the well-developed infrastructure to supply it. They are known for their efficiency, reliability, and effectiveness in providing consistent heating to homes and buildings. Other types of central heating systems, such as boilers that use oil or propane, heat pumps, or electric furnaces, are also used in Canada, but natural gas forced-air furnaces remain the most prevalent and widely chosen option. It is important to note that the specific prevalence of heating systems can vary across provinces and regions based on factors such as climate, fuel availability, and individual preferences."}]`),R={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},N={class:"search-container"},P={class:"card-container"},j={key:0,class:"empty-state"},M=["disabled"],O={key:0},L={key:1};function H(i,e,h,m,n,s){const g=f("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",N,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",P,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,p)=>(a(),k(g,{key:p,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",j,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
