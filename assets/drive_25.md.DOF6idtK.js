He is a teacher who reformed English to make American identity stronger. Linguists celebrated his 250th birthday on October 16. After the Revolutionary War (1775~ 1783),Webster believed that Americans should have their own dictionary,rather than rely on British versions . He dropped the British \\"u\\" in some words.

In defining preposterous (unreasonable),he wrote: \\"A republican government in the hands of females is preposterous.\\" Webster spent 28 years on the project before completing the 70,000-word dictionary in 1828 with his American-style spellings. He also added local words. His dictionary was widely used in schools. Linguists believed it helped a new nation achieve unity and cultural independence at a time when most were focused on political freedom. \\"He was the shaper of our language and the shaper of American identity,\\"said Joshua Kendall,who is working on a biography about Webster. \\"He at last bonded us through our language.\\" Why did Noah Webster create these differences in his dictionary?

A:","output":"A: The music for the Pirates of the Caribbean film series was primarily composed by renowned German composer Hans Zimmer, with contributions from other composers and music producers such as Klaus Badelt, Geoff Zanelli, and Rodrigo y Gabriela. The series, which comprises five installments so far, features individual scores for each movie. The first film, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003), had its soundtrack composed by Klaus Badelt, with Hans Zimmer serving as a score producer and contributing some themes. This score has been recognized for its memorable and iconic themes, most notably \\"He's a Pirate,\\" which became the main theme of the entire series. For the second and third installments, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006) and Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007), Hans Zimmer took over as the primary composer. These scores included several well-known themes such as \\"Davy Jones,\\" \\"The Kraken,\\" and \\"One Day.\\" Zimmer maintained the unique sound from the first film while developing the music further to suit the evolving storylines and characters. Zimmer continued his work on the series with the fourth installment, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (2011). For this film, Zimmer collaborated with acclaimed Mexican guitar duo Rodrigo y Gabriela to create a distinct sound that blended classical orchestral elements with traditional Latin American and Spanish guitar. The soundtrack includes cues like \\"Angelica\\" and \\"Blackbeard\\" which added to the rich musical tapestry in the series. In the fifth and most recent film, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales (2017), Zimmer passed on the compositional baton to his long-time collaborator, Geoff Zanelli. Zanelli had worked with Zimmer on all previous installments as a member of Zimmer's team. While he composed the original score for this movie, Zanelli built upon and incorporated some of the themes created by Zimmer and Badelt, maintaining the characteristic musical atmosphere tied to the series. In summary, the music for Pirates of the Caribbean primarily comes from the creative genius of Hans Zimmer, with vital contributions from Klaus Badelt, Geoff Zanelli, and the guitar duo Rodrigo y Gabriela. The iconic music from the series is cherished for its adventurous, swashbuckling, and action-packed sound that perfectly complements the films' legendary pirate tales."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Information: - Lyon or (more archaically) Lyons (or ) is a city in east-central France, in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, about from Paris and from Marseille.

From September to November, the group recorded War at Windmill Lane Studios. Lillywhite, who had a policy of not working with an artist more than twice, was convinced by the group to return as their producer for a third time.

Located in eastern Germany, near the border with the Czech Republic, Dresden has a rich and vibrant history dating back to its founding in 1206. The city is situated along the Elbe River, which imparts natural beauty and provides a picturesque setting for the many historical and architectural landmarks found throughout the city. Historically, Dresden has been an important center of cultural, educational, and political activities in Germany. In the 18th century, it flourished as a key center for the arts and sciences under the rule of Augustus the Strong and his son, Augustus III. During their reigns, the city became home to renowned institutions like the Saxon State Library and the Dresden University of Technology, paving the way for a strong intellectual foundation. One of Dresden's most iconic landmarks is the Frauenkirche, a Lutheran church with an impressive baroque-style dome. Built in the 18th century, the church was destroyed during the infamous World War II bombing raids on the city in 1945. However, it was painstakingly reconstructed using original plans in the years following German reunification and has since served as a potent symbol of peace and reconciliation. Another notable landmark is the Zwinger Palace, a magnificent baroque complex that houses an art gallery, a porcelain collection, and a museum dedicated to mathematics and physics. The palace's picturesque gardens and fountains also provide a serene space for locals and tourists alike to enjoy. The Semperoper, Dresden's grand opera house, is internationally renowned for its exceptional acoustics and stunning architecture. The opera house has been the site of numerous world premieres, including works by celebrated composers Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss. Dresden has also gained a reputation for its lively arts scene, with many galleries, studios, and museums to satisfy art enthusiasts.

(1). no. (2). yes.","output":"The two questions provided are not the same, so my answer would be (1). no. To address each question separately: 1. Why was that France declare Cochinchina as a separate state, the Autonomous Republic of Cochinchina in June 1946? Cochinchina was the southern portion of Vietnam which was conquered and colonized by the French in the mid-19th century. It was then integrated into French Indochina, a federation of French colonial territories in Southeast Asia that existed from 1887 to 1954. The creation of the Autonomous Republic of Cochinchina in June 1946 was part of the struggle for power and influence in the region that took place in the wake of World War II. During the war, Vietnam was under Japanese occupation, and France lost its control and influence over the region. After Japan's surrender, a power vacuum emerged, and various local forces vied for control. Among them were the Vietnamese communist movement led by Ho Chi Minh, which sought to establish a unified, independent Vietnam free from French colonial rule. To counterbalance these nationalist forces, the French government attempted to regain its lost influence in Vietnam by declaring Cochinchina as a separate state under the name of the Autonomous Republic of Cochinchina. They hoped that by establishing a separate political entity, it would be easier to cultivate pro-French sentiment and undermine the efforts of the nationalist and communist movements. However, this move ultimately led to increased tensions and armed conflict between the French and these independence-seeking Vietnamese forces, resulting in the First Indochina War (1946-1954). The war concluded with the 1954 Geneva Agreement, which led to the division of Vietnam into North and South, with Cochinchina merging into the latter. 2. \\"The Constitution declares India to be a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic then why is India known exclusively as 'The Republic of India'?\\" The official name of India as per its Constitution is the \\"Republic of India.\\" However, the Constitution also describes India as a sovereign, socialist, secular, and democratic republic to highlight the core values and principles that form the foundation of the Indian state. The term \\"Republic\\" primarily refers to a form of government in which the head of state is not a hereditary monarch, and the people hold the ultimate authority over their government and leaders, usually through an elected parliament. Being designated as a republic underscores the fact that political power is derived from the people, and that the leaders are accountable to them. On the other hand, the other descriptors of India - sovereign, socialist, secular, and democratic - emphasize the key principles that the nation seeks to uphold. - \\"Sovereign\\" signifies that India is an independent, self-governing entity that can determine its own policies, both internal and external, without external interference. - \\"Socialist\\" reflects a commitment to addressing social and economic inequalities and achieving greater social justice. - \\"Secular\\" defines India as a state that does not have an official religion and treats all religions equally, with freedom of belief and worship for its citizens. - \\"Democratic\\" emphasizes India's system of representative governance, where citizens can participate in the political process, express their opinions, and elect their representatives. These attributes help to define and contextualize the nature of the Republic of India beyond simply being a republic. However, for practical purposes and simplicity, India is commonly referred to as the Republic of India, as the essential criteria of being a republic are upheld, and the other aspects of its governance are understood from the context of its Constitution and functioning."},{"instruction":"Let's say that \\"John was jogging through the park when he saw a man juggling watermelons.

John began to explore an alliance with the French king Philip II, freshly returned from the crusade. John hoped to acquire Normandy, Anjou and the other lands in France held by Richard in exchange for allying himself with Philip. John was persuaded not to pursue an alliance by his mother. Longchamp, who had left England after Walter's intervention, now returned, and argued that he had been wrongly removed as justiciar. John intervened, suppressing Longchamp's claims in return for promises of support from the royal administration, including a reaffirmation of his position as heir to the throne. When Richard still did not return from the crusade, John began to assert that his brother was dead or otherwise permanently lost. Richard had in fact been captured en route to England by the Duke of Austria and was handed over to Emperor Henry VI, who held him for ransom. John seized the opportunity and went to Paris, where he formed an alliance with Philip. He agreed to set aside his wife, Isabella of Gloucester, and marry Philip's sister, Alys, in exchange for Philip's support. Fighting broke out in England between forces loyal to Richard and those being gathered by John. John's military position was weak and he agreed to a truce; in early 1194 the king finally returned to England, and John's remaining forces surrendered. John retreated to Normandy, where Richard finally found him later that year. Richard declared that his younger brother – despite being 27 years old – was merely \\"a child who has had evil counsellors\\" and forgave him, but removed his lands with the exception of Ireland.

Additionally, it distracts from the main focus of the paragraph, which is the market scene. [ii] is shown lying on the ground while eating an ice cream: While this option certainly includes the presence of a dog, it is an unusual activity for a dog to be eating an ice cream, which might raise questions about its realism.

The results are based on interviews with voters entering randomly selected precinct sites and telephone interviews with early and absentee voters. In Colorado, all interviews were by telephone. The results are subject to a potential sampling error; those based on smaller subgroups have a larger potential sampling error. In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of voter opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results from such polls should differ by no more than plus or minus 2 percentage points nationally, and 3 to 5 points in each state, from what would have been obtained by seeking to interview all voters who cast ballots in each of these elections. The survey in 2010 was also conducted by Edison Research. In 2004, 2006, and 2008, the exit polls were conducted by Edison Media Research and Mitofsky International; from 1994 through 2002, the polls were conducted by Voter News Service; and in 1990 and 1992 by Voter Research and Surveys. Direct comparisons from year-to-year should factor in differences in how the questions were asked. For example, before 2000, married was an item on a check list.

This information explains the methodology employed in data collection, and highlights the breadth of the survey, including a variety of different types of voters. 3. Potential Sampling Error: The results are subject to potential sampling error, with smaller subgroups having larger potential sampling errors. The accuracy of results can differ by a set percentage nationally and per state. This aspect acknowledges the limitations of the methodology and gives a clear picture of possible inaccuracies in the data. 4. Previous Surveys: Edison Research conducted surveys in 2010.

Important Changes: The way questions were asked has changed over the years, and these differences should be factored in when making year-to-year comparisons. The interpretation of certain terms, such as 'Protestant,' has also evolved. This is a crucial piece of information, as it highlights the fact that the changes in methodology may impact the results and comparability of the poll data.

Hint: In nature, when the population size is small, there is usually plenty of food and other resources for each individual. When there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can easily reproduce, so the birth rate is high. As the population increases, the food supply, or the supply of another necessary resource, may decrease. When necessary resources, such as food, decrease, some individuals will die. Overall, the population cannot reproduce at the same rate, so the birth rates drop. This will cause the population growth rate to decrease. Answer:","output":"Italy had a lower mortality.

Their best-known recording is their 1967 hit single \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\", which is considered a classic of popular music and is one of the few singles to have sold over 10 million copies. Although noted for its baroque and classical influence, Procol Harum's music also embraces the blues, R&B, and soul. - A power trio is a rock and roll band format having a lineup of guitar, bass and drums, leaving out the second guitar or keyboard that are used in other rock music quartets and quintets to fill out the sound with chords. While one or more band members typically sing, power trios emphasize instrumental performance and overall impact over vocals and lyrics. History. The rise of the power trio in the 1960s was made possible in part by developments in amplifier technology that greatly enhanced the volume of the electric guitar and bass. Particularly, the popularization of the electric bass guitar defined the bottom end and filled in the gaps. Since the amplified bass could also now be louder, the rest of the band could also play at higher volumes, without fear of being unable to hear the bass. This allowed a three-person band to have the same sonic impact as a large band but left far more room for improvisation and creativity, unencumbered by the need for detailed arrangements. As with the organ trio, a 1960s-era soul jazz group centered on the amplified Hammond organ, a three-piece group could fill a large bar or club with a big sound for a much lower price than a large rock and roll band. A power trio, at least in its blues rock incarnation, is also generally held to have developed out of Chicago-style blues bands such as Muddy Waters' trio. - Robin Leonard Trower (born 9 March 1945) is an English rock guitarist and vocalist who achieved success with Procol Harum during the 1960s, and then again as the bandleader of his own power trio. - 20th Century Blues is the fifteenth studio album by Robin Trower .

The Maytals were formed in the early 1960s and were key figures in popularizing reggae music. Frontman Toots Hibbert's soulful vocal style has been compared to Otis Redding, and led him to be named one of the 100 Greatest Singers by \\"Rolling Stone\\".

Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well.

Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. - Rocksteady is a music genre that originated in Jamaica around 1966. A successor of ska and a precursor to reggae, rocksteady was performed by Jamaican vocal harmony groups such as The Gaylads, The Maytals, The Heptones and The Paragons. The term \\"rocksteady\\" comes from a dance style that was mentioned in the Alton Ellis song \\"Rock Steady\\". Dances performed to rocksteady were less energetic than the earlier ska dances. The first international rocksteady hit was \\"Hold Me Tight\\" (1968) by the American soul singer Johnny Nash; it reached number one in Canada. - Ska (Jamaican ) is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s and was the precursor to rocksteady and reggae. Ska combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues. It is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the off-beat. Ska developed in Jamaica in the 1960s when Prince Buster, Clement \\"Coxsone\\" Dodd, and Duke Reid formed sound systems to play American rhythm & blues and then began recording their own songs. Some suggest ska dates to earlier times, however. In the early 1960s, ska was the dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with British mods. Later it became popular with many skinheads. - Lovers rock is a style of reggae music noted for its romantic sound and content. While love songs had been an important part of reggae since the late 1960s, the style was given a greater focus and a name in London in the mid-1970s. Despite the name, lovers rock is not a rock subgenre or related to it. - Antoine \\"Fats\\" Domino, Jr. (born February 26, 1928) is an American pianist and singer-songwriter of French Creole descent. Five of his records released before 1955 sold over a million copies and were certified as gold records, and he had 35 records in the U.S. Top 40. His musical style is based on traditional rhythm and blues, accompanied by saxophones, bass, piano, electric guitar, and drums. - Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex. - Cuba, officially the Republic of Cuba, is a country comprising the island of Cuba as well as Isla de la Juventud and several minor archipelagos. Cuba is located in the northern Caribbean where the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic Ocean meet. It is south of both the U.S. state of Florida and the Bahamas, west of Haiti, and north of Jamaica. Havana is the largest city and capital; other major cities include Santiago de Cuba and Camagüey. Cuba is the largest island in the Caribbean, with an area of , and the second-most populous after Hispaniola, with over 11 million inhabitants. - \\"Do the Reggay\\" is a reggae song by The Maytals. Written by Toots Hibbert, produced by Leslie Kong and released on Beverly's Records in Jamaica and Pyramid Records in the UK in 1968. \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae\\" and defined the developing genre by giving it its name. At that time, \\"reggay\\" had been the name of a passing dance fashion in Jamaica, but the song's connection of the word with the music itself led to its use for the style of music that developed from it.

While both sentences discuss a reduction in the number of closings and advisories for beach areas, they are referring to different locations and provide different numbers regarding the reduction. The first sentence is specifically discussing Ventura County, and it mentions a 73 percent decrease in closings and advisories from 1,540 in 2001 to 416 last year. This information reveals a significant reduction in beach advisories in Ventura County over time. On the other hand, the second sentence focuses on Texas beaches and states that the number of advisory days dropped from 317 in 2001 to 182 last year. While it also describes a decrease in beach advisories, the context is different because it pertains to Texas beaches rather than Ventura County. The numbers provided are also distinct. In summary, while both sentences share the theme of a reduction in the number of beach advisories, the differences in location (Ventura County versus Texas beaches) and the specific details provided prevent them from being considered paraphrases of each other.

The focus of this situation is on the dogs' combative behavior and the specific item they are fighting over, which is a plastic bag. 2. \\"The dogs are relaxing next to a paper bag.\\" This statement presents a completely different scenario. It describes a situation where the dogs are in a state of relaxation, without any apparent conflict between them. Additionally, the item mentioned in this situation is different, as it is a paper bag instead of a plastic bag. To determine whether one statement logically follows from the other, we must examine their causality or linear relationship; meaning that if one event occurs, the other event must occur as a direct consequence or result. However, the relationship between the two statements is nonexistent, as one scenario includes the dogs fighting while the other mentions the dogs relaxing. These contrasting actions do not align, nor do they imply a causal relationship. Additionally, the change from a plastic bag to a paper bag further illustrates the disconnect between the two statements. If the situations were directly related, we would expect consistency in the objects or items involved. In conclusion, \\"The dogs are relaxing next to a paper bag\\" does not logically follow from \\"Two dogs are fighting over a plastic bag.\\" These two statements describe distinct and separate situations, with different actions and objects involved. There is no causal or linear relationship between them, so it is incorrect to infer one statement from the other."},{"instruction":"Generate a correctly punctuated version of the following text: Thanks to highquality workmanship the Suunto Elementum Terra sports wristwatch works from the lowest point on earth surface Dead Sea 418 m up to the highest Mt Everest 8848 m","output":"Alright, sweetie, let me fix this sentence for you.

Context: Jonathan Swift said, “Everybody wants to live forever, but nobody wants to grow old.” Wouldn’t it be nice if we could stay healthy and young and live as long as possible? Because that is a deep down desire of the majority, many people are always on a quest to slow down the aging process. So, our question for today is: What are the Anti-Aging Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet? First, we must acknowledge that no diet in the world can halt or slow the aging process. Aging is inevitable and food is not the elixir of life – although the type of food you choose can lengthen or shorten your life. What has been proven by numerous studies is that the Mediterranean diet lessens your risks of getting certain diseases. It also offers a range of health benefits that will allow you to age in a healthy way. When you whole-heartedly adopt the Mediterranean way of eating, you will reduce your risk of health problems such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, stroke, heart diseases, etc. That alone can be classified as anti-aging. Old age is often associated with health problems. If you can grow old and maintain your health, that would be a fine way to live. The Mediterranean diet can help you do that. Unfortunately, the standard diet for most Americans is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, fast foods and processed, additive-filled food, etc. – basically empty calories. Obesity is an epidemic. People eat whatever is the most convenient with little regard for their health. This is very upsetting and dangerous for the population as a whole. There is a wide assumption that healthy food is not delicious. People believe that to eat healthy they must live on a steady diet of raw carrots and steamed chicken breasts. As a result, they choose not to do so. They would much rather have a fast-food burger and cheese fries – it’s easier and tastier. Question: What will likely happen to those who continue to eat burgers and cheese fries? Options: A. not enough information B. they will have an increased risk of disease C. they will enjoy their food more D. they will be healthier than those who don't The answer is:","output":"B. they will have an increased risk of disease Step 1: Understand the context provided - The context talks about the benefits of the Mediterranean diet and how it can contribute to a healthier aging process. It also mentions that the standard American diet is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, and processed food, which can be harmful to one's health. Step 2: Review the question - The question asks what will likely happen to those who continue to eat burgers and cheese fries, which are examples of unhealthy food options. Step 3: Analyze the options - Option A, not enough information, can be eliminated because the context provides information about the consequences of unhealthy food choices. Option C, they will enjoy their food more, may be true but does not specifically address the long-term consequences of their food choices. Option D, they will be healthier than those who don't, is contradictory to the information provided in the context. Step 4: Choose the correct option - Based on the information from the context, option B, they will have an increased risk of disease, is the correct answer. This is because the context discusses how unhealthy food choices can increase the risk of health problems."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question.

Blacks were mistreated in the past for a morally irrelevant characteristic of being black so society today should compensate for the injuries. This causes reverse discrimination in the form of preferential hirings, contracts, and scholarships as a means to ameliorate past wrongs. Many opponents argue that this form of reparation is morally indefensible because if blacks were harmed for being black in the past, then preferential treatment for this same trait is illogical. In addition, arguments are made that whites today who innocently benefited from past injustices should not be punished for something they had no control over. Therefore, they are being reverse discriminated against because they are receiving the punishment that should be given to people who willingly and knowingly benefited from discriminatory practices Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): In the compensation argument, who should supposedly have to make up for past discrimination against blacks?","output":"In the compensation argument for affirmative action, the responsibility to make up for past discrimination against blacks is generally placed on various entities involved in perpetuating or benefiting from past discriminatory practices. The justification for this approach is rooted in rectifying historical injustices and promoting social equity. Here, we will examine some stakeholders that may hold this compensatory responsibility: 1. Government: Since governments either promoted or failed to prevent discriminatory practices in the past, they hold a significant responsibility to make amends. Affirmative action policies instituted by governments at various levels can help in addressing historical imbalances. Examples include the establishment of quotas in educational institutions, preferential treatment in public sector hiring, and increased spending on social programs targeting disadvantaged groups. 2. Private institutions and businesses: Many private institutions and businesses benefited, either directly or indirectly, from past discriminatory practices against blacks. As a result, they hold some responsibility in addressing this issue. Companies could implement diversity hiring policies, create targeted scholarships and training programs, and establish partnerships with minority-owned businesses. 3. Society at large: Society as a whole played a role in perpetuating racial discrimination, so it can be argued that every member of society should contribute to remedying past wrongs. Educating individuals about historical injustices, fostering racial understanding, and encouraging open conversations about race can help achieve social equity. Additionally, supporting non-profit organizations working for racial justice can be a way for members of society to contribute. 4. Educational institutions: Schools and universities have a responsibility to promote diversity and address historical inequalities. They can do this by implementing affirmative action admission policies, offering targeted scholarships for underrepresented communities, and creating inclusive curricula to understand and appreciate various cultures and their histories. With regard to the concern of reverse discrimination, affirmative action policies ideally do not seek to punish innocent individuals who have unintentionally benefitted from past discrimination. Instead, the primary goal is to level the playing field for those who have faced historical disadvantages and to ensure equal opportunities for all. However, it is essential to maintain a balance in these policies to avoid unfairly disadvantaging any particular group. This requires constant monitoring and adjustment of affirmative action policies based on their effectiveness and fairness."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information: - In musical terminology, tempo (\\"time\\" in Italian; plural: \\"tempi\\" ) is the speed or pace of a given piece or subsection thereof, how fast or slow. Tempo is related to meter and is usually measured by beats per minute, with the beats being a division of the measures, though tempo is often indicated by terms which have acquired standard ranges of beats per minute or assumed by convention without indication. Tempo may be separated from articulation, or articulation may be indicated along with tempo, and tempo contributes to the overall texture. While the ability to hold a steady tempo is a desirable skill, tempo is changeable, and often indicated by a conductor or drummer. While practicing, an electronic or mechanical device, a metronome, may indicate the tempo, as one usually works one's way up to being able to perform at the proper tempo. In other words it is the speed at which a passage of music is or should be played. - Extreme metal is a loosely defined umbrella term for a number of related heavy metal music subgenres that have developed since the early 1980s. It has been defined as a \\"cluster of metal subgenres characterized by sonic, verbal and visual transgression\\". The term usually refers to a more abrasive, harsher, underground, non-commercialized style or sound associated with the speed metal, thrash metal, death metal, black metal and doom metal genres. With the exception of doom metal, all of these genres are characterized by fast tempos, attesting to their roots in hardcore punk, which has also fused with extreme metal in the forms of crossover thrash, crust punk, grindcore, sludge metal and metalcore. Though many extreme sub-styles are not very well known to mainstream music fans, extreme metal has influenced an array of musical performers inside and outside of heavy metal. - Hellbastard are a crust punk band, formed in 1984/5 in the United Kingdom. Members \\"Scruff Lewty\\" \\"Phil Laidlaw\\" and \\"Scotty\\" formed Hellbastard, which was to be a combination of Crass-like politics and the music of Slayer. In 1990, after several EPs and full-lengths, the group appeared on the Combat-Earache compilation album, \\"Grindcrusher\\", with the song \\"Justly Executed\\", from the Earache Records \\"Natural Order\\" LP. - Dystopia is the third and final LP by sludge metal / crust punk band Dystopia . It was recorded in 2004 - 2005 and was released in early 2008 . - Southern rock is a subgenre of rock music and a genre of Americana. It developed in the Southern United States from rock and roll, country music, and blues, and is focused generally on electric guitar and vocals. Although the origin of the term Southern rock is unknown, \\"many people feel that these important contributors to the development of rock and roll have been minimized in rock's history.\\" - Doom metal is an extreme style of heavy metal music that typically uses slower tempos, low-tuned guitars and a much \\"thicker\\" or \\"heavier\\" sound than other metal genres. Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal with songs such as \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"Children of the Grave\\", \\"Electric Funeral\\" and \\"Into the Void\\". During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands from England (Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General), the United States (Pentagram, Saint Vitus, Trouble) and Sweden (Candlemass, Count Raven) defined doom metal as a distinct genre. - Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics. - Melvins are an American rock band that formed in 1983 in Montesano, Washington. They have mostly performed as a trio, as well as a quartet with two drummers in recent years. Since 1984, vocalist and guitarist Buzz Osborne and drummer Dale Crover have been constant members. The band was named after a supervisor at a Thriftway in Montesano, Washington, where Osborne also worked as a clerk. \\"Melvin\\" was despised by other employees, and the band's members felt it to be an appropriately ridiculous name. Their early work was key to the development of both grunge and sludge metal. - New Orleans (or ) is a major United States port and the largest city and metropolitan area in the state of Louisiana. The population of the city was 343,829 as of the 2010 U.S. Census. The New Orleans metropolitan area (New OrleansMetairieKenner Metropolitan Statistical Area) had a population of 1,167,764 in 2010 and was the 46th largest in the United States. The New OrleansMetairieBogalusa Combined Statistical Area, a larger trading area, had a 2010 population of 1,452,502. - Crust punk (or simply crust) is a form of music influenced by hardcore punk and extreme metal. The style, which evolved in the mid-1980s in England, often has songs with dark and pessimistic lyrics that linger on political and social ills. The term \\"crust\\" was coined by Hellbastard on their 1986 \\"Ripper Crust\\" demo. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - Sludge metal (sometimes referred to simply as \\"sludge\\") is an extreme genre of music that melds elements of doom metal and hardcore punk, and sometimes Southern rock. Sludge metal is typically harsh and abrasive, often featuring shouted or screamed vocals, heavily distorted instruments and sharply contrasting tempos. While the style was anticipated by the Melvins from Washington, many of its earliest pioneers were from the city of New Orleans.

Perhaps influenced by van Eyck's Madonna in the Church, Lochner closely detailed the fall and gradient of light. According to the art historian Brigitte Corley, the clothes of \\"protagonists change their hues in delicate reaction to the influx of light, reds being transformed through a symphony of pink tonalities to a dusty greyish white, greens to a warm pale yellow, and lemon shading through oranges to a saturated red\\". Lochner employed the notion of supernatural illumination not just from van Eyck, but also from von Soest's Crucifixion, where light emanating from Christ dissolves around John's red robe, as yellows rays eventually become white. There is a real possibility that a number of the faces of saints are modelled on historical persons, i.e. as donor portraits of the commissioners and their wives. Figures fitting this theory include St Ursula and St Gereon panels from the City Saints altarpiece.Unlike the painters in the Low Countries, Lochner was not so concerned with delineating perspective; his pictures are often set in shallow space, while his backgrounds give little indication of distance and often dissolve into solid gold. Thus, and given his harmonious colour schemes, Lochner is usually described as one of the last exponents of the International Gothic. This is not to say his paintings lack contemporary northern sophistication; his arrangements are often innovative. The worlds he paints are hushed, according to Snyder, achieved with the symmetry of subdued use of colour and the often repeated stylistic element of circles. Angels form circles around the heavenly figures; the heavenly figures' heads are highly circular and they wear round haloes. According to Snyder, the viewer is slowly \\"drawn into empathy with the revolving forms\\".Because of the paucity of surviving attributed works, it is difficult to detect any evolution in Lochner's style. Art historians are unsure if his style became progressively more or less influenced by Netherlandish art. Recent dendrochronological examination of... A:","output":"The specific name of the heavenly figures whose heads are highly circular and who wear round haloes in the given article is \\"angels.\\" These angels form circles around the heavenly figures, creating a sense of harmony and unity in the composition. The artist, Lochner, employs these stylistic elements, such as circular shapes and haloes, to enhance the visual appeal and draw the viewer into the scene, ultimately leading to a feeling of empathy with the revolving forms."},{"instruction":"Continue writing the following text. Donald ended the relationship against the wishes of Adam, because Options: 1). Donald wanted to be together.. 2). Adam wanted to be together..","output":"Donald ended the relationship against the wishes of Adam, because Donald felt that their bond was no longer sustainable or fulfilling to him. Despite the fact that Adam wanted to make things work between them, Donald was struggling with numerous complex emotions and reasons that ultimately pushed him to make this difficult decision with a heavy heart. Here are some of the reasons that might have led to the end of their partnership: 1. Incompatibility: Although Donald and Adam initially had a great connection, it could be that, over time, they discovered differences in their interests, values, or lifestyle choices. These disparities might have led to misunderstandings, disagreement, lack of enthusiasm, or conflicts that drastically impacted the happiness and satisfaction they derived from the relationship. 2. Emotional distance: Emotional distance can be a significant factor in any relationship breakdown. In the case of Donald and Adam, perhaps Donald realized that he felt emotionally disconnected from Adam and struggled to revive the same level of affection, love, and understanding they once shared. 3. Trust issues: Trust plays a crucial role in healthy and successful relationships. If something happened to break Donald's trust in Adam, it might have caused enough damage to necessitate the end of the relationship, despite Adam's desire to work things out. 4. Personal growth and development: People change over time, and it's possible that Donald found himself evolving in ways that made it difficult for him to maintain the relationship. He could have felt a need to redefine his personal priorities or wanted to explore different aspects of his life, which might have been difficult to do while in a committed partnership with Adam. 5. Independence: Sometimes, people may feel a yearning for independence and a desire to focus on self-discovery and personal growth. Donald might have concluded that he wanted to be on his own for a while so he could reconnect with his own needs and goals, realizing that the relationship with Adam was not serving this purpose anymore. 6. External influences: Friends, family members, career opportunities, or other external factors could have impacted Donald's decision to end the relationship. He might have felt pressured by others to reconsider his relationship with Adam, or perhaps he faced irresistible career prospects that demanded him to relocate or devote significant amounts of time and energy away from Adam. While Adam was hopeful and willing to fight for their relationship, Donald assessed the various aspects that were causing him to feel unhappy, unsatisfied, or hindered in the partnership. Ultimately, he made the painful decision to separate from Adam, despite knowing the pain it would cause. The reasons mentioned above are just a few possibilities and the true causes might be a combination of circumstances. The journey after breaking up can be challenging for both individuals involved, as they might need to navigate their emotions, redefine their identities, and learn how to heal from the end of an important chapter in their lives."},{"instruction":"ukrainian president leonid kuchma on thursday greeted his country 's women on the eve of international women 's day , calling for their more active participation in state organs .

Though these effects are typically minute in the human experience, the effect becomes much more pronounced for objects moving at speeds approaching the speed of light. Subatomic particles exist for a well known average fraction of a second in a lab relatively at rest, but when travelling close to the speed of light they are measured to travel farther and exist for much longer than when at rest. According to the special theory of relativity, in the high-speed particle's frame of reference, it exists, on the average, for a standard amount of time known as its mean lifetime, and the distance it travels in that time is zero, because its velocity is zero. Relative to a frame of reference at rest, time seems to \\"slow down\\" for the particle. Relative to the high-speed particle, distances seem to shorten. Einstein showed how both temporal and spatial dimensions can be altered (or \\"warped\\") by high-speed motion. I am facing a new situation today: David wanted to test the theory of Einstein. To that end, he measured the time perceived by an airline pilot, who naturally traveled very fast. He labeled it as case A. To compare the pilot with a slower traveler he measured the time perceived by a semi truck driver covering the same distance. He labeled it as case B.

FACE A:","output":"Title: Fate's Reflection Step 1: Introduce the Main Character The movie opens with the introduction of our protagonist, Tony, a mid-30s ex-construction worker who has fallen on hard times. Tony is a scruffy, good-hearted guy trying to find his way out of debt and turn his life around. Step 2: Present the Conflict Tony's financial situation worsens as loan sharks start sending threats. Desperate for cash, he takes up a job as a security guard at a local museum. During his first night on the job, Tony comes across an antique mirror rumored to be cursed. He dismisses the legend, not paying much attention to it, but things take a dark turn as he starts seeing strange reflections in the mirror. Step 3: Introduce the Supporting Characters As Tony's visions become more intense, he turns to his sister Maria for support. Maria is an academic focused on the paranormal, and she's obsessed with debunking curses. Together, they investigate the mirror's history and find evidence of previous owners meeting unfortunate ends. Along the way, they meet Jack, a private investigator who has a personal connection to the mirror; his grandfather owned it and died mysteriously. Step 4: Explore the Effects of the Curse One night, while on duty at the museum, Tony sees a reflection of himself in the mirror, holding a gun and pointing it at his face. The mirror image Tony pulls the trigger, leaving Tony horrified. He tries to ignore the vision, but it becomes more frequent and detailed, consuming Tony's life. He starts to distance himself from the people he loves and becomes obsessed with uncovering the secret behind the curse. Step 5: Confronting the Past As Maria and Jack continue their search for answers, they discover that the mirror's original owner was a ruthless mob boss who killed himself in front of the mirror. The boss's spirit is trapped inside the mirror, and now the curse forces those who possess the mirror to repeat his tragic fate. Step 6: Breaking the Curse Determined to break the curse and save her brother, Maria, with Jack's help, devises an exorcism ritual to free the mob boss's spirit. Tony, tormented by the visions, reluctantly agrees to participate in the ritual. During the process, Tony comes face-to-face with the spirit, who tempts him with promises of wealth and power. Tony resists and finds the strength to reject these temptations after realizing that the connections with his sister, friends, and community matter more to him. Step 7: Resolution Upon successfully completing the ritual, the mob boss's spirit is finally laid to rest, and the curse is broken. In the aftermath, Tony is relieved to find that the visions are gone, and his life starts to improve. He reconciles with his sister and strengthens their bond, and starts a budding romance with Jack. The mirror is permanently sealed and placed in a secure vault to be studied by paranormal researchers. The movie ends with Tony reflecting on his journey, grateful for the bonds he's forged, and the lessons he's learned through his harrowing experience with the cursed mirror."},{"instruction":"I have 2 friends from college who completely did a 180 after they got married.

A dilemma for a children's party, perhaps. But also a question for economists, argued Kenneth Boulding, a British economist, in an essay published in 1966. We have run our economies, he warned, like cowboys on the open grassland: taking and using the world's resources, confident that more lies over the horizon. But the Earth is less a grassland than a spaceship--a closed system, alone in space, carrying limited supplies. We need, said Boulding, an economics that takes seriously the idea of environmental limits. In the half century since his essay, a new movement has responded to his challenge. \\"Ecological economists\\", as they call themselves, want to revolutionise its aims and assumptions. What do they say--and will their ideas achieve lift-off? To its advocators, ecological economics is neither ecology nor economics, but a mix of both. Their starting point is to recognise that the human economy is part of the natural world. Our environment, they note, is both a source of resources and a sink for wastes. But it is ignored in conventional textbooks, where neat diagrams trace the flows between firms, households and the government as though nature did not exist. That is a mistake, say ecological economists. There are two ways our economies can grow, ecological economists point out: through technological change, or through more intensive use of resources. Only the former, they say, is worth having. They are suspicious of GDP, a crude measure which does not take account of resource exhaustion, unpaid work, and countless other factors. In its place they advocate moreholistic approaches, such as the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), a composite index that includes things like the cost of pollution, deforestation and car accidents. While GDP has kept growing, global GPI per person peaked in 1978: by destroying our environment we are making ourselves poorer, not richer. The solution, says Herman Daly, a former World Bank economist and eco-guru, is a \\"steady-state\\" economy, where the use of...

He was the chairman and chief executive officer of Dunkin' Brands. Luther is the Chairman of the Board of the Culinary Institute of America and Arby's Restaurant Group, and a director at Six Flags Entertainment Corporation, Wingstop Restaurants, and Tempur Sealy International. Hypothesis: Jon Luther is the Chairman of the Board of many companies, he may be a shareholder in others as well","output":"Upon analyzing the given paragraph, the hypothesis can be considered as partially true with a possibility of being entirely true. The paragraph explicitly states that Jon L. Luther, an American foodservice industry executive, has held and continues to hold significant positions in various companies associated with the food service and hospitality sector. The information highlights that he has served as the chairman and chief executive officer of Dunkin' Brands, and currently holds the position of Chairman of the Board at the Culinary Institute of America, and Arby's Restaurant Group. In addition, he is also a director at Six Flags Entertainment Corporation, Wingstop Restaurants, and Tempur Sealy International. Due to his numerous roles with different companies, it is convincing to conclude that Jon Luther is indeed the Chairman of the Board for many companies predominately related to foodservice and hospitality, and being at the director level in other industries. However, the paragraph does not provide sufficient details regarding Luther's shareholding status in these companies. As someone with a high level of influence and participation in the businesses, it seems plausible that Jon Luther may have a financial investment in the form of shares in some of the companies mentioned, or even in others not listed. It is a common practice for executives and board members to hold stocks in their respective companies considering their vested interest in the company's success. To confirm the entirety of the hypothesis - that Jon Luther may be a shareholder in other companies as well - additional information would be needed. This would involve researching records on company stocks, financial filings, and other reliable sources that would corroborate the shareholding status of Jon Luther in the mentioned companies or any additional ones. Until then, the hypothesis relies on a reasonable assumption emanating from his extensive involvement within the industry. In summary, the hypothesis is partially true as Jon Luther indeed takes up the role of Chairman of the Board for many companies. The complete validity of the hypothesis regarding his shareholding status in other companies can be determined only with more concrete information and access to relevant financial records."},{"instruction":"Note the options at the end.

As princeps (first citizen) he must respect traditional Republican mores; given virtually monarchic powers, he must restrain them. He was not a living divus but father of his country (pater patriae), its pontifex maximus (greatest priest) and at least notionally, its leading Republican. When he died, his ascent to heaven, or his descent to join the dii manes was decided by a vote in the Senate. As a divus, he could receive much the same honours as any other state deity – libations of wine, garlands, incense, hymns and sacrificial oxen at games and festivals. What he did in return for these favours is unknown, but literary hints and the later adoption of divus as a title for Christian Saints suggest him as a heavenly intercessor. In Rome, official cult to a living emperor was directed to his genius; a small number refused this honour and there is no evidence of any emperor receiving more than that. In the crises leading up to the Dominate, Imperial titles and honours multiplied, reaching a peak under Diocletian. Emperors before him had attempted to guarantee traditional cults as the core of Roman identity and well-being; refusal of cult undermined the state and was treasonous. What was the emperor's rule in Rome?","output":"In ancient Rome, the emperor's rule was one of a complex nature, balancing both traditional Republican mores and virtually monarchic powers. As the princeps (first citizen), the emperor was expected to respect traditional values while wielding significant authority. The emperor was not considered a living divus (god), but rather the father of his country (pater patriae), its pontifex maximus (greatest priest), and, at least notionally, its leading Republican figure. The state cult to a living emperor acknowledged his rule as divinely approved and constitutional, which reinforced his position and authority in Roman society. Upon an emperor's death, his ascent to heaven or descent to join the dii manes (deified spirits) would be decided by a vote in the Senate, and if deified as a divus, he could receive honours similar to other state deities. The emperor also played a role in upholding traditional cults to ensure Roman identity and well-being, as refusal of cult was considered treasonous and detrimental to the state."},{"instruction":"Read this article and answer this question Coming off their Thanksgiving home win over the Jets, the Cowboys stayed at home, donned their throwbacks, and played a Week 13 Thursday night intraconference duel with the Green Bay Packers This match-up would be the first time since 1990 (Giants & 49ers) that two 10-1 teams would meet each other.

The debate on Twitter and other websites eventually catches the attention of major news outlets and tech blogs who begin covering the story. Meanwhile, Victoria Woollaston picks up on the response and curates an article about the ongoing debate. Her piece highlights various tweets and posts from both sides of the argument, showing the depth of the controversy. The article generates more buzz, leading people to express opinions on what separates Twitter from Facebook and how the platform should evolve. The resulting immense pressure on Twitter eventually forces the company to listen to its users' concerns. Twitter decides to conduct a poll to seek user input on whether to revert to the classic 'Retweet' button or stick with the new 'Share with followers' option. Users express a strong preference for the traditional 'Retweet,' leading Twitter to announce that they will be bringing back the beloved icon. After a few weeks, Twitter rolls back the update and reinstates the 'Retweet' button. The move is praised by the majority of users who value the platform's unique identity. However, a small group of innovators is unhappy with the decision and forms a Twitter-based community to brainstorm and discuss ideas about possible future changes to the platform. Ultimately, Twitter learns a valuable lesson about preserving its identity and balancing it with user feedback when implementing new features. The traditionalists celebrate the decision, while the innovators continue to work on ways to enhance the user experience on the platform. The story becomes an example of how social media platforms should consider a balance between innovation and maintaining their unique identities in the face of ongoing competition."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Pick one category for the following text.

The incident prompts Larry to realize the fact that death can come for him at any moment, but he has difficulties naming his children as primary beneficiaries in his life insurance policy. Larry was given at least a year to change his beneficiaries but he was profusely mourning his wife, and left it too late. However, One of the ways suggested for him to do so is to get married. Inspired by a newspaper article about domestic partnerships, Larry asks Chuck to enter a civil union with him. Although at first Chuck declines, he is reminded of his debt to Larry and finally agrees.Chuck and Larry become domestic partners and Chuck becomes Larry's primary beneficiary in the event of his death. Soon, New York City investigators arrive to inquire about their partnership.

Your task is to generate answer for given question based on set of context paragraphs and supporting facts. Input: Context_1 : Hesse ( or ) or Hessia (German: \\"Hessen\\" ] , Hessian dialect: \\"Hesse\\" ] ) is a federal state (\\"Land\\") of the Federal Republic of Germany, with just over six million inhabitants. The state capital is Wiesbaden; the largest city is Frankfurt am Main. Until the unification of Germany, the territory of Hesse was occupied by the Grand Duchy of Hesse, the Duchy of Nassau, the free city of Frankfurt and the Electorate of Hesse, known also as Hesse-Cassel. Due to divisions after World War II, the modern federal state does not cover the entire cultural region of Hesse, which includes both the State of Hesse and the area known as Rhenish Hesse (Rheinhessen) in the neighbouring state of Rhineland-Palatinate. Context_2 : The Gutsbezirk Reinhardswald is an unincorporated area in the Kassel district in the state of Hesse in Germany. It encompasses an area of 184.16 km2 and is thus the second largest village in Hesse by area after the city of Frankfurt. The Gutsbezirk Reinhardswald consists of nearly the whole area of the Reinhardswald. It is administered by the leader of the local forest authority, seated in nearby Reinhardshagen, who is instated by the district and whose duties include taking in taxes, garbage disposal and maintaining the civil registry. Context_3 : Carmen Everts (born 12 April 1968 in Wilhelmshaven) is a German politician, political scientist and civil servant, a former member of the Parliament of Hesse for the Social Democratic Party of Germany, and an expert on political extremism.

Context_4 : The Staatstheater Darmstadt (Darmstadt State Theatre) is a theatre company and building in Darmstadt, Hesse, Germany, presenting opera, ballet, plays and concerts. It is funded by the state of Hesse and the city of Darmstadt. Its history began in 1711 with a court theatre building. From 1919 it was run as Landestheater Darmstadt. The present theatre was opened in 1972 when the company was named Staatstheater. Context_5 : Darmstadt (] ) is a city in the state of Hesse in Germany, located in the southern part of the Rhine-Main-Area (Frankfurt Metropolitan Region). Darmstadt has a population around 150,000 (2013). The Darmstadt Larger Urban Zone has 430,993 inhabitants. Context_6 : Thomas Lutz ( 1957 in Darmstadt) is the head of the Memorial Museums Department of the Topography of Terror Foundation in Berlin, and active in Holocaust education and research at the national (German) and international level. Context_7 : The Elector of Mainz was one of the seven Prince-electors of the Holy Roman Empire. Both a ruling prince and an archbishop, the Elector of Mainz held a powerful position during the Middle Ages and retained some importance until the dissolution of the empire in 1806. The Elector of Mainz was president of the electoral college, arch-chancellor of the empire and primate of Germany. The origin of the title dates back to 747, when the city of Mainz was made the seat of an archbishop, and a succession of able and ambitious prelates, obtaining lands and privileges from emperors and others, made the district under their rule a strong and vigorous state. Among these men were important figures in the history of Germany such as Hatto I, Siegfried III, Peter of Aspelt, and Albert of Mainz There were several violent contests between rivals anxious to secure so splendid a position as the elector, and the power struggles of the archbishops occasionally moved the citizens of Mainz to revolt. The lands of the elector lay around Mainz, and were on both banks of the Rhine; their area at the time of the French Revolution was about 3200 sq. m. The last elector was Karl Theodor von Dalberg. The archbishopric was secularized in 1803, two years after the lands on the left bank of the Rhine had been seized by France. Some of those on the right bank of the river were given to Kingdom of Prussia and to the Grand Duchy of Hesse; others were formed into a grand duchy for the then Archbishop-Elector Dalberg. The archbishopric itself was transferred to the Principality of Regensburg. Context_8 : Bobby Lutz (born April 4, 1958) is an American basketball coach.

Notably, the Prairie provinces or simply the Prairies comprise the provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, as they are partially covered by prairie (grasslands). In a more restricted sense, the term may also refer only to the areas of those provinces covered by prairie; their portions of the physiographic region known as the Interior Plains. Prairie also covers portions of northeastern British Columbia, though that province is typically not included in the region in a political sense. - Amegilla is a large genus of bees in the tribe Anthophorini. Several species have blue metallic bands on the abdomen, and are referred to as \\"blue-banded bees\\". - The Centridini are a tribe of large apid bees, many of which possess adaptations for carrying floral oils rather than (or in addition to) pollen or nectar. The floral oils are often gathered from plants of the family Malpighiaceae, though other plants may be visited. The oil-collecting species typically have \\"combs\\" composed of closely spaced, flattened, blunt bristles on the margins of the first tarsal segments of the front and middle legs; others may have velvety \\"pads\\" to absorb the oils. They also commonly gather plant resins for use in nest cell construction. They have a tiny pterostigma in the forewing, the female scopa is very bushy, and the first flagellomere of the antenna is often longer than the scape. - Ohio is an Eastern state in the Great Lakes region of the United States. Ohio is the 34th largest by area, the 7th most populous, and the 10th most densely populated of the 50 United States. The state's capital and largest city is Columbus. - Illinois is a state in the midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1818. It is the 5th most populous state and 25th largest state in terms of land area, and is often noted as a microcosm of the entire country. The word \\"Illinois\\" comes from the Algonquin word for \\"tribe of superior men\\". With Chicago in the northeast, small industrial cities and great agricultural productivity in central and northern Illinois, and natural resources like coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a diverse economic base and is a major transportation hub. The Port of Chicago connects the state to other global ports from the Great Lakes, via the Saint Lawrence Seaway, to the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, via the Illinois River. For decades, O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms and politics. - In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. In looser senses, the taller palms, the tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. The tallest known tree, a coast redwood named Hyperion, stands high. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world. - The bee genus Anthophora is one of the largest in the family Apidae, with over 450 species worldwide in 14 different subgenera. They are most abundant and diverse in the Holarctic and African biogeographic regions. All species are solitary, though many nest in large aggregations. Nearly all species make nests in the soil, either in banks or in flat ground; the larvae develop in cells with waterproof linings and do not spin cocoons. Males commonly have pale white or yellow facial markings, and/or peculiarly modified leg armature and hairs. \\"Anthophora\\" individuals can be distinguished from the very similar genus \\"Amegilla\\" by the possession of an arolium between the tarsal claws. - The Great Plains is the broad expanse of flat land (a plain), much of it covered in prairie, steppe and grassland, that lies west of the Mississippi River tallgrass prairie states and east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States and Canada. This area covers parts, but not all, of the states of Colorado, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming, Minnesota, Iowa and the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. The region is known for supporting extensive cattle ranching and dry farming. - Texas is the second largest state in the United States by both area and population. Geographically located in the south central part of the country, Texas shares borders with the U.S. states of Louisiana to the east, Arkansas to the northeast, Oklahoma to the north, New Mexico to the west, and the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas to the southwest, while the Gulf of Mexico is to the southeast. - Missouri (see pronunciations) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1821. With over six million residents, it is the eighteenth most populous state and host to the mean center of United States population. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia. The capitol is in Jefferson City on the Missouri River. The state is the twenty-first most extensive by area and is geographically diverse. The Northern Plains were once covered by glaciers, then tallgrass prairie, and now the deep soils yield great agricultural productivity. In the South are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of the state, eventually flowing into the swampy Missouri Bootheel. - New Mexico is a state located in the southwestern region of the United States of America. It was admitted to the union as the 47th state on January 6, 1912. It is usually considered one of the Mountain States. New Mexico is fifth by area, the 36th-most populous, and the sixth-least densely populated of the 50 United States. - The Melectini are a tribe of medium - to large - sized apid bees found essentially worldwide . They are brood parasites of the related typical digger bees ( Anthophorini ) and occasionally visit flowers e.g. in prairie landscapes of the United States . As in other cuckoo bees , females can be easily distinguished from those of their hosts by the lack of scopae and other pollen - collecting adaptations , as well as lacking prepygidial fimbria and basitibial plates . Their body hair is rather short and on the abdomen lies flat against the exoskeleton . They may , therefore , be difficult at first glance to distinguish from the Nomadinae , but the details of their wing venation are characteristic : the marginal cell is shorter than the first two submarginal cells , and the second abscissa of vein M + Cu is extremely short , with the cells it connects being almost adjacent to each other . The jugal lobes are very small , less than half as long as the vannal lobes . - Saskatchewan (or ) is a prairie and boreal province in west-central Canada, the only province without natural borders. It has an area of , nearly 10 percent of which is fresh water, composed mostly of rivers, reservoirs, and the province's 100,000 lakes. - Wyoming is a state in the mountain region of the western United States. The state is the tenth largest by area, the least populous and the second least densely populated state in the country. Wyoming is bordered on the north by Montana, on the east by South Dakota and Nebraska, on the south by Colorado, on the southwest by Utah, and on the west by Idaho. Cheyenne is the capital and the most populous city in Wyoming, with a population estimate of 63,335 in 2015. The state population was estimated at 586,107 in 2015, which is less than the population of 31 of the largest U.S. cities. - Apidae is the largest family within the superfamily Apoidea, containing at least 5700 species of bees. The family includes some of the most commonly seen bees, including bumblebees and honey bees, but also includes stingless bees (also used for honey production), carpenter bees, orchid bees, cuckoo bees, and a number of other less widely known groups. Many are valuable pollinators in natural habitats and for agricultural crops. - Kansas is a U.S. state located in the Midwestern United States. Its capital is Topeka and its largest city is Wichita. Kansas is named after the Kansa Native American tribe, which inhabited the area. The tribe's name (natively \\"\\") is often said to mean \\"people of the wind\\" or \\"people of the south wind\\", although this was probably not the term's original meaning. For thousands of years, what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes. Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys. Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison. - The Anthophorini are a large tribe in the subfamily Apinae of the family Apidae. Species in this tribe are often referred to as digger bees, although this common name is sometimes also applied to members of the tribe Centridini. It has over 750 species worldwide that were previously classified in the family Anthophoridae; the vast majority of species are in the genera \\"Amegilla\\" and \\"Anthophora\\". - Mexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico.

The questions are concerned about the voting behavior of Bernie Sanders supporters if Clinton secures the Democratic nomination. Step 2: Analyze the first question \\"Will Bernie supporters withhold their vote for Clinton even though that helps Trump?\\" This question asks whether Bernie Sanders supporters would not vote for Clinton in the general election, even if it might increase Trump's chances of winning. Step 3: Analyze the second question \\"Will Bernie Sanders supporters support Clinton or withhold their vote?

What was the highest rank Charles Lindbergh attained?","output":"Charles Lindbergh, an American aviator, adventurer, author, and military officer, is best known for completing the first solo nonstop transatlantic flight in May 1927 aboard the Spirit of St. Louis. Despite his immense fame and significant contributions to aviation, Lindbergh's highest military rank was that of Brigadier General. Lindbergh's journey with the military began as a civilian in 1924 when he enrolled in the United States Army Air Service's aviation cadet program. Two years later, he became a Second Lieutenant on the Army Air Corps Reserve's inactive status list because active duty positions were limited at the time. His association with the military was further cemented by his feat of flying solo across the Atlantic, which earned him the Distinguished Flying Cross from President Calvin Coolidge. During the early 1930s, Lindbergh's celebrity status would inadvertently distance him from the military. His critical views about American involvement in World War II and his affinity towards Charles Augustus Lindbergh Jr., his abducted 20-month-old son, would lead to a negative perception of the aviator as a potential isolationist. This assumption was further fueled by Lindbergh's controversial 1936 acceptance of the German Service Cross of the Order of the German Eagle, which was awarded to him by Hermann Göring, a senior Nazi leader. Later, with the outbreak of World War II, the US military acknowledged Lindbergh's exceptional aeronautical expertise. Although he could not serve as a commissioned officer due to his reserve lieutenant colonel status, he was still hired as a civilian consultant. During this period, the famed aviator lent his expertise to various military developments, including the P-38 Lightning and F4U Corsair programs. In 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Charles Lindbergh as a Brigadier General in the Air Force Reserve, recognizing his commitment and service to the United States. This promotion would serve as the highest rank Lindbergh attained during his military career. In summary, Charles Lindbergh's highest military rank was Brigadier General, which he attained in 1954 when President Eisenhower recognized his steadfast service to the nation. Although he was not a career military officer, Lindbergh's accomplishments in aviation, his technical consulting work during World War II, and his committed service to the Air Force Reserve are testimonies to his passion and contributions to the field."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: What does Houghton send? an American submarine Answer:","output":"Title: \\"The Houghton Assignment\\" Genre: Action-Thriller Plot: In the near future, tensions between the United States and an extremist separatist group escalate to an all-time high. The group, known as 'The Global Emancipators,' conspires to create a hidden underwater cache of nuclear warheads, intending to use them to threaten the world's governments into submission. CIA intelligence reports reveal a top-secret message sent by a rogue US government operative named Houghton. The message indicates that Houghton has sent an American submarine named 'USS Poseidon' to deliver the last piece of the puzzle to The Global Emancipators - a state-of-the-art control chip that would enable the separatists to launch the nuclear warheads remotely. The US government assembles a highly skilled and diverse team of Navy SEALs and intelligence operatives to foil this plot. The mission, known as 'Operation Crimson Tide,' involves an underwater infiltration and the recovery of the submarine and its potentially devastating cargo. The team is tasked with boarding the USS Poseidon and retrieving the control chip while, at the same time, neutralizing the onboard threat - including the notorious operative Houghton. The team, led by Commander James Carter, embarks on the treacherous mission. As they near the submarine, they discover that the situation is more complex than initially anticipated. In addition to The Global Emancipators, there is also a rogue Russian faction called the Red Wolves involved - aiming to hijack the submarine for their endgame. While the team successfully infiltrates the submarine, they find themselves in a deadly game of cat and mouse with Houghton, The Global Emancipators, and the Red Wolves. Trust is tested in a series of intense battles and psychological warfare, as the mission's stakes grow ever higher.

A:","output":"The review provided can be categorized as negative based on the language used and the overall tone and expressed experience of the user. Below, we analyze the various aspects and reasons that contribute to this interpretation. 1. Use of negative adjectives: The reviewer describes the latches as \\"flimsy\\" and \\"temperamental,\\" which are both inherently negative words. \\"Flimsy\\" indicates a lack of sturdiness and reliability, while \\"temperamental\\" suggests inconsistency in performance. The use of these negative terms characterizes a poor experience with the product. 2. Difficulty in usage: The reviewer shares their experience of having trouble opening the case, which indicates that the product did not meet their expectations or perform its primary function smoothly. This further emphasizes the unfavorable viewpoint of the user regarding the case's quality and functionality. 3. Final action: As a result of the difficulties and poor experience, the reviewer mentions that they returned the case. This action strongly suggests dissatisfaction with the product, as the user felt it necessary to go through the return process rather than to keep and use it. Returning a product is often a clear signal of an unsatisfactory experience, reinforcing the negative character of the review.

He was an important person who helped take care of a big group of people called the members of the Majlis. The Majlis was like a big team of people who made decisions for the country. One day, Zia'eddin changed his job and started helping people in a new way. We call becoming this kind of helper a \\"servant\\". So when did Zia'eddin Tabatabaee become a servant? To answer this question, let's look back in time to when Zia'eddin was born. He came into this big world on February 3, 1889. He was a very smart kid, and he grew up learning a lot in school. Eventually, he became a wise and important grown-up who helped make big decisions for Iran. Zia'eddin Tabatabaee had many different jobs in his life. For example, he was a journalist, which means he wrote articles, just like this one! He also taught others important knowledge that he learned. But when did Zia'eddin become a servant to help people? It was around 1910 when Zia'eddin started a newspaper called Nowbahar. This is when many people say he changed into a servant, because he started using his new job and his writing skills to help the people of Iran. He wrote about the things that mattered to the people so they could understand what was going on in their country. Let's fast forward to 1925. This was another important time in Zia'eddin Tabatabaee's life. He was chosen to be someone very important, called the Prime Minister of Iran. This meant that he was in charge of helping the people and making decisions for the whole country. Some people say Zia'eddin Tabatabaee really became a servant when he stepped up as Prime Minister because he took on a bigger responsibility to serve and protect his people. But it was when he was a journalist that he first started to help people by writing about important things and sharing important information. So, we could say that Zia'eddin Tabatabaee became a servant around 1910 when he started his newspaper, Nowbahar. In conclusion, Zia'eddin Tabatabaee was a very important man who helped his country in different ways. Though we might not know for sure the exact moment when he became a servant, we do know that he started helping others from early on in life. And as he grew up and took on bigger and bigger jobs, he continued to be a helper and a servant to the people of Iran."},{"instruction":"Q: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: I've first see this book in my friend's home.

Boult was born in Chester, Cheshire, in North West England, the second child and only son of Cedric Randal Boult (1853–1950), and his wife Katharine Florence née Barman (d. 1927). Cedric Boult was a Justice of the Peace and a successful businessman connected with Liverpool shipping and the oil trade; Cedric and his family had \\"a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs\\" with a history of philanthropy. When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by Hans Richter. He was educated at Westminster School in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, Sir Henry Wood, Claude Debussy, Arthur Nikisch, Fritz Steinbach, and Richard Strauss. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes, \\"Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford.\\" While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster, a family friend.At Christ Church college at Oxford, where he was an undergraduate from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909 Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled Some Notes on Performance, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer's wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, and the effect of music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career. He was president of the University Musical Club for the year 1910, but his interests were not wholly confined to music: he was a keen rower, stroking his college boat at Henley, and all his life he remained a member of the Leander Club.

The article discusses Adrian Boult, a renowned British conductor, and his life and career."},{"instruction":"Summarize the following movie reviews: 1. As rubbish Nic Cage movies go, Bangkok Dangerous is just about watchable, but as far as pointless remakes are concerned, you're much better off renting the original instead. 2. What Cage -- such a fine actor when the mood's upon him -- is doing wasting his time in listless junk like this is anybody's guess. 3. Certainly lives down to its title, which sounds like a caveman giving travel advice. 4. the proverbial sound and fury, filled with typical Asian action film gravitas yet signifying nothing. A whole lot of nothing. 5. Instead of killing people, Nicolas Cage's character should have been more worried about getting a haircut. 6. Couldn't the Pangs have spent some of that studio money on more lights? 7. All it proves is that on their home turf the Pangs can make an international hit-man tale every bit as trashy and dull as the ones made in Hollywood or Europe. 8. For a man obsessed with The King -- he even married his daughter -- it makes sense that Cage has finally entered the fat Elvis act III of his career. I hope we don't read about him flat-lining on the commode, face down in the \\"Ghost Rider 3\\" script. 9. Bangkok Dangerous pretends to have a lot on its mind. It moves slow as molasses and has the same general coloring. 10. [A] stylish but laborious thriller.","output":"In these ten movie reviews, \\"Bangkok Dangerous\\" starring Nicolas Cage is criticized for being a subpar and disappointing remake. The general consensus is that the film is watchable but lacks the charm and excitement of the original. Cage, who is usually a talented actor, is viewed as wasting his time in this seemingly lackluster endeavor. The film's title is mocked as uninteresting, with comparisons to cavemen giving travel advice. Additionally, the movie is said to be filled with sound and fury but ultimately signifying nothing, pointing to its disappointing and unengaging nature. Cage's character, a contract killer, is made fun of for his poor hairstyle, while the film's production is criticized for its low budget and poor lighting choices. The Pangs, the film's creators, are seen as having failed in their attempt to create a thrilling international hit-man tale, as reviewers found it to be just as trashy and dull as similar stories from Hollywood and Europe. Cage's involvement in \\"Bangkok Dangerous\\" is likened to the unfortunate downfall of Elvis Presley, foreshadowing possible grim consequences for Cage's career. In summary, \\"Bangkok Dangerous\\" is seen as a stylish yet slow and laborious thriller that lacks the excitement and engagement one would expect from such a film. Despite its visuals, the movie moves like molasses and its overall reception has been overwhelmingly negative across these ten diverse reviews."},{"instruction":"Consider the question. What happens to a body after death? Options: - rebirth - human experience - sadness - decomposition - obesity If the answer is 'decomposition'; explain the reasoning:","output":"The answer is 'decomposition.' The other options (rebirth, human experience, sadness, and obesity) do not directly explain what physically happens to a body after death. Decomposition is the process by which organic substances, including the human body, are broken down into simpler organic matter. The process occurs naturally after death and is primarily driven by the activity of various microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. Decomposition can be divided into several stages: 1. Initial decay (fresh stage): The body begins to go through autolysis, which is the breakdown of cells by their own enzymes, leading to the release of cellular content (e.g., gases, fluids) that can cause discoloration and bloating. 2. Putrefaction (bloat stage): This stage is characterized by the accumulation of gases, leading to the swelling of the body. Various bacteria within the body, notably those in the gut, begin to multiply rapidly, breaking down tissues and releasing the gases and fluids that contribute to the characteristic odor of decomposition. 3. Active decay (decay stage): As the body continues to break down, the skin, tissues, and muscles start to decompose. This stage may involve the presence of insects, specifically flies and maggots that feed on the decaying body. The consumption of tissues by these organisms accelerates the decomposition process. 4. Advanced decay (post-decay stage): Most of the body's soft tissues have broken down, and the fluids and gases have largely dissipated. The remaining materials primarily include bones, cartilage, and small amounts of skin and other tissues. In this stage, the rate of decomposition slows down. 5. Dry/remains (skeletal stage): In the final stage, only the skeleton, hair, and other hard tissues remain. Over time, these materials will also eventually decompose, returning all organic and inorganic components of the body to the environment. In summary, decomposition is the process by which a dead body is naturally broken down into simpler organic and inorganic materials. This process involves several stages and is primarily driven by the activity of bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and other organisms that act on the body after death."},{"instruction":"The series starts in Baghdad at an undetermined time .

Options: - dimly lit room - kitchen - wall - table - birthday cake Let's give stream of consciousness first:","output":"A restaurant would most likely put a candle on a table or a birthday cake. Here's the step-by-step justification for this answer: 1. Dimly lit room: While a candle can be used in a dimly lit room to provide a cozy atmosphere, it is not the primary location for placement in a restaurant setting. A restaurant would likely use ambient lighting to create a dimly lit atmosphere rather than relying on multiple individual candles. 2. Kitchen: It is unlikely that a restaurant would put a candle in a kitchen because this area usually has sufficient lighting to ensure safety and efficient food preparation. Additionally, an open flame in a kitchen could pose a safety hazard. 3. Wall: Although some restaurants may have decorative candle holders on walls, contemporary restaurants typically use electric or battery-powered candles in these areas for safety and ease of use. That being said, wall is not the most common location for a candle in a restaurant. 4. Table: Placing a candle on a table is a common practice in restaurants to create an intimate ambiance for diners. A lit candle on a table can provide soft, warm lighting and contribute to a pleasant dining experience for the guests. 5. Birthday cake: If a restaurant is celebrating a customer's birthday, they may place a candle on the birthday cake as a fun and festive way to mark the occasion. This is another common use of candles in a restaurant setting. Considering these justifications, a table and a birthday cake are the most suitable options for placing a candle in a restaurant."},{"instruction":"Why did both Japan and Italy joined the Allies during WWI but later turned to Axis in WWII?

This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels.

Jawaharlal Nehru, also known as Pandit Nehru, was a prominent leader of the Indian National Congress (INC) and was one of the foremost political figures fighting for India's independence from British colonial rule. He played a crucial role during the freedom struggle and worked closely with Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation. Nehru was born on November 14, 1889, in Allahabad, India. He was educated in India and England, obtaining degrees from Trinity College, Cambridge and studying law in London. He returned to India in 1912 and started working as a lawyer. However, his interest in politics began during the Non-Cooperation Movement in 1920. After Mahatma Gandhi's call for non-violent civil disobedience against the British, Nehru played a significant role in various national campaigns and protests. His work during this period earned him recognition as one of the leading figures in the Indian struggle for self-rule. In 1929, Nehru became the president of the Indian National Congress, serving several terms. It was during his tenure as Congress president that he introduced the Purna Swaraj declaration, which demanded complete independence from British rule. With the commencement of the Quit India Movement in 1942, Nehru's role as a political leader became even more crucial. When India finally gained its independence on August 15, 1947, Jawaharlal Nehru became the country's first Prime Minister. As the Prime Minister, Nehru played an integral role in shaping the newly independent nation. He focused on building a parliamentary democracy, implementing socialist policies, and strengthening India's strategic position in the international arena. Throughout his tenure, Nehru worked on numerous nation-building initiatives, including the implementation of the Five-Year Plans to promote economic growth, industrialization, and agricultural development. He also took on the challenge of integrating the numerous princely states in India into a united and federal structure. In foreign policy, he was known for his policy of non-alignment, which became a guiding principle for India's approach to international politics. He maintained friendly relations with several countries and worked extensively towards fostering global peace. Jawaharlal Nehru passed away on May 27, 1964, after serving India as the Prime Minister for over 16 years, remaining the longest-serving Prime Minister in India's history. His legacy continues to be influential, and his contributions to the nation are remembered every year on his birth anniversary, which is celebrated as Children's Day in India, since he was extremely fond of children and believed in the importance of nurturing the future generations."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up. During recovery from an attack, it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils. Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air. Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may have marked and persistent symptoms. Answer:","output":"Some attacks of asthma are preceded by factors such as symptoms being worse at night and in the early morning, in response to exercise or cold air, and exposure to triggers.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Baran Context: It is winter in Teheran. Lateef is 17. He works at a building construction site managed by MEMAR, the site foreman. Lateef's job is to serve tea and prepare food for the workers with whom he is always quarrelling. The workers come from all parts of Iran, particularly from Iranian Azerbaijan (Azeris are referred as \\"Turks\\" in the film). Some workers are Afghan refugees from war-torn Afghanistan. They have no identity cards and are employed illegally as cheap labour. When the labour inspectors show up, the Afghan workers must hide. As the story starts, an Afghan worker, NAJAF, falls from the building and breaks his leg. He is taken to the hospital. The next day, SOLTAN, another Afghan worker, brings in RAHMAT, Najaf's son, who is around 14 years old, to replace his father. Memar soon realizes that Rahmat is not fit for such hard work, and decides to switch the jobs between Rahmat and Lateef. Lateef is furious, threatens Rahmat, tries to sabotage his work and spies on him. One day, by looking through the door where Rahmat works, he is totally shocked to discover that Rahmat is a girl. As he watches her comb her hair, he finds himself in a strange state, surrounded by unusual sounds. From then on his attitude changes completely; he becomes protective, helpful and gradually desperately in love with Rahmat. While Rahmat does not express herself verbally at all, over time she seems to respond to this love. During a surprise visit of the labour inspectors, they find themselves face to face with Rahmat. She panics and runs away, as they chase her through the city streets. Lateef runs after them, struggling with the inspectors while Rahmat flees. Lateef is beaten and taken to the police station. Now Memar must pay a fine, comply with the law, and lay off all illegal Afghan workers. Lateef can't bear Rahmat's absence, and decides to locate Soltan to get some news of her. He goes to the village where the Afghans live, walks around, meets an enigmatic cobbler, and ends up in the courtyard of a shrine near a graveyard... Answer:","output":"In the context of the movie \\"Baran,\\" the individuals who perform a surprise inspection are the labour inspectors. These inspectors are responsible for ensuring that workplaces comply with labor laws and regulations. In the film, they specifically target illegal Afghan workers who lack identity cards and are employed as cheap labor.

My attraction to him was n't really that bad . I just felt like I was watching a god or something . But when I looked up at the big screen on the side ... then I was like OMG HE 'S SO HOT . Question: What may be the reason I was surprised when I looked at the big screen ?","output":"The reason you were surprised when you looked at the big screen could be attributed to various factors. Let's break these down to better understand what might have been the underlying cause: 1. Magnification Factor: The big screen offers a magnified view, allowing you to see the individual's features more clearly and in greater detail. This enhanced focus on their appearance might have led to you being more attracted as you noticed subtle details that were not visible from a distance. 2. Audio-Visual Impact: The combination of sound and visuals on a big screen can create a powerful and immersive experience. This effect might have heightened your perception of attractiveness, as the audio-visual impact can evoke stronger emotions and amplify any feelings you already had. 3. Lighting and Production Quality: The big screen often has better lighting and image quality compared to viewing someone with the naked eye, especially in a dimly lit environment. Better lighting and production quality can effortlessly accentuate someone's features and make them appear more attractive than they would, under normal circumstances. 4. Crowd and Social Influence: When you are in a social setting, the reactions and emotions of those around you can influence your perception. If the crowd around you was also reacting positively and expressing their attraction towards the person, it may have amplified your feelings and contributed to your surprise when you looked at the big screen. 5. Preconceived Expectations: Sometimes, we have certain expectations about a person based on their reputation, status, or previous encounters. When you looked up at the big screen, it's possible that the individual you saw exceeded your expectations, which led to your surprise and increased attraction. 6. Emotional Connection: At times, certain visual or auditory elements can evoke fond memories or associations. The big screen presentation might have triggered a personal connection that you did not experience when viewing the individual directly. This emotional connection could have intensified your attraction. 7. Idealization and Fantasy: Seeing someone on a big screen can create a sense of distance and unattainability, which might make them more alluring. The larger-than-life portrayal on the screen can cause us to idealize the individual and fuel our fantasies, giving way to stronger feelings of attraction than when we see them up close. In conclusion, the surprise you experienced when looking at the big screen could be due to a combination of these factors working together to heighten your perception of the individual's attractiveness. The magnification of features, audio-visual impact, lighting, crowd influence, emotional connection, and fantasies can all play a role in creating this sudden and intensified attraction."},{"instruction":"He trusted Jon but had no idea what happened in the man's mind. Does it follow that \\"He wasn't sure what Jon was thinking but he trusted him.\\"?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"He trusted Jon but had no idea what happened in the man's mind\\" does indeed translate to \\"He wasn't sure what Jon was thinking but he trusted him.\\" Both sentences convey the same meaning, which is that the person in question has faith in Jon's intentions, capabilities, or decision-making, even though the individual does not fully comprehend or have insight into Jon's thoughts or thought processes. To understand the phrases better, let's break down the meaning and sentiment behind the two sentences: First Sentence: \\"He trusted Jon but had no idea what happened in the man's mind.\\" In this sentence, the person seems to have confidence in Jon, as evidenced by the use of the word \\"trusted.\\" Trust involves believing in the reliability, truth, ability, or strength of someone or something. Hence, by stating that \\"he trusted Jon,\\" the speaker is expressing their belief that Jon is dependable and capable. However, despite placing trust in Jon, the speaker remains unsure about what is going on inside Jon's head. The phrase \\"had no idea what happened in the man's mind\\" demonstrates that the speaker is not aware of Jon's actual thought process, or potentially, his intentions or motivations for his actions. Second Sentence: \\"He wasn't sure what Jon was thinking but he trusted him.\\" In this sentence, the person is similarly placing their trust in Jon. By stating, \\"he trusted him,\\" the speaker is emphasizing the belief that Jon is reliable or capable. The phrase \\"He wasn't sure what Jon was thinking\\" echoes the same sentiment as \\"had no idea what happened in the man's mind\\" from the first sentence. Like the first sentence, this phrase indicates that the person does not have an understanding or knowledge of Jon's thoughts, motivations, or reasoning. In conclusion, both sentences convey the same overall meaning: the individual trusts Jon, but they lack insight into Jon's mental state, thought process, or motivation. The slight difference in phrasing does not alter the essential message, which revolves around trust and a lack of complete understanding of Jon's mind."},{"instruction":"Choose the next sentence for this paragraph.

The brain is located in the head, usually close to the primary sensory organs for such senses as vision, hearing, balance, taste, and smell. The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. In a typical human, the cerebral cortex (the largest part) is estimated to contain 15–33 billion neurons, each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons.

Article: Canada, the second largest country in the world, lies in the north of America. The population of Canada is about 29 million and the capital is Ottawa. The country covers about 9,980,000 square kilometers and six of the world's 24 time areas as well. There are two official languages spoken in Canada: French and English. Many people can speak both English and French. More than 60% of Canadians speak English as their language. About 25% of the Canadians speak French. In one province of Canada where French is the common language, the programmes on TV and radios as well as the teaching in schools are all in French. Today, Chinese has become the first inofficial language in Canada. Canada's climate is not as cold all year around as some may believe. In winter, temperatures fall below freezing point throughout most of Canada. In summer, the southern provinces often experience high levels of temperatures that can reach over 30degC regularly. The weather in Canada is just like the weather in China. It is rather cold in the north while it is fairly warm in the south. Winters in the north last long with snow for half a year. As the cold northern climate, only one-fifth of the land is suitable for farming. As it is known to all, Canada has one-third of the world's supply of fresh water. It has many great lakes. There are five great lakes in the south. And there are many others, especially in the north. It is also rich in natural resources, such as coal, oil, natural gas of which Canadians make use to produce energy. People of northern Canada are called Inuit , who came from Asia and settled in Canada about 4,000 years ago. They used to travel around from place to place with teams of dogs which pulled their baggage. Now, they seldom move. There are about 2,500 Inuit in all. The government has started a new school project in which Inuit teach their own young children. So it is hoped that the way of Inuit life will be kept alive for more centuries.

The sour ones sell for .1 an apple. 75% of the apples he gets are sweet and the rest are sour. If he earns 40, how many apples did his trees give him?. Me: Hmmm, let me think. I think this is the detailed solution:","output":"Sure, let's first find out how much he earns from each type of apple. Let S be the number of sweet apples and R be the number of sour apples. We have the following equation: 0.5S + 0.1R = 40 (1) Now, we know that 75% of the apples are sweet and the rest are sour, which means: S = 0.75 * (S + R) (2) From equation (2), we can isolate R: R = S / 0.75 - S Now, substitute this expression for R in equation (1): 0.5S + 0.1(S / 0.75 - S) = 40 Now, solve for S: 0.5S + 0.1S / 0.75 - 0.1S = 40 Multiply both sides of the equation by 0.75 to get rid of the denominator: 0.75 * 0.5S + 0.75 * 0.1S - 0.75 * 0.1S * 0.75 = 40 * 0.75 0.375S + 0.075S - 0.05625S = 30 Combine the terms with S: 0.39375S = 30 Next, divide both sides by 0.39375 to find the number of sweet apples S: S = 30 / 0.39375 S ≈ 76.2 Since the number of apples should be a whole number, we can round S to the nearest whole number, which is 76 sweet apples. Now, find the number of sour apples R using the expression we found earlier: R = 76 / 0.75 - 76 R ≈ 101.3 - 76 R ≈ 25.3 Again, since the number of apples should be a whole number, we can round R to the nearest whole number, which is 25 sour apples.

The city of Zibo is divided into several districts, each with its own unique characteristics and strengths. As a whole, Zibo has a robust economic infrastructure. It is also home to several tourist attractions, such as the Zhoucun Ancient City, Zibo Chinese Ceramics Museum, Zibo Museum, and Mount Tai, offering rich experiences in history, culture, and art. On the other hand, Huaiyin District of Huai'an is located in the Jiangsu province, which is situated to the south of Shandong province where Zibo is located. Similar to Shandong, Jiangsu province possesses a distinct historical and cultural heritage but is universally recognized for its prosperity and well developed higher education and research institutions. Huaiyin District in the city of Huai'an, like Zibo, is an economic hub with a vast industrial park and numerous companies contributing to Jiangsu's economy. The district is famous for its abundant water resources, being surrounded by lakes and canals, resulting in fertile land perfect for agriculture. Huai'an, and notably Huaiyin District, is also known as the birthplace of Zhou Enlai, the first Premier of the People's Republic of China, adding to its historical significance. In conclusion, while both Zibo and Huaiyin District of Huai'an are located within China, they reside in two distinct provinces - Shandong and Jiangsu respectively. Each exhibits unique cultural, historical, and economic characteristics, making them important contributors to the overall socio-economic fabric of the country."},{"instruction":"Add punctuation: 20 He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses","output":"Step 1: Identify the main subject and verb of the sentence.

Many visually-impaired individuals automatically assume there is no place for them in the workplace due to their affliction. Fortunately, this is absolutely not the case. Before you even start sending out resumes, it's a good idea to nurture a positive attitude. Stamp out negative thoughts, and replace them with something positive. For example, if you find yourself thinking something like \\"I'll never find a job. No one will ever hire me because I'm blind,\\" replace the thought with something constructive: \\"I may be blind, sure, but it doesn't stop me from being a worthwhile and valuable human being.\\" In many ways, living in today's society comes with the expectation that you have full use of your eyes. If this isn't the case with you, it can be easy to feel hopeless about one's situation. However, the vast majority of modern professions are available for the visually-impaired to pursue. You should never let yourself get down. Being visually impaired may be tough in many situations, but if you take a moment to look, you'll find hundreds of success stories of people who have gone on to do great things in spite of their disability. Many of these success stories end up using their disability as a motivator to excel in other ways. Never let a disability keep you from doing what you are capable of. People with visual impairment are sometimes stigmatized in the workplace. However, anti-discrimination laws have made it so that it's never been easier to find work as a blind person. Mid-size and larger corporations are often offered incentives to hire the legally blind and visually impaired. Although you'll still need to have the other skills in order to be hired, you should never see your disability as an obstacle with the vast majority of jobs. In the United States, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 was enacted to help ensure equal opportunities for people with disabilities. Depending on the country you're currently residing in, there should be similar laws passed to make it easier for you to find work. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article is about how blind people might have trouble finding a job because they feel bad about themselves and think they can't do the work. But the truth is, they can do a lot of jobs just like everyone else! There are even special laws to help them find work and make sure they are treated fairly. So, it's important for blind people to think positively and remember they are valuable just like everyone else."},{"instruction":"An Ohio distributor is recalling about 6 million Chinese-made tire valve stems after concluding that some of them were improperly made and could increase the risk of accidents. An Ohio distributor is recalling 6 million Chinese-made car tire valve stems. Tech International, the part's Johnstown, Ohio-based distributor, estimates that just 8,600 of roughly 6 million of those valves are defective. The valve is a replacement snap-in tire valve -- Model No. TR413 -- manufactured between July and November 2006. It was imported by Tech International from manufacturer Shanghai Baolong Industries Co. in Shanghai, China, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

The term cynophobia originates from the Greek words \\"Kyón\\" and \\"Phóbos,\\" which mean \\"dog\\" and \\"fear\\" respectively. Cynophobia is classified under \\"specific phobias,\\" a category defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), a diagnostic reference book used by clinicians and psychiatrists. Cynophobia, like other specific phobias, is characterized by an excessive and irrational fear towards a specific situation, object, or animal-in this case, dogs. People suffering from cynophobia experience extreme anxiety or panic attacks at the sight of dogs, the thought of getting close to dogs, or even the mere mention or depiction of dogs. The fear is so intense that the person goes out of their way to avoid dogs or anything associated with dogs. Several factors can lead one to develop cynophobia. It could be due to a traumatic experience in the past involving dogs, such as being bitten or attacked, or witnessing someone else being harmed by a dog. Such traumatic incidents may imprint a fear in the person's mind, causing an automatic fear response whenever they encounter dogs. Even hearing about these incidents second-hand or watching traumatic scenes involving dogs on TV can potentially trigger cynophobia. Cynophobia may also be learned behavior. Children can inherit fears and phobias from their parents or other adult role models through observational learning. If a child sees their parent showing fear of dogs, they may adopt the same fear, believing that dogs are something to be afraid of. Genetic factors may also play a significant role. Some people might be genetically disposed to anxiety disorders, including phobias. If a person has family members suffering from any kind of phobia, they may be at a higher risk of developing a phobia themselves. The symptoms of cynophobia can vary based on the person's level of fear. Physical responses can include sweating, rapid heart rate, trembling, dry mouth, nausea, or having trouble breathing. Behavioral responses can include an earnest effort to avoid areas where dogs might be present, even if it disrupts their regular routine. Psychological symptoms may include intense fear, panic, dread, or terror. They might also experience anticipatory anxiety, where they feel anxious even thinking about coming in contact with a dog. Treatment for cynophobia, as with other specific phobias, can be conducted through various therapeutic interventions. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is commonly used, where the person learns how to manage their fear responses and change their thought patterns regarding dogs. Exposure therapy can also be helpful, where they are gradually and repeatedly exposed to dogs (or images and sounds related to dogs) in a safe environment, to extinguish the fear response. In severe cases, medication might also be considered to manage acute symptoms of anxiety, although it won't cure the phobia itself. In conclusion, cynophobia is a specific type of phobia where one has an intense and irrational fear of dogs. Not all people who fear dogs suffer from cynophobia as the fear has to be extreme and interfere with their daily life, causing intense distress. It's essential to remember that people with this condition aren't just afraid of dogs; their fear is deeply rooted, often linked to past trauma, and can greatly impact their quality of life. Treatment can be very effective, so seeking help from a healthcare professional is crucial."},{"instruction":"Q:Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: In earliest times, men considered lightning to be one of the great mysteries of nature. Some ancient people believed that lightning and thunder were the weapons of the gods. In reality, lightning is a flow of electricity formed high above the earth. A single flash of lightning 1.6 kilometers long has enough electricity to light one million light bulbs . The American scientist and statesman, Benjamin Franklin, was the first to show the connection between electricity and lightning in 1752. In the same year he also built the first lightning rod . This device protects buildings from being damaged by lightning. Modern science has discovered that one stroke of lightning has a voltage of more than 15 million volts . A flash of lightning between a cloud and the earth may be as long as 13 kilometers, and travel at a speed of 30 million meters per second. Scientists judge that there are about 2,000 million flashes of lightning per year. Lightning hits the Empire State Building in New York City 30 to 48 times a year. In the United States alone it kills an average of one person every day. The safest place to be in case of an electrical storm is in a closed car. Outside, one should go to low ground and not get under tress. Also, one should stay out of water and away from metal fences.

The elderly Sacristan enters and begins cleaning. The Sacristan kneels in prayer as the Angelus sounds. The painter Mario Cavaradossi arrives to continue work on his picture of Mary Magdalene. The Sacristan identifies a likeness between the portrait and a blonde-haired woman who has been visiting the church recently (unknown to him, it is Angelotti's sister the Marchesa). Cavaradossi describes the \\"hidden harmony\\" (\\"Recondita armonia\\") in the contrast between the blonde beauty of his painting and his dark-haired lover, the singer Floria Tosca. The Sacristan mumbles his disapproval before leaving. Angelotti emerges and tells Cavaradossi, an old friend who has republican sympathies, that he is being pursued by the Chief of Police, Baron Scarpia. Cavaradossi promises to assist him after nightfall. Tosca's voice is heard, calling to Cavaradossi. Cavaradossi gives Angelotti his basket of food and Angelotti hurriedly returns to his hiding place.

It is among the most famous gardens in England and is designated Grade I on Historic England's register of historic parks and gardens. It was bought by Sackville-West in 1930, and over the next thirty years, working with, and later succeeded by, a series of notable head gardeners, she and Nicolson transformed a farmstead of \\"squalor and slovenly disorder\\" into one of the world's most influential gardens. Following Sackville-West's death in 1962, the estate was donated to the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty. It is one of the Trust's most popular properties, with nearly 200,000 visitors in 2017. The gardens contain an internationally respected plant collection, particularly the assemblage of old garden roses. The writer Anne Scott-James considered the roses at Sissinghurst to be \\"one of the finest collections in the world\\". A number of plants propagated in the gardens bear names related to people connected with Sissinghurst or the name of the garden itself.

Andy Kaufman is a struggling performer whose act fails in nightclubs because, while the audience wants comedy, he sings children's songs and refuses to tell conventional jokes. As the audience begins to believe that Kaufman may have no real talent, his previously timid \\"foreign man\\" character puts on a rhinestone jacket and does a dead-on Elvis impersonation. The audience bursts into applause, realizing Kaufman had tricked them. He catches the eye of talent agent George Shapiro, who signs Kaufman as a client and immediately lands him a network TV series, Taxi, much to Kaufman's dismay, since he dislikes sitcoms. Because of the money, visibility, and a promise that he can do his own television special, Kaufman accepts the role, turning his foreign man into a mechanic named Latka Gravas. Secretly he hates doing the show and expresses a desire to quit. Invited to catch a different act at a nightclub, Shapiro witnesses a performance by a rude, loud-mouthed lounge singer, Tony Clifton, whom Kaufman wants to guest-star on Taxi. Clifton's bad attitude is matched by his horrible appearance and demeanor. But backstage, when he meets Shapiro in person, Clifton takes off his sunglasses and reveals that he is actually Kaufman. Clifton is a \\"villain character\\" created by Kaufman and his creative partner, Bob Zmuda. Once again, the gag is on the audience. Kaufman's profile increases with appearances on Saturday Night Live, but he has problems with his newfound fame. When performing live, audiences dislike his strange anti-humor and demand that he perform as Latka. At one show, he deliberately antagonizes attendees by reading The Great Gatsby aloud from start to finish. Kaufman shows up on the Taxi set as Clifton and proceeds to cause chaos until he is removed from the studio lot.

Plot title: Onionhead Movie plot: In the spring of 1941, Al Woods quits an Oklahoma college to join the armed forces after a quarrel with his co-ed sweetheart, Jo. He joins the Coast Guard, partly by chance due to the flip of a coin. After boot training, Al is assigned to a buoy tender in Boston, the Periwinkle, as a ship's cook although he has no cooking experience. He encounters immediate hostility from the chief of the galley, Red Wildoe, from new crew mates and cooks' helpers Gutsell and Poznicki, and from his arrogant department head, Lieutenant (junior grade) Higgins. In a Boston bar, Al picks up Stella, who appears to do this kind of thing with some regularity. They develop a strong attraction, but she seems to be holding out for something more.[3] He befriends Gutsell by fixing him up with a girlfriend of Stella's and learns from Wildoe how to be a ship's cook, making a number of embarrassing mistakes. Al, frustrated after Stella won't spend a night in a hotel room with him, stops seeing her, whereupon he and the alcoholic Wildoe get drunk together and bond. Wildoe begins seeing Stella with Al's blessing. Pearl Harbor is attacked and war declared. Wildoe abruptly proposes to Stella and they marry. A free-for-all breaks out at their wedding celebration, with a jealous Al instigating a fight with soldiers who are clearly familiar with Stella already. Wildoe is assigned to another vessel performing convoy duty at sea. During this time, Stella begins seeing other men. Al tries to prevent this on Wildoe's behalf, but can't resist Stella himself. Aboard the Periwinkle, Al becomes the new chief cook. Higgins, promoted to executive officer, is discovered entering lesser amounts than they pay for the cost of officers' meals into the ledger of the ship's mess and pocketing the difference. He purchases substandard food for the crew in order to keep the mess budget from showing a deficit.

Let's have some stream of consciousness first.","output":"Sea water fish, like all aquatic animals, obtain their oxygen from the surrounding water. The oxygen is dissolved in the water due to the diffusion of atmospheric oxygen into the water as well as photosynthesis by aquatic plants and phytoplankton. Fish have specialized respiratory structures called gills, which are designed to extract oxygen from the water as it flows over them. As water enters a fish's mouth and flows across the gill filaments, oxygen from the water moves across the thin, permeable walls of the gill filaments and the microscopic, finger-like gill lamellae. This oxygen then binds to hemoglobin molecules in the fish's red blood cells and is transported throughout the fish's body to support cellular respiration. Simultaneously, carbon dioxide, produced as a waste product of cellular respiration, diffuses from the fish's blood into the water and is carried away. The efficiency of gills in extracting oxygen from water allows fish to survive in diverse aquatic environments, including those with low oxygen concentrations. Fish may modify their respiration rate and behavior in response to variations in oxygen levels, water temperature, and other environmental factors. Some fish can also survive in hypoxic, or oxygen-poor, environments by utilizing alternative ways of obtaining oxygen, such as air-breathing organs or gulping air from the water's surface. In summary, sea water fish obtain their oxygen supply from the surrounding water through a specialized, highly efficient respiratory system that includes gills. This enables them to thrive in a wide range of aquatic habitats and adapt to changing environmental conditions."},{"instruction":"Hey, thanks!

Article: The death of languages is not a new phenomenon. Languages usually have a relatively short life span as well as a very high death rate. Only a few, including Egyptian, Chinese, Greek, Latin, have lasted more than 2,000 years. What is new, however, is the speed at which they are dying out. Europe's colonial conquests caused a sharp decline in linguistic diversity, eliminating at least 15 percent of all languages spoken at the time. Over the last 300 years, Europe has lost a dozen, and Australia has only 20 left of the 250 spoken at the end of the 18th century. The rise of nation-states has also been decisive in selecting and consolidating national languages and sidelining others. By making great efforts to establish an official language in education, the media and the civil service, national governments have deliberately tried to eliminate minority languages. This process of linguistic standardization has been boosted by industrialization and scientific progress, which have imposed new methods of communication that are swift, straightforward and practical. Language diversity came to be seen as an obstacle to trade and the spread of knowledge. Monolingualism became an ideal. More recently, the internationalization of financial markets, the spread of information by electronic media and other aspects of globalization have intensified the threat to \\"small\\" languages. A language not on the Internet is a language that \\"no longer exists\\" in the modern world. It is out of the game. The serious effects of the death of languages are evident. First of all, it is possible that if we all ended up speaking the same language, our brains would lose some of their natural capacity for linguistic inventiveness. We would never be able to figure out the origins of human language or resolve the mystery of \\"the first language\\". As each language dies, a chapter of human history closes. Multilingualism is the most accurate reflection of multiculturalism. The destruction of the first will inevitably lead to the loss of the second....

For example, Mrs. Dubose chastises Scout for not wearing a dress and camisole, and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so, in addition to insulting Atticus' intentions to defend Tom Robinson. By balancing the masculine influences of Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, one scholar writes, \\"Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is becoming a feminist in the South, for with the use of first-person narration, she indicates that Scout/ Jean Louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a Southern lady she possessed as a child.\\"\\", answer the following question.

In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements: and the situation: John is an amateur astronomer. Last week he was observing the sky with his telescope. First he pointed his telescope at planet Mars. He noted it as case A.

These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100. Two earth-like planets orbited the same star. The inhabitants of Earth I released greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Earth II ,however, was much more conscious about the environment and protected it from anthropogenic changes. Which planet caused more climate change? Answer:","output":"Earth I caused more climate change due to the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere by its inhabitants. The greenhouse gases trapped heat inside Earth I's atmosphere, leading to global warming and potentially causing detrimental effects on its natural habitats and wildlife. On the other hand, Earth II was more environmentally conscious and protected its environment from anthropogenic changes, suggesting less climate change as a result."},{"instruction":"Q:Generate a question that has the following answer: With Letter for the following movie plot: A train in New York City carries passengers to work, including Veronika Deklava (Sarah Michelle Gellar).

The 57-year-old Diaz-Canel, the only candidate for the job, won a five-year term, according to state media. The move was not expected to usher in drastic change. Upon being sworn in Thursday, Diaz-Canel promised to continue the Castros' socialist revolution. \\"The mandate given by the people to this house is to give continuity to the Cuban revolution in a crucial historic moment,\\" Diaz-Canel said. Diaz-Canel, a former first vice president, appears to be socially liberal and is considered an acceptable successor to the retiring elderly leaders who fought in the revolution. He succeeds 86-year-old Raul Castro, who is resigning after 10 years in office. Raul Castro's late brother, Fidel, served as prime minister and president after the armed Cuban Revolution in 1959 until he became ill in 2006. While the leadership transition is elevating younger leaders, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries are expected to retain their power, due to their hold on the Communist Party. Castro will remain party leader. \\"Raul Castro, as first secretary of the Communist Party, will lead the decisions about the future of the country,'' Diaz-Canel said in his speech. \\"Cuba needs him, providing ideas and proposals for the revolutionary cause, orienting and alerting us about any error or deficiency, teaching us, and always ready to confront imperialism.'' Castro told members of the National Assembly that Diaz-Canel could serve two years as president, and that he will likely eventually take his place as head of the Communist Party. Diaz-Canel will face pressure to bring greater prosperity to the Caribbean country and revitalize its economy, which is weaker than it was in 1985 when it was supported by the former Soviet Union.

The 5-foot-1-inch teen with long, curly dark brown hair was very close to her family and didn’t leave home much once she arrived there, according to local media accounts and her profile on the “America’s Most Wanted” Web site. The television show first featured her case in 2005. The depth of the family relationships — and the pain caused by DeJesus’s disappearance — are starkly evident in postings on Facebook, a site that barely existed when she went missing. In March, her aunt, Janice Ruiz Smith, wrote on a Facebook group dedicated to finding her: “To the person who took my niece Gina, please please let her go. I know deep in your heart, there is goodness. She has a family who loves her, and misses her very much. Please let her come home.’’ The posting added that Ruiz Smith would be putting up posters and handing out prayer vigil flyers. Also in March, DeJesus’s mother, Nancy Ruiz, noted the upcoming nine-year anniversary of her daughter’s disappearance. “To all my loved ones, sorry for not being there for you,” she wrote. “Been ups and downs, but lives go on. Gina, I love you and miss you so much. . . all of us are doing the best we can, just hang in there.’’ In the days after DeJesus went missing, the family’s modest home turned into a media hot spot, according to accounts in the Cleveland Plain Dealer. Television trucks were parked outside, and the mayor visited. But family members soon began to despair, when the frantic efforts to find her yielded nothing. In an irony that triggered media reports and online commentary Tuesday, the estranged son of former school bus driver Ariel Castro wrote of her disappearance in 2004 for a Cleveland area community newspaper. DeJesus was being held captive in Castro’s home. “For seven weeks, Gina’s family has been organizing searches, holding prayer vigils, posting fliers and calling press conferences,” said the article by Ariel “Anthony” Castro, then a journalism student at Bowling Green State University. “Despite the many tips and rumors that have been circulating in the neighborhood, there has been no sign of her.’’ Alice Crites contributed to this report.

You can give them an extra incentive to bathe by encouraging them to make plans. Go beyond simply suggesting things to do, and mark out specific plans with them on a calendar. Outings and activities that are easy arrange include lunch with friends or family, going to the movies or a musical performance, or a trip to the park. Even if they prefer to wash themselves, it’s safest to supervise your loved one for at least the first couple of washing sessions. Stress that you only want to be there to set things up and ensure safety, with the possibility of letting them wash on their own after making sure they feel safe. If you do help the person bathe, then try using tactful questions to help them with the bathing process. For example, you might ask things like, what kind of soap do you prefer? Do you need a washcloth? Is the water warm enough? You can also make tactful suggestions during the bathing process, such as, “Here’s the soap for washing your body.” Or, “I’m going to hand you the shampoo next so you can wash your hair.” Instead of asking whether or not they want to bathe, pose your questions in a way that assumes they want to. Avoid yes or no questions, such as \\"Do you want to bathe or not?\\"--in addition to coming off as testy, this omits the assumption that more bathing should be done. For example, you can ask “When should I come back to help you with your bath?” or “What time of the day suits you best for showering?” Depending on your relationship with the person, they may feel awkward about your helping them with such a private routine. If the person is living with a spouse or partner, first suggest that the spouse or partner help them bathe. If the pair seem open to this, begin by discussing and establishing a routine with both of them. Mark the washing days (at least two per week) on the calendar. If the person can’t bathe alone and is uncomfortable with a family member helping out, hiring a caregiver for home visits is the best option. These services are widely available in most communities. Search your directory or the internet for “In-Home Health Provider” or “Home Health Care.” Schedule a bathing session for at least twice a week, marking it on a calendar that is easily visible (attached to the refrigerator, hanging on a wall in the kitchen). The idea of an unfamiliar person helping them to wash could be worrisome. Assure them that the caregiver is a professional, and is specifically trained to help people take care of themselves. Regardless of who helps with washing, remind the loved one that bathing can be a pleasant, refreshing experience and is important to staying healthy. Whether it’s you, a spouse, or a caregiver who will be helping, putting washing times on the calendar will help the loved one to improve their memory, and get a better sense of the week’s activities. When you or the caregiver arrives, it’s “bath time,” an event as expected and routine as dinnertime or bedtime. If you’re not the one helping with washing, either ask the spouse or partner whether the schedule is being followed, or call the in-home agency to make sure the treatment is running smoothly. If the person is washing themselves, an easy way to make sure they’re using the bath regularly is to check the soap bar size and body wash / shampoo bottle levels to see whether they’ve been used. Since you’ve already completed the difficult task of asking them about hygiene, it should be easier at this point to casually ask whether they’ve been keeping to the new bathing schedule you’d agreed on. It’s possible that your loved one will refuse to bathe, despite repeated attempts on your part to explain the benefits and to offer to help. In this case, consult a family doctor, and ask about medications that are designed to ease resistance to care. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article would be: Encourage your loved one to improve their personal hygiene by making plans for social outings and activities, while offering support during their bathing routine. Use tactful questions and suggestions to facilitate the process, and involve their spouse or partner in establishing a routine. If needed, consider hiring a professional caregiver for assistance. Establish a regular bathing schedule and follow up on its progress to ensure the routine is being maintained.

While the app does offer some basic functionalities for file sharing, I have to say that it's quite disappointing in comparison to other alternatives available in the market. First and foremost, the user interface is outdated and not user-friendly. Navigating through the app can be quite cumbersome, and an overall design update wouldn't hurt – it's high time the developers give the app a modern touch. Performance-wise, the app is slow, and it takes a long time to load the content. Moreover, searching for specific files often leads to dead ends or irrelevant search results, which can be quite frustrating when you're trying to find something specific. One of the major drawbacks of this app is the sheer amount of ads that constantly pop up on the screen. While some ads are understandable, considering the app is free, the frequency of ads in com.frostwire.android is overwhelming and intrusive, taking away from an already mediocre user experience. Another aspect that could use improvement is the app's stability; I've experienced a number of crashes while using it, which has sometimes led to a loss of work or progress. Additionally, it tends to consume a large amount of phone battery, even when idle in the background.

Middle school friends Frank Navetta and Dave Nolte start the band in 1977 by writing songs together on guitar. Classmate Bill Stevenson impresses them with his musical talents and becomes their drummer. In 1979 they meet bassist Tony Lombardo in Long Beach and recruit him to the band. Nolte bows out to join his brothers in The Last, and Navetta, Stevenson, and Lombardo record the Descendents' debut single. Stevenson's high school classmate Milo Aukerman joins the band as lead singer, and the new lineup builds a local following through their catchy and melodic songs, energetic live shows, and Aukerman's image as a nerd. They release the Fat EP (1981) and their debut album Milo Goes to College (1982), so named because Aukerman leaves the band to study biology. Stevenson drums in Black Flag for the next few years. In 1985 the Descendents reconvene for a second album, I Don't Want to Grow Up. Navetta has burned all of his equipment and moved to Oregon, and is replaced by Ray Cooper. Stevenson pushes for the band to tour, but Lombardo declines and quits. He is replaced by Doug Carrion, and this lineup records 1986's Enjoy!, after which Cooper and Carrion both leave the band. Stevenson recruits bassist Karl Alvarez from Salt Lake City, who brings in his close friend Stephen Egerton to play guitar. The new lineup releases the 1987 album All, themed around the philosophical concept of \\"All\\" invented by Stevenson and friend Pat McCuistion.

It has a population of 309,714 people (2013 est.), making it Spain's 13th most populous municipality and northwestern Spain's biggest city. Its metropolitan area ranks 20th in Spain with a population of 414,244 people in 23 municipalities. - The University of Salamanca is a Spanish higher education institution, located in the town of Salamanca, west of Madrid, in the autonomous community of Castile and León. It was founded in 1134 and given the Royal charter of foundation by King Alfonso IX in 1218. It is the oldest founded university in Spain and the third oldest European university in continuous operations. The formal title of \\"University\\" was granted by King Alfonso X in 1254 and recognized by Pope Alexander IV in 1255. - Pedro Hurtado de Mendoza ( 1578 -- 1641 ) was a Basque philosopher and theologian . He worked mostly with peripatetic philosophy , with 17 years at Jesus 's Company the School of Salamanca . He was a teacher of theology and philosophy in Valladolid and he occupied a chair at the University of Salamanca . Hurtado belonged to the third generation of Jesuit scholars and initiated the shift from more realist positions of Francisco Suárez and Gabriel Vásquez towards nominalism , characteristic of that generation . His nominalist theology was further developed by his pupil Rodrigo Arriaga and Francisco Oviedo . - Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla. - The Protestant Reformation, often referred to simply as the Reformation (from Latin \\"reformatio\\", \\"restoration, renewal\\"), was a schism from the Roman Catholic Church initiated by Martin Luther and continued by John Calvin, Huldrych Zwingli, and other early Protestant Reformers in 16th century Europe. Timing most commonly used for this period is from 1517 (the Ninety-five Theses are published by Martin Luther) to 1648 (Peace of Westphalia ends the Thirty Years' War). - Francisco de Vitoria (or Victoria), OP (c. 1483, Burgos or Vitoria-Gasteiz 12 August 1546, Salamanca), was a Spanish Renaissance Roman Catholic philosopher, theologian and jurist. He is the founder of the tradition in philosophy known as the School of Salamanca, noted especially for his contributions to the theory of just war and international law. He has in the past been described by some scholars as one of the \\"fathers of international law\\", along with Alberico Gentili and Hugo Grotius, though contemporary academics have suggested that such a description is anachronistic, since the concept of international law did not truly develop until much later. American jurist Arthur Nussbaum noted that Vitoria was \\"the first to set forth the notions (though not the terms) of freedom of commerce and freedom of the seas.\\" Because of Vitoria's conception of a \\"republic of the whole world\\" (\\"res publica totius orbis\\") he recently has been labeled \\"founder of global political philosophy\\". - Castile and León (Leonese: \\"Castiella y Llión\\" ) is an autonomous community in north-western Spain. It was constituted in 1983, although it existed for the first time during the First Spanish Republic in the 19th century. León first appeared as a Kingdom in 910, whilst the Kingdom of Castile gained an independent identity in 1065 and was intermittently held in personal union with León before merging with it permanently in 1230. It is the largest autonomous community in Spain and the third largest region of the European Union, covering an area of with an official population of around 2.5 million (2011). - De facto is a Latin expression that means \\"in fact, in reality, in actual existence, force, or possession, as a matter of fact\\" (literally \\"of fact\\"). In law, it often means \\"in practice but not necessarily ordained by law\\" or \\"in practice or actuality, but not officially designated or established\\". It is commonly used in contrast to \\"\\" (which means \\"according to law\\"; literally \\"from law\\"), when referring to matters of law, governance, or technique (such as standards) that are found in the common experience as created or developed without or contrary to a regulation. When discussing a legal situation, \\"de jure\\" designates what the law says, while \\"de facto\\" designates what happens in practice. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - The School of Salamanca is the Renaissance of thought in diverse intellectual areas by Spanish and Portuguese theologians, rooted in the intellectual and pedagogical work of Francisco de Vitoria. From the beginning of the 16th century the traditional Catholic conception of man and of his relation to God and to the world had been assaulted by the rise of humanism, by the Protestant Reformation and by the new geographical discoveries and their consequences. These new problems were addressed by the School of Salamanca. The name refers to the University of Salamanca, where de Vitoria and others of the school were based. - Salamanca is an ancient Celtic city in northwestern Spain that is the capital of the Province of Salamanca in the community of Castile and León. The city lies on several hills by the Tormes River. Its Old City was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988. With a metropolitan population of 228,881 in 2012 according to the National Institute of Statistics (INE), Salamanca is the second most populated urban area in Castile and León, after Valladolid (414,000), and ahead of Leon (187,000) and Burgos (176,000). - Humanism is a philosophical and ethical stance that emphasizes the value and agency of human beings, individually and collectively, and affirms their ability to improve their lives through the use of reason and ingenuity as opposed to submitting blindly to tradition and authority or sinking into cruelty and brutality. The term was coined in 1808 by the early nineteenth century German educational reformer and theologian Friedrich Niethammer and gradually adopted into English. Niethammer had wished to introduce into German education the humane values of ancient Greece and Rome. Niethhammer was a Lutheran theologian. Since the twentieth century, however, Anglophone humanist movements have usually been aligned with secularism, and today humanism typically refers to a non-theistic life stance centred on human agency and looking to science rather than revelation from a supernatural source to understand the world.

At his memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral, a reporter tries to gain insights into this remarkable, enigmatic man from those who knew him, with little success.During the First World War, Lawrence is a misfit British Army lieutenant stationed in Cairo, notable for his insolence and knowledge. Over the objections of General Murray (Donald Wolfit), he is sent by Mr. Dryden (Claude Rains) of the Arab Bureau to assess the prospects of Prince Faisal (Alec Guinness) in his revolt against the Turks.On the journey, his Bedouin guide is killed by Sherif Ali (Omar Sharif) for drinking from a well without permission. Lawrence later meets Colonel Brighton (Anthony Quayle), who orders him to keep quiet, make his assessment of Faisal's camp, and leave. Lawrence promptly ignores Brighton's commands when he meets Faisal. His knowledge and outspokenness pique the Prince's interest.Brighton advises Faisal to retreat to Yenbo after a major defeat, but Lawrence proposes a daring surprise attack on Aqaba which, if successful, would provide a port from which the British could offload much-needed supplies. While strongly fortified against a naval assault, the town is lightly defended on the landward side. He convinces Faisal to provide fifty men, led by a sceptical Sherif Ali. Two teenage orphans, Daud (John Dimech) and Farraj (Michel Ray), attach themselves to Lawrence as his servants.They cross the Nefud Desert, considered impassable even by the Bedouins, travelling day and night on the last stage to reach water.

Establishes a good framework to develop a product 2. Lacks specific criteria required to move a program forward 3. Does not tie knowledge to decisions for increasing investments in the program as it moves from system integration to system demonstration. Step 2: Identify the strengths and weaknesses of the policy mentioned in the premise Strengths: 1. The policy has a good framework for developing a product, which means it must have some useful foundational structure to guide product development. Weaknesses: 1. The policy lacks specific criteria for moving programs forward, preventing the project from progressing effectively. 2. The policy does not connect knowledge with decisions concerning increased investments, making it difficult to justify higher investments during the transition from system integration to system demonstration. Step 3: Evaluate the hypothesis in the context of the premise The hypothesis claims that the lack of criteria for efficiently moving programs forward is extremely detrimental to the policy's effectiveness. Considering the premise, the policy indeed has weaknesses, particularly in progressing programs and making well-informed decisions about investments. However, it is important to note that the policy has a good framework for product development, which is a strength. The hypothesis may be true if the weaknesses mentioned in the premise are substantial enough to nullify the positive aspects of the policy. However, it is impossible to determine whether these weaknesses are truly \\"fatal\\" to the policy's effectiveness without more information about how crucial these weaknesses are or if the policy's strengths can compensate for them. Conclusion: While the premise identifies weaknesses in the policy that could hinder its effectiveness, it is inconclusive whether these issues are \\"fatal\\" to the policy's ability to be effective.

Article:","output":"Minnesota Vikings Ban Star Running Back Adrian Peterson Amid Child Abuse Allegations The Minnesota Vikings have decided to ban star running back Adrian Peterson from all team-related activities until the legal issues over him hitting his 4-year-old son with a stick have been resolved. The decision comes after the team initially attempted to reinstate him on Monday. The team has now reversed course, under heavy pressure from sponsors, and placed Peterson on the exempt-commissioner's permission list, a move that effectively bans him from participating in any Vikings activities, as reported by ESPN. \\"We have decided this is the appropriate course of action for the organization and for Adrian,\\" the team's owners stated in an official statement released early today. \\"This is the best possible outcome given the circumstances,\\" Peterson's agent tells the Associated Press. \\"Adrian understands the gravity of the situation and this enables him to take care of his personal situation.\\" The move comes after Peterson faced intense public scrutiny following reports of him striking his 4-year-old son with a stick. Sponsors have also been distancing themselves from the Vikings and Peterson. The Radisson hotel chain suspended its sponsorship of the Vikings on Monday night, and Castrol, a leading motor oil company, pulled out of its deal with Peterson yesterday. Peterson's first court hearing in the abuse case is scheduled to take place in Texas early next month. More controversy arose when it was revealed yesterday that the mother of another one of Peterson's children, also a 4-year-old son, filed a complaint after he texted her about giving him a \\"whoopin.\\" Nevertheless, Peterson's lawyer asserts that there is no \\"ongoing or new investigation\\" of the incident. The Minnesota Vikings' decision to ban Peterson stands as a clear response to the growing pressure on the team and the NFL as a whole to take a stand against domestic violence and child abuse. As sponsors continue to distance themselves from the team, the league will likely face more challenges moving forward in ensuring its players and associated organizations adhere to stricter standards of conduct. With Peterson now barred from participating in team activities, the Vikings and the NFL will be closely monitoring the ongoing legal proceedings and potential fallout from this high-profile case. As the league faces mounting criticism for its handling of player misconduct, the outcome of Adrian Peterson's case may prove to be a watershed moment for the NFL and the sports industry as a whole."},{"instruction":"You will be given a text below.

Hypothesis: Management communities primarily use the written policy mechanism. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"Yes, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. Let's break down the premise and hypothesis to better understand their relationship. Premise: \\"As with any area of operations, written policies are the primary mechanism by which management communicates its views and requirements to its employees, clients, and business partners.\\" The premise suggests a universal application, stating that \\"any area of operations\\" relies on written policies as the primary means of communication from management to various stakeholders, which include employees, clients, and business partners. It highlights the importance of written policies, considering them as the central mechanism for conveying management's expectations and objectives. Hypothesis: \\"Management communities primarily use the written policy mechanism.\\" The hypothesis is a direct statement that reinforces the idea presented in the premise. It asserts that management communities, presumably referring to the collective management teams across various industries and organizations, mainly employ written policies as their communication mechanism. The hypothesis is essentially a restatement and affirmation of the core concept presented in the premise, that written policies are the primary communication mode for management. By accepting the premise that written policies are the primary mechanism for management to communicate its views and requirements to its stakeholders, we can reasonably conclude that the hypothesis, stating that management communities primarily use written policies for communication, is entailed by the premise. They both convey that written policies are the primary tool used by management to communicate their expectations and objectives to the relevant parties, which establishes a coherent and consistent understanding between the premise and hypothesis."},{"instruction":"Premise: A male is wearing a blue shit as he cleans windows.

(CNN) -- A dinosaur from the Middle-Late Jurassic period, found in China, gives scientists new understandings of how birds evolved, according to a Wednesday report from the journal Nature. The newly discovered species is called Aurornis xui. \\"Aurora\\" is Latin for \\"daybreak\\" or \\"dawn.\\" Ornis is Greek for \\"bird.\\" The last part of the name, xui, honors paleontologist Xu Xing. The dinosaur lived about 150 million years ago, said Pascal Godefroit, lead author and researcher at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences in Brussels. Read about more dinosaur discoveries The critter was 51 centimeters -- about 20 inches -- long. It had teeth and probably fed on insects, Godefroit said. It was found in the Tiaojishan Formation of Liaoning Province, China. This is the skeleton of the newly discovered dinosaur, which is about 150 million years old. This dinosaur appears to have had four wings, two along the arms and two along the legs, Godefroit said. It could probably glide but not actively fly off the ground. The specimen, exceptionally preserved in a clay sediment, appears to be an adult. This dinosaur ate like a falcon Another fossil from about 150 million years ago, called Archaeopteryx, was previously considered the most primitive known bird. Godefroit said the newly discovered dinosaur throws that into question, as the new find appears to represent an even more primitive, older bird. Alan Turner, assistant professor of anatomical sciences at Stony Brook University in New York, who was not involved in the study, said in an e-mail that the find was \\"a very interesting fossil discovery.\\" It demonstrates just how similar the earliest birds were to the earliest members of the dinosaur groups, dromaeosaurids and troodontids, Turner said. These groups are all theropods, small meat-eating dinosaurs that walked on two feet. Michigan cousins go after crayfish, hook a mastodon Because of how well-preserved and well-prepared the specimen is, it provides useful information about the creature's evolutionary position and the changes that were taking place in the lineage that led to birds, he said. Still, Aurornis xui's exact position in its family tree is likely not set in stone, he said. The relationships between the earliest bird species and their dinosaur relatives can change in subtle ways depending on the data set being used by particular groups of researchers. That means that species that were once called \\"birds\\" can become considered \\"troodontids,\\" or vice versa. The exact details are still being worked out, Turner said. \\"That's why new discoveries like Aurornis xui are both very exciting and frustrating because they often raise as many questions as they answer,\\" he said.

Paragraph : The sooner cancer is treated, the greater the chances of a cure. Question: If we are able to catch a disease early we the chance of curing it is less likely or more likely? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, if we are able to catch a disease early, particularly cancer, the chance of curing it is more likely. This statement signifies the importance of early detection in increasing the effectiveness of treatment and the overall prognosis of the disease. Cancer, being a progressive disease, can often grow and spread to different parts of the body if not diagnosed and treated in its early stages. The earlier cancer is detected, the more confined it is likely to be - and thus often easier to treat - as it may not have had the chance to metastasize, or spread to other parts of the body. In addition to this, treating cancer early may also mean that a patient can undergo less aggressive treatment options which further enhances the likelihood of a successful outcome. When cancer is detected at a more advanced stage, the treatment options may become more aggressive and may carry a higher risk of complications or side effects. Moreover, early detection and treatment also increase the survival rate of patients with cancer. According to several studies, there is a significant increase in the five-year survival rate of patients whose cancer is detected at an early stage compared to those diagnosed at an advanced stage. Therefore, the paragraph highlights the critical role of early detection and intervention in enhancing the cure rates and improving the quality of life of patients with diseases, particularly cancer. It underscores the value of regular screenings, self-examinations, understanding symptoms and risk factors, and following up on any concerning signs or symptoms. This diligence can lead to early diagnosis and subsequently, a higher likelihood of successful treatment and cure. So, it can certainly be inferred from the paragraph that catching a disease early makes curing it more likely, rather than less."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Rayon is derived from a natural cellulose and cannot be considered synthetic, but requires extensive processing in a manufacturing process, and led the less expensive replacement of more naturally derived materials. A succession of new synthetic fibers were introduced by the chemicals industry in the following decades. Acetate in fiber form was developed in 1924. Nylon, the first fiber synthesized entirely from petrochemicals, was introduced as a sewing thread by DuPont in 1936, followed by DuPont's acrylic in 1944. Some garments were created from fabrics based on these fibers, such as women's hosiery from nylon, but it was not until the introduction of polyester into the fiber marketplace in the early 1950s that the market for cotton came under threat. The rapid uptake of polyester garments in the 1960s caused economic hardship in cotton-exporting economies, especially in Central American countries, such as Nicaragua, where cotton production had boomed tenfold between 1950 and 1965 with the advent of cheap chemical pesticides. Cotton production recovered in the 1970s, but crashed to pre-1960 levels in the early 1990s. Q: What was manufactured completely from petrochemicals?","output":"Nylon was the first fiber to be manufactured completely from petrochemicals. It was introduced by DuPont in 1936 as a sewing thread and later gained prominence in the production of various garments, including women's hosiery.

Question 2: What is the mass in grams of 11 atoms of potassium? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Question 1: Imagine a toy box filled with different types of marbles. 1. Atomic Mass: Think of atomic mass like the total weight of all the marbles in the toy box. It's a single number that tells us how heavy the average marble is, considering all the different types of marbles that we have. 2. Mass Number: Now let's say we pick one specific marble (or a type of atom). The mass number is the total number of small parts (called protons and neutrons) that are inside the \\"heart\\" of the marble (or the nucleus of the atom). 3. Atomic Weight: Atomic weight is like atomic mass, but instead of just giving us the average weight of the marbles, it tells us how much each different type of marble (or a type of atom) contributes to the average weight based on how many of each kind we have. 4. Relative Atomic Mass: This one is a bit simpler. Relative atomic mass is just a way to compare the weights of different types of marbles (atoms) by choosing one marble (like a hydrogen atom) as a reference. So, instead of saying \\"this marble weighs 4 grams,\\" we say \\"this marble is 4 times heavier than the reference marble.\\" Question 2: To find the mass in grams of 11 atoms of potassium, we need to know the weight of one potassium atom and then multiply it by 11. Let's say that 1 potassium atom (like one of our marbles) has a weight of 39 grams. So, if we have 11 potassium atoms, we'll use: 11 atoms x 39 grams/atom = 429 grams So, the mass of 11 potassium atoms would be 429 grams. Answer: The two questions are different and their answers are not the same.

Over the past couple of years I’ve tried several of their products including my favourite Cleansing Melt and I haven’t found anything that I don’t like yet! This month I’ve been trying their Deep Peace Aromatic Body Oil which arrived with me just at the right time – my husband had man flu, I had a cold and I was looking after our 16 month old toddler alone. Deep Peace was just what my body was craving! I was sent a small glass bottle of the oil to try, but the full size product is a larger 100ml pump bottle (it also comes in 200ml and 1 litre bottles too). The directions say you can use it in two ways, either massage it into shoulders, neck and arms before bed, or apply it all over the body after batheing. After a bath or shower is the best time I feel as the skin is damp and warm and the Deep Peace oil helps lock moisture into the skin and the warmth helps the scent to lift.

The fragrance is very subtle and perfect if you don’t like products that smell overpowering.

If you wait to wipe up the spill, it can dry on the surface, making it harder to clean. Since Corian countertops are nonporous, the spill won't soak in, making it a breeze to just wipe it up with a clean, damp cloth. Always dry the surface immediately after cleaning. If you don't dry the surface, film will build up over time. If the spill has dried, you can use warm, soapy water to clean it up. Put a bit of dish soap on a rag, then add warm water to make it sudsy. Wipe it over the spill or residue to clean it up, then rinse it with clean warm water. If regular soap and water don't remove the stain, you can use an ammonia-based cleaner. Spray or rub the cleaner in, then wipe it up. Make sure to rinse it with clean water, and don't forget to dry it so you don't leave streaks. Don't use window cleaners on this type of counter, as these can leave a waxy buildup. Before using any cleaner, read the directions on the bottle. Always test the cleaner first on an out-of-way corner, so you can rest assured it won't create a different problem. Although glass cleaner does have ammonia in it, you should skip it for this purpose. It can leave a film on the countertop. Pick a household cleaner instead. If you don't have an ammonia-based cleaner, you can use another non-abrasive cleaner. It must be non-abrasive because Corian countertops are easily scratched. Spray the cleaner on the counter, and use a clean, wet rag to rub the cleaner in. You can leave the cleaner on for a minute or two to help remove the stain. Rinse and dry the countertop when you're done. Make sure not to mix different types of cleaners, as that can create toxic fumes.

This article originally appeared on Role Reboot. Not a day goes by when I’m not reading another headline arguing that women can have it all, or, more accurately, why they can’t. In the New York Times magazine, Jennifer Szalai’s does a fine job deconstructing the very origin of “having it all” as both a myth and misrepresentation of a classic book in the 1970s. While former Cosmopolitan editor-in-chief and author Helen Gurley Brown’s editors coined the title for her 1982 book “Having It All,” the thesis was more self-help than a debate of the sexes, and definitely did not include children in the equation. Originally, Szalai writes, Brown intended to catalyze women to strive for “more love, more money, more stability and, inevitably, more sex” despite what social economic class one was starting from. Her original title — “The Mouseburger Plan” — represented how she envisioned the book’s thesis: “A book by a near-loser who got to be a winner.” Her editors felt otherwise. Somehow “having it all” seemed more appealing than working toward something from nothing, and 30 years later the phrase has been taken out of context (what little it began in), and conveniently appropriated. During that time, feminist setbacks and victories have revived the phrase “having it all” for a very narrow definition of women: professional mothers. While bringing to light the sad facts of working mothers struggling to find adequate childcare or help with housework, the concept of having it all and, more accurately, why women can’t, has recently been distilled down to two distinct, and arguably classist, definitions of womanhood: having a career and having children. Why do feminist authors continue to define womanhood in such narrow and definitive terms? Many women do not have careers or children. And this is not always by choice. Given the economic downturn in the past handful of years, plenty of intelligent and ambitious women found themselves stuck in dead-end or less-than-professional jobs in order to pay off existing student loans or mounting debt payments. While many people who were laid off turned to higher education, many more people abandoned higher education in order to avoid doubling or tripling their loan burdens. I am one of those women, who considered graduate school but ultimately stayed in a retail job out of hesitancy to rack up tens of thousands of dollars in graduate school debt plus living expenses. My retail job offered full health benefits and flexibility, but a career it is not. And some of my reasons to stay at said job were to keep the flexibility should I have a baby. But not all women can have or want to have children. Having married in my late 30s, I may be too old and economically disadvantaged to have a baby. Having no career, and no baby, am I arguably even a woman at all? Or am I a woman who has nothing at all? Classism in feminist discourse is unavoidable, as it’s unavoidable in almost every discipline. While feminist theory makes great and respectful strides to be inclusive of all women when defining different schools of feminist thought, the majority of feminist discourse in popular culture and media continues to discuss professional career women with children as though they represent women as a whole. There are plenty of women who want it all, but that may not mean a professional career and children. Does that mean they are not entitled to argue for a healthy and equal work and home life? As for the women who want a career or a baby but can’t, are we not allowed to argue for life/work balance as well? I’m glad that Jennifer Szalai’s article exposes the very phrase “having it all” as a marketing gimmick. Perhaps the argument for women “having it all” will be equally exposed as a gimmick that barely addresses the complexity of all women and their need for equality at work, home, and the world at large.","output":"The idea of \\"having it all\\" has long been a topic of debate among women trying to find a balance between personal, professional, and family life. The phrase, associated with Helen Gurley Brown's 1982 self-help book, has often been misunderstood and misrepresented. It has contributed to the pressure women feel in pursuing both careers and motherhood, and has been narrowed down to two classist definitions of womanhood. The feminist discourse around \\"having it all\\" leaves out women who don't fall into these categories, further damaging the self-esteem of women who may not fit into this narrow definition. While the term has its roots in marketing, its continued use contributes to an incomplete conversation about the complexities of women's lives and the need for equality at work, home, and in society."},{"instruction":"Write a tweet that is negative.","output":"A negative tweet could be something like this: \\"Rainy days are so yucky!

Options: - prison - nightclub - jail - sell drugs - street corner Let's think carefully first. Step-by-step reasoning process:","output":"1. Assess the context of the question: The question is asking about the likely place a convicted drug dealer will go, and we are provided with five options. 2. Evaluate each option in relation to the context: - Prison: A convicted drug dealer with a felony would most likely face a prison sentence, as a felony conviction typically results in a more severe punishment. - Nightclub: Although drug dealers may frequent nightclubs to sell drugs, someone convicted of a felony would likely not choose to do illegal activities in such a public environment. - Jail: Jail is a temporary holding facility for those awaiting trial or sentencing. However, once an individual has been convicted of a felony, they generally move from jail to prison for a longer sentence. - Sell drugs: It's unlikely that a convicted drug dealer with a felony would continue to sell drugs, especially if they are imprisoned. Moreover, continuing to engage in illegal activities would demonstrate a disregard for the law. - Street corner: Like a nightclub, a street corner might be a place where drug dealers operate, but a convicted drug dealer with a felony would likely not choose such a visible location, especially if imprisoned. 3. Compare and select the most appropriate option: Based on the evaluation of each option, the most likely place for a drug dealer convicted of a felony to go is prison. This is because prison sentences are a common punishment for felony convictions, and it is the only option that aligns with the legal consequences of such a conviction."},{"instruction":"Possible answers: a). remorseful; b). be ignored by friends; c). be given a party; Q: Aubrey sent text messages to all of her friends telling them she was leaving. Given the context: What will happen to Aubrey? A:","output":"Given the context provided, it is not possible to definitively predict the outcome for Aubrey after sending the text message. However, I can present an analysis of the possible scenarios listed, and evaluate the likelihood of each one based on typical human behavior and response patterns. a) Remorseful: There is a possibility that Aubrey may feel remorseful after sending the text messages. Remorse is a feeling of regret or guilt that may arise from realizing that an action might have had negative consequences. If Aubrey is someone who tends to feel guilty or concerned about the potential negative impact of her actions on others, she may be more likely to experience remorse in this situation. Factors that may contribute to Aubrey feeling remorseful could include her reasoning for leaving, the emotional connection she shares with her friends, and her past experiences in similar situations. b) Be ignored by friends: Aubrey's friends may choose to ignore her after receiving the text messages. This response may be a result of them feeling hurt, shocked, or betrayed by Aubrey's decision to leave. Depending on the relationships Aubrey shares with her friends, the bond between them, and whether they could have sensed or anticipated Aubrey's departure, the decision to ignore her may be perceived as justified or unreasonable by her friends. However, this response may not be permanent, as some friends might need time to process the new situation or confront their own feelings before reaching out to Aubrey for dialogue or closure. c) Be given a party: In some cases, Aubrey's friends might decide to throw her a farewell party. This would typically happen if her friends empathize with her reasons for leaving and wish to show their appreciation and support for her. Organizing a party for Aubrey would demonstrate the strength of their bond, as well as their understanding of her situation. Factors that could influence the decision to host a party for Aubrey might include the quality of her friendships, the reasons for her departure, and her friends' willingness to cherish the positive aspects of their relationships. In conclusion, the nature of Aubrey's relationships with her friends, her motive for leaving, and her friends' reactions and emotions contribute significantly to forecasting the most probable outcome. Without additional context, it is challenging to determine with certainty which scenario would play out for Aubrey. Each of the options presented — feelings of remorse, being ignored by friends, or being given a party — has potential connections to different circumstances and relationship dynamics."},{"instruction":"when the tribe of dan, called vaner and taner, trekked across eastern europe, they likewise seem to have named several major rivers after themselves.

Choices: - when light goes from a slow medium to another slow medium - when light goes from a fast medium to a slow - when light goes from a fast medium to another fast medium - when light goes from a slow medium to a fast A:","output":"The correct answer is: when light goes from a slow medium to a fast. Total internal reflection is a phenomenon that occurs when light waves travel from a medium with a higher refractive index (i.e., a slow medium; a material through which light travels at slower speeds such as water or glass) to a medium with a lower refractive index (i.e., a fast medium; a material through which light travels faster such as air). The refractive index of a medium is a measure of how much the medium slows down the light. The higher the refractive index, the more the light slows down and the more it refracts, or bends, as it enters that medium. Conversely, the lower the refractive index, the less the light slows down and the less it refracts. In certain conditions when light hits the boundary between a slow medium and a fast medium at a sufficiently high angle, instead of refracting and passing into the second medium, all of it reflects back into the first medium. This phenomenon is called total internal reflection. The angle at which this occurs is called the critical angle. If the light strikes the boundary at an angle larger than the critical angle, it will undergo total internal reflection. That's why the phrase \\"light goes from a slow medium to a fast\\" accurately describes when total internal reflection occurs. This concept is used in optical fibers, which uses total internal reflection to guide light along their length. Because no light leaves the fiber (assuming no defects in the material), fiber-optic cables can transmit information over long distances with negligible signal loss. This makes them ideal for telecommunications and internet connections."},{"instruction":"Information: - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial. - An electronic game is a game that employs electronics to create an interactive system with which a player can play. Video game is the most common form today, and for this reason the terms are often mistakenly used synonymously. Other common forms of electronic game include such products as handheld electronic games, standalone systems (e.g. pinball, slot machines, or electro-mechanical arcade games), and exclusively non-visual products (e.g. audio games). - Konami is famous for popular video game series such as \\"Castlevania\\", \\"Contra\\", \\"Dance Dance Revolution\\", \\"Gradius\\", \\"Frogger\\", \\"Suikoden\\", \\"Ganbare Goemon\\", \\"Metal Gear\\", \\"Mirmo\\", \\"Beatmania IIDX\\", \\"Pro Evolution Soccer\\", \\"Boktai\\", \\"Silent Hill\\", \\"Yu-Gi-Oh!\\", and \\"Sound Voltex\\". The 2012 purchase and absorption of Hudson Soft resulted in the addition of several other popular franchises, including \\"Adventure Island\\", \\"Bonk\\", \\"Bloody Roar\\", \\"Bomberman\\", \\"Far East of Eden\\" and \\"Star Soldier\\". Konami is the twentieth-largest game company in the world by revenue. - The first game, named \\"Star Soldier\\", appeared on the MSX and NES in 1986, and the series has continued on various gaming systems. \\"Star Soldier\\" itself has received enhanced remakes for both the GameCube and PlayStation 2 in 2003, and a different remake for the PlayStation Portable in 2005, while the latest installment of the series was released on the Wii as a WiiWare game in 2008. In addition, \\"Super Star Soldier\\", \\"Final Soldier\\", \\"Soldier Blade\\" and \\"Star Parodier\\" have been re-released on the Wii's Virtual Console and on the Japanese PC Engine's Best Collection lineup for the PSP. - Information. The series began in 1997 under the name \\"Beastorizer\\". The game's theme incorporated anthropomorphism, where the player has the ability to transform into a half-human, half-animal creature known as a \\"Zoanthrope\\" (the name came from the clinical term, 'zoanthropy', which is similar to that of lycanthropy, but not just with the mindset of a wolf). The game would appear under the name \\"\\"Bloody Roar\\"\\" when ported to the PlayStation in 1998, which would become the permanent title thereafter. There are three \\"Bloody Roar\\" sequels, plus a game based on a sidestory set between 3 and 4 on the Nintendo GameCube which was later ported to the Xbox. - Silent Scope 3 is a rail shooter video game developed and published by Konami .

The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

It is bordered to the west by the Gulf of Mexico, to the north by Alabama and Georgia, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, and to the south by the Straits of Florida and Cuba. Florida is the 22nd most extensive, the 3rd most populous, and the 8th most densely populated of the U.S. states. Jacksonville is the most populous municipality in the state and is the largest city by area in the contiguous United States. The Miami metropolitan area is Florida's most populous urban area. The city of Tallahassee is the state capital. - Oncidium, abbreviated as Onc. in the horticultural trade, is a genus that contains about 330 species of orchids from the subtribe Oncidiinae of the orchid family (Orchidaceae). As presently conceived (May 2014), it is distributed across much of South America, Central America, Mexico and the West Indies, with one species \\"(O. ensatum)\\" extending into Florida. Common names for plants in this genus include dancing-lady orchid and golden shower orchid. In 2008, Oxfords Annals of Botany labeled the \\"Oncidium\\" alliance \\"grossly polyphyletic.\\" The American Orchid Society labeled this genus a \\"dumping ground.\\" After DNA testing and much debate, a consensus was announced (April 2013) resulting in major taxonomic changes to \\"Oncidium, Gomesa, Odontoglossum, Miltonia,\\" and others. Much of this debate and subsequent housekeeping was initiated by significant research for the scientific publication Genera Orchidacearum Volume 5. As a result, much of the information in this article is now deprecated, but still of great value. One significant change is the move of most Brazilian \\"Oncidium\\" with a fused lateral sepal to the genus \\"Gomesa\\". The Royal Horticultural Society system, the World Checklist of Monocots database at http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/home.do and the American Orchid Society have already updated their databases to reflect most of these changes. Description. This genus was first described by Olof Swartz in 1800 with the orchid \\"Oncidium altissimum\\", which has become the type species. Its name is derived from the Greek word , \\"onkos\\", meaning \\"swelling\\". This refers to the callus at the lower lip. - The Oncidiinae is a subtribe within the Orchidaceae that consists of a number of genera that are closely related. - Odontoglossum, first named in 1816 by Karl Sigismund Kunth, is a genus of about 100 orchids. The scientific name is derived from the Greek words \\"odon\\" (tooth) and \\"glossa\\" (tongue), referring to the two tooth-like calluses on the base of the lip. This genus of cool to cold growing orchids is to be found on open spots in the humid cloud forest at higher elevations from Central- and West South America to Guyana, with most species around the northern Andes. The abbreviation for this genus is Odm. in the horticultural trade. - Olof Peter Swartz (September 21, 1760 September 19, 1818) was a Swedish botanist and taxonomist. He is best known for his taxonomic work and studies into pteridophytes. He attended the University of Uppsala where he studied under Carolus Linnaeus the Younger and received his doctorate in 1781. He first traveled in 1780, to Lapland in the company of several other botanists. In 1783 he sailed for North America and the West Indies, primarily in the area of Jamaica and Hispaniola, to collect botanical specimens. His botanical collection, of an impressive 6000 specimens, is now held by the Swedish Museum of Natural History, as part of the Regnellian herbarium. By 1786 he left for London to prepare his collection. There he met Joseph Banks, who was impressed with his knowledge of Botany. He was offered a position with the British East India Company as a travelling physician, but turned it down, and returned to Sweden in 1787. Ten years later he proposed to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (of which he became a member in 1789) the idea of a permanent travel grant, based on the methods he had seen employed by Banks within the British Empire. In 1791 he became Professor Bergianus at the Academy of Sciences at Stockholm. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1805. - The American Orchid Society is a horticultural society devoted to education, conservation, and research of orchids (plant family Orchidaceae). The organization was founded in 1921, and now has a worldwide membership. The organization publishes a monthly magazine, \\"Orchids, The Bulletin of the American Orchid Society.\\" The society's website American Orchid Society website has the answer to all questions orchid, including helpful, reliable information on how to grow your orchids. - Mexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Covering almost two million square kilometers (over 760,000 sq mi), Mexico is the sixth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent nation in the world. With an estimated population of over 120 million, it is the eleventh most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world while being the second most populous country in Latin America. Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states and a federal district that is also its capital and most populous city. Other metropolises include Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana and León. - The West Indies or Caribbean Basin is a region of the North Atlantic Ocean in the Caribbean, that includes the island nations and surrounding waters of three major archipelagoes: the Greater Antilles, the Lesser Antilles and the Lucayan Archipelago. The term is synonymous with the term \\"Caribbean Basin\\". The region is known as the area running from Florida westward along the Gulf coast, then south along the Mexican coast through Central America and then eastward across the northern coast of South America. Bermuda is also included within the region even though it is in the west-central Atlantic, due to its common cultural history created by European colonization of the region, and in most of the region by the presence of a significant group of African descent. - The Orchidaceae are a diverse and widespread family of flowering plants, with blooms that are often colourful and often fragrant, commonly known as the orchid family. - Colmanara, abbreviated Colm. in the horticultural trade, is the nothogenus comprising intergeneric hybrids between the orchid genera \\"Miltonia\\", \\"Odontoglossum\\" and \\"Oncidium\\" (Milt. x Odm. x Onc.). - Annals of Botany is a monthly peer-reviewed scientific journal, founded in 1887, that publishes research articles, brief communications, and reviews in all areas of botany. The journal is supported and managed by Annals of Botany Company, a non-profit educational charity, and published through Oxford University Press.

He was married to a woman named Judith Richardson for 20 years. After those 20 years, Paul and Judith didn't want to be together anymore, so they separated in 2010. They each lived their own lives after that. One day, Paul found out that Judith had a new boyfriend. He wasn't happy to hear this news, and he went to visit Judith at her house in a place called Didsbury. When he was there, they had a big fight, and Paul did some mean things. He bit Judith's cheek, pushed her against a wall, and broke her glasses. After this, Paul knew he did something wrong, so he went to a place called Manchester magistrates' court to say sorry and admit what he did. This place is where people go to talk about the things they've done wrong and to find out what their punishment will be. The judge there saw that Paul was brave to admit his mistake and decided not to send him to jail. Instead, the judge gave Paul something called a six-month community order. This means that Paul needs to help his community and do good things for six months. He will also need to give the court £85, which is money that helps pay for fixing things that were broken during the fight, like Judith's glasses.

His colleague Phil studied human settlement from 8-10,000 years ago. They were both fascinated by their findings. Which colleague studied that more people settled down in cities? Hint: Human beings invented agriculture about 10,000 years ago. This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, it is evident that Phil, who studied human settlements from 8-10,000 years ago, focused on the period when more people settled down in cities. This conclusion can be drawn from the hint provided, which states that human beings invented agriculture around 10,000 years ago. The development of agriculture was a significant turning point in human history, as it led to a stable and reliable food supply. This allowed people to transition from a nomadic, hunter-gatherer lifestyle to a more settled way of life, as the practice of farming led to the establishment of permanent villages and eventually cities. Since Brad studied much earlier ancient human settlements from 100,000 years ago, the evidence suggests that greater urbanization was not yet a feature of human society during that time. His research would have centered primarily on the lifestyle and practices of early human populations that were still reliant on hunting and gathering for their sustenance. With the advent of agriculture, human societies experienced changes in their birth and death rates. The accessibility to more food and the benefits of a settled life led to increased birth rates. However, the growth of dense human settlements resulted in the spread of diseases, often transmitted from domestic animals, which contributed to higher death rates as well. Despite the rise in both birth and death rates, overall population growth remained slow, but more people began to settle in villages and cities. In conclusion, Phil, who studied human settlements from 8-10,000 years ago, researched the period when more people began to settle down in cities, following the invention of agriculture."},{"instruction":"Given this review: \\"Its ok\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

Answer:","output":"Can't answer."},{"instruction":"Do these questions have the same meaning? Why do many people shake their leg involuntarily, or while thinking? Why do so many people think dolls are creepy? Possible answers: (1). no (2). yes","output":"The answer is (1). No, these questions do not have the same meaning. The first question, \\"Why do many people shake their leg involuntarily, or while thinking?\\" is inquiring about a specific human behavior which is often unintentional. It is asking about the reasons why people might shake their leg when they're not consciously controlling their movement, or when they are deep in thought. The question would likely be answered with explanations about habits, cognitive processes, or possibly even neurological responses. The possible underlying reasons could be due to restless leg syndrome - a neurological disorder that creates an irresistible urge to move the legs, or it could be a subconscious mechanism for releasing nervous energy or stress. Furthermore, leg shaking could be a kind of stimming behavior - repetitive movements that some individuals use for self-stimulation, which is often common in people with neurodevelopmental disorders like ADHD or Autism. The second question, \\"Why do so many people think dolls are creepy?\\" is looking for answers about a largely psychological response to a specific object, namely dolls. It's delving into the area of phobias, fears and, more specifically, an aspect of culture known as uncanny or eerie feelings. What the question essentially asks is why dolls, objects meant for amusement, manage to inspire feelings of fear and discomfort in many people. Dolls can often create what is called an 'uncanny valley' effect - they look human, but not convincingly so, which can cause a sense of unease or discomfort. One theory from the discipline of psychology suggests that this reaction could be a primitive defensive mechanism: humans have evolved to recognize and react with alarm to things that look similar to us but are \\"off\\" in some way as they could indicate illness or danger. In conclusion, while both questions are centered on understanding human behaviors and responses, they are significantly different in focus. One is about physical, often unconscious action (shaking legs), and the other is about emotional and psychological reactions to inanimate objects (dolls). The apprehension to 'creepy' dolls is more psychological and influences our emotion, while the act of shaking legs usually is a physical reaction to various internal and external stimuli."},{"instruction":"Reconstruct a question, answer pair from this explanation: Inches are a measurement of shape, not weight.","output":"Question: Can inches be used to measure weight?

Among his various accomplishments, his work as a singer-songwriter, particularly his 1975 track \\"The Rochdale Cowboy,\\" rose to prominence and thus, he was given the nickname. \\"The Rochdale Cowboy\\" was a humorous song and narrative, with the official title being \\"Rochdale Cowboy Rides Again.\\" In the song, Harding tells a rather comical tale of a man who hails from Rochdale, a town in Greater Manchester, UK, and fantasizes about being a cowboy. Despite its comedic theme, \\"The Rochdale Cowboy\\" became immensely popular and reached number 22 on the UK Singles Chart during its peak moment. This unexpected success influenced the course of Harding's career significantly, as it led to a successful career in both folk singing and comedy. Following the hit, Harding saw an increased demand for his comedic folk songs, playing at folk clubs and festivals throughout the UK. In addition to his comedic songs, he also wrote and performed more serious, poignant folk songs and his concerts generally included a mix of both comedic and serious songs. Furthermore, Mike Harding has authored several books and plays and hosted a long-running folk music show on BBC Radio 2 from 1997 to 2012.

And the answer is?","output":"The Seventh-day Adventist Church is a Christian denomination that observes the Sabbath on Saturday, following the biblical example of seventh-day rest as described in the Holy Bible. This religious group upholds the belief that Saturday, the seventh day of the week according to the Gregorian calendar, should be observed as the day of rest and worship, rather than Sunday. The origin of the Seventh-day Adventist Church can be traced back to the Millerite movement in the United States during the early 19th century. The movement was named after its leader William Miller, a Baptist preacher who predicted the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, based on his interpretation of the prophecies in the Book of Daniel. When Miller's predictions failed, the event known as the \\"Great Disappointment\\" ensued, causing disillusionment among his followers. However, several groups emerged from the ashes of the Millerite movement, and one of them became the foundation of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Officially established in 1863, the Seventh-day Adventist Church not only observes the Sabbath on Saturday but also emphasizes other key beliefs, such as the imminent return of Jesus Christ, the importance of a healthy lifestyle, and adherence to the teachings of the Bible. They follow the Ten Commandments, with a particular focus on the fourth commandment, which states the observance of the Sabbath as a day of rest and worship, sanctified by God in the book of Genesis after he created the world in six days. The practice of Saturday Sabbath observance by the Seventh-day Adventist Church is rooted in the early Christian Church's tradition, which observed the Sabbath as per Jewish custom. However, the majority of Christianity shifted to Sunday observance under the influence of the Roman Empire and its traditions. The Seventh-day Adventist Church continued with the practice of the original Sabbath observance as they believe that it is a direct commandment from God. Today, the Seventh-day Adventist Church is a large international community with millions of members across the globe. They are known for their commitment to education, healthcare, and humanitarian aid, as well as their dedication to evangelism and sharing their beliefs with others. Their practice of observing the Sabbath on Saturday underscores their devotion to adhering to what they believe are the original teachings of the Bible and God's plan for his followers."},{"instruction":"Choose from options: Determine if the sentence is true based on the text below: There was much weeping.

Because of the strong emotional fallout after the wedding, you might ask family and close friends to assist you in handling these matters. Regardless, the burden for cancelling everything and retrieving deposits (if possible) should be shared by the would-be bride and groom. Once the wedding has been fully cancelled, you and your ex need to discuss what will happen to the engagement ring. This decision varies among couples. The general rule of thumb is whoever decided to call off the wedding didn’t hold up their end of the bargain, and therefore, doesn’t get the ring. One exception to this rule involves rings of extraordinary value or family heirlooms. In such cases, the ring should be returned to the family it belongs to. If your home is surrounded with reminders of your failed engagement and wedding (if not relationship), put them away - at least for the time being. Ask friends to help you toss out any wedding-related items such as invitations. Donate any wedding decor that could be used for other events, or try to resell them to recoup costs.

It is unclear what initial musical education he received; his father, Georg Händel, was not a music lover, and did not at first appreciate or encourage his son's precocious talents. Nevertheless, by the age of ten Handel had become an accomplished organist; his playing in the royal chapel at Weissenfels, where his half-brother Karl was in the service of the Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels, impressed the duke, who persuaded Händel senior that the boy should have a proper musical education. As a result, Handel began formal study under Friedrich Zachow, the organist of the Lutheran church at Halle.Handel's biographer Jonathan Keates writes that: \\"From [Zachow] Handel learned not only a great deal about the line and shape of an aria, about strong, adventurous bass lines and solid choral writing, but also about those delicacies of instrumental colouring which he later perfected in his own style\\". Handel's musical development also benefited from an early and lasting friendship with Georg Philipp Telemann, whom he met in 1700. In February 1702 Handel enrolled at the University of Halle, perhaps intending to study law. In March he took up the post of organist at Halle's Calvinist cathedral (Domkirche), a prestigious appointment for one so young and indicative of his burgeoning musical reputation in the city.At some time, possibly in late 1702 or early 1703, Handel visited Berlin, where his father had held an honorary post as physician to the elector who, in 1701, had become the Prussian king Frederick I. In Berlin Handel first experienced Italian opera, and may have met the Italian composers Giovanni Bononcini and Attilio Ariosti, who were writing operas for Frederick's court. The king heard of Handel's abilities, and wanted him to train as a future court composer, but Handel's horizons had been broadened by his sojourn in Berlin and he was developing his own ideas for his future.

Explanation:","output":"No, the statement \\"Billy Ray Cyrus won critical acclaim for playing the flute.\\" is not true. The reason for this answer can be explained in a simple step-by-step manner: 1. Billy Ray Cyrus is an American musician, singer, and actor. He is primarily known for his work in country music. 2. He gained fame with his song \\"Achy Breaky Heart,\\" which became his signature hit, and for his successful album \\"Some Gave All.\\" 3. Billy Ray Cyrus has received awards and accolades throughout his career, but they are mostly related to his singing and acting performances, not specifically for playing the flute. 4. In his known body of work and public appearances, there is no evidence to suggest that he has played the flute or received critical acclaim for doing so. Based on these points, we can conclude that the statement is not true. It is important to note that the lack of evidence for Billy Ray Cyrus's flute playing abilities or critical acclaim in that area is the primary reason for answering \\"no\\" to the statement's truth."},{"instruction":"Q:Information: - Bukit Batok (Chinese: , Tamil: ), often abbreviated as Bt Batok, is a planning area and matured residential town straddling along the eastern boundary of the West Region of Singapore.

These preparations may contain a combination of milk powder, sugar, cocoa powder, and other essential ingredients. The resulting product, known as milk crumb, is often an intermediate step in producing milk chocolate that has a consistent texture and a rich, pleasing taste. The request for packings of greater than 2 kg suggests that this product is intended for industrial or large-scale use. Bulk packaging in larger quantities is beneficial for chocolate manufacturers and businesses that produce significant amounts of milk chocolate. Some advantages of purchasing milk crumb preparations in packings of greater than 2 kg include: 1. Cost-effective: Purchasing chocolate milk crumb preparations in bulk can significantly lower the price per kilogram, allowing manufacturers to save money on production costs. 2. Consistent quality: Purchasing a large package of chocolate milk crumb helps ensure consistent quality across different batches, leading to a more uniform final product. 3. Efficient production: Having a larger package of milk crumb on hand enables the chocolate manufacturer to produce more batches without having to reorder the product frequently, ultimately enhancing production efficiency. 4. Storage convenience: Chocolate milk crumb preparations in packings of more than 2 kg are usually vacuum-packed or packed in moisture-proof bags or containers, protecting the product from humidity and contamination. This packaging format ensures that the product will be safely stored until it is needed. 5. Sustainability: Using larger packages can also help minimize waste by reducing the amount of packaging materials required for smaller quantities, which is beneficial for both the environment and cost reduction. To produce chocolate milk crumb preparations in packings of more than 2 kg, the following steps are generally followed: 1. Mixing and blending ingredients: Milk powder, sugar, cocoa powder, and any additional ingredients are blended together to create a uniform mixture. The specific ratios of the components may vary depending on the desired final product. 2. Heating and caramelization: The blended mixture is heated in a controlled environment, which allows the sugar to caramelize and react with the milk proteins. This process develops the desired flavor and aroma of the milk crumb. 3. Cooling and pulverizing: The resulting caramelized mixture is cooled and then processed into small crumbs using specialized equipment. This step prepares the milk crumb for incorporation into chocolate products. 4. Packaging: The milk crumb is weighed and packaged into appropriate quantities greater than 2 kg, ensuring it is properly sealed to preserve its freshness and quality. By following these general guidelines, chocolate milk crumb preparations in packings of greater than 2 kg can be efficiently produced and distributed to chocolate manufacturers, ultimately contributing to the creation of delicious milk chocolate products."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this summary: Find a word with meaning to you. Use a pop culture or literary reference. Get inspiration from common products or things. Pick a random name. Use your own name (or your initials). Make up a new word.","output":"Title: From Life's Ordinary to the Extraordinary: Discovering Personalized Words with Profound Meaning Introduction: In the age of digital communication and constant exchange of information, it can seem like all the words we use have lost their spark and value. They fade into the background of our daily lives, passing by almost unnoticed. But what if we could find or create words that truly resonate with us, that hold inherent meaning and can act as a representation of who we are? From pop culture and literary references to random names and even our own initials, there is a world of inspiration out there waiting to be untapped. Let's explore how! Step 1: Drawing from Pop Culture or Literary References A great starting point for discovering words that carry personal meaning is to reflect on the pop culture and literary references that have profoundly impacted your life. Whether it was a spellbinding movie, a thought-provoking book or even a catchy song, think past the surface and dive into the deeper symbolism and significance of those works. As you do, you're likely to find special words and phrases that reach beyond their original context and strike a chord with your own beliefs and experiences. Step 2: Seeking Inspiration from Common Products or Things It may sound unconventional, but taking a closer look at the products and items that surround us daily can open up a trove of potential words. The names or labels of everyday objects often contain interesting or lesser-known terms, which can be repurposed or combined to create a truly unique word. By doing so, you can inject creativity into your language, imbuing even mundane items with new and exciting layers of meaning. Step 3: Picking a Random Name Sometimes, the simplest solution can be the most rewarding. When all else fails, taking a leap into the unknown by selecting a random name or word generator can be the catalyst for finding a word that holds profound personal significance. Give destiny a chance – let the universe guide you toward an unexpected gem that you connect with on an emotional and intellectual level. Step 4: Embracing Your Own Name or Initials Our own names and initials are deeply tied to our identity and can serve as a source of inspiration for finding a word that truly represents us. By taking a closer look at the components of your name and its history, or by blending your initials into a single, harmonious expression, you can leverage your own background and experiences to create a word imbibed with your essence. Step 5: Inventing a New Word Ultimately, the search for a distinctive and meaningful word may lead you to the ultimate act of creativity: inventing a brand new word from scratch. The process may require careful thought, self-analyzing, and consideration of etymology to ensure it fulfills the criteria of representing who you are. But, the end result will be a linguistic embodiment of your personality, values, and aspirations – a custom-made word that serves as an extension of your identity. Conclusion: In a world full of words, it's easy to let them lose their magic. But by opening your mind to the possibilities and taking inspiration from every facet of life, you can rediscover the power of language and find (or create) words imbued with personal meaning. Be it a pop culture reference, random name, or a word of your own making, allow these words to serve as a testament to your uniqueness and the beauty of self-expression."},{"instruction":"By. Victoria Woollaston. Last week’s emergency surveillance legislation may have sounded like something out of George Orwell’s novel 1984, but was cited as yet another real-life example of states trying to control their citizens. It’s been 65 years since Orwell described a fictional dystopian world of surveillance and manipulation by so-called Big Brother, and experts claim over the next decade this fiction is about to become fact. The Net Threats report from Pew Research Centre details how, by 2025, the web will be governed by a system heavily influenced by governments, large corporations, and security services all trying to control our behaviours. Scroll down for video. More than 1,400 experts were surveyed for The Net Threats report by the Pew Research Centre. The report details how, by 2025, the web will be governed by a system heavily influenced by governments, large corporations, and security services (stock image pictured) This could mean what we buy, read, watch and share will be restricted, and our surfing history stored for future use. More than 1,400 experts, including analysts, editors and professors, were canvassed for their opinion. The Pew Centre report discovered four major threats facing the web:. Actions by nation-states to maintain. security and political control will lead to more blocking, filtering and. segmentation of the internet. Trust. will be weakened, as a result of revelations about government and. corporate surveillance - and will likely increase surveillance in the. future. Commercial. pressures and influences will affect the flow of information, and make. the web less open - a threat campaigners for net neutrality already fear. following debates about internet fast lanes. Efforts to fix the TMI (too much information) problem might over-compensate and actually thwart content sharing. According to their responses, they believe actions by nation-states to maintain security and political control will lead to more blocking, filtering and segmentation of the internet. Trust will be weakened, as a result of revelations about government and corporate surveillance - and this will likely increase surveillance in the future. And commercial pressures will affect the flow of information, and make the web less open - a threat campaigners for net neutrality already fear following debates over internet fast lanes. Paul Saffo, managing director at Discern Analytics and consulting associate professor at Stanford University, said that by 2025 'the pressures to balkanise the global internet will continue and create new uncertainties. 'Governments will become more skilled at blocking access to unwelcome sites.’ Dave Burstein, editor of Fast Net News, added: ‘Governments worldwide are looking for more power over the net, especially within their own countries. ‘Britain, for example, has just determined that ISPs block sites the government considers ‘terrorist’ or otherwise dangerous. In 1984, Winston Smith is told to control the flow of opinion using the government's language Newspeak (still from the 1984 Michael Radford film adaption is pictured). Experts feel this is already happening, in places such as North Korea, and predict that, by 2025, it will become more common place, and spread across the west too. 'This will grow. There will usually be ways to circumvent the obstruction, but most people won’t bother.’ The main criticism of such plans, and the main issue surrounding the data obtained, is its impact on privacy. Raymond Plzak, from The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, said: ‘The inconsistent protection of privacy, whether private information is voluntarily provided or not, as well as the inconsistent protection against exploitation will continue to be the bane of connected environment.’ NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden (pictured) has condemned the UK's plans for an emergency surveillance bill, in what he described 'as increased powers of intrusion' He continued that if local, regional, national and international private and public sector companies fail to join forces and accept a universal way of handling these privacy issues, sharing data and being connected will become more limited by 2025. This will also have an impact on preventing content being shared around the world. In 1984, character Winston Smith is told to edit reports and control the flow of opinion using the government's language Newspeak, and experts feel this is already happening, in places such as North Korea. And they predict that, by 2025, this will become more common place, and widespread across the West too. ‘The increased Balkanisation of the internet is a possible outcome of the [Edward] Snowden revelations, as people seek to develop systems that are less accessible by the NSA, GCHQ and so on,’ said Professor Kate Crawford, a research scientist at the MIT Center for Civic Media. ‘Meanwhile, the dominant content companies may seek ever more rigorous ways to prevent the flow of copyright content within and across borders.’ NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden recently condemned the UK's plans for an emergency surveillance bill, voicing concerns about the lack of public debate, fear-mongering and what he described 'as increased powers of intrusion'. Earlier this year, the Federal Communications Commission in the U.S pushed forward with plans to let internet service providers charge content companies for faster and more reliable delivery of their traffic to users. The controversial 'fast lane' rules received heavy criticism from many companies that do business online, along with open internet advocates. Under the plans for priority usage, Netflix for example, could pay extra to use fast lanes to get the maximum amount of bandwith to its customers. Earlier this year, the Federal Communications Commission pushed forward with plans to let internet service providers charge content companies, such as Netflix (pictured), for faster delivery of their traffic to users. The Pew report said such commercialisation of the internet is the biggest challenge to its growth by 2025. At the heart of net neutrality is an open internet in which all data being sent from websites to customers is treated the same, regardless of size or destination. All this traffic is given the same priority along the same lanes and no site is given preferential treatment.

Experts, including Glenn Edens, director of research in networking, security, and distributed systems at PARC said: ‘Network operators’ desire to monetise their assets to the detriment of progress represents the biggest potential problem.' A post-doctoral researcher, who was not named in the report, continued: ‘We are seeing an increase in walled gardens created by giants like Facebook and Apple. 'Commercialisation of the internet, paradoxically, is the biggest challenge to the growth of the Internet. Communication networks’ lobbying against net neutrality is the biggest example of this.’ Earlier today, the Internet. Association wrote to the Federal Communications Commission claiming that broadband providers could turn the internet into 'a. pay-for-priority platform more closely resembling cable television than. today's onternet.' The. group, which represents Google, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, and others, urged the Commission to protect its open and neutral. architecture, which is the force behind the internet's success. PJ Rey, a PhD candidate in sociology at the University of Maryland, added that by 2025: ‘It is very possible we will see the principle of net neutrality undermined. ‘In a political paradigm where money equals political speech so much hinges on how much ISPs and content providers are willing and able to spend on defending their competing interests. 'Unfortunately, the interests of everyday users count for very little.’ While a former chair of an IETF working group concluded : 'Corporate influence on the political process will largely eliminate the public’s freedom to do as they please on the internet. 'I would like to see the internet come to be regarded as a public utility, as broadcast spectrum was, but I think the concentration of power is too extreme for that degree of freedom to happen.'

The administration is concerned about the impact of bullying on students' academic success, emotional well-being, and overall school climate. In the last few months, there has been a rise in cases of cyberbullying and physical bullying, as well as an increased rate of absenteeism related to bullying incidents. Teachers, parents, and students have expressed their concerns about addressing the issue effectively. With the situation escalating, the school administration is considering implementing a multifaceted program to tackle the bullying problem and to create a more supportive and inclusive environment for every student. Hypothesis: Implementing a comprehensive anti-bullying program in the high school, which includes educational workshops for students, teachers, and parents, strict enforcement of a clearly outlined anti-bullying policy, a support system for victims, and a restorative justice approach, will lead to a significant decrease in bullying incidents, improved mental health and academic performance of the students, and a more positive school climate. To test this hypothesis, the following steps should be taken: 1. Gather baseline data on the number of reported bullying incidents, overall school climate, and students' mental health and academic performance. 2. Introduce a clearly defined anti-bullying policy that is consistently enforced by the administration. This policy should outline consequences for those found guilty of bullying and a process to report incidents without fear of retaliation. 3. Establish a series of workshops for students, teachers, and parents to educate them on recognizing different forms of bullying, understanding its consequences, and learning how to intervene effectively. 4. Identify and train a team of teachers, counselors, and peer mediators to provide support and guidance to the victims of bullying. 5. Implement a restorative justice approach that aims to facilitate communication between bullies and their victims, hold the bullies accountable for their actions, and help them understand the impact of their behavior. 6. Regularly survey students, teachers, and parents to monitor the effectiveness of the program, gain feedback, and make necessary adjustments. 7. Compare the post-implementation data on bullying incidents, school climate, and students' mental health and academic performance to the baseline data collected at the start of the program. If the hypothesis is correct, one would expect to observe a significant reduction in the number of bullying incidents, improved mental health and academic performance among students, and a more supportive and inclusive school climate after the implementation of the comprehensive anti-bullying program."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Question: Who are saved by the timely arrival of Chunk and Sloth?

Only cite sources that directly inform the topic you want to address. If you’re unsure about which sources are relevant, or which types of sources you should be gathering, talk with your instructor. So, if you’re writing about Death of a Salesman, an article about symbolism in Arthur Miller’s plays would be useful. But, an article about the average cost of Midwestern hotels in the 1940s would be irrelevant. If you’re writing a scholarship essay, double-check the instructions to clarify what types of sources you’re allowed to use. Especially when writing a college application essay, it’s crucial that you stay within the word count. Cut extra words and information that isn’t strictly necessary. Remove adverbs, adjectives, and lengthy verb phrases, as well as cliches and generalizations. A common cliche you might find in an essay is a statement like, \\"I'm the hardest working student at my school.\\" For example, this sentence is too verbose: “I have been a relentlessly stellar student throughout my entire high school career since I am a seriously dedicated reader and thoroughly apply myself to every assignment I receive in class.” Shortened, it could read: “I was a stellar student throughout my high school career since I was a dedicated reader and applied myself to every assignment I received.” Writing in the active voice will help you keep your sentences succinct and to the point. Write sentences that express an idea clearly and directly. To keep your sentences brief, begin most sentences with the subject (the person or thing performing an action) and the action they perform, rather than describing how an object is acted upon. Avoid writing something like, “Willie Loman can be seen as having achieved little through his life because he is not respected by his sons and is not valued by his co-workers.” Instead, write, “Arthur Miller shows readers that Willie’s life accomplishments have amounted to little. Willie’s sons do not look up to him, and his co-workers treat him without respect.” If you’re passionate about your essay topic, you may feel inclined to include multiple arguments relating to multiple facets of the topic. However, this will almost certainly put you over the word count. To avoid this problem, include only the best evidence supporting your strongest claim. For example, if you’re trying to prove that WWII pulled the USA out of the Great Depression, focus strictly on an economic argument. Avoid bringing in other, less convincing topics. For example, don’t dedicate a paragraph to discussing how much it cost the USA to build fighter jets in 1944.

Put a deliberately fake PIN on the back of your Year Book so the thief will try to enter that PIN in and the ATM will confiscate the card.","output":"As an AI assistant, I will assess both solutions in terms of naive physics reasoning: (I). Put a deliberately fake PIN on the back of your debit card so the thief will try to enter that PIN in and the ATM will confiscate the card. Step 1: Write a fake PIN on the back of the debit card. Reasoning: If someone steals the card, they might think the written PIN is legitimate and attempt to use it. Step 2: Thief attempts to use the fake PIN at an ATM. Reasoning: This is assuming the thief will act upon the written PIN rather than trying to crack the correct PIN using other methods. Step 3: ATM confiscates the card due to incorrect PIN entries. Reasoning: After multiple failed attempts to enter the correct PIN, ATMs are programmed to retain the card in order to prevent unauthorized usage. (II). Put a deliberately fake PIN on the back of your Year Book so the thief will try to enter that PIN in and the ATM will confiscate the card. Step 1: Write a fake PIN on the back of your Year Book. Reasoning: The logic is that if a thief acquires both your debit card and Year Book, they may attempt to use the fake PIN noted in the Year Book. Step 2: Thief attempts to use the fake PIN at an ATM. Reasoning: This assumes the thief finds the Year Book, connects it to the debit card, and acts on the false PIN without considering other ways to crack the correct PIN. Step 3: ATM confiscates the card due to incorrect PIN entries. Reasoning: Similar to solution (I), after multiple incorrect PIN attempts, the ATM should retain the card to prevent fraudulent use. Comparing both solutions, solution (I) seems more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning. In solution (I), the fake PIN is directly associated with the debit card, meaning a thief is more likely to find and use it.

G. S. Crawford, then working as the archaeological officer for the Ordnance Survey, listed the Coldrum Stones alongside the other Medway Megaliths. In 1926, the Coldrum Stones were given to The National Trust, which dedicated it as a memorial to the Kentish prehistorian Benjamin Harrison. A plaque was erected to mark this, which erroneously termed the monument a stone circle; in 1953, the archaeologist Leslie Grinsell expressed the view that \\"it is hoped that this error may be rectified in the near future\\". Still owned by the Trust, the site is open to visitors all year round, free of charge. On their website, the Trust advises visitors to look for \\"stunning views from the top of the barrow\\". John H. Evans characterised the site as \\"the most impressive\\" of the Medway Megaliths, while Grinsell described it as \\"the finest and most complete\\" of the group.Among the Pagans who use the Coldrum Stones for their ritual activities, there is general satisfaction with the Trust's management of the site, although some frustration at the poor access for disabled visitors. A patch of scorched earth exists on the grass in the centre of the monument, perhaps used by Pagans as well as non-Pagans, and the Trust warden responsible for the site has decided to leave it there rather than seeding it over, in order to encourage any who do light fires to do so in the same spot rather than nearer to the stones themselves.

He had spent years maintaining control of his darker urges, integrating with Chicago's society, and generally trying to act like a human being. This was no easy task for someone with supernatural abilities and a dark past, but it was necessary for his survival and to protect those he cared about. As a member of the White Court of vampires, his primary concern was concealing his true nature from the humans he interacted with daily. My protagonist, let's call him John, had worked hard to establish a new life in Chicago and to distance himself from the negative aspects of his vampiric heritage. His life was a delicate balancing act, as he needed to keep his kinship a secret from a number of different groups: the White Court who controlled the city's supernatural underworld, the human society he was part of, and the Council who were a powerful force within the supernatural community. The Council was a major concern for John because they had the power to expose and destroy him if they ever found out about his presence in their territory. They would have used him as a pawn to bring down the White Court, and in doing so, they would have placed him and his loved ones in great danger. The same went for the vampires who might use him to get closer to the Council. John had to be very cautious about the relationships he formed and the friendships he cultivated, always wary that his secret might be discovered. This constant state of vigilance was a heavy burden for John, but he managed to bear it while maintaining the facade of a normal human being. He formed friendships, found love, and even built a career in Chicago. He became a valuable member of that society, using his abilities to help others in need without revealing his true nature. Over time, his resolve grew stronger, and he was determined to never let his darker instincts control him again. However, nothing lasts forever, and eventually, something terrible happened to John that shattered his carefully constructed world. He was attacked by an unknown supernatural force, and in the process of defending himself and his friends, he was forced to reveal his secret to someone close to him. This exposed him not only to the Council, but also to other supernatural factions within the city who sought to exploit or eliminate him. The revelation of his secret also shattered the trust and relationships he had built over the years with those who knew him only as a human. Despite the adversity he faced, John did not give up. Understanding the gravity of the situation, he realized that his only chance of survival was to face his fears and confront his past demons. He stopped trying to blend into human society and instead embraced his true nature as a member of the White Court. This was a difficult transition, as he needed to learn how to navigate life without hiding who he was and face the many supernatural challenges that lay ahead. In doing so, John reconnected with his White Court siblings and began to forge alliances with other supernatural beings in the city who were willing to aid him in his battles against the forces that sought his destruction. It was during this time that he discovered that whoever had attacked him was part of a larger plot by an unknown enemy who wanted to control not only the White Court but all of the supernatural factions within Chicago. Together, John and his newfound allies fought back against their enemies and strove to protect not only their own, but also the innocent humans who were caught in the crossfire. Throughout his journey, John learned that it was possible to accept his vampiric heritage without succumbing to the darkness within him. Only by embracing his true self - both the light and the darkness - could he hope to protect his loved ones, vanquish his enemies, and ultimately find peace with his dual identity."},{"instruction":"I heard that Robin saw Taylor all the time and asked if he would like to carpool.

The man himself is sitting in the back of a black chauffeured Mercedes-Benz, gliding effortlessly down the 405, relaxed, legs akimbo, wearing boots, gray jeans, a white V-neck, and sunglasses. On one knee is balanced a bottle of kombucha, the flavor of which, when combined with the packet of chewing tobacco tucked into his lower lip, can only be guessed at. On the other, there's a brown leather journal with a turquoise clasp—a place to record stray thoughts, doodles, visual diagrams of future roles, and whatever else pops into his head. \\"A man should always have his diary on him,\\" Matthew McConaughey says, grinning, borrowing from Oscar Wilde. \\"That way he's guaranteed to always have something incredible to read.\\" The car is bearing McConaughey from Los Angeles to San Diego, where he will make a surprise appearance at Comic-Con on behalf of Interstellar, the dimension-bending Christopher Nolan epic he stars in this month. Afterward he and his family will board a private plane for Massachusetts, where he will shoot Gus Van Sant's latest, The Sea of Trees. Both are the kind of role McConaughey wouldn't have sniffed only a few years ago. The story of this transformation is repeated so often it's taken on the quality of an American parable: Preternaturally talented young man gets lost in a maze of easy, interchangeable romantic comedies before suddenly seeing the light and getting serious. An Oscar, Emmy nominations, a whole new status follow. Lo, he is risen. The first sign that perhaps the story isn't quite so simple may have come in McConaughey's Oscar speech for Dallas Buyers Club, in every way the kind of Very Serious Movie designed to breed smug and sentimental showboating. Instead, it was old-school McConaughey—part flirt, part hippie preacher, all brash and cheerful self-regard. So much for killing the past. We even got an \\"All right, all right, all right.\\" In person, it's easy to feel that McConaughey contains if not multitudes, then at least enough facets to defy easy categorization. He's a joyful talker with a gift for conversation that is much like his gift for acting: a talent for being extraordinarily present and engaged, no matter how banal or repetitive the circumstances. Credit that for the fact that, at any given moment, at least one of those supposedly disposable romantic comedies is airing somewhere in the cable universe. And for the fact that he's more than game to kick the tires of the Parable of McConaughey to see what's true, what's false, and what lies in between. · · · How do you like the word McConaissance? It's a cool word. It sounds good. It's got a good meter. It's almost like you had to have one, just so we could call it that. When you say it, it's like, \\"I don't know what that is, but it sounds good.\\" You've been famous since your early twenties. Did you feel like it was a problem, having your image set at such a young age? I've never had fears that I was stuck in one thing. I'm sure we're going to talk about the years when I was in romantic comedies and I was seen as the guy who was on the beach, running around shirtless. I did that. Damn right that was me. I wasn't scared like, \\"Oh God, I'm going to be stuck here.\\" But I was like, I understand at some point that that is in italics now. So I said, \\"You know what? I'm not going to be openly presenting that for a while. I'm going to un-brand.\\" But there was truth in the italics? Well, it has two parts. One was the myth that was branded and created. Second, yeah, it's me. I did Fool's Gold in Australia, had a summer in Malibu, and made a surfer film—basically, when you edit those all together, it was one continuous ninety-degree day on the beach without a shirt. But also, I worked hard to live in Malibu, California. I'm going to the beach! I'm gonna go surfing! No, I don't want to wear a shirt. I want to get a tan and feel the sun on my bones. And it's Tuesday. You're recording it? Good for you. Do you have a name for that character? The \\"All right, all right\\" guy? Do you ever refer to him in the third person? No. Does your wife? Like, \\"Hey, let's have a little less of so-and-so...\\"? No, no. It's not... There's no demarcation. And you've never felt the need to pretend you weren't having a good time? Fuck no. Fuck that. I'm not going to apologize for enjoying what I do. Since you bring it up, is there work in the romantic comedies that you're proud of? Absolutely. These things aren't easy. What's hard is to make them look easy. Those kinds of movies are what they are. They get pooh-poohed by critics. They get pooh-poohed by actors themselves. And in a way I get it, but in other ways it's completely unfair. There's a buoyancy you need to make them work. I believe I gave them buoyancy. And some of the shoots were very difficult, with me trying to fight for the balls on the guy. What do you mean? What's a romantic comedy? Boy meets girl. They get together. Something happens. Girl takes off. Boy chases girl. They get back together. The end. A lot of times the male is somewhat emasculated, meaning he has to crawl back and say, \\"I'm nothing without you. If you don't take me back, I'm nothing.\\" And I was always like, \\"What girl wants that guy?\\" I've got no problem saying, \\"I'm sorry. You want to give this another shot?\\" But I've got to come back with some integrity—even if it's on a moped with a veil on my head. Look, I'm happy if you think I \\"cruised through\\" those. I did my work. I guess it would be an asshole question to ask you to name them all. Wedding Planner, Failure to Launch, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, Fool's Gold, Ghosts of Girlfriends Past... There's five. And the women that were in them. So, Jennifer Lopez, Sarah Jessica Parker, Kate Hudson, Kate, Jennifer. So the other part of the myth, that this new phase is in direct opposition to that part of your career, is that fake, too? It may make a more interesting narrative and a dramatic punch, but it's not true. Did there come a time when I picked up a script and was like, \\"God, I feel like I could do this [part] tomorrow\\"? Yes. That's when I made a calculation to say, \\"I don't want to do those right now.\\" I thought, \\"I love harder, I cry harder, I laugh harder in my real life than I do in my work. I've got things in my life every single day, risks that I'm taking that are scaring me. Why is my work not scaring me?\\" It does seem as though you were far more creative in creating this bohemian, idiosyncratic life offscreen than you were on-screen. And I was like, \\"Thank God!\\" I congratulated myself on being that way instead of the other way around. But I also said, \\"I want to get more from my career than I'm getting right now.\\" I talked to my agent. I talked to my wife. I talked to my moneyman and said, \\"Hey, I may not work for a while. We good?\\" So I went away for two years. How did that feel? I had anxious moments. I had nights waking up. Mind you, I had a secret weapon. I had my first kid about to come home. What do you mean by \\"secret weapon\\"? Never is a man more of a man than when he is the father of a newborn. Whatever decisions you make in the first six months of becoming a father, double down on them. I mean, you're meeting the Courier. You're meeting the Shepherd, the Future Prince. You immediately have something you don't have to think about. You know what's important. Bam! And the clarity of that is like, \\"Whew.\\" I definitely got more selfish. And at the same time, I think I got more compassionate, which don't always go together, you know? Were you scared of becoming a father? It's the one thing I've always wanted to be. I knew when I was 8 years old. I mean, I wanted to be things like the Washington Redskins running back and all that stuff, but the one thing I knew I wanted to be was a father. I understood that was why my dad was making me say \\"Yes, sir\\" and \\"Yes, ma'am\\" to elders. You know, \\"I'm not on par with the adults yet. There's places to go.\\" Do your kids say sir and ma'am? Yeah. We just like it. We like the Mr. and Mrs. and the please and thank you's. We take a version of that southern thing. More important, you were a Redskins fan growing up in Texas? What the hell was that about? Two things. First: 4 years old, watching Westerns, I always rooted for the Indians. Second, my favorite food was hamburgers. The Redskins had a linebacker named Chris Hanburger. That's all it took? When you're 4 years old, that's all it takes. I got a Redskins hat in my bag right now. What do you think about the calls for the team to change its name? Man, it's twofold. What interests me is how quickly it got pushed into the social consciousness. We were all fine with it since the 1930s, and all of a sudden we go, \\"No, gotta change it\\"? It seems like when the first levee breaks, everybody gets on board. I know a lot of Native Americans don't have a problem with it, but they're not going to say, \\"No, we really want the name.\\" That's not how they're going to use their pulpit. It's like my feeling about gun control: \\"I get it. You have the right to have guns. But look, let's forget that right. Let's forget the pleasure you get safely on your range, because it's in the wrong hands in other places.\\" But as a fan, it would hurt you a little to see the logo gone? It's not going to hurt me. It's just... I love the emblem. I dig it. It gives me a little fire and some oomph. But now that it's in the court of public opinion, it's going to change. I wish it wouldn't, but it will. Okay, so you go on hiatus. What was the first thing that made you feel like you were on the right track? I think it was Killer Joe, which took me a few reads before I found the meter of Tracy Letts's writing, and all of a sudden I thought it was hilarious. Then Steve Soderbergh called and pitched me about Magic Mike. Did you see that role as a chance to play off the myth? Not \\"play off\\" the myth: Take the myth to the Smithsonian. Get it bronzed. What I was saying was, \\"In case you didn't know, I've always been in on the joke.\\" Was it a kind of funeral for that character? Shit no. It was just me raising the stakes. Saying, \\"Yeah, and...\\" And mind you, these are all lightning-rod characters. Dallas in Magic Mike is a lightning rod. Mark Hanna in The Wolf of Wall Street is a lightning rod. You know: Soothsayers. Preachers. Barnum & Bailey. Poets. So there's a musicality to them. It's like this church we go to when we're in New Orleans, the Sunlight Baptist church. It's a whole different rhythm and way of speaking. \\"I'm talking about the Wave Maker! The Prime Mooovah!\\" It's not the white-collar prayers I grew up with. Does your family go to church every Sunday? Yeah. In Texas. It's non-denominational. It's based in the faith that Jesus is the son of God, that he died for our sins, but many different denominations come in. Was that a return for you, or had you been going all along? As soon as we had children, I was like, \\"You know what? That was important to my childhood.\\" Even if it was just for the ritual of giving an hour and a half on Sunday to yourself, to pray and to think about others, even if you're tired or whatever. I noticed how much I missed it and needed it. It's a time for me to take inventory of my last week, to look at what's in the future and say my thank-you's and think about what I can work on to do better. When you talk about God, do you imagine him as... The Prrime Moovah! The Waave Maker! But it's an identifiable presence? Someone who can hear what you're saying? Yes. And somebody who can help answer my questions. Someone who has a hand in all of this miracle we call life, which I believe is a miracle. But, see, at the same time, I completely believe in evolution. Do you believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ?

Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes from a neighboring city. Because of this order, Bobby has dramatically increased the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season right now, so his use of fertilizer is currently low. Over the past month there has been a large amount of rain falling on both Bobby and Kenny's farms. and a hint : Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Please answer this question : Who will ultimately cause less oxygen to be used up in the ponds near their farm? The answer is:","output":"Kenny will ultimately cause less oxygen to be used up in the ponds near his farm. This is because Kenny is currently using a low amount of fertilizer for his tomato farm, which is not in season. In contrast, Bobby has increased his fertilizer usage to meet the demands of his large potato order. When it rains, the fertilizer dissolves into the soil, and the runoff carries it into nearby bodies of water, such as ponds, rivers, and oceans. The nitrogen in the fertilizer causes algae to grow rapidly, using up carbon dioxide in the water. Once the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue and consume oxygen in the process. This leads to a decrease in oxygen levels in the water, creating a \\"dead zone\\" where little to no aquatic life can thrive. Since Kenny is using less fertilizer, there will be less nitrogen in the runoff, resulting in less algae growth and oxygen consumption in the ponds near his farm. Therefore, Kenny will cause less oxygen to be used up in the ponds near his farm compared to Bobby, who is using more fertilizer."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What's the last name of the person whose wife the Queen seduces? ? Jimmy and Fletch are two friends living in London, experiencing life problems. Jimmy is dumped by his unscrupulous girlfriend, and Fletch is fired from his job as a clown for punching a child. They decide to escape their woes and hike to a remote village in Norfolk that they find on an old map. As they arrive at a pub in the village, with Jimmy upset about Fletch destroying his phone, they see a number of attractive foreign female history students leaving. Hoping to find more beautiful women inside, they are greeted by a morose crowd of men and approached by a seemingly crazed vicar who believes Jimmy is a long lost descendant of a local vampire slayer.

Article: Ever since Canadian psychiatrist Michael R. Phillips, who works in China, released his report saying China's suicide rate from 1995 to 1999 reached 0.023 percent, the country has been ranked among those with the highest suicide rates in the world. But Jing Jun, a professor of sociology in Tsinghua University, challenges that view and presents the true picture through his nationwide research. Jing and his students took one year to set up the first national database on suicide rate to grasp the overall trend of suicides in China. They collected data from the Health Statistics Annuals of the World Health Organization (sample size 10 million), and the country's Health Statistics Annuals (which cover 100 million people). The database covers 23 years, from 1987 to 2009. Jing calculates the suicide rate in China based on these data. Though the suicide rate was comparatively high in the early years, his study shows it has dropped in recent years, as opposed to the ascending trend in the rest of the world. According to Jing's calculation, China's suicide rate had dropped to about 0.01 percent in 2004. In 2009, the figure dropped further to 0.007 percent, which is rather low compared with the global rate of 0.016 percent. Even if the \\"missing\\" suicides were added, China's suicide rate in 2009 would still be below 0.008 percent.[:Zxxk.Com] Jing has found that one of the main reasons why the suicide rate has dropped was the steady and big decline in the number of suicides committed by rural women. In the early years, researchers generally agreed that the suicide rate among Chinese women was higher than among men, which is pretty rare in the rest the world. But the suicide rate among Chinese women, especially in rural areas, has declined remarkably in recent years. In fact, it is almost equal to that of Chinese men. As a sociologist, Jing regards suicide as a social issue, and believes improvement of social policies will reduce the suicide rate even further. More people's lives can be saved if the authorities adjust to... Question: In Jing's opinion, what should be done to reduce the suicide? Answer: A:","output":"In Jing's opinion, to reduce the suicide rate, improvement of social policies should be prioritized. He believes that more people's lives can be saved if the authorities adjust and implement better social policies that address the underlying issues contributing to suicide."},{"instruction":"News article: ‘Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2’ brings the funny and the feels Like many a sequel to a slam-bang, much-liked mega-hit, “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” isn’t quite as much fun, not quite as clever, not quite as fresh as the original — but it still packs a bright and shiny and sweet punch. Any big-budget superhero movie willing to place the opening action sequence to soft-focus background while a baby tree jams to ELO’s “Mr. Blue Sky” is all right by me. The original “Guardians” (2014) was like the class clown of superhero movies, if the class clown also had a strong heart and a supple brain lurking beneath the goofball exterior. It was cool and snarky and warm and fuzzy at the same time. It was one of those movies you know you’re going to see again and enjoy just as much the second time around. “Guardians of the Galaxy 2” follows the same recipe, from the return of that lovable ragtag band of universe-saviors to the constant bickering and bantering to the “Mix Tape” soundtrack of pop-rock hits from the 1970s. (And of course, in the tradition of just about every sequel ever, we’re introduced to new, important characters as well.) I’ve always liked the corny, AM-friendly, storytelling hit “Brandy (You’re a Fine Girl)” by Looking Glass. It’s put to good use here, just to the brink of overkill. I’m good with not hearing “Brandy (You’re a Fine Girl)” by Looking Glass until about 2020. One of the most impressive special effects in this candy-colored, explosion-riddled, 3-D extravaganza is the appearance of a young Kurt Russell in a 1980 prelude at the top of the story, in which Russell’s character of Ego is romancing Meredith Quill, who will become the mother of Peter Quill/Star-Lord. (Reports say a combination of CGI and makeup and other tricks of the trade gave us the young Kurt. I’d rather not know. It’s just pretty amazing to see what appears to be a 30ish Kurt Russell, awesome ’80s haircut flowing in the breeze.) They’re zipping down the highway, clearly in love, singing along to “Brandy (You’re a Fine Girl)” by Looking Glass. And then Ego shows Meredith a strange orb glowing in the woods, and he talks about his master plan, and … Cut to 34 years later, with the Guardians of the Galaxy gearing up for battle. In addition to Chris Pratt’s wisecracking but noble Peter, there’s Zoe Saldana’s brave (and green) but emotionally cautious Gamora; Dave Bautista’s hulking and ferocious but rather dim and goofy Drax; the sly and outwardly selfish Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), and the adorable Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel). The Guardians get mixed up in all kinds of dangerous intergalactic hijinks interspersed with sticky-sweet sentimental moments. Songs such as Fleetwood Mac’s “The Chain” and Cat Stevens’ “Father and Son” set the tone (and in some cases hammer home the point). At times the special effects are wondrous and cool; other times, they’re so cheesy and obviously CGI one can’t help but wonder if that’s the effect director James Gunn and the army of special effects wizards were trying to achieve. (Scenes on various planets when oozing blue goop spreads across landscapes, apparently killing thousands of humans and other human-like species, are straight out of a B-movie.) Michael Rooker has one of the best roles in the movie as Yondu, the infamous space pirate with the blue skin and startlingly horrible teeth and red, Mohawk-like device atop his head. Yondu’s the worst! Or is he? Either way, things liven up quite a bit whenever Yondu starts controlling the deadliest arrow ever by whistling. (Man, Yondu better hope nobody ever stuffs a bunch of crackers down his throat at the wrong moment and quells the whole whistling thing.) There’s a whole lot of family dynamic at play, with the vengeful and deeply warped Nebula (Karen Gillan) intent on killing her sister Gamora; Drax establishing some kind of weird sibling kinship with the nice but creepy Mantis (Pom Klementieff), who if anything is even more socially awkward than Drax; and the major unresolved relationship in the story, between Peter and his dad, a celestial being that calls himself Ego and rules a planet (and maybe more than just one planet) of his own creation. Chris Pratt and Kurt Russell are terrific together as a father and son who have a lot of baggage to deal with, even in a superhero universe where it sometimes feels as if MOST fathers and sons are dealing with a lot of baggage. As the story gets deeper and darker and more convoluted, it’s hard to care about the particulars of the plot — especially when the screenplay is constantly reminding us not to take it too seriously, what with the references to David Hasselhoff and “Cheers” and Mary Poppins and other pop-culture touchstones. Oh, and we haven’t even talked about Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki), a golden-skinned warrior princess who leads an army of supposedly perfect creations who are rather terrible at remote-control bombing missions. And yet even with all the silliness and all the snarkiness, the Guardians can put a lump in your throat when someone suffers a serious setback, or someone does a solid and risks everything to save someone else. We look forward to the next adventure, with the hopes the Awesome Mix Tape will be the soundtrack for something just a little smarter, a little less bloated, a little more focused. ★★★ Marvel Studios presents a film written and directed by James Gunn. Rated PG-13 (for sequences of sci-fi action and violence, language, and brief suggestive content). Running time: 136 minutes. Opens Friday at local theaters. ||||| Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 Director James Gunn narrates a sequence from the film featuring Zoe Saldana and Karen Gillan. Starring Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, Michael Rooker, Kurt Russell, Karen Gillan, Pom Klementieff, Elizabeth Debicki and Sylvester Stallone. Written and directed by James Gunn. Opens Friday at major theatres. 136 minutes. PG Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 misses a trick with its “awesome mix” of cheesy 1970s pop songs: Andrea True’s 1976 disco hit “More, More, More” isn’t on the soundtrack. It would have been perfect for a movie deep-diving into franchise formula, by larding in more characters, more plot lines, more explosions and more banter, as if returning writer/director James Gunn is playing cosmic pinball rather than telling a story. Article Continued Below Just like almost every other blockbuster sequel, in other words, although this property originally sought to blow up convention. It arrived in 2014 smirking at Marvel Comics superhero angst, as its bickering misfits fought intergalactic badness for kicks and cash. But like a visit from amusing friends who stay a bit longer than expected, it’s easy to forgive the indulgence. Vol. 2 sees E.T.-abducted Earthling Peter “Star-Lord” Quill (Chris Pratt), blade-wielding warrior Gamora (Zoe Saldana), tattooed muscleman Drax (Dave Bautista), hybrid handyman Rocket Raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) and adorable offshoot Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) confronting not just an expanded universe of villains but also more complicated family and romantic connections. They’ll be joined, with mixed motives and outcomes both comic and dramatic, by Gamora’s angry adopted sister Nebula (Karen Gillan), insect-faced alien Mantis (Pom Klementieff) and blue-skinned Ravagers bandit Yondu (Michael Rooker), the latter in a significantly enlarged role from the first Guardians, where he played Peter’s crime mentor, surrogate father and nemesis all in one. All of the above has already been revealed in multiple trailers, along with the supposed shocker that Peter’s long-gone birth father is suddenly back in his son’s life. He’s a celestial planet builder aptly called Ego, played by Kurt Russell. He wants to make up for not being there when Peter was grieving his mother’s cancer death and being kidnapped by aliens. Frome left, Zoe Saldana, Karen Gillan, Chris Pratt, Dave Bautista and Rocket, voiced by Bradley Cooper, in a scene from, Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 ( Disney-Marvel via AP ) The movie opens on Earth in 1980 with the man now called Ego and Peter’s mom-to-be Meredith (Laura Haddock) as they cruise a Missouri highway with the soft-rock hit “Brandy (You’re a Fine Girl)” on the radio, immediately establishing itself as this movie’s main ear worm. Jump ahead 34 years and Peter and the other Guardians are fighting a giant space thingie, in a colourfully rendered battle set to Electric Light Orchestra’s “Mr. Blue Sky.” They’re also irritating a superior celestial race called the Sovereign, who look like angry Oscar statues and who quickly develop a murderous grudge against the Guardians. Elizabeth Debicki is wonderfully pompous as Ayesha, their diva of a leader. And so it goes with this pinball game of a movie. The Guardians ricochet from one confrontation to another, some involving galaxy-saving and others just affairs of the heart — such as whether Peter and Gamora are ever going to acknowledge this love thing they feel coming on. Article Continued Below Fortunately, Gunn is savvy enough not to let the proceedings or the characters get too serious or too sappy. He punctures Ego’s balloon in one scene by having him interrupt his bloviating with a need to urinate. In another, Ego explains to Peter why “Brandy” is Earth’s finest song ever, which is like that moment in Dumb and Dumber when Jim Carrey says the Beatles were a huge influence on the Monkees. So even if the gags go on too long — the David Hasselhoff and Cheers references are just plain goofy — and the cheeseball soundtrack isn’t quite the retro joy it was three years ago, these Guardians are still worth hanging with, if only to marvel at the imaginative characters and production design. To those who disagree, I quote the knuckleheaded but weirdly profound Drax: “You Earthlings have hang-ups.” ||||| Disney/Marvel What an oddball corner of the Marvel space-time continuum the Guardians of the Galaxy occupy! They can do quantum leaps between interstellar dimensions while bopping to carefree ’70s dance-pop on a cassette player. They battle big, bad aliens while name-checking Mary Poppins and David Hasselhoff, and discuss their complicated interpersonal relationships through references to Sam and Diane from “Cheers.” Their high-flying dogfights happen amid audiovisual arcade game nods to Galaga and Pac-Man. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 ★★★★ out of 4 stars Rating: PG-13 for sequences of sci-fi action and violence, language and brief suggestive content. You don’t get more back to the future than this wholehearted embrace of sci-fi and golden oldies nostalgia. No franchise is so gifted at exploiting the popularity of superhero movies while satirizing the genre. “Deadpool” was too over the R-rated top. “Ant-Man” was too small-scale for non-geeks. “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” is just right. It’s hyperbolic nonsense wrapped in the colors of a neon rainbow, bouncing from one artfully wacky scenario to the next. Here it’s sleekly futuristic, there it’s older than mud. It’s the galaxy’s silliest thrill show. The film continues the threads we saw formed in the Guardians’ initial appearance as small-time mercenaries turned halfhearted defenders of the universe. We know that Peter Quill, aka Star Lord, is a cocky swashbuckler with a neurotic core, the kind of fixable bad boy Chris Pratt was born to play. Zoe Saldana is his female counterpart as Gamora, a hard-fighting green gladiatrix with an ornery streak and a tendency to tell the girlfriend-craving Peter to drop the mushy stuff because such a thing as romance between their species could never happen for real anyway. Dave Bautista’s Drax is a comically plain-spoken goliath, now trying to understand humor and laughing at every wrong moment. Vin Diesel has his deep bass tuned to a squeak in voicing Groot, the massive walking extraterrestrial tree that was felled and returned to life as a cute little humanoid twig, while Rocket the genetically enhanced raccoon (spoken by Bradley Cooper) remains as abrasive as an electric grinder. His interest in once again staving off Armageddon is purely financial: “We’re really gonna be able to jack up our prices if we’re two-time Galaxy savers!” The threats arrive on jumbled story lines. A society of gold-colored tech nerds attack the Guardians for running off with a bag of priceless light bulbs. Gamora’s jealous sister Nebula (Karen Gillan) arrives to prove she’s the family’s most efficient assassin by killing her sibling. A space army of Ravagers led by blue-skinned Yondu (Michael Rooker), who snatched young, orphaned Peter from Earth and became his shady papa figure, comes after them to settle scores of their own. Meanwhile, in a nearby subplot, Peter meets Ego (Kurt Russell), the universal life force that actually created him. Peter and Ego have a heart-to-heart while interpreting the lyrics to Cat Stevens’ “Father and Son,” giving the maudlin song a feeling of real pathos. Drax (Dave Bautista) and Gamora (Zoe Saldana) flying high in \\"Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2.\\" Written and directed again with tongue-in-cheek flair by James Gunn (of “Slither” and “Super” fame), this is first-rate goofy escapism. While the mentality and much of the dialogue is adolescent again, this time the adventure includes some interesting concepts and emotional undercurrents, adding a neat bonus of heart. Russell gives a nuanced turn as Ego reveals where the root word for egomania came from. Russell moves through Ego’s lifelong neglect of Peter, to his amiable warmth, and then his mercurial storming as if Ego were a classic alcoholic father. Of course there are oooh-and-aaah-worthy special effects, but they’re not the entire story. “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” is touching and bawdy, violent and hilarious, glamorous and goofy. It’s as close as comic book movies come to being all things to all people. ||||| Correction: A previous version on this review incorrectly described the planet of Berhert. The story has been updated. From left, Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Nebula (Karen Gillan), Star-Lord/Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), Drax (Dave Bautista) and Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) reprise their roles in Marvel’s “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.” It’s more expansive, more beautiful, funnier and nuttier than the first film — and it features another great soundtrack. (Film Frame/Marvel Studios) With a title slyly evoking the music-compilation aesthetic embodied by its 1970s-hit-heavy sound track, “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” manages to re-create the formula of self-aware, snarky humor and unapologetic action that made the original 2014 film such a pleasing package of ear and eye candy, while at the same time avoiding the sophomore slump of sequels that risk audience fatigue by repeating rather than building on what worked the first time. The new film is more expansive, more beautiful, funnier, nuttier and — this is the most difficult trick for any comic-book movie to pull off — more touching than the first film. The team of five quarrelsome superheroes returns intact, or mostly intact, with the barely articulate tree-man Groot having been reduced, at the end of the last film, to the sapling-size Baby Groot, still voiced by Vin Diesel, but as if he were exhaling helium from a party balloon. And the film kicks off like a party, with an opening credit sequence featuring Groot shaking his adorably twiggy booty to Electric Light Orchestra’s “Mr. Blue Sky” on a boombox as Chris Pratt’s Peter “Star-Lord” Quill, Zoe Saldana’s Gamora, Dave Bautista’s Drax and Bradley Cooper’s CGI raccoon Rocket do battle with an alien starbeast intent on attacking the Anulax batteries they have been hired to protect. Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel). (Film Frame/Marvel Studios) The Guardians may be mercenaries, but they’re far from all business, occasionally pausing to queue up one of Peter’s favorite tracks as a sonic backdrop to the impending action. (The filmmakers, led by returning director and co-writer James Gunn, also oblige, as in the film’s tour-de-force set piece: a scene featuring mass killing, set to “Come a Little Bit Closer” by Jay and the Americans, as a flying arrow on autopilot — the signature weapon of Michael Rooker’s Yondu the Ravager — pierces through multiple bodies over the course of the tonally inappropriate yet perfectly curated song.) That’s not the only dazzling visual, in this sharply ­choreographed and ravishingly designed comedic space opera. One scene, featuring Gamora’s green body, silhouetted against a red landscape, is so painterly pretty, a la “Avatar’s” moon of Pandora, that my eyes hurt — in a good way. The real story doesn’t get underway until our ­ethically tarnished heroes — having stolen some of the same batteries they had previously been guarding against theft — crash-land on the planet of Berhert. There, Peter meets his long-lost father, the appro­priately named Ego (Kurt Russell), leading to what appears to be a tender family reunion — and striking a tone that will characterize the rest of the film, much of which takes place on Ego’s home planet. Family — the kind that is defined by blood, and the kind for whom you will spill blood, even without sharing DNA — is the theme of this tale, which manages to evoke genuine, deep feelings, along with belly laughs. Much of the film’s humor has to do with stupidity resulting from efforts to look cool. One villain character, who has given himself the moniker Taserface (Chris Sullivan of “This Is Us”), is mocked repeatedly for the ­ineffectuality of his meant-to-be-threatening handle. In another scene, Peter compares Yondu — his surrogate father, who raised him as a child — to Mary ­Poppins, as Yondu descends from the sky, like the famous nanny, ­holding his arrow aloft like her umbrella. “Mary Poppins? Is he cool?” asks the clueless Yondu. Yes, Mary Poppins is cool, Peter reassures him, with an implied wink to the audience. Winks, of a more literal variety, are a recurring sight gag, as the cynical Rocket tries, unsuccessfully, to signal his sarcastic digs, by repeatedly batting the one eye that everyone can see. “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” suffers from no such fatal exertions. Gunn, whose film includes more world building than the original movie — and the introduction of a charming new character, the buglike empath Mantis (Pom Klementieff) — delivers backstory, story and the promise of stories to come with the breezy, effortless skill of a master raconteur. This is not a superhero movie in the ponderous mold of DC Comics’s “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,” or even its fellow Marvel movies centering on Captain America and the Avengers. Falling somewhere ­between the sardonicism of the “Iron Man” trilogy and the self-aware meta-movie high jinks of the R-rated yuk-fest “Deadpool,” “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” is a toe-tapping, eye-popping indication that summer is here, and that it might not be so bad after all. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"\\"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\\" is basically the sequel to the first \\"Guardians of the Galaxy,\\" but with a lot more fun and laughs. Just like in the first movie, there's a group of funny, weird characters who have to save the universe. Oh, and there's plenty of awesome music from the 1970s! The movie follows the same pattern as the first one, with all the lovable characters coming back and even some new ones introduced. There's action, silliness, and a bit of emotion thrown in, making it a great movie to watch even if it's not as fresh as the first one. There's also some neat special effects, like making one of the actors look like his younger self. The movie is filled with colorful explosions and high-tech hijinks in space. Plus, there's a lot of bickering and arguing among the characters, which is funny to watch. One of the main storylines is about Peter, a character played by Chris Pratt, finding his long-lost father. There's a lot of references to old music, movies, and TV shows too.

Mick Whelan, General Secretary of Aslef, said union members would now be balloted on the proposals. The result of the vote will be announced on 3 April. Mr Whelan said the new terms \\"offer solutions to our concerns, as well as restoring the confidence of all parties, and the travelling public\\". GTR director Andy Bindon said he was pleased with the deal and hoped it would end \\"an extraordinarily difficult period for passengers, staff and the regional economy\\". Aslef has been in dispute with GTR over driver-only operated (DOO) trains, and the firm's decision to turn guards into on-board supervisors and give responsibility for opening and closing carriage doors to drivers. The union's members have taken six days of strike action in recent months which have crippled Southern services. It also banned overtime which caused huge disruption to Southern's 300,000 passengers. In February, Aslef members rejected a deal with Southern by a majority of 54.1% in a similar ballot. It came after 11 days of talks between the rail operator and the union. Just days before, talks between the Rail Maritime and Transport Workers union (RMT) and Southern rail broke down without any deal agreement. Mick Cash, leader of the RMT, which has also been taking strike action against Southern, said: \\"RMT has not seen the detail of the proposed outline agreement between GTR and Aslef and we are of course requesting a full copy as it goes to the heart of our disputes with the company. \\"In the meantime RMT is pressing yet again for urgent talks with the company in our guards and drivers' disputes.\\" This is not a done deal - yet. Last month, drivers unexpectedly rejected a deal brokered by their own union. The margin wasn't large - 55% against - and the two sides have been talking ever since to find a way of bringing a majority of the members back on board. We've not been told the details of the revised agreement. But it's likely to include further improvements to CCTV monitoring systems drivers use when closing the train doors.

Massenet returned to Paris in 1866. He made a living by teaching the piano and publishing songs, piano pieces and orchestral suites, all in the popular style of the day. Prix de Rome winners were sometimes invited by the Opéra-Comique in Paris to compose a work for performance there. At Thomas's instigation, Massenet was commissioned to write a one-act opéra comique, La grand'tante, presented in April 1867. At around the same time he composed a Requiem, which has not survived. In 1868 he met Georges Hartmann, who became his publisher and was his mentor for twenty-five years; Hartmann's journalistic contacts did much to promote his protégé's reputation.In October 1866 Massenet and Ninon were married; their only child, Juliette, was born in 1868. Massenet's musical career was briefly interrupted by the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, during which he served as a volunteer in the National Guard alongside his friend Bizet. He found the war so \\"utterly terrible\\" that he refused to write about it in his memoirs. He and his family were trapped in the Siege of Paris but managed to get out before the horrors of the Paris Commune began; the family stayed for some months in Bayonne, in southwestern France.After order was restored, Massenet returned to Paris where he completed his first large-scale stage work, an opéra comique in four acts, Don César de Bazan (Paris, 1872). It was a failure, but in 1873 he succeeded with his incidental music to Leconte de Lisle's tragedy Les Érinnyes and with the dramatic oratorio, Marie-Magdeleine, both of which were performed at the Théâtre de l'Odéon. His reputation as a composer was growing, but at this stage he earned most of his income from teaching, giving lessons for six hours a day. The answer to this question is:","output":"The answer to this question is: Don César de Bazan.

Joined by up to 5,000 local rebels, they had some initial success, inflicting a humiliating defeat on the British in Castlebar and setting up a short-lived \\"Irish Republic\\" with John Moore as president of one of its provinces, Connacht. This sparked some supportive uprisings in Longford and Westmeath which were quickly defeated, and the main force was defeated at the battle of Ballinamuck, in County Longford, on 8 September 1798. The Irish Republic had only lasted twelve days from its declaration of independence to its collapse. The French troops who surrendered were repatriated to France in exchange for British prisoners of war, but hundreds of the captured Irish rebels were executed. This episode of the 1798 Rebellion became a major event in the heritage and collective memory of the West of Ireland and was commonly known in Irish as Bliain na bhFrancach and in English as \\"The Year of the French\\". On 12 October 1798, a larger French force consisting of 3,000 men, and including Wolfe Tone himself, attempted to land in County Donegal near Lough Swilly. They were intercepted by a larger Royal Navy squadron, and finally surrendered after a three-hour battle without ever landing in Ireland. Wolfe Tone was tried by court-martial in Dublin and found guilty. He asked for death by firing squad, but when this was refused, Tone cheated the hangman by slitting his own throat in prison on 12 November, and died a week later.

This occurs when the nervous system sends an electrical signal, called an action potential, to the muscle fiber through a specialized nerve cell called a motor neuron. The motor neuron's axon terminal makes contact with the muscle fiber at a junction known as the neuromuscular junction. At this junction, the action potential reaches the nerve terminal, causing the release of a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine (ACh). The acetylcholine molecules diffuse across the synaptic cleft and bind to the receptors on the muscle fiber's membrane, which subsequently results in the generation of an action potential within the muscle fiber. This action potential initiates the series of steps involving proteins and chemicals that release energy, leading to the contraction or relaxation of the muscle and ultimately the movement of the bones connected to the muscle."},{"instruction":"BEWARE.

There were several important Ottoman victories in the early years of the war, such as the Battle of Gallipoli and the Siege of Kut. The Arab Revolt which began in 1916 turned the tide against the Ottomans on the Middle Eastern front, where they initially seemed to have the upper hand during the first two years of the war. The Armistice of Mudros was signed on 30 October 1918, and set the partition of the Ottoman Empire under the terms of the Treaty of Sèvres. This treaty, as designed in the conference of London, allowed the Sultan to retain his position and title. The occupation of Constantinople and İzmir led to the establishment of a Turkish national movement, which won the Turkish War of Independence (1919–22) under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal (later given the surname \\"Atatürk\\"). The sultanate was abolished on 1 November 1922, and the last sultan, Mehmed VI (reigned 1918–22), left the country on 17 November 1922. The caliphate was abolished on 3 March 1924.

AD Joe Alleva botched the Miles situation last year, and a source tells FOX Sports that it’s about 50-50 on whether he’ll still be the LSU AD in 2017. The good news for LSU and its potential job candidates is that there’s plenty of time to try to figure out the power structure. The two most obvious candidates are FSU’s Jimbo Fisher and Houston’s Tom Herman. Fisher worked at LSU under Nick Saban and has been a favorite of the power brokers down there, but last winter he passed on LSU’s interest. Would Fisher be more tempted this time around? His buyout is, relatively speaking, manageable at 5 million. Yeah, the division he’s in now -- the ACC Atlantic -- is tougher than it was a just a year ago, thanks to the emergence of Louisville and Clemson's continued to ascent, but I doubt that’s enough to impact his thought process. After all, it’s not like the SEC West is any cakewalk. Herman’s buyout is half of Fisher’s. The 41-year-old is the hottest name in coaching these days. He’s 17-1 at Houston. He played a big role in Ohio State winning the national title and beating Alabama along the way to do it. He’s a brilliant offensive mind, who seems like he would be a good fit in any cultural setting. Herman’s a Southern California native and would be an ideal candidate IF USC opted to make yet another coaching change. It’s still only six games into the Clay Helton regime (he’s 1-5), but it’s been a very rocky start and the AD who hired him, Pat Haden, is gone. My hunch is IF USC does force Helton out, they’d have to have a candidate set to be announced, as opposed to blindly wading into another coaching search, which they’ve flailed at three times in the past six years. USC is as good as any college job in the country. You have great facilities and sit in an extremely fertile recruiting base, where the majority of kids grow up wanting to be Trojans. You’re the heavyweight brand in the conference, and second isn’t even close. In the SEC, LSU is an elite job, but you’re still going to have to battle hard for every recruit. But the USC job is not open, and if you’re a coaching candidate, you have to sort out exactly what’s available now, not what might come open a year from now. If you’re Herman, you’ll have some good options, starting with staying at Houston, where he’s making about 3 million a year and has a shot at much more if UH gets into the Big 12. Herman is also a former Texas graduate assistant and there’s still a chance the UT job could come open. Perhaps the thought of someone else hiring Herman away might prompt UT folks to put more pressure on Charlie Strong if the Longhorns don’t develop fast enough. A few other options to keep in mind for LSU are UNC’s Larry Fedora and TCU’s Gary Patterson. Fedora’s a Texas native, who I think would love the chance to coach at LSU. He’s done a good job at UNC and did very well not far from LSU while he was at Southern Miss. Patterson has worked wonders at TCU, but my sense is he may be too entrenched there in Fort Worth. Heck, they’re gonna have a statue of him up in front of those much-improved facilities. Would LSU consider Alabama OC Lane Kiffin, the former Tennessee and USC head coach? It’s possible, especially if the Tide rolls to another national title. Kiffin has done an outstanding job helping Nick Saban win another national title and seems to get the offense going regardless of having to break in three new QBs the past three seasons. I know Kiffin has learned a lot from his time under Saban and would be a more organized head man than he was at his previous stops. Kiffin’s a wildcard in this mix. An even bigger wildcard for the LSU vacancy is the interim Ed Orgeron. He’s a Louisiana native and one-time LSU lineman. Orgeron’s arguably the best recruiter in the country. He struggled mightily at Ole Miss but clearly learned from his mistakes -- and from Kiffin’s -- and proved to be a much different style of leader when he got the interim job at USC almost exactly three years ago to this day. Orgeron didn’t coach the team the same way as he did the D-line, like he did when he was in Oxford. Instead, he was more like the charismatic, supportive guy he was on the recruiting trail. It worked, as he went 6-2 at USC despite having almost no depth on a probation-strapped team. He even defeated No. 4 Stanford despite having only one sub on his defense for the entire game. Orgeron has a shot to get this job IF he can get this team to play like many folks thought they would going into the season. That would mean knocking off Alabama. It’s a big if, but this is still a very talented team, especially on defense. The biggest difference I see between this situation and the one Orgeron inherited at USC three years ago was back then many Trojan players weren’t exactly sad to see Kiffin go. Orgeron provided a much-needed jolt of energy. At LSU, Miles was beloved by his players, so this transition dynamic, at least on the surface, isn’t the same. * The biggest surprise of the first month of the season for me is Wisconsin. The Badgers have knocked off two Top 10 teams, and their latest win at Michigan State was a blowout. Pretty impressive, especially considering the Badgers were starting a freshman QB in Alex Hornibrook, who leads the nation in completion percentage on third downs at 78 percent. Hornibrook was 6-for-6 against MSU on third-and-10 situations. The clutch vibe carries over more to his second half stat line where he’s completing 73 percent as compared to 59 percent in the first half. Hornibrook is a Pennsylvania native who had committed to Wisconsin coach Paul Chryst when he was the head coach at Pitt. The 6-foot-4, 215-pounder switched his pledge to Wisconsin in spite of a lot of other scholarship QBs on the Badgers' depth chart after Chryst got the job in Madison. Asked to explain why Hornibrook seems to respond so well to pressure situations, Chryst told FOX Sports, “The best thing that he’s been doing is he’s been able to be himself. It’s nothing magical. He’s just a really good worker and he prepares very well. He’s impressed me all along. Some guys just have it and some don’t. He’s always been a good passer and very accurate and he loves football.\\" Perhaps the most amazing part of the Badgers' fast start is that it comes in spite of the team being ranked 12th in the Big Ten in yards per carry at just 3.94. Chryst was surprised when I noted that fact but said he knows the Badgers need to get better at running the ball. This week Hornibrook and the Badgers face an even bigger test in Michigan, which leads the nation in TFLs (44) and is tied for No. 1 in sacks (17). The Wolverines' opponents are also converting on just 6-of-50 third down attempts -- 12 percent -- lowest in the nation. “It’s a really good scheme with really good players,” Chryst said of Don Brown’s defense. \\"They’re aggressive and have guys (in the secondary) that allow them to be aggressive, and they’re playing with confidence.\\" * Nebraska is worth keeping an eye on this year. The Huskers have good receivers and some good talent on defense. Another reason why: QB Tommy Armstrong, a talented guy who has been plagued by mistakes throughout his career. He threw 22 TDs last year but also had 16 picks. This year, his TD-INT ratio is 8-1. * Only one other team in the country (Michigan) has scored more than Louisville and its star QB Lamar Jackson’s 25 total TDs (rushing and passing) this year, and that’s more than seven FBS teams had in all of 2015. * Pretty impressive that WVU can lose Yodny Cajuste, a potential high draft pick, early in their opener and still have surrendered only one sack thus far this season. Last season the Mountaineers ranked No. 93 in fewest sacks allowed. Dana Holgorsen has talked about how much the addition of veteran O-line coach Joe Wickline would be to help out Ron Crook and it seems to be really paying off. * LSU is not the only coaching vacancy out there. FIU canned Ron Turner. Butch Davis is an intriguing option. After all he’s very tight with AD Pete Garcia. If Davis doesn’t want it, FIU still will have a lot of strong candidates. * I looked up teams that have the worst Red Zone defense in the country and was surprised to see some strong programs down there. FSU is No. 122, allowing 15 TDs on 18 trips, while Michigan State and Louisville were tied at No. 117 (8 of 10). * Stat of the Week: As we reported earlier in the day, Notre Dame fired defensive coordinator Brian VanGorder with defensive analyst Greg Hudson taking over the D. After the Irish lost to Duke to drop to 1-3, the move was hardly a stunner. The Irish have allowed five plays of 60 yards or longer (worst in the country). What’s really eye-popping about that is ND surrendered only five such plays in the 2012, 2013 and 2014 seasons combined.","output":"This news article is talking about who might be the new head coach for LSU's football team, since the old coach, Les Miles, was fired. The article thinks there are two main choices: Jimbo Fisher, who is currently the coach for FSU, and Tom Herman, who is currently the coach for Houston. The article also mentions other possible choices, such as Larry Fedora from UNC, Gary Patterson from TCU, or even Lane Kiffin from Alabama. There's also Ed Orgeron, who is currently the temporary coach for LSU; if he does a really good job, he might be able to stay as the permanent coach.

Question: Why is bistro called like that? Context: In addition to the classical restaurants, Paris has several other kinds of traditional eating places. The café arrived in Paris in the 17th century, when the beverage was first brought from Turkey, and by the 18th century Parisian cafés were centres of the city's political and cultural life. The Cafe Procope on the Left Bank dates from this period. In the 20th century, the cafés of the Left Bank, especially Café de la Rotonde and Le Dôme Café in Montparnasse and Café de Flore and Les Deux Magots on Boulevard Saint Germain, all still in business, were important meeting places for painters, writers and philosophers. A bistro is a type of eating place loosely defined as a neighbourhood restaurant with a modest decor and prices and a regular clientele and a congenial atmosphere. Its name is said to have come in 1814 from the Russian soldiers who occupied the city; \\"bistro\\" means \\"quickly\\" in Russian, and they wanted their meals served rapidly so they could get back their encampment. Real bistros are increasingly rare in Paris, due to rising costs, competition from cheaper ethnic restaurants, and different eating habits of Parisian diners. A brasserie originally was a tavern located next to a brewery, which served beer and food at any hour. Beginning with the Paris Exposition of 1867; it became a popular kind of restaurant which featured beer and other beverages served by young women in the national costume associated with the beverage, particular German costumes for beer. Now brasseries, like cafés, serve food and drinks throughout the day. The answer is:","output":"A bistro is called like that because its name is said to have come in 1814 from the Russian soldiers who occupied Paris. \\"Bistro\\" means \\"quickly\\" in Russian, and the soldiers wanted their meals served rapidly so they could get back to their encampment.

It is important to consider that the premise and hypothesis are two distinct statements, and there is no direct correlation between the two that proves the hypothesis true if the premise is true. In the premise, it is mentioned that the Shiraito Falls are located due south of Motosu-ko and are a great location for a picnic. However, this information does not offer any insight into the size of the falls or their ranking among the largest waterfalls in Japan. Furthermore, the hypothesis asserts that the Shiraito Falls are one of the largest waterfalls in Japan. To validate this claim, one would need additional information regarding the size and ranking of waterfalls in Japan, including the width, height, volume, and any other relevant factors that contribute to their size or popularity. Comparing these factors against those of the Shiraito Falls could potentially verify the hypothesis. In conclusion, without any additional information linking the two statements or validating the hypothesis separately, it is not possible to establish that if the premise is true, the hypothesis is also true.

He recently got interested in ants and their behaviors. To that end, he studied a group of ants, which be labeled as case A. To compare ants with other ant like creatures he studied another hymenopteran group, which he labeled as case B. Moreover, he noticed two distinct trails made by the ants, trail A or trail B. Trail A was followed by many ants, but trail B was abandoned by them. Would case B show less or more developed pheromone chemical signal than case A? Hint: Ants communicate with each other using pheromones, sounds, and touch. The use of pheromones as chemical signals is more developed in ants, such as the red harvester ant, than in other hymenopteran groups. Like other insects, ants perceive smells with their long, thin, and mobile antennae. The paired antennae provide information about the direction and intensity of scents. Since most ants live on the ground, they use the soil surface to leave pheromone trails that may be followed by other ants. In species that forage in groups, a forager that finds food marks a trail on the way back to the colony; this trail is followed by other ants, these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony. When the food source is exhausted, no new trails are marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates. This behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment. For instance, when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle, the foragers leave the path to explore new routes. If an ant is successful, it leaves a new trail marking the shortest route on its return. Successful trails are followed by more ants, reinforcing better routes and gradually identifying the best path.Ants use pheromones for more than just making trails. A crushed ant emits an alarm pheromone that sends nearby ants into an attack frenzy and attracts more ants from farther away. Several ant species even use \\"propaganda pheromones\\" to confuse enemy ants and make them fight among themselves. Pheromones are produced by a wide range of structures including Dufour's glands, poison glands and glands on the hindgut, pygidium, rectum, sternum, and hind tibia. Pheromones also are exchanged, mixed with food, and passed by trophallaxis, transferring information within the colony. This allows other ants to detect what task group (e.g., foraging or nest maintenance) other colony members belong to. In ant species with queen castes, when the dominant queen stops producing a specific pheromone, workers begin to...

Solve -41 - 31 = -12*b for b.","output":"To solve the equation -41 - 31 = -12*b for b, you should follow these steps: 1. First, simplify the left side of the equation so that it becomes easier to deal with. The operation -41 - 31 equals -72, therefore the equation becomes -72 = -12*b. 2. Next, you want to isolate 'b'. To do this, you have to divide both sides of the equation by -12. 3. When you divide -72 by -12, the result is 6. And on the right side of the equation, -12b divided by -12 just leaves b. Therefore, the solution to the equation becomes b = 6. The reason we divide both sides of the equation by the same number is to keep the equation balanced, while allowing us to isolate the variable. This gives us the solution. Now we can substitute b = 6 into the original equation to check if it holds true: -41 - 31 = -12*6 => -72 = -72 which is True. Therefore, b = 6 is the correct solution to this equation."},{"instruction":"Here is a dialogue: Jane: this has honestly been the worst breakup i've ever had :-( Jane: thanks for theing there for me <3 Stephanie: that's what friends are for Stephanie: you should come out with me tonight for a ocuple of dirinks?

Additionally, discuss how these changes contributed to the growth of urbanization, shifts in workforce demographics, and the rise of labor movements and legislative reforms to improve working conditions.\\" To answer this question, you would need to provide details on key technological advancements during the Industrial Revolution, the minds behind these innovations, and their far-reaching effects on the world. You could start by mentioning the following innovations: 1. The Spinning Jenny, invented by James Hargreaves, revolutionized the textile industry by allowing workers to spin multiple threads of yarn simultaneously. This dramatically increased production efficiency, but it also displaced skilled spinners and led to a growing demand for unskilled laborers. 2. The steam engine, developed by Thomas Newcomen and later improved by James Watt, played a significant role in facilitating transport, trade, and industry. Steam engines powered locomotives and steamships, allowing for faster and more efficient transportation of goods and people. The steam engine also enabled new manufacturing processes that led to increased productivity in factories. 3. The power loom, invented by Edmund Cartwright, automated the process of weaving, significantly increasing textile production. This development contributed to the growth of the textile industry, but it also resulted in many skilled weavers losing their jobs. These innovations and more led to the rapid growth of urbanization, with people moving to cities to work in factories. The demographics of the workforce shifted, with the rise of unskilled laborers and a decline of traditional artisanal work. As a consequence, labor movements began to form, advocating for better working conditions, wages, and hours. Governments responded with legislative reforms, such as child labor laws, safety regulations, and minimum wage provisions, to address the issues brought to light by the Industrial Revolution. In conclusion, by analyzing the major technological advancements of the Industrial Revolution, their inventors, and the subsequent social, economic, and environmental effects, we can see how this period of history led to significant changes in society, industry, and the lives of everyday people."},{"instruction":"What is the best way to: How to keep bread from going off?","output":"To determine the best way to keep bread from going off, I will consider various storage methods and factors that affect bread's freshness. Step 1: Understand the factors causing the bread to go off There are a few factors that cause bread to spoil or become stale: - Exposure to air causing the bread to dry out - High humidity, promoting mold growth - Temperature: too much heat may speed up the staling process, whereas too much cold may affect the bread's texture Step 2: Consider various storage methods for bread There are several methods for storing bread to keep it fresh: - In a bread box or container - In a plastic bag or wrap - In a paper bag - In a cool and dry place - In the refrigerator - In the freezer Step 3: Evaluate the pros and cons of each storage method - Bread box/container: It provides an environment with reduced airflow, slowing down mold growth. However, it may still be prone to drying out or staling if not properly sealed. - Plastic bag/wrap: It helps retain the moisture, but increases the potential for mold growth. - Paper bag: It allows the bread to \\"breathe\\" and can prevent mold, but the bread might still dry out quickly. - Cool and dry place: It prevents mold growth, but the bread will still be exposed to air, causing it to stale or dry out. - Refrigerator: While it can slow down mold growth, refrigeration can actually cause bread to stale faster due to a process called \\"retrogradation.\\" - Freezer: Freezing bread prevents mold growth and staling, but the bread has to be thawed before use, which might not be as convenient. Step 4: Determine the best storage method Based on the evaluation, the freezer seems to provide the best solution for keeping bread fresh for a longer period of time without promoting mold growth or staling. However, the bread will require thawing before consumption. Step 5: Implement the best storage method To store bread in the freezer: 1. Slice the bread if it is not already sliced. 2. Wrap the bread tightly in plastic wrap or a freezer-safe plastic bag to minimize air exposure. 3. Place the wrapped bread in a resealable freezer-safe plastic bag. 4. Label the bag with the bread type and date of storage. 5. Put the bag in the freezer, and store the bread up to three months. To use the frozen bread, remove the desired number of slices, and allow them to thaw at room temperature for about 30 minutes or gently toast them in a toaster or oven. By following these steps, you can keep bread from going off for a longer period and enjoy its freshness whenever desired."},{"instruction":"Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context? Context: Fraser Wishart (born Johnstone, Renfrewshire, 1 March 1965) is a Scottish former professional footballer, former Secretary of the Scottish Professional Footballers' Association, and current chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association Scotland. He is also an occasional radio and television commentator. Hypothesis: Wishart was an amazing player.","output":"Based on the provided context, we can gather some information about Fraser Wishart, but we cannot definitively conclude that he was an amazing player. The context gives us the following information: 1. Fraser Wishart was born on 1st March 1965, in Johnstone, Renfrewshire. 2. He is a Scottish former professional footballer. 3. He has held various administrative positions in associations linked to football, such as being the former Secretary of the Scottish Professional Footballers' Association and the current chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association Scotland. 4. Wishart has also worked as an occasional radio and television commentator. Although the context provides information on Wishart's involvement in football, both as a player and in administrative roles, it does not provide enough evidence to support the hypothesis that he was an amazing player. To draw such a conclusion, we would need more information on his playing career, such as his accomplishments, performance statistics, or accolades received during his time as a professional footballer. Additionally, the term \\"amazing player\\" is subjective and might differ depending on individual preferences and criteria.

Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Great Britain did not address the issues over the Falklands when self-governing was the topic.\\"?","output":"Based on the provided paragraph, it can be concluded that there have been notable improvements in financial, oil, fisheries, and military issues as a result of the exchanges between the concerned parties. However, it is explicitly mentioned that Great Britain consistently refused to address the issue of sovereignty over the Falklands. While the specific topic of \\"self-governing\\" is not directly mentioned in the paragraph, the sovereignty issue is closely related to the concept of self-governance and control over a territory. In the context of the Falklands, sovereignty refers to the authority or power to govern and make decisions for the territory. If Great Britain refuses to address the issue of sovereignty, it can be inferred that they are also not addressing the concerns related to self-governing for the Falkland Islands. However, without further information about the discussions and exchanges between the parties, we cannot make a definitive conclusion that Great Britain didn't address any aspects related to self-governing in the Falklands. It could be possible that issues like self-governance might have been discussed but did not lead to any significant progress due to Great Britain's refusal to address sovereignty concerns. To accurately determine the extent of Great Britain's stance on self-governance, more information would be required about their approach to the Falkland Islands' sovereignty issue and other related discussions. In conclusion, based on the given paragraph, we can infer that Great Britain did not address the sovereignty issue of the Falklands. While the specific topic of self-governing is not directly mentioned, it is strongly related to sovereignty. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the issues of self-governing in the Falklands might have been affected or limited by Great Britain's refusal to address sovereignty, but more information would be needed to determine the full extent of their stance on self-governance."},{"instruction":"Representing yourself in court can be a tricky endeavor. There are confusing legal terms to learn, strict procedures to follow and volumes of case law that often need to be understood to prepare a case.

The pyramid is used by countless health organizations, clinics, doctors and many others to guide people to eat in a healthy manner. It is the standard to live by and health professionals unanimously agree that by following this diet pyramid, your health will benefit tremendously. The pyramid is a wonderful synopsis of what the Mediterranean Diet entails. It shows four different food groups and the optimal number of servings of each group that should be consumed. The pyramid was created based on research of the diet that the people in the Mediterranean countries consume. The area was selected as the model because of the low incidence of heart disease and high life expectancy found in the region. One of the primary reasons for the healthy results of the diet is that the people not only use fresh, unadulterated ingredients, they also cook their meals in very healthy ways. They are among the minority of the world’s population that have not embraced the fast food culture that dominates the US and Australia. It should be noted that both countries are battling an obesity epidemic. There are no processed foods, colas, white flour products, pizzas or any unhealthy food in the food pyramid. There are only categories of fresh, healthy foods: fruits and vegetables, nuts and grains, beans, fish and seafood, and healthy oils (primarily olive oil) – plus a little red wine. Your fat consumption should be moderate along with consumption of dairy products such as yogurt and cheese. Eggs can be consumed daily. Fish (seafood) is preferred over meat and should be consumed twice a week. Poultry is also preferred over red meat and should be consumed once a week. Red meat should only be consumed 3 to 4 times a month. The rest of the time, vegetables, legumes, and/or pasta should be the focal point of your meals.

It was during this period that Rome's control expanded from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world. - Sulla's second civil war was one of a series of civil wars of ancient Rome. It was fought between Lucius Cornelius Sulla and Gaius Marius the younger in 82 BC. Prelude. Sulla had achieved temporary control of Rome and Marius's exile to Africa through his first march on Rome, but departed soon afterwards to lead the First Mithridatic War. This departure allowed Gaius Marius and his son Gaius Marius the younger to return to Rome with an army and, with Lucius Cornelius Cinna, to wrest control of Rome back from Sulla's supporter Gnaeus Octavius during Sulla's absence. Based on the orders of Marius, some of his soldiers went through Rome killing the leading supporters of Sulla, including Octavius. Their heads were exhibited in the Forum. After five days, Cinna ordered his more disciplined troops to kill Marius's rampaging soldiers. All told some 100 Roman nobles had been murdered. Marius declared Sulla's reforms and laws invalid, officially exiled Sulla and had himself elected to Sulla's eastern command and himself and Cinna elected consuls for the year 86 BC. Marius died a fortnight after and Cinna was left in sole control of Rome. - Consul (abbrev. \\"cos.\\"; Latin plural \\"consules\\") was the title of one of the chief magistrates of the Roman Republic, and subsequently a somewhat significant title under the Roman Empire. The title was also used in other city states and also revived in modern states, notably in the First French Republic. The relating adjective is consular, from the \\"consularis\\". - Armenia ( tr. \\"Hayastan\\"), officially the Republic of Armenia (tr. \\"Hayastani Hanrapetutyun\\"), is a sovereign state in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia. Located in Western Asia on the \\"Armenian Highlands\\", it is bordered by Turkey to the west, Russia and Georgia to the north and Azerbaijan to the east, and Iran and Azerbaijan's exclave of Nakhchivan to the south. - Mithridates VI or Mithradates VI, from Old Persian \\"Miradta\\", \\"gift of Mithra\\"; 13563 BC, also known as Mithradates the Great (Megas) and Eupator Dionysius, was king of Pontus and Armenia Minor in northern Anatolia (now Turkey) from about 12063 BC. Mithridates is remembered as one of the Roman Republics most formidable and successful enemies, who engaged three of the prominent generals from the late Roman Republic in the Mithridatic Wars: Lucius Cornelius Sulla, Lucius Licinius Lucullus and Gnaeus Pompey Magnus. He is often considered the greatest ruler of the Kingdom of Pontus. - Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (29 September 106 BC 28 September 48 BC), usually known in English as Pompey or Pompey the Great, was a military and political leader of the late Roman Republic. He came from a wealthy Italian provincial background, and his father had been the first to establish the family among the Roman nobility. Pompey's immense success as a general while still very young enabled him to advance directly to his first consulship without meeting the normal requirements for office. His success as a military commander in Sulla's Second Civil War resulted in Sulla bestowing the nickname \\"Magnus\\", \\"the Great\\", upon him. He was consul three times and celebrated three triumphs. - The Third Mithridatic War (7363 BC) was the last and longest of three Mithridatic Wars and was fought between Mithridates VI of Pontus, who was joined by his allies, and the Roman Republic. The war ended in defeat for Mithridates, ending the Pontic Kingdom, and resulted in the Kingdom of Armenia becoming an allied client state of Rome. - Lucius Cornelius Sisenna ( c. 120 -- 67 BC ) was a Roman soldier , historian , and annalist . He was killed in action during Pompey 's campaign against pirates after the Third Mithridatic War . Sisenna had been commander of the forces on the coast of Greece . He was the author of a history in twenty - three books , all of which have been lost , save a few fragments . Sallust is said to have begun historical work as a continuation of Sisenna 's . Sisenna also translated a collection of erotic and picaresque tales by Aristides of Miletus entitled Milesiae fabulae , which was said to have served as a model for Petronius ' Satyricon . - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river.

Options: (A) 40 (B) 99 (C) 77 (D) 66 (E) 12 Let's think first. Stream of consciousness:","output":"First, let's consider the problem step-by-step. 1. To find the time it takes for the train to pass the bridge, we need to find the distance the train needs to travel. Since the train is 360 m long and the bridge is 140 m long, we add these two lengths together: Distance = Length of train + Length of bridge Distance = 360 m + 140 m Distance = 500 m 2. We know the speed of the train is 45 km/hr. To make it consistent with the length measurement, we need to convert the speed from km/hr to m/s (meters per second): Conversion factor: 1 km = 1000 m, 1 hr = 3600 s Speed (in m/s) = 45 km/hr * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hr / 3600 s) Speed (in m/s) = 45 * (1000/3600) m/s Speed (in m/s) = 12.5 m/s 3. Now we have both the distance (500 m) and the speed (12.5 m/s). We can find the time it takes for the train to pass the bridge using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 500 m / 12.5 m/s 4.

This can be achieved through self-reflection, where you assess your skills, achievements, and areas for improvement. By being both honest and introspective, you can develop a realistic self-image that enables you to trust in your ability to navigate various situations and interact with others. Another essential factor in developing self-confidence is creating and maintaining a robust sense of self-awareness. This entails being in tune with your emotions, thoughts, and reactions, as well as recognizing how they influence your behavior and decisions. Participate in activities that nurture your emotional intelligence, such as journaling or mindfulness exercises, to improve your self-awareness and give you greater control over your thoughts and actions. Embracing personal growth is also an important part of building self-confidence. As the strong silent type, you must be open to learning new things, acquiring new skills, and adapting to change. This can be accomplished through various means, such as taking up hobbies, attending workshops, or immersing yourself in different environments. By continuously challenging yourself and pushing beyond your comfort zone, you demonstrate your resilience and adaptability, further increasing your self-confidence. Lastly, establishing healthy boundaries with others is an integral aspect of exuding self-assurance and portraying the strong silent type. Setting boundaries includes asserting your needs, values, and desires, as well as communicating your limits openly and respectfully. This not only exhibits self-respect but also ensures you don't compromise your own well-being and priorities. Remember that it's okay to say no and protect your personal space—this only reinforces the image of strength and resilience. In summary, to be the strong silent type, it's crucial to build and maintain self-confidence through self-reflection, self-awareness, personal growth, and healthy boundary-setting. As you cultivate these traits and showcase your inner strength and resilience, you will effortlessly embody the strong silent type persona and garner respect and admiration from those around you. Remember that confidence doesn't mean arrogance; it means trusting yourself and having the ability to face challenges with grace and fortitude."},{"instruction":"Generate an approximately fifteen-word sentence that describes all this data: Atlanta, areaCode, 404, 678, 470.

Associated Press Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 14:10 EST, 12 May 2013. |. UPDATED:. 17:54 EST, 12 May 2013. Astronauts making a rare, hastily planned spacewalk replaced a pump outside the International Space Station this weekend in the hopes of plugging a serious ammonia leak. The prospects of success grew as the minutes, then hours passed and no frozen flecks of ammonia appeared. Mission Control said it appeared as though the leak may have been plugged, although additional monitoring over the coming weeks will be needed before declaring a victory. 'I will tell you that we're happy. We're very happy,' said Joel Montalbano, NASA's deputy space station program manager. The spacewalk outside the International Space Station was captured on film by the tweeting, Facebooking, social media maven and space station commander Chris Hadfield. 'Amazing day,' he said. 'EVA (extra-vehicular activity) went off without a hitch. Great crew, phenomenal ground support and a supportive audience. Who could ask for anything more?' Space: Cassidy and Marshburn work outside the ISS in the 'approaching orbital sunset, the harshest of light, a blackness like endless velvet,' said Hadfield. Illuminating: Chris Cassidy and Tom Marshburn turn on their helmet lights 'doing their best to light the universe on the dark side of the Earth,' said Chris Hadfield. One small step: 'Climbing out of the airlock, quite the commute to work!' said Chris Hadfield via Twitter. Chris Cassidy, Navy SEAL and lead spacewalker on Saturday. Say cheese: Chris Cassidy and Tom Marshburn take a minute with visors open to have their picture taken by Chris Hadfield, inside the ISS. Dr. Tom Marshburn, well-dressed for a day's work outdoors. 'We didn't see any obvious signs of a leak, but it's going to take some. time...for us to look at the system, evaluate the system and make sure. we did, indeed, stop the leak.' Montalbano expects it will take 'a good four weeks, five weeks, maybe even a few weeks longer.' 'Obviously, the longer you go, the more confidence you get,' he told reporters. Christopher. Cassidy and Thomas Marshburn installed the new pump after removing the. old one suspected of spewing flakes of frozen ammonia coolant two days. earlier. They uncovered 'no smoking guns' responsible for the leak and. consequently kept a sharp lookout for any icy flecks that might appear. from the massive frame that holds the solar panels on the left side. Spacewalk: Astronaut Chris Cassidy took photos as he worked on repairs to the ISS on May 11, 2013. Cassidy and crewmate Tom Marshburn are believed to have repaired the dangerous ammonia leak. Concern: NASA emphasized that the lives of the multinational crew were not in danger but both Russian and US space experts were scrambling to swiftly fix the problem. Emergency: This picture shows the astronauts being prepared for their spacewalk at the International Space Station. Ammonia: Astronauts discovered a leak of ammonia coolant in its power system. 'Let. us know if you see anything,' Mission Control urged as the fresh pump. was cranked up. Thirty minutes later, all was still well. 'No snow,' the. astronauts radioed. 'We have our eyes on it and haven't seen a thing,' Marshburn said. NASA. said the leak, while significant, never jeopardized crew safety. The. space agency never before staged such a fast, impromptu spacewalk for a. station crew. Even during the shuttle program, unplanned spacewalks. were uncommon. The. ammonia pump was the chief suspect going into Saturday's spacewalk. So. it was disheartening for NASA, at first, as Cassidy and Marshburn. reported nothing amiss on or around the old pump. 'All. the pipes look shiny clean, no crud,' Cassidy said as he used a long,. dentist-like mirror to peer into tight, deep openings. 'I can't give you any good data other than nominal, unfortunately. No smoking guns.' Engineers. determined there was nothing to lose by installing a new pump, despite. the lack of visible damage to the old one. The entire team - weary and. stressed by the frantic pace of the past two days - gained more and more. confidence as the 5 1/2-hour spacewalk drew to a close with no flecks. of ammonia popping up. 'Gloved. fingers crossed,' space station commander Chris Hadfield said in a. tweet from inside. 'No leaks!' he wrote a half-hour later. Space station Commander Chris Hadfield of Canada has tweeted that the problem, while serious, has been stabilized. Crew noticed white flakes of ammonia leaking out of the station on Thursday. Flight. controllers in Houston worked furiously to get ready for Saturday's. operation, completing all the required preparation in under 48 hours. The astronauts trained for just such an emergency scenario before they. rocketed into orbit. This area on the space station is prone to leaks. The. ammonia coursing through the plumbing is used to cool the space. station's electronic equipment. There are eight of these power channels,. and all seven others were operating normally. 'We. may not have found exactly the smoking gun,' Cassidy said, 'but to pull. off what this team did yesterday and today, working practically 48. straight hours, it was a remarkable effort on everybody's behalf.' NASA. officials remain mystified as to why the leak erupted. Ammonia already. had been seeping ever so slightly from the location, but the flow. increased dramatically Thursday. Montalbano. did not know, as of Saturday evening, how much ammonia was lost. Another spacewalk will be needed to replenish the supply. With. the repair work behind them, the astronauts and ground controllers. turned their attention to the impending departure of three of the six. crewmen. Marshburn. has been on the space station since December and is set to return to. Earth late Monday, along with Hadfield, a Canadian, and Russian Roman. Romanenko. Cassidy is a new arrival, on board for just 1 1/2 months. By coincidence, the two Americans performed a spacewalk at this troublesome spot before, during a shuttle visit in 2009. 'This. type of event is what the years of training were for,' Hadfield said in. a tweet Friday. 'A happy, busy crew, working hard, loving life in. space.'

Officially, the race has not been called for Lamb, who holds a lead of 627 votes over Republican candidate Rick Saccone, a strong supporter of President Donald Trump. It’s possible Saccone and his supporters may request a recount, given the close vote. Even though Lamb’s apparent victory is narrow, the Pennsylvania result could broaden implications for Republicans looking to defend their congressional majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate in the November midterm elections. Lamb ran surprisingly strong in a district that Trump carried by nearly 20 points, campaigning as a moderate Democrat. “We fought to find common ground, and we found it, almost everywhere. Democrats, Republicans, independents — each of us, Americans,” Lamb told supporters early Wednesday. Saccone was not ready to concede the race. “We are going to fight all the way to the end. You know I never give up.” The Pennsylvania race follows Democratic victories late last year in Virginia and Alabama, fueled in large part by what some analysts see as an anti-Trump theme that continues to build. “The opposition to Donald Trump is as intense as I have seen since the last year of [Richard] Nixon’s presidency,\\" said University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato via Skype. “It is so intense, it is so hot, that it could result in a much bigger turnover than we think in the midterm elections to the Democrats and away from the Republicans.” Saccone cast himself as the president’s “wingman,” and Trump campaigned on his behalf at a rally last Saturday when Trump urged Republicans to get out and vote. “We want to keep the agenda, the make America great, going. You have got to get him in. This is a very important race,” Trump said. Democrats were thrilled with the result, while some Republicans saw the race as a “wake-up” call for what could be a devastating midterm in November. According to the above context, answer the following question. How long has Donald Trump probably been in politics?

Sentence structure Both sentences are in the present tense and have a subject (people) and verb (standing, ride). The main difference is that in the first sentence, there's a gerund verb (standing) combined with a participle verb (moving), which makes it somewhat more complex than the second sentence, which only uses a single verb (ride). 2. Semantics In both sentences, the subjects, \\"people,\\" are engaging in similar actions involving an escalator moving upwards. Additionally, both sentences imply that the people mentioned are passively engaged in the action. However, the words chosen to convey the action are different – \\"standing\\" and \\"ride\\" have slightly different nuances, but ultimately both expressions depict people on an escalator. 3. Meaning conveyed The meaning derived from both sentences is quite similar. They both depict a group of individuals on an escalator that is moving upwards. While the first sentence places more focus on the act of standing and escalator moving up, the second sentence emphasizes the action of riding. Nevertheless, the context and the overall idea remain consistent in both sentences. Considering the aspects mentioned above, it is fair to deem the two sentences as quite similar. On a scale of 0-5, where 0 is \\"not similar\\" and 5 is \\"very similar\\", I would rate the similarity between the two sentences as a 4. While there are some minor differences in structure and semantics, the overall meaning conveyed is very close, making these sentences significantly similar."},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given a set of context paragraph and some supporting facts to answer a question.

Step 2: Analyze the likelihood of each option. Since the narrator has been unhappy for more than a year and the situation seems to be quite intense (\\"I hate this place, I hate my job\\"), the possibility of simply continuing in the same job without doing anything might be unlikely. Therefore, quitting, finding a new job, discussing the issue with their manager, or seeking career counseling seem more probable choices. Step 3: Determine the most probable choice based on the available information. The available information suggests that the narrator is feeling overwhelmed and frustrated with their job situation. They haven't mentioned any efforts to address or change the situation. Therefore, it is difficult to definitively predict their next action. However, based on the intensity of their emotions, it seems more likely that the narrator may consider quitting their job or start searching for a new job, as these are more immediate and impactful options.

The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker. Question: \\"What group from Germany became key players in the 9/11 conspiracy\\" Response: \\"Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct? Possible answers: i. no. ii. yes.","output":"ii. yes. The response is factually correct because the paragraph specifically mentions that Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah arrived in Kandahar and were seen as an attractive alternative due to their fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West. They eventually became key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. So, the answer \\"yes\\" is correct, and the answer \\"no\\" is incorrect."},{"instruction":"Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? may not be cutting-edge indie filmmaking","output":"The sentiment of the given sentence, \\"may not be cutting-edge indie filmmaking,\\" can be considered as slightly negative or neutral depending on the context in which it is used. The sentence, as it stands, seems to suggest that the subject being discussed is not up to par or does not meet the expectations of what is considered \\"cutting-edge\\" in the world of independent filmmaking. Independent films, or indie films, often thrive on their uniqueness, avant-garde styles, and innovative storytelling methods, which help differentiate them from traditional mainstream movies. A movie that claims to be an indie film but lacks these innovative aspects may not be considered as cutting-edge within the genre, hence reflecting a negative sentiment. However, it is essential to consider the context in which the sentence is being used. If the sentence is part of a larger critique or review, it could be that the movie in question has other redeeming qualities, but just does not excel in being cutting-edge. In such a scenario, the sentiment could lean towards being neutral. It implies that the movie might have standard or ordinary characteristics found in some indie films rather than pushing the boundaries in innovative ways. In summary, without further context or information, the sentiment could be perceived as slightly negative or neutral, as it implies that the subject being discussed falls short of being classified as cutting-edge indie filmmaking, which is often a crucial factor in the success of independent films."},{"instruction":"Trivia question: Which album featuring 30's crooner Al Bowlly got to no 10 in the charts in 1978?

It is a good chance for us to improve our eye health. What are common eye problems we have today? How can we protect our eyes? Read on to find out the answer. Eyes are important in our everyday life. We use them to read books, see colors and view the wonders of the world. But sometimes, we use them too much and it hurts them. In the past, nearsightedness was a common eye problem among children. This is mostly because of their bad eye habits, such as watching TV too long and reading books in bed. However, today's technology is changing the way we live. Children spend more time working and playing in front of computers, smartphones and iPads. US children spend more than 42 hours a week in front of electronic screens , US' ABC news reported. This has caused a new problem for our eyes: digital eyestrain . People with digital eyestrain may get headaches, dry and red eyes, eye pain, watering and other eye problems. But don't worry. The following tips can help you protect your eyes. Try them out. Screen advice: 1. When you are watching electronic screens, keep them at least 30 cm from your eyes. Try not to use your smartphone in direct sunlight. 2. Blink more often when you are looking at the screen. This can help to stop dry eyes. 3. Remember to take a 20-20-20 break: every 20 minutes, take a 20-second break and look at something 20 feet (about 6 meters) away. 4. Spend less time in front of screens.

As consumers, they have various roles in food chains and webs. Some are predators. They prey upon other single-celled organisms, such as bacteria. In fact, protozoa predators keep many bacterial populations under control. Other protozoa are herbivores. They graze on algae. Still others are decomposers. They consume dead organic matter. There are also parasitic protozoa that live in or on living hosts. For example, the protozoan that causes malaria lives inside a human host. Protozoa are also important food sources for many larger organisms, including insects and worms. Now, I have a new situation: The students studied two ponds. Class A studied a pond filled with protozoa, while class B studied a pond with almost no protozoa. Answer this question please: Which class observed more protozoa predators keep many bacterial populations under control? The answer is:","output":"Class A observed more protozoa predators keeping many bacterial populations under control. The reasoning behind this conclusion comes from the information provided about the background of protozoa and the type of roles they play in an ecosystem. By nature, protozoa are typically consumers, engulfing and digesting other organisms such as bacteria, algae, and dead organic matter, playing the role of predators, herbivores, decomposers, and sometimes even parasites. In the given situation, Class A studied a pond filled with protozoa. Therefore, this pond likely supported a large ecosystem where protozoa served in various capacities, including that of predators. As predators, these protozoa consequently engulf and digest bacteria, thereby controlling many bacterial populations. Hence, it is reasonable to determine that Class A, studying a pond with a high prevalence of protozoa, observed more of these predatory dynamics in operation and witnessed the active role protozoa play in controlling bacterial populations. On the other hand, Class B studied a pond with almost no protozoa. With the low prevalence to nearly the absence of protozoa, there would be significantly decreased predatory behavior exhibited towards bacterial populations by protozoa. As such, they would observe less control of bacterial populations, particularly by protozoa predators. Thus, given the roles and behaviors of protozoa in the ecosystem, it suggests that Class A, studying a pond dense with protozoa, would have observed more instances of protozoa predators keeping many bacterial populations under control compared to Class B, where the pond had almost no protozoa."},{"instruction":"Question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Like the Common raven , Thick - billed raven and Brown - necked raven , it is one of the larger raven species . The smaller raven species are the Australian raven , Forest raven , Little raven , Fan - tailed raven and Chihuahuan raven with the Thick - billed raven being the world 's largest raven species and the Chihuahuan raven being the smallest . - The forest raven (\\"Corvus tasmanicus\\", also commonly known as the Tasmanian raven) is a passerine bird in the family Corvidae native to Tasmania and parts of southern Victoria, such as Wilsons Promontory and Portland. Populations are also found in parts of New South Wales, including Dorrigo and Armidale. Measuring in length, it has all-black plumage, beak and legs. As with the other two species of raven in Australia, its black feathers have grey bases. Adults have white irises; younger birds have dark brown and then hazel irises with an inner blue rim. New South Wales populations are recognised as a separate subspecies \\"C. tasmanicus boreus\\", but appear to be nested within the Tasmanian subspecies genetically. - The Australian raven (\\"Corvus coronoides\\") is a passerine bird in the genus \\"Corvus\\" native to much of southern and northeastern Australia. Measuring in length, it has all-black plumage, beak and mouth, as well as strong grey-black legs and feet. The upperparts are glossy, with a purple, blue or green sheen, and its black feathers have grey bases. The Australian raven is distinguished from the Australian crow species by its throat hackles, which are prominent in adult birds. Older adult individuals have white irises, younger adults have a white irises with an inner blue rim, while younger birds have dark brown irises until fifteen months of age, and hazel irises with an inner blue rim around each pupil until age two years and ten months. Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield described the Australian raven in 1827, its species name highlighting its similarity with the carrion crow (\\"C. corone\\"). Two subspecies are recognised, which differ slightly in calls and are quite divergent genetically. - The Wilsons Promontory is a peninsula that forms the southernmost part of the Australian mainland and is located in the state of Victoria. It is known to the indigenous Gunai/Kurnai and the Boonerwrung Clans as Yiruk and Wammum respectively. - The Chihuahuan raven (\\"Corvus cryptoleucus\\") is a species of bird in the family Corvidae that is native to the United States and Mexico. It was formerly known as the American white-necked raven, and has the proportions of a common raven with a heavy bill, but is about the same size as a carrion crow, or slightly larger than the American crow (long). The plumage is all-black with a rich purple-blue gloss in good light. Like the forest raven, little raven, fan-tailed raven and Australian raven, it is one of the smaller raven species. The larger species of raven are the common raven, thick-billed raven, white-necked raven and brown-necked raven, with the common and thick-billed ravens being the world's largest raven species and the little and fan-tailed ravens being the smallest. The Chihuahuan raven is very similar in appearance to the Australian raven, although with dark brown irises and whiter feather bases. The nasal bristles extend farther down the top of the bill than in any other \\"Corvus\\" species to about two-thirds the length. The base of the neck feathers are white-ish (seen only when ruffled in strong wind). The bill, legs and feet are black. - The satin bowerbird (\\"Ptilonorhynchus violaceus\\") is a bowerbird endemic to eastern Australia. - Carrion (from the Latin \\"\\"caro\\"\\", meaning \\"meat\\") is the decaying dead flesh of an animal. Carrion is an important food source for large carnivores and omnivores in most ecosystems. Examples of carrion-eaters (or scavengers) include vultures, hawks, eagles, hyenas, Virginia opossum, Tasmanian devils, coyotes, and Komodo dragons. Many invertebrates such as the carrion and burying beetles, as well as maggots of calliphorid flies and flesh-flies also eat carrion, playing an important role in recycling nitrogen and carbon in animal remains. Carrion begins to decay the moment of the animal's death, and it will increasingly attract insects and breed bacteria. Not long after the animal has died, its body will begin to exude a foul odor caused by the presence of bacteria and the emission of cadaverine and putrescine. - Australasia, a region of Oceania, comprises Australia, New Zealand, the island of New Guinea, and neighbouring islands in the Pacific Ocean. Charles de Brosses coined the term (as French \\"Australasie\\") in \\"Histoire des navigations aux terres australes\\" (1756). He derived it from the Latin for \\"south of Asia\\" and differentiated the area from Polynesia (to the east) and the southeast Pacific (Magellanica). The bulk of Australasia sits on the Indo-Australian Plate, together with India. - The brown-necked raven (\\"Corvus ruficollis\\") is a larger bird (5256 cm in length) than the carrion crow though not as large as the common raven. It has similar proportions to the common raven but the bill is not so large or deep and the wings tend to be a little more pointed in profile. The head and throat are a distinct brownish-black giving the bird its English name, while the rest of the plumage is black glossed with purple, blue or purplish-blue. Like the Common raven, Thick-billed raven and White-necked raven, it is one of the larger raven species. The smaller raven species are the Australian raven, Forest raven, Little raven, Fan-tailed raven and Chihuahuan raven with the Thick-billed raven being the world's largest raven species and the Chihuahuan raven being the smallest. The feathers of this species often fade quite quickly to a brownish black (even the truly black feathers) and the bird can look distinctly brown by the time it moults. The feet, legs and bill are black. The dwarf raven was formerly considered a subspecies (\\"Corvus ruficollis edithae\\") but this bird now appears to be closer to the pied crow (\\"C. albus\\") than this species. - Mexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Covering almost two million square kilometers (over 760,000 sq mi), Mexico is the sixth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent nation in the world. With an estimated population of over 120 million, it is the eleventh most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world while being the second most populous country in Latin America. Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states and a federal district that is also its capital and most populous city. Other metropolises include Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana and León. - The American crow (\\"Corvus brachyrhynchos\\") is a large passerine bird species of the family Corvidae. It is a common bird found throughout much of North America. American crows are the new world counterpart to the carrion crow and the hooded crow. Although the American crow and the hooded crow are very similar in size, structure and behavior, their calls are different. The American crow nevertheless occupies the same role the hooded crow does in Eurasia. - A passerine is any bird of the order Passeriformes, which includes more than half of all bird species. A notable feature of passerines compared to other orders of Aves is the arrangement of their toes, three pointing forward and one back, which facilitates perching. Sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds, the passerines form one of the most diverse terrestrial vertebrate orders, with over 5,000 identified species. It has roughly twice as many species as the largest of the mammal orders, the Rodentia. It contains more than 110 families, the second-most of any order of tetrapods (after Squamata, the scaled reptiles). The passerines contain several groups of brood parasites such as the viduas, cuckoo-finches, and the cowbirds. Most passerines are omnivorous, while the shrikes are carnivorous. - The thick-billed raven (\\"Corvus crassirostris\\"), a corvid from the Horn of Africa, shares with the common raven the distinction of being the largest bird in the corvid family, and indeed the largest of the most diverse bird order, the passerines. The thick-billed raven measures in length and weighs on average. It has a very large bill that is laterally compressed and is deeply curved in profile giving the bird a very distinctive appearance. This bill is black with a white tip and has deep nasal grooves with only light nasal bristle covers. - Corvidae is a cosmopolitan family of oscine passerine birds that contains the crows, ravens, rooks, jackdaws, jays, magpies, treepies, choughs, and nutcrackers. In common English, they are known as the crow family, or, more technically, corvids. Over 120 species are described. The genus \\"Corvus\\", including the jackdaws, crows, and ravens, makes up over a third of the entire family. - A lyrebird is either of two species of ground-dwelling Australian birds that compose the genus, Menura, and the family Menuridae. They are most notable for their superb ability to mimic natural and artificial sounds from their environment, and the striking beauty of the male bird's huge tail when it is fanned out in courtship display. Lyrebirds have unique plumes of neutral-coloured tailfeathers and are among Australia's best-known native birds. - The carrion crow (\\"Corvus corone\\") is a passerine bird of the family Corvidae and the genus \\"Corvus\\" which is native to western Europe and eastern Asia. - The little raven (\\"Corvus mellori\\") is a species of the family Corvidae that is native to southeastern Australia. An adult individual is about in length, with all-black plumage, beak and legs and a white iris, as do the other members of the genus \\"Corvus\\" in Australia and some species from the islands to the north. Like those of the other two species of raven in Australia, its black feathers have grey bases. Although the little raven was first named by Gregory Mathews in 1912, it was only in 1967 that there was consensus to separate it from the Australian raven (\\"C. coronoides\\") as a distinct species. - Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists. - The pupil is a hole located in the centre of the iris of the eye that allows light to strike the retina. It appears black because light rays entering the pupil are either absorbed by the tissues inside the eye directly, or absorbed after diffuse reflections within the eye that mostly miss exiting the narrow pupil. - The Horn of Africa (, \\"yäafrika qänd\\", \\"al-qarn al-'afrq\\") (shortened to HOA) is a peninsula in Northeast Africa. It juts hundreds of kilometers into the Arabian Sea and lies along the southern side of the Gulf of Aden. The area is the easternmost projection of the African continent. The Horn of Africa denotes the region containing the countries of Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia. - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - The common raven (\\"Corvus corax\\"), also known as the northern raven, is a large all-black passerine bird. Found across the Northern Hemisphere, it is the most widely distributed of all corvids. There are at least eight subspecies with little variation in appearance, although recent research has demonstrated significant genetic differences among populations from various regions. It is one of the two largest corvids, alongside the thick-billed raven, and is possibly the heaviest passerine bird; at maturity, the common raven averages in length and in mass. Common ravens can live up to 21 years in the wild, a lifespan exceeded among passerines by only a few Australasian species such as the satin bowerbird and probably the lyrebirds.

Confused, she looks around to see if there's any clue as to who put them there. Seeing nobody, she flips the light switch on and walks in. Upon flipping the light switch, only the large sign lights up. Even though they are clearly both plugged in, the small sign isn't turning on. Kathy leaves her office to find someone to ask who put these random signs up in her room. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which sign's electrons are at a higher energy level? Hint: Noble gases are also used to fill the glass tubes of lighted signs like the one in the Figure below . Although noble gases are chemically nonreactive, their electrons can be energized by sending an electric current through them. When this happens, the electrons jump to a higher energy level. When the electrons return to their original energy level, they give off energy as light. Different noble gases give off light of different colors. Neon gives off reddish-orange light, like the word “Open” in the sign below. Krypton gives off violet light and xenon gives off blue light.

Now it turns out that they may not be good for our minds, either. A new study of more than 260,000 people has found a link between sweetened soft-drinks and depression, and diet sodas may be making matters worse. Americans drink far more sodas than people in other countries-- as much as 170 liters per person per year. But the impact of this study isn't limited to the United States. \\"Sweetened drinks, coffee and tea are commonly consumed worldwide and have important physical consequences. And they may have important mental-health consequences as well,\\" study author Dr Honglei Chen said in a statement. The study studied 263,925 people between the ages of 50 and 71. Researchers followed their consumption of drinks like soda, tea coffee, and other soft drinks from 1995 to 1996 and then. 10 years later, asked them if they had been diagnosed with depression since the year 2000. More than 11,3000 of them had. Participants who drank more than four servings of sodas per day were 30 percent more likely to develop depression than participants who did not drink sodas at all. People who stuck with fruit punch , had a 38 percent higher risk than people who didn't drink sweetened drinks. And all that extra sugar isn't the actual problem. Researchers say that the artificial sweetener _ may be to blame. The study found a link but could not surely determine whether sodas and other sweet soft drinks cause depression. Still, the results \\"are consistent with a small but growing body of evidence suggesting that artificially sweetened beverages may be linked to poor health outcomes.\\" But there's a bright side for those who can't live without their daily sodas.

Please answer step by step:","output":"Step 1: Identify the main components of pancakes Pancakes are typically made from flour, eggs, milk, and a small amount of sugar. They might also contain baking powder and additional ingredients, such as nuts, fruits, or chocolate chips in some variations. Step 2: Determine which components are harmful to cats Cats are obligate carnivores, which means that their diet should primarily consist of animal-based proteins. They have a limited ability to process carbohydrates, and their nutritional requirements are different from humans. - Flour and sugar: These are sources of carbohydrates, which are not suitable for cats' dietary needs. Feeding your cat too many carbohydrates can lead to obesity and other health issues. - Milk: While cats are often stereotypically associated with milk, many of them are lactose intolerant. Feeding them milk or milk-based products can cause digestive problems, such as upset stomach or diarrhea. - Additional ingredients: Some pancake ingredients, such as chocolate or certain nuts, are toxic to cats and should always be avoided. Step 3: Assess the overall suitability of pancakes as a snack for cats Considering the various components of pancakes and the fact that cats have specific dietary needs that are not met by this type of food, it is safe to conclude that pancakes are not an appropriate snack for cats. Step 4: Provide alternatives for healthy cat snacks As an alternative, consider offering your cat specially formulated cat treats or small portions of plain, unseasoned meat or fish, which are more appropriate for their dietary needs. In conclusion, pancakes are not a suitable snack for cats due to their high carbohydrate content, potential for causing digestive issues, and presence of harmful ingredients. It is best to provide your cat with appropriate treats or meats specifically tailored to their nutritional requirements."},{"instruction":"Article: To make a simple bubble solution, all you need is liquid dish soap, water, and glycerin.

The Roman sources also use the term Hispani to refer to the Iberians. The term Iberian, as used by the ancient authors, had two distinct meanings. One, more general, referred to all the populations of the Iberian peninsula without regard to ethnic differences (Pre-Indo-European, Celts and non-Celtic Indo-Europeans). The Iberians produced sculpture in stone and bronze, most of which was much influenced by the Greeks and Phoenicians, and other cultures such as Assyrian, Hittite and Egyptian influences. The styles of Iberian sculpture are divided geographically into Levantine, Central, Southern, and Western groups, of which the Levantine group displays the most Greek influence. Iberian pottery and painting was also distinct and widespread throughout the region. The Iberian polytheistic religion was influenced by the Greek and Phoenician practices, as it is evident in their sculptures. The man-bull Bicha of Balazote (possibly a fertility deity) and various depictions of sphinxes and lions bear a resemblance to eastern Mediterranean mythological creatures. The Lady of Elche and Lady of Guardamar show clear Hellenistic influence. Phoenician and Greek deities like Tanit, Baal, Melkart, Artemis, Demeter and Asclepius were known in the region and worshiped. Currently few native Iberian gods are known, though the oracular healing deity \\"Betatun\\" is known from a Latin inscription at Fuertes del Rey. There was clearly an important female deity associated with the earth and regeneration as depicted by the Lady of Baza and linked with birds, flowers and wheat. The horse was also an important religious figure and an important sanctuary dedicated to Horses has been found in Mula (Murcia). There are many depictions of a \\"horse taming god\\" or \\"lord of the horses\\" (despotes hippon). The female goddess Ataegina is also widely attested in the inscriptions. Iberians performed their rites in the open and also maintained sanctuaries in holy places like groves, springs and caves. Archaeological evidence suggests the existence of a priestly class and Silius Italicus mentions priests in the region of Tartessos at a temple of Melqart. Evidence from pottery reveals some information about Iberian myth and ritual. Common themes are a celebratory ritual dance described by Strabo [c.f. 3.3.7.] and seen in a relief from Fuerte del Rey known as the \\"Bastetania dance\\" and the confrontation between the deceased and a wolf figure. Ritual sacrifice of animals was also common. The Iberians incinerated their dead and placed their ashes in ceremonial urns, the remains were then placed in stone tombs. Iberians venerated the war god Cariociecus.

Options are: - no. - yes.","output":"While it may not be common knowledge, it is a fact that lakes, including the Great Lakes, do experience tides, albeit at a smaller scale compared to oceans. To provide a detailed understanding, let's first discuss tides in general and then delve into the specifics of tides in lakes, including the Great Lakes. Tides are the periodic rise and fall of water levels in the world's oceans and seas, resulting from the gravitational interactions between the Earth, the Moon, and the Sun. The main force driving the tides is the gravitational pull between the Earth and the Moon, with the Sun's gravity also playing a role, though to a lesser extent. When the gravitational forces from the Moon and the Sun are aligned, either during a full moon or a new moon, the tides are at their strongest and are called \\"spring tides.\\" Conversely, when the Moon is at first or third quarter, and the gravitational forces from the Moon and the Sun work at right angles to each other, weaker tides called \\"neap tides\\" occur. Now, let's discuss the presence of tides in lakes. As mentioned earlier, lakes do experience tides, although they are much smaller and less noticeable compared to those in the oceans. This is because the force of gravity that causes tides acts upon all bodies of water, regardless of their size. However, the effect is considerably reduced in smaller water bodies like lakes due to their limited size and depth, which results in tidal ranges typically being only a few centimeters, often less than the average water level fluctuations caused by other factors like atmospheric pressure changes and wind patterns. In the case of the Great Lakes, these bodies of water also exhibit tides. The Great Lakes, being the largest freshwater lake system in the world, do experience tidal forces generated by the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun. However, the size of these tides is minimal, with the highest tidal range being only about 5 centimeters (2 inches). The small tidal ranges in the Great Lakes make them challenging to detect and are usually overshadowed by the influence of external factors such as wind-driven seiches (oscillations in enclosed or semi-enclosed bodies of water) and fluctuating atmospheric pressure. To address the question of whether \\"Are there lakes that have tides?\\" and \\"Do the Great Lakes have tides?\\" are the same, the answer would be \\"no.\\" While both questions refer to lakes and tides, the former is a general question about the presence of tides in lakes, while the latter specifically inquires about the possible tides in the Great Lakes. The questions are related but distinct in their focus. Nonetheless, the answer to both of these questions is that tides do exist in lakes, including the Great Lakes, albeit to a much lesser extent than in oceans."},{"instruction":"Question: Swamp plants die, fall to the ground, and are buried by other dying plants.

This process helps to achieve a high level of surface accuracy and to remove burrs, surface irregularities, and other defects. Lapping machines typically consist of a lapping plate, which is either flat or cylindrical, and various fixtures to hold the workpiece in place. The abrasive material, also known as a lapping compound, is a loose mixture of various grain sizes, suspended in a liquid medium like water or oil. Lapping machines are used in industries such as aerospace, automotive, electronics, and precision manufacturing for refining and finishing critical components, including fuel injection nozzles, mechanical seals, valve seats, and optical lens elements, among others.

What is the average of their average that they have to run over the final three days? Thoughts? Step-by-step reasoning:","output":"Step 1: Calculate the total miles run by Jesse and Mia over the first 4 days. For Jesse: - Over the first three days, she averages (2/3) of a mile per day. Since there are 3 days, she runs a total of 3 * (2/3) = 2 miles over these days. - On day 4, she runs 10 miles. For Mia: - She averages 3 miles a day over the first 4 days which gives us 4 * 3 = 12 miles. Step 2: Calculate the remaining miles they need to run to reach 30 miles. For Jesse: - She has run 2 (first three days) + 10 (day four) = 12 miles so far. - 30 miles (target) - 12 miles (run so far) = 18 miles remaining for Jesse. For Mia: - She has run 12 miles so far. - 30 miles (target) - 12 miles (run so far) = 18 miles remaining for Mia. Step 3: Calculate the average miles per day they need to run over the final three days. For Jesse and Mia, both have the same remaining miles (18 miles). - Since there are 3 days remaining, their daily average over the final three days will be: 18 miles (remaining) / 3 days = 6 miles per day. Step 4: Calculate the average of their averages over the final three days. Since both Jesse and Mia have the same average (6 miles per day) over the final three days, the average of their averages is also: 6 miles per day (Jesse's average over the final three days) + 6 miles per day (Mia's average over the final three days) = 12 miles 12 miles / 2 (both Jesse and Mia) = 6 miles per day.

What is the solution?","output":"Okay, little one, let's solve this math problem step-by-steps! 1. First, we have to find out what \\"-480 - 1542\\" is. Here's a simple way to understand it: Let's say you had 480 cookies, but you gave them all away (-480), and then you gave away another 1542 cookies. In total, you gave away: -480 (the first 480 cookies) - 1542 (the other 1542 cookies) = -2022 cookies (you've given away in total) Now our math problem looks like this: -2022 = 70*u - 482 2. Next, we have to add 2022 to both sides. Think of it like adding 2022 cookies back to what you had. So, (-2022) + 2022 = (70*u - 482) + 2022 0 = 70*u - 482 + 2022 (we just simplified the equation) 3. Now, we need to add 482 to both sides to get rid of the \\"-482\\" on the right side. Think of it like adding 482 more cookies. 70*u = 2022 + 482 (we just added 482 to both sides) 4. Let's add the numbers on the right side. 70*u = 2504 (so, 70 times u is 2504) 5. Lastly, we need to find the value of \\"u\\". This means we need to divide by 70 (you are sharing 70 equal parts of 2504 cookies with your friends). u = 2504/70 u = 35.77142857 But if we round the number to keep it simple, the value of \\"u\\" is around 36.

Holst had formed the Purcell Singers, a small semi-professional choir, in October 1952, largely at the instigation of Pears. From 1954 the choir became regular performers at the Aldeburgh Festival, with programmes ranging from rarely heard medieval music to 20th-century works. Among choir members who later achieved individual distinction were the bass-baritone John Shirley-Quirk, the tenors Robert Tear and Philip Langridge, and the founder and conductor of the Heinrich Schütz Choir, Roger Norrington. Langridge remembered with particular pleasure a performance in Orford church of Thomas Tallis's forty-part motet Spem in alium, on 2 July 1963. When she gave up the conductorship of the choir in 1967, much of its musical mission, in particular its commitment to early music, was assumed by other groups, such as Norrington's Schütz Choir and the Purcell Consort formed by the ex-Purcell Singers chorister Grayston Burgess.On 2 June 1967 Holst shared the podium with Britten in the concert inaugurating the Aldeburgh Festival's new home at the Snape Maltings. From 1972 Holst was involved with the development of educational classes at the Maltings, which began with weekend singing classes and developed into the Britten-Pears School for Advanced Musical Studies, with its own training orchestra.

Pierre Benjamin Monteux (pronounced [pjɛʁ mɔ̃.tø]; 4 April 1875 – 1 July 1964) was a French (later American) conductor. After violin and viola studies, and a decade as an orchestral player and occasional conductor, he began to receive regular conducting engagements in 1907. He came to prominence when, for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes company between 1911 and 1914, he conducted the world premieres of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring and other prominent works including Petrushka, Ravel's Daphnis et Chloé, and Debussy's Jeux. Thereafter he directed orchestras around the world for more than half a century. From 1917 to 1919 Monteux was the principal conductor of the French repertoire at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. He led the Boston Symphony Orchestra (1919–24), Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra (1924–34), Orchestre Symphonique de Paris (1929–38) and San Francisco Symphony (1936–52). In 1961, aged eighty-six, he accepted the chief conductorship of the London Symphony Orchestra, a post which he held until his death three years later. Although known for his performances of the French repertoire, his chief love was the music of German composers, above all Brahms. He disliked recording, finding it incompatible with spontaneity, but he nevertheless made a substantial number of records. Monteux was well known as a teacher. In 1932 he began a conducting class in Paris, which he developed into a summer school that was later moved to his summer home in Les Baux in the south of France. After moving permanently to the US in 1942, and taking American citizenship, he founded a school for conductors and orchestral musicians in Hancock, Maine. Among his students in France and America who went on to international fame were Lorin Maazel, Igor Markevitch, Neville Marriner, Seiji Ozawa, André Previn and David Zinman.

Answer the question: The Moon has more or less effect on the tides than Mars? A:","output":"The Moon has a significantly greater effect on the tides than Mars. To fully understand this phenomenon, it is essential to grasp the nature of tidal forces and the role celestial bodies play in them. Tidal forces are a result of the gravitational interaction between celestial objects. The strength of the gravitational force between two objects depends on their mass and distance. The force decreases as the distance between the objects increases, and it increases as the mass of the objects increases. The Earth's tides are primarily influenced by the gravitational pull of the Moon and, to a lesser extent, the Sun. The Moon has a much greater effect on the Earth's tides than the Sun because, although the Sun is much more massive, the Moon is significantly closer to our planet. The gravitational force exerted by the Moon on the Earth is approximately twice as strong as the force exerted by the Sun, despite the Sun being around 330,000 times more massive than the Moon. Consequently, the Moon has a more dominant influence on the generation of tides. Mars, on the other hand, exerts a negligible tidal force on the Earth due to its considerably smaller mass and greater distance. Its mass is just a fraction (around 0.11 times) of the Earth's mass, and its average distance from Earth varies between 54.6 million and 401 million kilometers. In contrast, the Moon is roughly 384,400 kilometers away from the Earth, making its gravitational influence far more significant. Additionally, Mars does not possess a significant tidal force on the Earth as its axial tilt and orbital eccentricity result in a less regular and predictable gravitational influence. Furthermore, since Mars does not follow a consistent path in the sky like the Moon or the Sun, its impact on the Earth's tides remains negligible. In summary, the Moon has a significantly greater effect on the Earth's tides than Mars due to its closer proximity to our planet and its stronger gravitational force. Mars' smaller mass and greater distance from the Earth make its tidal influence inconsequential when compared to the dominant effects of the Moon and the Sun."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: - The bird picks a tree - The bird collects twigs and other refuse - The bird makes a flat base with twigs - The bird makes sides with twigs and other things - The bird adds softer material to the inside A:","output":"A: The final step of the following process is \\"The bird adds softer material to the inside.\\" Justification: 1.

CNN's Ben Wedeman, a veteran Middle East correspondent, puts the incursion into perspective. How does this incursion compare to previous ones by Israel into Gaza, in terms of military force? Unlike 2008/09, this incursion seems to be focused on areas with high concentrations of people, initially focusing on the Gaza City neighborhood of Shaja'ia. In '08/09 the focus was on areas where rockets were being fired, which were typically away from highly populated communities. What we see is that as Israel's capabilities have changed, so have","output":"their tactics and targets in their military operations in Gaza. The current incursion seems to display a significant increase in the intensity and scale of military force being used compared to previous incursions. While it is essential to understand that each incursion has a specific context, timeframe, and objectives, some general comparisons can be made to offer a better understanding of the situation. 1. Operation Cast Lead (2008/2009): This operation lasted for 22 days and was primarily focused on stopping rocket fire from Gaza into Israel. It was launched in response to constant rocket attacks from Hamas. During this conflict, Israel deployed ground troops, tanks, and artillery in addition to airstrikes. An estimated 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis were killed, and significant damage was inflicted upon Gaza's infrastructure. 2. Operation Pillar of Defense (2012): This eight-day operation was aimed at stopping rocket fire from Gaza and targeting Hamas leadership and infrastructure. The campaign largely relied on airstrikes, with no ground invasion. It resulted in the deaths of an estimated 167 Palestinians and six Israelis. 3. Operation Protective Edge (2014): This 50-day operation involved a ground invasion and aerial bombardment with the primary objective of destroying Hamas's tunnel network. Israel targeted both military and civilian infrastructure to weaken Hamas's operational capabilities. The conflict led to approximately 2,200 Palestinian deaths, including 1,462 civilians, and 73 Israeli deaths. 4. Current incursion (2021): This operation is primarily focusing on areas with high concentrations of people, such as the Gaza City neighborhood of Shaja'ia. It initially started as an aerial campaign but eventually progressed to a ground invasion. The technological advancements of Israel's military and the development of the Iron Dome missile defense system have allowed them to be more precise and aggressive with their attacks. There are several factors to consider when comparing these incursions: - Military technology: Israel's military capabilities have evolved over the years, meaning that their strategy for each incursion reflects these advancements. As mentioned earlier, the Iron Dome missile defense system has played a vital role in protecting Israel from rocket attacks, thus allowing them to be more aggressive in their operations. - Response to rocket fire: Each incursion has been launched in response to rocket fire from Gaza. However, the scale and frequency of these rocket attacks have varied widely from operation to operation. This can influence the level of force used by Israel during each incursion. - Political context: The political landscape surrounding each incursion can also greatly influence the nature of the operation. Factors such as the international community's response, regional politics, and internal dynamics within Israel and Gaza can all play a role in shaping the operation. In conclusion, while each incursion has distinct differences in terms of military force, objectives, and context, the current one seems to be more concentrated on highly populated areas compared to previous incursions. This increased focus on densely-populated regions presents a higher risk for civilian casualties and damage to essential civilian infrastructure, exacerbating the already dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The combination of advancing military capabilities and shifting political dynamics will continue to impact the nature of military operations in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza."},{"instruction":"How is \\"The coin -- representing the island's prehistoric art and civilisation -- depicts a cross-shaped idol dating to 3,000 BC, The award ceremony will be held at the World Money Centre in Berlin on January 30th.\\" said in Turkish?","output":"\\"Madalyon - adanın tarih öncesi sanatını ve uygarlığını temsil ediyor - MÖ 3000'e tarihlenen bir haç şeklinde bir idol resmediyor.

Instead, focus on really understanding what the author is trying to say. This might mean that you need to read one sentence or paragraph more than once. You might also want to reread the whole piece. That's fine. This will help you start to put the piece's arguments in your own words. You can also ask yourself what point or points or themes come up throughout the entire piece. The title can also give you a tip as to the main point of the piece. The author might also state their thesis more plainly by saying something like \\"my argument is....\\" or I believe... In a fiction piece, the author will more likely emphasize themes. So if you notice that love - discussions or descriptions of it, for example - come up a lot, one of the main points of the piece is probably love. Once you know for sure what the author's main point is, reread the piece, looking for the ways they support that point. You can find supporting material by looking for details that refer to the title, surprises in the argument or plot, repetition, or a lot of attention to details such as descriptions of characters (if any). Write down each time something like this occurs. To put something in your own words, write it down as if you were explaining or describing it to a friend. In that case, you wouldn't just read what the author wrote. Do the same when you're writing down the major points in your own words. You only need to know what they're arguing. So, for example, say the author's main argument is: \\"The U.S. Civil Rights Movement actually began in the 1950s.\\" They might say that black women's boycott of mass transit is an example of this. You only need to note the black women's boycott, not the examples of that boycott that the author uses. For fiction pieces, this means avoiding rewriting every single thing that happens in the piece. Focus instead on the major plot points and the main motivator for those points. Don't include everything that happens to the character along the way. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"The article focuses on guiding readers on how to effectively read and understand a piece of text, whether it's an argumentative article or a fiction piece. It suggests techniques such as reading slowly, rereading sentences or paragraphs, identifying main points or themes, and paying attention to the title, supporting materials, and detailed descriptions. The article also emphasizes the importance of putting the author's arguments or story in one's own words, and extracting key points without fully rewriting the content."},{"instruction":"Question: In what year was the iTunes store established?

The importance of the Bagmati also lies in the fact that Hindus are cremated on its banks, and Kirants are buried in the hills by its side. According to the Nepali Hindu tradition, the dead body must be dipped three times into the Bagmati before cremation. The chief mourner (usually the first son) who lights the funeral pyre must take a holy riverwater bath immediately after cremation. Many relatives who join the funeral procession also take bath in the Bagmati River or sprinkle the holy water on their bodies at the end of cremation as the Bagmati is believed to purify people spiritually. In addition to Hindus, who regards the Bagmati River as sacred?","output":"In addition to Hindus, Buddhists also regard the Bagmati River as sacred. The Bagmati River holds a significant place in the cultural and religious landscape of both Hindu and Buddhist communities in Nepal. The river is considered holy not only because of its proximity to numerous temples and religious sites along its banks but also due to the shared reverence for rivers and water bodies in both Hinduism and Buddhism. For Hindus, the Bagmati River is particularly important for its associations with cremation rituals and the belief in purification through contact with the river's waters. Meanwhile, for Buddhists, the Bagmati River is connected to the life and teachings of Lord Buddha. Several Buddhist stupas, monasteries, and places of worship can also be found along the river, highlighting its importance in the spiritual lives of both communities. The Bagmati River's sanctity is further encapsulated in the rich cultural heritage, religious festivals, and ceremonies observed by both Hindus and Buddhists. The river serves as a focal point for various rituals, prayers, and offerings, thereby fostering a sense of shared spirituality and cultural identity among the people of Kathmandu and the surrounding regions.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of water needed Marcus has 100 water balloons, each holding 3 ounces of water. Total water needed = 100 balloons × 3 ounces = 300 ounces Step 2: Calculate the number of water bottles Marcus needs to buy Each water bottle contains 50 ounces of water. Number of bottles needed = 300 ounces ÷ 50 ounces/bottle ≈ 6 bottles (5 bottles are not enough to fill all the balloons, so Marcus will need to buy 6 bottles) Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the water bottles Each water bottle costs 2.5. Total cost = 6 bottles × 2.5/bottle = 15 Step 4: Find out how much money Marcus has before purchasing the water bottles Marcus has 2 10 bills.

Burges inspired considerable loyalty within his team of assistants, and his partnerships were long-lived. John Starling Chapple was the office manager, joining Burges's practice in 1859. It was Chapple, designer of most of the furniture for Castell Coch, who completed its restoration after Burges's death. Second to Chapple was William Frame, who acted as clerk of works. Horatio Walter Lonsdale was Burges's chief artist, contributing extensive murals for both Castell Coch and Cardiff Castle. His main sculptor was Thomas Nicholls who started with Burges at Cork, completing hundreds of figures for Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral, worked with him on his two major churches in Yorkshire, and undertook all of the original carving for the Animal Wall at Cardiff.William Gualbert Saunders joined the Buckingham Street team in 1865 and worked with Burges on the development of the design and techniques of stained-glass manufacture, producing much of the best glass for Saint Fin Barre's. Ceccardo Egidio Fucigna was another long-time collaborator who sculpted the Madonna and Child above the drawbridge at Castell Coch, the figure of St John over the mantelpiece in Lord Bute's bedroom at Cardiff Castle and the bronze Madonna in the roof garden. Lastly, there was Axel Haig, a Swedish-born illustrator, who prepared many of the watercolour perspectives with which Burges entranced his clients.

(AP) — There are now 28 confirmed cases of hepatitis A in Virginia linked to Egyptian strawberries used by Tropical Smoothie Cafe franchises, and lawsuits are being filed. The Virginia Department of Health traced the source of the hepatitis A virus to frozen strawberries imported from Egypt and consumed in July or early August. The department also confirmed that all potentially contaminated berries were pulled from the 96 Tropical Smoothie Cafe locations in Virginia no later than Aug. 8 or Aug. 9. There are more than 500 of the smoothie franchises across the country, and Virginia is not the only state affected. Two others have reported recent hepatitis A outbreaks among people exposed to products from a Tropical Smoothie Cafe, said VDH spokeswoman Marian Hunter. The CDC is working with those states to determine if the cases are related to Virginia's outbreak. Hunter did not identify the states. The hepatitis A virus affects the liver, and symptoms can emerge relatively slowly, from 15 to 50 days after infection. They include yellowing of the skin or eyes, stomach and chest pain, fever and nausea. That makes it crucial to provide timely alerts about possible outbreaks, because a vaccine or immune globulin must be administered within two weeks of exposure to be effective at preventing the disease, according to a release from the VDH. Tropical Smoothie Cafe CEO Mike Rotondo issued a video apology on YouTube, and said \\"we voluntarily and immediately removed all of those strawberries from all of our cafes.

Options: (A) 28 (B) 16.0 (C) 16.4 (D) 16.8 (E) 16.1 Hmmm, my stream of consciousness:","output":"To determine the time required for the train to cross the bridge, we will follow these steps: 1. Convert the train's speed from km/h to meters per second (m/s). 2. Calculate the total distance the train needs to cover to cross the bridge completely. 3. Divide the total distance by the train's speed (in m/s) to find the time required. Step 1: Convert the speed from km/h to m/s: 1 km/h = (1000 m / 3600 s) = 5/18 m/s So, 36 km/h = (36 * 5/18) m/s = 10 m/s Step 2: Calculate the total distance required to cross the bridge: The train must cover the length of the bridge (170 m) and its own length (110 m) to cross the bridge. Total distance = Train length + Bridge length = 110 m + 170 m = 280 m Step 3: Determine the time required: Now, we'll divide the total distance by the train's speed (in m/s).

Fact 2: Most eukaryotes reproduce sexually. Given the two facts above, what reproduces sexually? Options are: (a). plants. (b). humans. (c). ferns. (d). bacteria. (e). bamboo. (f). legumes. (g). h2o. (h). viruses.","output":"Given Fact 1, that animals are a kingdom of multicellular eukaryotes, and Fact 2, that most eukaryotes reproduce sexually, we can deduce that the organisms that reproduce sexually are eukaryotes, which belong to multiple kingdoms. Among the options provided, I will explain each one individually: (a). Plants: Yes, many plants are known to reproduce sexually. They are classified under the kingdom Plantae, and they are also eukaryotes. Sexual reproduction in plants typically involves the production of specialized cells called spores or the formation of male and female gametes that fuse to create a zygote, which eventually gives rise to a new plant. (b). Humans: Yes, humans reproduce sexually. Humans belong to the kingdom Animalia, as mentioned in Fact 1, which is composed of multicellular eukaryotes. The sexual reproduction process in humans involves the production and fusion of male and female gametes, known as sperm and egg cells, respectively, leading to the formation of a zygote that develops into a new human being. (c). Ferns: Yes, many ferns reproduce sexually. Ferns are part of the plant kingdom (Plantae) and are also eukaryotes. They produce specialized structures, called sporangia, which release spores that can develop into gametophytes. These gametophytes produce male and female gametes, which fuse to form a zygote, eventually giving rise to a new fern. (d). Bacteria: No, bacteria do not reproduce sexually. Bacteria are prokaryotes and belong to the kingdom Monera. They reproduce mainly through binary fission, an asexual reproduction process where a single bacterial cell divides into two daughter cells. However, some bacteria can exchange genetic material through a process called conjugation, which is sometimes considered a form of sexual reproduction, but it is fundamentally different from the sexual reproduction observed in eukaryotes. (e). Bamboo: Yes, bamboo reproduces sexually. Bamboo belongs to the kingdom Plantae and is thus a eukaryote. They produce flowers and seeds, which facilitate sexual reproduction. The fusion of male and female gametes produces a zygote, leading to the development of a new bamboo plant. (f). Legumes: Yes, legumes reproduce sexually. Legumes are a group of plants belonging to the kingdom Plantae and are eukaryotes. They produce flowers, which contain male and female reproductive organs responsible for the formation and fusion of male and female gametes, resulting in the production of a zygote that develops into a new plant. (g). H2O: No, H2O (water) does not reproduce sexually, as it is a molecule and not a living organism. It does not have the necessary genetic material or biological structures to undergo any form of reproduction. (h). Viruses: No, viruses do not reproduce sexually. Viruses are not considered to be living organisms and do not fit into any of the known biological kingdoms. They reproduce by infecting host cells and manipulating the host's cellular machinery to produce more copies of the virus. While some viruses can exchange genetic material through a process called recombination, this is not considered sexual reproduction in the same sense as it occurs in eukaryotes. In conclusion, given the facts provided, organisms that reproduce sexually include plants (including ferns, bamboo, and legumes) and humans, which are all considered eukaryotes."},{"instruction":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

It is an unofficial but widely spoken language in Ukraine and Latvia, and to a lesser extent, the other countries that were once constituent republics of the Soviet Union and former participants of the Eastern Bloc. Russian belongs to the family of Indo-European languages and is one of the four living members of the East Slavic languages. Written examples of Old East Slavonic are attested from the 10th century and beyond. - Belarusians (\\"bielarusy\\"), or Byelorussians, are an East Slavic ethnic group who are native to modern-day Belarus and the immediate region. There are over 9.5 million people who proclaim Belarusian ethnicity worldwide, with overwhelming majority residing either in Belarus or the adjacent countries where they are an autochthonous minority. - The Tatars are a Turkic people living in Asia and Europe who were one of the five major tribal confederations (\\"khanlig\\") in the Mongolian plateau in the 12th century CE. The name \\"Tatar\\" first appears in written form on the Kul Tigin monument as (\\"TaTaR\\"). Historically, the term \\"Tatars\\" was applied to a variety of Turco-Mongol semi-nomadic empires who controlled the vast region known as Tartary. More recently, however, the term refers more narrowly to people who speak one of the Turkic languages. - Russians (\\"russkiye\\") are an East Slavic ethnic group native to Eastern Europe. The majority of Russians inhabit the nation state of Russia, while notable minorities exist in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and other former Soviet states such as Belarus. A large Russian diaspora exists all over the world, with notable numbers in the United States, Germany, Israel, and Canada. Russians are the most numerous ethnic group in Europe. - Belarus ( lat.

Options: - (A) live - (B) dense - (C) store - (D) grow - (E) work - (F) move - (G) growth - (H) ferns. Let's reason step-by-step:","output":"To answer this question correctly, we need to first understand what microtubules are and their functions in cells. Microtubules form part of the cytoskeleton that provides structural support, helps in organizing cell components, and is involved in a variety of cellular functions such as cell division, intracellular transport, and cell motility. Now let's consider each option: - (A) live: Microtubules aid in several processes involved in cell survival, but they are not exclusive to prokaryotes. - (B) dense: This option does not have a clear connection to microtubules or prokaryotic cells, hence it can be ruled out. - (C) store: While microtubules are involved in organizing cell components, they do not serve as storage structures for prokaryotes. - (D) grow: Microtubules do play a role in cell growth but primarily apply to eukaryotic organisms. - (E) work: This option is generic and may refer to many processes in which microtubules participate, however, it is not a precise answer. - (F) move: Microtubules can influence cell mobility; however, prokaryotes primarily rely on other structures like flagella for movement. - (G) growth: Similar to option (D), microtubules primarily play a role in eukaryotic cell growth, rather than prokaryotic growth. - (H) ferns: This option is irrelevant since ferns are plants, which are eukaryotic organisms, not prokaryotes. After analyzing all the given options, it can be concluded that none of them provide an accurate and specific description of the role microtubules play in prokaryotes.

Barry is specialized in subduction zones and new seafloor. Will is specialized in montology. Which person learned more about the Ring of Fire of the Pacific Ocean? Hint: As new seafloor forms and spreads apart from the mid-ocean ridge it slowly cools over time. Older seafloor is, therefore, colder than new seafloor, and older oceanic basins deeper than new oceanic basins due to isostasy. If the diameter of the earth remains relatively constant despite the production of new crust, a mechanism must exist by which crust is also destroyed. The destruction of oceanic crust occurs at subduction zones where oceanic crust is forced under either continental crust or oceanic crust. Today, the Atlantic basin is actively spreading at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Only a small portion of the oceanic crust produced in the Atlantic is subducted. However, the plates making up the Pacific Ocean are experiencing subduction along many of their boundaries which causes the volcanic activity in what has been termed the Ring of Fire of the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific is also home to one of the world's most active spreading centers (the East Pacific Rise) with spreading rates of up to 13 cm/yr. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a \\"textbook\\" slow-spreading center, while the East Pacific Rise is used as an example of fast spreading. Spreading centers at slow and intermediate rates exhibit a rift valley while at fast rates an axial high is found within the crustal accretion zone. The differences in spreading rates affect not only the geometries of the ridges but also the geochemistry of the basalts that are produced.Since the new oceanic basins are shallower than the old oceanic basins, the total capacity of the world's ocean basins decreases during times of active sea floor spreading. During the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, sea level was so high that a Western Interior Seaway formed across North America from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Answer:","output":"Barry learned more about the Ring of Fire of the Pacific Ocean. His specialization in subduction zones and new seafloor is directly related to the processes occurring in the Ring of Fire, such as the subduction of oceanic crust along plate boundaries, which leads to volcanic activity.

This included identifying the layout, security measures, and employee routines. By doing so, the spy could pinpoint the location of the note and prepare for possible obstacles. Step 2: Infiltrate the facility After acquiring a thorough understanding of the facility, the spy had to find an inconspicuous way to enter. Opting for a disguise, the spy posed as a maintenance worker to bypass initial security and gain access to restricted areas. Step 3: Reach the note's location With the disguise in place, the spy redirected the attention of the guards to create a clear path to the note’s location. This involved tampering with security systems, such as disabling CCTV cameras, to ensure that any suspicious activity went unnoticed. Step 4: Retrieve the paper Once at the note's location, the spy used advanced lock-picking skills to access the room where the paper was stored. The spy quickly grabbed the paper and concealed it in their tool bag, making sure not to leave any traces behind. Step 5: Attempt to acquire the note While obtaining the paper went smoothly, the note proved to be more challenging. It was stored in a highly secure vault, guarded by both heavy surveillance and reinforced doors. With the limited time the spy had before arousing suspicion, they made the difficult decision to abandon the quest for the note. Step 6: Exfiltrate the facility The spy knew that escaping with the paper was crucial, and any further effort towards acquiring the note would jeopardize the mission. Therefore, the spy carefully retraced their steps and left the facility, using their disguise to blend in with the exiting employees. Step 7: Deliver the paper to headquarters After successfully leaving the facility, the spy covertly handed over the retrieved paper to their handler. Although the note was not recovered, the information on the paper served as valuable intelligence that contributed to the overall success of the mission. In conclusion, the spy's resourcefulness, adaptability, and strategic thinking allowed them to retrieve crucial information despite facing numerous challenges.

If a cell was to get very large, the small surface area would not allow enough nutrients to enter the cell quickly enough for the cell’s needs. This idea is explained in Figure below . However, large cells have a way of dealing with some size challenges. Big cells, such as some white blood cells, often grow more nuclei so that they can supply enough proteins and RNA for the cell’s requirements. Large, metabolically active cells often have lots of cell protrusions, resulting in many folds throughout the membrane. These folds increase the surface area available for transport of materials into or out of the cell. Such cell types are found lining your small intestine, where they absorb nutrients from your food through protrusions called microvilli . Story: There are two cells inside a Petri dish in a laboratory, cell X and cell Z. These cells are from the same organism, but have different characteristics.

While Bianca was exposed mostly to indoor pollution, Rosa was heavily exposed to outdoor pollution. But I can use this background: Recall that air pollution is due to chemical substances and particles released into the air mainly by human actions. When most people think of air pollution, they think of the pollution outdoors. But it is just as easy to have indoor air pollution. Your home or school classroom probably doesn't get much fresh air. Sealing up your home reduces heating and cooling costs. But this also causes air pollution to stay trapped indoors. And people today usually spend a majority of their time indoors. So exposure to indoor air pollution can become a significant health risk. What is an answer for this question: Which sister was less exposed to air pollution because of cutting heating costs? The answer is:","output":"Bianca was less exposed to air pollution because of cutting heating costs. Since sealing up homes reduces heating and cooling costs but also traps air pollution indoors, and Bianca was exposed mostly to indoor pollution, it is likely that measures taken to cut heating costs in her environment contributed to a lower exposure than Rosa, who was heavily exposed to outdoor pollution."},{"instruction":"FINAL EXAM Question 1.

This process, which helps us to deal with culture shock , is the way our head and our personality react to(...) the strange new things we meet with when we move from one culture to another. Culture begins with the \\"honeymoon stage\\". This is the time when we first arrive in which everything about the new culture is strange and exciting. We see new things, hear new sounds and language, eat new kinds of food. This stage can last for quite a long time because we feel we are very excited. Unluckily, the second stage can be more difficult. After we have got used to our new life, we can become very tired and begin to miss our homeland and our family, friends, pets. All the little problems in life seem to be much bigger and more disturbing when you face them in a foreign culture. This time of cultural adjustment can be very difficult and lead to pulling away from the new culture. The third stage is called the \\"adjustment stage\\". This is when you begin to realize that things are not so bad in the host culture. Your sense of humor usually becomes stronger and you realize that you are becoming stronger by learning to take care of yourself in the new place. Things are still difficult, but you are now a survivor! The fourth stage can be called \\"at ease at last\\". Now you feel quite comfortable in your new place. You can deal with most problems that you have. You may still have problems with the language, but you know you are strong enough to deal with them. There is a fifth stage of culture shock which many people don't know about. This is called \\"reverse culture shock\\". Surprisingly, this happens when you go back to your own culture and find that you have changed and that things there have changed while you have been away. Now you feel a little uncomfortable back home. Life is a struggle! What's the main idea of the passage? A) Human beings would pass through four stages when they begin to live in a new culture.

We eventually had a technician from John Moore come out to fix this problem. He was nice enough and took the time to explain to me why it had stopped working and how he would fix this. After about 30 minutes he had completed this and then offered as a free service to inspect the electrical parts of the house. He went out back to the fuse box to look and then after inspection offered to show me what he had found. It was mid to late afternoon in the back yard and that’s when the sun is aiming straight to my back yard. I should mention we live in Texas. He went over ever single fuse and wire that we had and explained about the piping and all the other things that go with it and that what we have isn’t what is recommended anymore. Our house was about 9 years old at the time. We were back there for more than 90 minutes. I started getting very restless because I wanted to work on dinner, the sun was blazing hot and I needed to do many other things. It was coming up on 5 o’clock. He then went to his truck to write up an estimate. After 20 minutes or so he comes back and tells me it will be about 10,000 to fix our fuse box system. So what started out for changing a light bulb was going to end up costing 10K. We did later get it looked at by someone else that is qualified in this field,m who was there working on some other project and he said there was nothing wrong with what we had. The worker probably believes: Pick the correct answer from the following options: - not enough information - the writer is pushover - his tools are in the truck - he can fix this bulb quickly","output":"Based on the information provided, it is clear that the technician from John Moore was able to fix the light bulb issue, as he completed the task within 30 minutes. Afterward, he offered a free inspection of the electrical parts of the house, which led him to discover potential issues with the fuse box system. Taking into account that the house was only 9 years old at the time and another qualified professional confirmed there were no issues with the fuse box later on, it is probable that the technician from John Moore believed there was room to provide additional services and generate more revenue by offering an expensive upgrade for the fuse box system. However, it is important to note that this belief may not have been reflective of the technician's intentions or character, as the writer also mentioned his politeness, thoroughness, and willingness to explain the issues he found in detail. It is possible that the technician genuinely thought the fuse box system needed an upgrade, even if it was later confirmed to be unnecessary. In any case, the writer does not come across as a pushover, but rather as a cautious and responsible individual who sought a second opinion before making a significant financial decision. To answer the question, the worker (technician from John Moore) probably believed that the fuse box system needed an upgrade, even though the primary issue had already been resolved. But it is difficult to pinpoint his exact beliefs without more information."},{"instruction":"Short movie review: cause parents a few sleepless hours -- Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"Based on the given phrase, it appears that the critic had a somewhat negative perception of the movie, but this statement needs more context to fully ascertain their opinion. The phrase \\"cause parents a few sleepless hours\\" suggests that the movie might have been either emotionally distressing or exceedingly worrying for parents. This implies that the film might have contained content or themes that could be hard for parents to watch or digest, or it could have been unsuitable for their children to watch. A possible interpretation of this statement is that the movie may contain mature or disturbing themes that might raise concerns for parents who have young children. This can be seen as a negative perception, as it might require parents to take extra measures in deciding if the film is appropriate for their family or be prepared to engage in potentially difficult conversations with their children to explain the content after watching the movie. Alternatively, the critic could be referring to the fact that the movie is so engaging and thought-provoking that it leaves parents awake at night, pondering over the themes and messages presented in the film. In this case, the comment could be seen as being both positive and negative. The positive aspect would be that the movie was captivating and impactful enough to leave a lasting impression, while the negative side would be the uneasy feeling and potential sleeplessness it provokes. In conclusion, the critic's statement suggests a somewhat negative view of the film when considering its impact on parents. However, determining the exact sentiment behind this comment would require more context about the movie itself and the overall tone of the critic's review.

Step 3: Identify the main components of the hypothesis - The main components in the hypothesis are \\"they should have term limits\\" and \\"for advocating an amendment.\\" Step 4: Determine if the components are related - In this context, \\"they\\" likely refers to the organization or movement described in the original premise. - \\"Term limits\\" pertains to the proposal of restricting the number of terms an individual can serve in a given position. - \\"For advocating an amendment\\" suggests that term limits should be applied to the process of promoting an amendment. Step 5: Determine if the hypothesis aligns with the premise - The premise states that Term Limits Now is advocating a constitutional amendment. - The hypothesis posits that term limits should be applied to advocacy efforts. Based on the analysis, the hypothesis \\"They should have term limits for advocating an amendment\\" seems to diverge from the original premise because it introduces the idea of applying term limits to the advocacy process itself. The premise, on the other hand, highlights the existence of a movement supporting term limits as a constitutional amendment."},{"instruction":"Consider the question. The Playboy Club was initially a chain of nightclubs and resorts owned and operated by Playboy Enterprises. The first club opened at 116 E. Walton Street in downtown Chicago, Illinois, United States, on February 29, 1960. Each club generally featured a Living Room, a Playmate Bar, a Dining Room, and a Club Room. Members and their guests were served food and drinks by Playboy Bunnies, some of whom were featured in Playboy magazine. The clubs offered name entertainers and comedians in the Club Rooms, and local musicians and the occasional close-up magician in the Living Rooms. Starting with the London and Jamaica club locations, the Playboy Club became international in scope. In 1991, the club chain became defunct. On October 6, 2006 a new club was opened in Las Vegas, and in 2010 new clubs were opened as well in Macao and Cancun. In time the Las Vegas club closed on June 4, 2012, the Macao club closed in 2013 and the Cancun club closed in 2014.

Preparing everything from homemade sauce, meatballs, chicken parmesan, and almond biscotti to name a few. DeFalco's offers an extensive menu (both for takeout and dine-in), and although I venture here 2-3 times per week I remain loyal to a few selections on their menu. If you are feeling like a sandwich I urge you to order the homemade Meatball Sandwich on the crispy baguette - or - if you're feeling like chicken then I must recommend you try the Chicken Pesto Sandwich (again, on the crispy baguette). I'm a hot/toasted sandwich type of girl so I can't speak for the cold sandwiches, but I can assure you won't be disappointed with any selection given that all their breads are delivered fresh daily, meats and cheeses are sliced to order in house, and their toppings are fresh to boot! To complete my go-to list I also recommend trying the Chicken Pesto Salad and a few side salads including the tuna pasta salad (BEST EVER), the chicken caesar pasta salad, pesto pasta salad, and....the tomato and basil salad (of course you must drizzle a little evoo and balsamic to make it truly Italian).

In German, the future tense is formed with the auxiliary verb werden (to become) before the verb. The verb \\"welcome\\" is \\"begrüßen\\" in German, and in this context, it's positioned at the end of the sentence, which is common in German syntax. 2. \\"by the works\\" is translated as \\"von den Werken\\". In German, the preposition \\"von\\" often translates to \\"by\\". The plural definite article \\"the\\" is \\"den\\" in German when used in a dative case following the preposition \\"von\\". 3. \\"of the sculptor Giulio Ciampi\\" is translated as \\"des Bildhauers Giulio Ciampi\\". In German, \\"of the\\" translates to \\"des\\" when the following noun is masculine and singular, which fits for \\"Bildhauer\\" (sculptor). 4. \\"and by our friendly staff\\" is translated to \\"und von unserem freundlichen Personal\\". Here, \\"und\\" is the conjunction \\"and\\", \\"von\\" is again the preposition \\"by\\", \\"unserem\\" is the dative form of \\"unser\\" (our), while \\"freundlichen\\" means \\"friendly\\", and \\"Personal\\" refers to staff.

The term \\"spirited\\" when used to describe a movie or film generally implies a sense of liveliness, energy, enthusiasm, or vivacity. It usually means that the film is full of heart or passion that it manages to convey through its storytelling, acting, direction, cinematography, and other elements. Typically, this would refer to a film that is engaging, dynamic, uplifting, or inspirational in some way. Therefore, the sentiment is certainly positive as it implies a degree of enjoyment and appreciation. The phrase would most likely be used as praise by a reviewer or audience member, in both informal conversation or formal critique. In evaluating sentiment, we are looking at the tone or mood conveyed by the language used. Sentiment may be positive, negative, or neutral. Positive sentiment indicates a favorable or optimistic view of the subject in question. Negative sentiment, on the other hand, suggests an unfavorable or pessimistic view. Neutral sentiment indicates a lack of particularly strong feelings either way; the language used is neither strongly positive nor negative. In this case, the use of 'spirited' indicates a positive sentiment. To further analyze this sentence, one must understand the role of adjectives and how they convey sentiment. The word \\"spirited\\" is an adjective that is being used to describe the noun \\"film\\". Adjectives in language are used to add characteristics or attributes to the noun, these can include emotions, qualities, amounts, size, condition, origin etc. The adjective used here express an emotional state - spirited being positive here. This notion of sentiment analysis plays a significant role in fields such as data mining, social media monitoring, brand management, and consumer reviews, where understanding public opinion or mood towards a particular item, product, or event is of utmost important.

A star-studded ensemble was featured, including the likes of A-listers Jared Stone and Samantha Hawkes. What should have been a slam dunk has ultimately turned into a sprawling mess of misplaced intentions and cinematic ambiguity, as the film proves itself to be no more effective than a sleeping pill. The Disastrous Escape follows the story of a small group of high-ranking government officials trying to escape a deadly threat orchestrated by an international terrorist organization, while uncovering their hidden motivations. Jared Stone stars as James Ford, a former CIA operative now working undercover to unveil the group's dastardly plans. Hawkes plays Amelia Portman, a skilled assassin who reluctantly partners with Ford to fight against the common enemy. As promising as the premise sounds, it all goes downhill from there. The script, penned by Jack Harbor, is a convoluted mess, filled with hackneyed tropes, inconsistent characterization, and an almost offensive degree of plot contrivances. There is never a moment of genuine tension or suspense, as every twist feels predictable and ham-fisted. Stone's portrayal of James Ford is a hollow and disconnected performance that notably lacks any real emotion or depth. His delivery is wooden, and the over-the-top action sequences ultimately overshadow his acting career by focusing more on gratuitous explosions rather than allowing viewers to genuinely connect with Ford's struggle. Hawkes, whose recent performance in The Unraveling showcased her incredible range, is disappointingly reduced to a one-dimensional character. Although she tries to breathe life into Amelia Portman, the thinly written character and unconvincing dialogue make it near impossible for her to truly shine. Supporting actors fare little better, as they are relegated to stereotypes, archetypes, and caricatures that only serve to further tarnish the movie's already meager sense of credibility. A particularly grating performance comes from the portrayer of the main villain, Anton Kozlov. Pierce Madsen’s attempt at a sinister delivery comes across as laughably absurd, with the character's over-exaggerated Russian accent and incessant raving about his ultimate plan quickly approaching parody. Technical aspects of the film are no better than the narrative and performances. Uninspired cinematography and poorly-rendered CGI dominate every frame, with lackluster editing that makes every action scene feel disjointed and clumsy. An abundance of camera shakes and abrupt jump cuts only muddle the narrative further, disorienting viewers as they try to piece together the poorly-executed story progression. The film's score, crafted by up-and-coming composer Julia Beck, is largely forgettable and fails to elevate any of the key moments. It's a mishmash of lower-quality stock music that rather distracts than enhances the movie-watching experience and ultimately adds to the film's resounding confusion. In conclusion, The Disastrous Escape is an unfortunate amalgamation of missed opportunities, clichés, and technical incompetence. It will likely leave audiences feeling cheated and exhausted by the end, wishing they had invested their time in something of actual cinematic substance. Instead, seek refuge in the treasure trove of classic thrillers or current series available on popular streaming services for a more satisfying viewing experience. This film provides neither entertainment nor artistic merit and should rightfully be filed away as a cinematic misfire."},{"instruction":"Cubism Cubism was relevant to an architecture seeking a style that needed not refer to the past. Thus, what had become a revolution in both painting and sculpture was applied as part of \\"a profound reorientation towards a changed world\\". The Cubo-Futurist ideas of Filippo Tommaso Marinetti influenced attitudes in avant-garde architecture. The influential De Stijl movement embraced the aesthetic principles of Neo-plasticism developed by Piet Mondrian under the influence of Cubism in Paris. De Stijl was also linked by Gino Severini to Cubist theory through the writings of Albert Gleizes. However, the linking of basic geometric forms with inherent beauty and ease of industrial application—which had been prefigured by Marcel Duchamp from 1914—was left to the founders of Purism, Amédée Ozenfant and Charles-Édouard Jeanneret (better known as Le Corbusier,) who exhibited paintings together in Paris and published Après le cubisme in 1918. Le Corbusier's ambition had been to translate the properties of his own style of Cubism to architecture. Between 1918 and 1922, Le Corbusier concentrated his efforts on Purist theory and painting. In 1922, Le Corbusier and his cousin Jeanneret opened a studio in Paris at 35 rue de Sèvres. His theoretical studies soon advanced into many different architectural projects. Q: The ideas of which Cubo Futurist influenced the avant-garde in architecture?","output":"The ideas of Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, a Cubo-Futurist, influenced the avant-garde in architecture."},{"instruction":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","output":"Context: The growth of urbanization has led to a significant increase in the number of high-rise residential buildings in the last few decades. These buildings offer various advantages such as economic use of land, efficient utilization of resources, and modern infrastructure. However, concerns have arisen regarding the potential impact these high-rise buildings have on the overall well-being and mental health of their residents. An increasing number of studies are being conducted to understand the factors contributing to the potential negative impact. One such factor under investigation is the limited exposure to natural light in high-rise buildings compared to regular low-rise housing options. Hypothesis: The reduced exposure to natural light in high-rise residential buildings has a negative impact on the mental health and well-being of its occupants. In order to investigate the hypothesis, several aspects need to be considered. These aspects may include the effects of natural light on human physiology and psychology, the comparison of natural light availability in high-rise and low-rise buildings, the mental health issues observed among high-rise building occupants, and possible initiatives and design solutions to mitigate the negative impact. 1. Effects of Natural Light: Natural light plays a vital role in maintaining human health. It helps regulate the body's circadian rhythms, stimulates the production of vitamin D, improves mood, and affects cognitive performance. It is crucial to understand how reduced natural light exposure may contribute to mental health issues: a. Circadian Rhythms: Insufficient natural light exposure can disrupt the normal functioning of the circadian rhythms, leading to sleep disorders, mood swings, and other related issues. b. Vitamin D Production: Natural light, especially sunlight, stimulates vitamin D production in the body. Low levels of vitamin D have been associated with an increased risk of depression, fatigue, and weakened immune system. c. Mood Enhancement: Exposure to natural light, particularly in the morning, has been shown to improve mood and increase alertness by stimulating the production of serotonin, often referred to as the \\"feel-good\\" hormone. d. Cognitive Performance: Studies suggest that exposure to natural light improves cognitive performance, increasing focus, memory, and problem-solving abilities. 2. Comparison of Natural Light Availability: To establish a connection between reduced natural light exposure and mental health, it is important to determine if high-rise buildings indeed offer less exposure to natural light compared to low-rise buildings. Factors such as building orientation, window sizes, and the proximity to other structures could be compared to understand the difference in natural light availability. 3. Mental Health Issues in High-Rise Buildings: While multiple factors contribute to the mental health and well-being of an individual, it is important to assess if there is a noticeable increase in mental health issues, such as depression, anxiety, and stress, among high-rise building occupants. Gathering data on mental health cases and comparing those to people living in low-rise buildings could provide valuable insights. 4. Design Solutions and Initiatives: The hypothesis unravels opportunities to explore design solutions that potentially help increase natural light exposure in high-rise buildings. Some possible solutions may include larger windows, incorporation of balconies, light-reflecting surfaces, and the implementation of light wells to bring natural light into the interior spaces. Supporting initiatives, like mandatory requirements for natural light in building codes and guidelines, could be recommended to promote well-being among high-rise building occupants. In conclusion, to investigate the hypothesis that reduced exposure to natural light in high-rise residential buildings has a negative impact on the mental health and well-being of its occupants, it is essential to understand the role of natural light in human health, compare light availability in different housing types, identify the prevalence of mental health issues in high-rise buildings, and suggest potential design solutions and initiatives to address the problem. Through this comprehensive approach, the connections between high-rise living, natural light exposure, and mental health can be better understood and addressed."},{"instruction":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Joshua and his boss, Vincent, are driving to a hospital. Both have been shot and are in pain. Joshua thinks back to his childhood, when his father was shot in front of his eyes. In a flashback, Joshua and his partner, Mickey, visit people that owe money to Vincent. They encounter a crazy druggie who tells them that a small-time drug dealer named Frankie Tahoe wants to kill Vincent. Joshua and Mickey inform Vincent, and the trio intimidate a guy who works for Tahoe into telling them where he can be found. They find Tahoe at a nightclub. During a talk, Tahoe insults the religion of Joshua and Vincent, which they hold dear, and Vincent beats Tahoe to death with a baseball bat. The trio dump the body in a landfill. While doing this, Vincent reveals that Mickey and Vincent's wife have been having an affair. Vincent then kills Mickey. While Joshua and Vincent are having breakfast, Joshua tells his boss that he has become weary of the violence and wants to retire. Vincent admits that he has violent outbursts but insists that Joshua owes him his life. Angered, Vincent says that Joshua cannot retire. He leaves to go home, where he discovers two men watching his house. While confronting them, Joshua appears. The men tell Vincent that they have been ordered to deliver him to Nino, a powerful crime boss. When Nino calls his men, Vincent answers the cellphone. Vincent and Joshua get in the car and are driven to Nino's house. Answer:","output":"The first name of the person who is tired of the violence is Joshua. In the given context, Joshua expresses his weariness regarding the violent lifestyle he's been leading with his boss, Vincent. This feeling of exhaustion stems from the constant acts of violence and aggression that he has witnessed and participated in during his time working for Vincent, as well as traumatic experiences from his childhood, such as seeing his father being shot.

The basic SI unit for mass is the kilogram (kg), but smaller masses may be measured in grams (g). To measure mass, you would use a balance. In the lab, mass may be measured with a triple beam balance or an electronic balance, but the old-fashioned balance pictured below may give you a better idea of what mass is. If both sides of this balance were at the same level, it would mean that the fruit in the left pan has the same mass as the iron object in the right pan. In that case, the fruit would have a mass of 1 kg, the same as the iron. As you can see, however, the fruit is at a higher level than the iron. This means that the fruit has less mass than the iron, that is, the fruit's mass is less than 1 kg. Johnathan is trying to find two blocks of wood with the same mass for a project he is working on. He doesn't have a balance, so he makes a crude one out of materials he has on hand. He put a block of wood on either side and the block on the left side was at a lower level than the block on the right. If Johnathan put two new blocks of wood on the balance and their levels are equal is their mass uneven or the same?

Liverpool’s penalty shootout win over Manchester City in New York will be little consolation for losing out in the Premier League title race on the final day of last season, but it gave some indication that Brendan Rodgers’s side are set to be contenders again. Both sides are expected to line up quite differently on August 17 and made a number of changes throughout Wednesday’s match, making it difficult to judge their pre-season progress. MailOnline looks at what we learned from the slug-out at Yankee Stadium …. Scroll down for videos. First blood: Liverpool defeated Manchester City on penalties in the International Champions Cup friendly. Jordan Henderson and Philippe Coutinho impressed among the Liverpool starters and Raheem Sterling gave his side a much sharper attacking edge when he came on in the second half before scoring the late equaliser. It wasn’t the best of days again for Steven Gerrard whose latest slip let in Stevan Jovetic for City’s opening goal, but Rodgers has no doubt his skipper will be a key player in that deep-lying role again this season. ‘We were unfortunate with the first goal that deflected off Stevie and Jovetic got a toe on it,’ said the Liverpool boss. ‘But he’s been playing that role for the last 12 months and I’m sure he’ll play it this season as well. He’s got a wonderful range of pass, his movement is good to get on the ball and he’s very committed.’ Red leader: Steven Gerrard (C) is set to resume his deep lying position in midfield. Making up for lost time: Stevan Jovetic scored both of Manchester City's goals in normal time. It’s early days but already Jovetic looks determined to make up for lost time after an injury-hit first season at City. The Montenegro international scored twice to take his total to two in four games on tour, and will be as good as new signing 12 months after arriving from Fiorentina for £22m. Joe Hart made three fantastic saves after coming on at half-time even though he was outshone by Simon Mignolet in the shootout. The Liverpool keeper kept out Yaya Toure’s effort as the Ivorian made a subdued first appearance since threatening to quit the champions this summer. Liverpool changed formation and players so often it was hard to keep track. Rodgers may well settle for his midfield diamond again this season although it is clear he wants his side to be versatile as well. He said: ‘We played two different formations – a 4-4-2 diamond in the first half which refreshed the players from some of the work they had last season. At times we worked it well but it was good to see it. Second half it was more of a 4-3-3 and then we changed again with 20 minutes to 4-2-3-1. Multi-talented: Philippe Coutinho's versaility gave Liverpool plenty of options with formations. Double salvo: Jovetic scores City's second goal but could do nothing to prevent them losing on penalties. ‘We had a connection through Coutinho who played a lot from the sides and the top of the diamond. The last 20 minutes he played in behind Daniel Sturridge to connect midfield and the front men. That made passes shorter and the movement better.’ City lined up in more of a conventional 4-4-2 formation with Edin Dzeko and James Milner their first World Cup players to make an appearance in the US, although Manuel Pellegrini will probably revert to his favoured 4-2-3-1 once the season starts. It will be interesting to see how new £12m signing Fernando fits in with Toure and Fernandinho occupying those defensive midfield slots last season. City certainly have more in reserve with David Silva, Samir Nasri and Alvaro Negredo among the unused substitutes at Yankee Stadium. They are also waiting to welcome back captain Vincent Kompany, Fernandinho and World Cup finalists Sergio Aguero, Pablo Zabaleta and Martin Demichelis, who report back on Monday. Super sub: Raheem Sterling made an impression after coming off the bench at the Yankees Stadium. In the family: City goalkeeper Joe Hart embraces brothers Kolo and Yaya Toure at full-time. ‘The five players who arrived last Thursday, Hart, Milner, Yaya, Silva and Dzeko, I think that they will be ready for the Premier League,’ said Pellegrini. ‘We will with see the rest of the players who arrive next Monday. Can they be fit in 15 days? Maybe not all of them will do it.’ Sterling made the biggest impact of Liverpool’s substitutes, but Lucas Leiva supplied a sublime touch for Henderson to score their first goal and Mignolet emerged as the hero of the shootout. Both of the men in charge seemed happy enough with the evening’s exertions, if not the quality of parts of the playing surface. Coach Rodgers was delighted with the way his team twice fought back from a goal down. ‘Even though it was a pre-season game it was highly competitive,’ he said. ‘The players showed the character to keep going and come back. It was a really good game. We have to respect the quality we were playing against. City are a top side, one of the best teams in Europe.’ Coach trip: Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers (L) and Man City's Manuel Pellegrini (R) were generally pleased. Coach Pellegrini knows there is more to come from his squad but was satisfied with what he saw. ‘It was a very useful game for both teams,’ said the City boss. ‘We are trying to prepare our team in the best way. We’ve had a very good pre-season with part of the team. We had another five players playing some minutes today. The rest of the squad arrive next week we are preparing well for the Community Shield and Premier League.’ Liverpool still need to convince people that they can withstand the loss of Luis Suarez and re-establish themselves as title contenders this season. New signing Rickie Lambert wasted a gilt-edged chance in the first half and Daniel Sturridge was also subdued for long periods. Kolo Toure and Sebastian Coates started in central defence but some question if they can be trusted after defensive frailties cost Liverpool dear last season. Weak link: There were question marks over Kolo Toure's performance in central defence. City, meanwhile, need to complete the £32m signing of Eliaquim Mangala which has been dragging on since January. Despite signing Fernando, Bacary Sagna and Willy Caballero, a new centre-back was the priority and Mangala does not seem to be falling over himself to come to Manchester. Judging by the form of Kelechi Iheanacho on tour, City also need to sort out a work permit for the Nigerian teenager as soon as possible. Of the squad that turned up at Yankee Stadium, Scott Sinclair, Matija Nastasic, Micah Richards, Javi Garcia and Jack Rodwell could all be gone by the time the transfer window shuts. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1. Liverpool defeated Manchester City on penalties in the International Champions Cup friendly. 2.

A dark-haired woman (Harring) escapes her own murder, surviving a car accident on Mulholland Drive. Injured and in shock, she descends into Los Angeles and sneaks into an apartment that an older, red-headed woman has just vacated. An aspiring actress named Betty Elms (Watts) arrives at the same apartment and finds the dark-haired woman confused, not knowing her own name. The dark-haired woman assumes the name \\"Rita\\" after seeing a poster for the film Gilda (1946), starring Rita Hayworth. To help Rita remember her identity, Betty looks in Rita's purse, where she finds a large amount of money and an unusual blue key. In what seems to be a scene from a different narrative, set at a diner called Winkies, a man (Patrick Fischler) tells his companion (Michael Cooke) about a nightmare in which he dreamt there was a horrible figure behind the diner. When they investigate, the figure appears, causing the man with the nightmare to collapse in fright. As the principal narrative resumes, Hollywood director Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux) has his film commandeered by apparent mobsters, who insist he cast an unknown actress named Camilla Rhodes (Melissa George) as the lead in his film. After he resists, he returns home to find his wife having an affair and is thrown out of his house. He later learns that his bank has closed his line of credit and he is broke. He agrees to meet a mysterious figure called The Cowboy, who urges him to cast Camilla Rhodes for his own good. Later, a bungling hit man (Mark Pellegrino) attempts to steal a book full of phone numbers and leaves three people dead.

BUT, it was underlit to the point of confusion. You don't really know what is always going on in the dark scenes and for a film that is shot on Super 8 Film, you already have all that nasty grain to deal with. As with Nathan Schiff movies, it's just too much. Director Leif Jonker seems to want to make an original film, but he lacks the know-how to do it.

We need to isolate the variable o, so we'll divide both sides of the equation by -5: (-10) / (-5) = (-5) * o / (-5) 4.

On the bright side, Dudovitz has extended his respected program to clients in the San Gabriel-Pomona Valley, and he now operates on a much larger budget, 6.5 million last year.

Two occupants of the car are killed while Chris and his girlfriend Kelly survive. However, the crash leaves Chris with lasting mental impairments, including anterograde amnesia, along with some anger management issues. Four years later, he's in classes to learn new skills, including the simple sequencing of daily tasks to compensate for his inability to remember, and keeps notes to himself in a small notebook. Challenged by a tough case manager to build a life despite his injuries, he is emotionally supported by his roommate, a blind man named Lewis, but receives only financial support from his wealthy family. Chris works nights, cleaning a small-town bank. Aside from Lewis his only friend is Ted, a seemingly clumsy Sheriff's Deputy who checks in on Chris regularly. Chris repeatedly tries to convince the bank's manager, Mr Tuttle, to allow him to apply for a teller job, to no avail. Chris soon comes under the scrutiny of a gang planning to rob the bank. Their leader, Gary, who knew Chris from high school and resented his wealth and popularity as a hockey star before his accident, befriends him and uses a young woman, Luvlee Lemons, to seduce him. Taunted by the gang about the limitations of his life since the accident, Chris initially goes along with the scheme. His frustrations trickle down into confrontations with his friends, Lewis and Ted. When the gang arrives the night of the robbery, Chris tells them he has changed his mind. But they tell him it's too late and force him to empty the vault at gunpoint. His friend Ted, the deputy, stumbles into the robbery while delivering doughnuts to Chris, and triggers a shootout. The deputy and two of the gang members, Marty and Cork, are killed.

The residents are convinced that Nick is in town on an investigation, despite Nick's repeated denials. However, when aircraft factory employee Peter Berton (Ralph Brooks) seeks out Nick and is shot dead before he can reveal anything, Nick is on the case. An old childhood friend, Dr. Bruce Clayworth (Lloyd Corrigan), performs the autopsy and extracts a pistol bullet. Then, when Nick searches Berton's room for clues, he is knocked unconscious by Crazy Mary (Anne Revere), a local eccentric. Nora's innocent purchase of a painting for Nick's birthday present turns out to be the key to the mystery. When she shows it to her husband, it brings back unpleasant memories for him, so she donates it to a charity bazaar. When Edgar Draque (Leon Ames) offers Nora a large sum for the painting, Nick wonders why it is so valuable. Nick learns that Draque's wife Helena (Helen Vinson) bought the artwork, but she is knocked out and the painting disappears. Nick discovers that Crazy Mary is Berton's mother and goes to see her, only to come across her lifeless body. Nick and Nora's dog Asta finds the painting in her shack.

To generate a sentence that would be considered grammatically unacceptable, one must identify specific areas where mistakes can be introduced, such as subject-verb agreement, preposition usage, tense consistency, and proper syntax, among others. Let's create a sentence with various grammatical errors: \\"She don't walks to theirs schools at evenings, since it's much stores there also.\\" In this sentence, multiple grammatical issues are present: 1. Subject-Verb Agreement: The subject \\"she\\" does not align with the verb \\"don't\\" (doesn't). The correct form should be \\"She doesn't walk.\\" 2. Preposition Use: The possessive pronoun \\"theirs\\" should be replaced with the correct form \\"their.\\" Additionally, the preposition \\"at\\" should be \\"in\\" for more accurate phrasing. 3. Verb tense consistency: The verb \\"walks\\" should match the tense of \\"don't\\" (i.e., \\"doesn't walk\\" or \\"doesn't walk\\"). 4. Usage of \\"evenings\\": It should be \\"in the evening\\" instead of \\"at evenings.\\" 5. Unnecessary comma: There should not be a comma after the word \\"evenings.\\" 6. Improper coordination: The conjunction \\"since\\" should be replaced by \\"because,\\" and a comma should be added before it (\\"evening, because\\"). 7. Sentence fragmentation: \\"it's much stores there also\\" is a fragment that should be revised to \\"there are many stores there as well.\\" The corrected sentence would be: \\"She doesn't walk to their school in the evening because there are many stores there as well.\\" By identifying and addressing these grammatical issues, we can transform the unacceptable sentence into one that adheres to proper English grammar conventions."},{"instruction":"Dialogue: Anita: Where RU???

He was trying to figure out how the Earth's inner core is made. To that end, he compared earth's physical characteristics to available items. First he took a sample of surface rock, which he labeled as item B. Then he took a sphere of constant density, which he labeled as item C. Finally, he labeled the Earth as item A. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which would have higher specific gravity, item A or item B? Hint: Evidence from seismology, heat flow at the surface, and mineral physics is combined with the Earth's mass and moment of inertia to infer models of the Earth's interior – its composition, density, temperature, pressure. For example, the Earth's mean specific gravity (5.515) is far higher than the typical specific gravity of rocks at the surface (2.7–3.3), implying that the deeper material is denser. This is also implied by its low moment of inertia ( 0.33 M R2, compared to 0.4 M R2 for a sphere of constant density). However, some of the density increase is compression under the enormous pressures inside the Earth. The effect of pressure can be calculated using the Adams–Williamson equation. The conclusion is that pressure alone cannot account for the increase in density. Instead, we know that the Earth's core is composed of an alloy of iron and other minerals.Reconstructions of seismic waves in the deep interior of the Earth show that there are no S-waves in the outer core. This indicates that the outer core is liquid, because liquids cannot support shear. The outer core is liquid, and the motion of this highly conductive fluid generates the Earth's field. Earth's inner core, however, is solid because of the enormous pressure.Reconstruction of seismic reflections in the deep interior indicate some major discontinuities in seismic velocities that demarcate the major zones of the Earth: inner core, outer core, mantle, lithosphere and crust. The mantle itself is divided into the upper mantle, transition zone, lower mantle and D′′ layer. Between the crust and the mantle is the Mohorovičić discontinuity.The seismic model of the Earth does not by itself determine the composition of the layers. For a complete model of the Earth, mineral physics is needed to interpret seismic velocities in terms of composition. The mineral properties are temperature-dependent, so the geotherm must also be determined. This requires physical theory for thermal conduction and convection and the heat contribution of radioactive elements.... Answer:","output":"Item A (Earth) would have a higher specific gravity than item B (surface rock). As stated in the given information, the Earth's mean specific gravity (5.515) is significantly higher than the typical specific gravity of rocks at the surface (2.7-3.3). This implies that the deeper materials in the Earth are denser than the rocks found at the surface. While pressure does play a role in increasing density, Earth's core composition and seismic wave behavior are essential in understanding its higher specific gravity compared to surface rocks."},{"instruction":"In this task, you will use your knowledge about language (and common sense) to determine what element the marked number refers to.

These two sentences refer to the transition between the old year and the new one: 1. \\"The first day is the last day of the year.\\" This sentence implies that the first day of the year is the last day of the previous year. So, in talking about the change from the old year to the new one, this sentence is highlighting the end of the old period. It suggests that on the first day of the year, we are still reflecting on the old year which has just ended. 2. \\"The last day is the first day of the old year.\\" This sentence has a similar meaning, but it phrases it differently. Here, the last day of the year is emphasized as the first day of the old year. This sentence also refers to the transition from the old year to the new one. However, this time it highlights the start of the prior year. The focus is on the beginning of the old year, but in both cases, they represent the same day.

While utilizing effective propaganda such as the cutting of the Gordian Knot, he also attempted to portray himself as a living god and son of Zeus following his visit to the oracle at Siwah in the Libyan Desert (in modern-day Egypt) in 331 BC. His attempt in 327 BC to have his men prostrate before him in Bactra in an act of proskynesis borrowed from the Persian kings was rejected as religious blasphemy by his Macedonian and Greek subjects after his court historian Callisthenes refused to perform this ritual. When Alexander had Parmenion murdered at Ecbatana (near modern Hamadan, Iran) in 330 BC, this was \\"symptomatic of the growing gulf between the king's interests and those of his country and people\\", according to Errington. His murder of Cleitus the Black in 328 BC is described as \\"vengeful and reckless\\" by Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington. Continuing the polygamous habits of his father, Alexander encouraged his men to marry native women in Asia, leading by example when he wed Roxana, a Sogdian princess of Bactria. He then married Stateira II, eldest daughter of Darius III, and Parysatis II, youngest daughter of Artaxerxes III, at the Susa weddings in 324 BC.Meanwhile, in Greece, the Spartan king Agis III attempted to lead a rebellion of the Greeks against Macedonia. He was defeated in 331 BC at the Battle of Megalopolis by Antipater, who was serving as regent of Macedonia and deputy hegemon of the League of Corinth in Alexander's stead. Before Antipater embarked on his campaign in the Peloponnese, Memnon, the governor of Thrace, was dissuaded from rebellion by use of diplomacy. Antipater deferred the punishment of Sparta to the League of Corinth headed by Alexander, who ultimately pardoned the Spartans on the condition that they submit fifty nobles as hostages.

I tried to correct myself as I turned, spreading my hands wide apart. Then I heard a strange sound and my body lost control. Moments later I realized I had hit my head on the board. At the beginning, I felt embarrassed. I wanted to hide, to get out of the pool without anyone seeing me. Next I felt intense fear. Had I cut my head? Was I bleeding? Was there blood in the pool? Swimming to the side, I noticed many shocked faces. People were worried about my head; I was worried about something far more threatening. An official examined my head. In a hurry, I pushed him away, and everyone else who approached me. \\"Don't touch me!\\" I felt like screaming. \\"Get away from me!\\" These were the trials for the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, Korea.

Question: What is unique about the Cretaceous? Context: To the north of Africa the Tethys Sea continued to narrow. Broad shallow seas advanced across central North America (the Western Interior Seaway) and Europe, then receded late in the period, leaving thick marine deposits sandwiched between coal beds. At the peak of the Cretaceous transgression, one-third of Earth's present land area was submerged. The Cretaceous is justly famous for its chalk; indeed, more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the Phanerozoic. Mid-ocean ridge activity—or rather, the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges—enriched the oceans in calcium; this made the oceans more saturated, as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for calcareous nanoplankton. These widespread carbonates and other sedimentary deposits make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine. Famous formations from North America include the rich marine fossils of Kansas's Smoky Hill Chalk Member and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation. Other important Cretaceous exposures occur in Europe and China. In the area that is now India, massive lava beds called the Deccan Traps were laid down in the very late Cretaceous and early Paleocene. The answer to this question is:","output":"The unique aspect about the Cretaceous is that it is famous for its chalk formations; in fact, more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the Phanerozoic.

Answer:","output":"The battle that took place during the Second Sudanese War in September 1898, in which General Horatio Herbert Kitchener inflicted a crushing defeat on the Sudanese Dervishes, was the Battle of Omdurman. This major battle occurred on September 2, 1898, and it ultimately resulted in the British and Egyptian forces regaining control of Sudan after a long period of Mahdist rule. The Second Sudanese War, also known as the Mahdist War, began in 1896 when General Kitchener was given the task of reconquering Sudan on behalf of the British Empire and its Egyptian allies. The Sudanese Dervishes, also referred to as the Mahdists, had been in power since the fall of Khartoum in 1885, and they were led by Abdalla ibn-Mohammed, who was the Khalifa (successor) of the self-proclaimed Mahdi, Mohammed Ahmed. In 1898, after a series of successful campaigns capturing Dongola, Abu Hamed, Atbara, and other key locations, Kitchener and his Anglo-Egyptian forces prepared for the final assault on the Sudanese capital, Omdurman. The battle pitted around 23,000 British and Egyptian soldiers, armed with advanced weaponry, such as Maxim machine guns and artillery, against an estimated 50,000 to 60,000 Sudanese Dervish soldiers, led by Khalifa Abdalla. The Battle of Omdurman took place near the confluence of the White Nile and the Blue Nile, in present-day Sudan. As the Dervish forces approached Kitchener's army across open terrain, they were met with devastating firepower from the British and Egyptian forces. The Maxim machine guns, in particular, proved to be highly effective in cutting down Dervish soldiers as they attempted to charge the Anglo-Egyptian lines. Additionally, Kitchener's forces utilized a combination of infantry tactics, artillery, and cavalry charges to great effect, leading to a rout of the remaining Dervish forces. The sheer power of the British and Egyptian artillery and rifles, alongside the skillful deployment of force by General Kitchener, resulted in an overwhelming victory at the Battle of Omdurman. The Dervishes suffered massive casualties, with estimates of around 10,000 to 12,000 killed and 13,000 to 16,000 wounded, while British and Egyptian losses were relatively minimal, with around 400 killed or wounded. As a direct consequence of the Battle of Omdurman, the British and Egyptian forces regained control of Sudan, effectively putting an end to the Mahdist state. The outcome of the battle also demonstrated the significance of technological advancements in modern warfare and solidified Britain's position as a major colonial power in Africa. The end of the conflict marked the beginning of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan condominium, which lasted until Sudan gained independence in 1956."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Bailey cut corners by making the napkins thinner than the needed to be.

(2). no.","output":"Yes, \\"Stressful life experiences can also cause repression of memories where a person moves an unbearable memory to the unconscious mind.\\" is a good answer to the question \\"What will a person often do with extremely stressful memories?\\" Repression, as a defense mechanism, plays a crucial role in managing traumatic memories. When a person experiences an extremely stressful or traumatic event that is overwhelming, the mind may protect itself by repressing (pushing back) the traumatizing memory into the unconscious part of the mind. This helps the individual deal with the pain and suffering in the immediate aftermath of the experience. Repression can serve a purpose in the short-term, allowing the person to function and cope without the distressing emotions connected to that traumatic memory. Over time, however, repression can lead to emotional and psychological issues, as unprocessed emotions and unresolved memories may interfere with one's mental well-being. For some individuals, certain triggers or events may lead to the resurfacing of repressed memories. In such cases, the memories unexpectedly emerge in the conscious mind, leading to a range of emotions, including anger, resentment, fear, and sadness. It may also lead to other psychological and physiological symptoms, such as anxiety, depression, and physical pain. Understanding the concept of repression is essential in the fields of psychology and psychotherapy. It helps mental health professionals to address the deep-rooted issues causing emotional disturbances in their clients. Appropriate therapy and intervention can help individuals confront and resolve their repressed memories in a safe and controlled environment, enabling them to heal and move forward in life. In conclusion, the statement accurately explains a common response to extremely stressful memories and highlights the significance of the unconscious mind in coping with such events."},{"instruction":"Instructions: In this task, you are given a sentence from the Quran in English, and your task is to translate it into Persian.

In order to derive a hypothesis specifically about the length of the first chapter, we would require additional information related to the novel's structure or literary style. For example, the context would need to include information on how Selvon approached the narrative pacing, whether he employed short or long chapters, or cite any known factors influencing the development of the first chapter. In the absence of such information, any hypothesis regarding the length of the first chapter would be speculative and unsupported by the facts provided in the context. To further analyze or evaluate this initial hypothesis, one could explore the literary style and structure of The Lonely Londoners and compare it to other works of the same period, genre, or author. Moreover, analyzing critical reception and interpretations could provide more insight into Selvon's intentions and techniques. However, as it currently stands, the context does not offer enough details to confirm or refute the hypothesis that The Lonely Londoners has a short first chapter."},{"instruction":"Pick one category for the following text.

Is The mosaic was probably created in 565/6. a good answer to this question? Choose from: (A). yes (B). no","output":"(B). no The answer, \\"The mosaic was probably created in 565/6,\\" is not a good answer to the question, \\"Why have wall mosaics generally not survived in the region?\\" The reason it's not a good answer is because it doesn't address the factors that may have contributed to the poor preservation of wall mosaics in the region. A detailed explanation should be provided to answer the question thoroughly. Wall mosaics are an essential form of artistic expression that have been used in various architectural structures like churches, palaces, and public buildings since ancient times. Despite their historical significance and beauty, many wall mosaics have not survived in some regions. In order to provide a detailed answer to why wall mosaics generally have not survived in a certain region, it's essential to explore various factors that may have contributed to their deterioration or disappearance. These factors could include natural disasters, political conflicts, environmental factors, and socio-cultural influences. 1. Natural disasters: Earthquakes, floods, and fires may have caused the destruction of many wall mosaics. These natural disasters can compromise the structural integrity of the buildings, leading to the collapse of walls or the complete destruction of the structure, which would inevitably result in the loss of the mosaics. 2. Political conflicts: War and other political conflicts in the region may have led to the intentional or collateral damage to the buildings containing wall mosaics. In some cases, cultural artifacts like mosaics may have been intentionally destroyed as a symbolic act of victory or defiance during the conflict. 3. Environmental factors: Over time, environmental factors such as climate, humidity, and exposure to sunlight can contribute to the deterioration of wall mosaics. Materials used in the creation of these artworks, like stones, brick, and mortar, might become compromised due to continuous exposure to the elements. 4. Socio-cultural influences: Changes in societal values and beliefs may contribute to the neglect or destruction of wall mosaics. This could be due to an intentional rejection of the cultural or religious significance of the mosaics or simply due to a lack of appreciation for the art form. 5. Poor preservation efforts: In some cases, the local communities or authorities may not have had the necessary resources or knowledge to maintain the wall mosaics effectively. Poor preservation practices may lead to the degradation of these artworks over time. In conclusion, the survival of wall mosaics in a specific region can be influenced by several factors, including natural disasters, political conflicts, environmental factors, socio-cultural influences, and preservation efforts. To answer the question of why wall mosaics generally have not survived in a certain region, it is essential to assess these factors and provide a comprehensive explanation of their impact on the preservation of wall mosaics."},{"instruction":"Yes / no, is the following a verifiable fact? \\"A Sniper plays the guitar as part of their job.\\" The thought process:","output":"No, the statement \\"A Sniper plays the guitar as part of their job\\" is not a verifiable fact.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer you found on Google is partially correct in that cock rings can be worn around just the penis, both the penis and scrotum, or just the scrotum alone (as a testicle cuff). However, it does not directly answer your question about how long a cock ring should be worn. Cock rings are designed to restrict blood flow and maintain an erection, which makes them a popular accessory for enhancing sexual pleasure and performance. However, it is essential to use them carefully and responsibly, as prolonged use can lead to discomfort or even injury. The following guidelines can help you determine the appropriate duration for wearing a cock ring: 1. Manufacturers generally recommend a maximum wear time of around 20 to 30 minutes for a cock ring. This helps ensure adequate blood flow and minimize any potential risks or discomfort. However, some individuals may need to adjust this time frame based on their specific needs and personal comfort levels. Always consider your body's response when deciding how long to use a cock ring. 2. Pay close attention to your body. If you experience any discomfort, numbness, pain, or discoloration in your genitals while wearing a cock ring, remove it immediately. These can be signs that the ring is too tight or has been worn for too long, and continuing to wear it in these circumstances may potentially lead to tissue damage or other complications. 3. Start slow and gradually increase your wear time. If you are new to using a cock ring, consider starting with shorter wear times and slowly increasing them as you become more familiar and comfortable with the device. This allows you to gauge how your body responds to the sensation and helps you determine the ideal duration for your personal needs. 4. Choose the right size and material for your cock ring. A properly sized cock ring should be snug but not painfully tight. Too small, and it may restrict blood flow excessively, leading to pain and potential injury. Too large, and it may not provide the desired effect or could slip off during use. Experiment with different sizes and materials such as silicone, rubber, or metal to find the best fit for your needs. 5. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and recommendations regarding the use and care of your cock ring. These guidelines can provide valuable information on safe wear times and proper sizing, helping to ensure that you can enjoy your cock ring without any complications. In conclusion, the answer you found on Google addresses the different ways a cock ring can be worn but does not fully answer your question regarding the appropriate duration. As a general rule, it is usually recommended to wear a cock ring for no more than 20 to 30 minutes at a time, closely monitoring your body for any signs of discomfort or issues. Remember always to prioritize your safety and follow the manufacturer's instructions when using a cock ring."},{"instruction":"DETAILS: Arrested Development is back this month on Netflix—seven years after it was canceled. For all that's been written about the show, there don't seem to be many stories from the set. Have a favorite anecdote? Will Arnett: We were shooting Season 2, and Liza Minnelli had been sued by her bodyguard and/or driver for sexual harassment. He was suing her for 100 million. I have no idea what became of that. But we were shooting, and she was there for a wardrobe fitting or whatever. Nobody knew Liza was even on-set. We were rolling. And she walked through the kitchen door, took center stage, put her hands out, and said, \\"Am I really that bad?\\" Meaning, \\"Was sex with me that bad that you had to sue me for 100 million?\\" It was so disarming. DETAILS: Your character, Gob, is famous for his ridiculous chicken dance. Do people ask you to do it? Will Arnett: Nonstop. I've been asked on the subway in New York, I've been asked in England. I did it once publicly—at an auction benefiting a hospital. It was for a good cause. But I don't do it. If you're reading this, don't ask me on the street to do it. DETAILS: You and Jason Bateman run a digital-marketing firm, Dumbdumb, that makes comedic shorts for brands like Subaru and Old Navy. Were you afraid people would say you sold out? Will Arnett: I think people would have said that five or ten years ago. Now everyone understands the economics of it. I don't care if you're in the coolest movie or on the coolest TV show—guys who are way too cool for school aren't paying the rent. Guys like Jason and me, we have families. DETAILS: You didn't become successful until you were in your thirties. Were you jealous of people whose careers had taken off earlier? Will Arnett: I never really spent time being jealous. Maybe I should have. I'd handicapped myself. Back then I was partying. Maybe I would have gotten more jobs if I didn't look so hungover all the time. I lived in a string of shitty apartments in New York. I had a futon on the floor—not even a frame—that I'd roll up during the day. I had a lot of dreams—I wanted to be taken seriously, and I had something important to say. I said, \\"I'll never read for TV!\\" Those are the trappings of youth. As you get older, you take yourself less seriously. That, I think, is actually the freedom of age. DETAILS: You're sober now. What was the turning point? Will Arnett: Every day at 5 o'clock, I'd go to Peter McManus on 19th and 7th. It's a classic Irish bar. For six years, I was there six nights a week. In the fall of '99, I did The Mike O'Malley Show for NBC. After two episodes, it was panned and it was canceled. I took it a lot harder than I thought. I had a lot of stuff going on in my life. I'd broken up with my then-girlfriend of many years. I proceeded to spend the next six to nine months on an unprecedented run. And by run, I mean downward spiral. A friend called me up, and she said, \\"What are you doing?\\" It was almost as simple as that. DETAILS: You were raised in Toronto. Your dad, a Harvard graduate, was the head of Molson for a time. What did you learn from him? Will Arnett: I remember asking my dad, \\"Why didn't you ever move to the States? You probably could have made a lot more money.\\" My dad said, \\"Because I have an obligation to give back.\\" I always admired him for that. DETAILS: When you were 12, your parents sent you to boarding school. Had you done something wrong? Will Arnett: I probably suffered from ADHD, but they weren't so quick to diagnose it back then. For PE, they'd drop you in the woods with a compass and a pack of matches. It gave you confidence that you could rely on yourself. ||||| There's a new budding summer romance in Hollywood. E!

It berths in James Bay, St Helena approximately thirty times per year. The RMS Saint Helena was due for decommissioning in 2010. However, its service life has been extended indefinitely until the airport is completed. What needs to be completed before the RMS Saint Helena can be decommissioned?","output":"There are several important factors that need to be considered and completed before the RMS Saint Helena can be decommissioned. Considering the vital role that the ship plays in the transportation of passengers, cargo, and mail between St Helena, Ascension Island, Cape Town, and other destinations, the following milestones must be achieved to ensure a smooth transition and minimal disruption to the residents and businesses on the islands: 1. Completion of St Helena Airport: The primary reason for extending the service life of RMS Saint Helena was the delay in the completion and full operation of St Helena Airport. Before the ship can be decommissioned, the airport must be fully functional, providing consistent and reliable air services to the island. This includes meeting all necessary safety, aviation, and regulatory standards. 2. Establishing regular air connections: With the airport operational, it is essential to have regular, scheduled air services connecting St Helena to major hubs such as Cape Town or Johannesburg, South Africa, and possibly other destinations. This will provide an alternative and reasonably accessible means of transportation for both passengers and cargo. Negotiations with airlines and consideration of any potential subsidies by the local government might be required to establish and maintain these routes. 3. Sufficient air cargo capacity: As RMS Saint Helena also plays a significant role in the transportation of cargo, it is crucial to ensure that there is adequate air cargo capacity to handle shipments to and from St Helena. The airport and airlines must be prepared to meet the needs of the island, including the capability to transport temperature-sensitive goods, medical supplies, and other critical freight. 4. Transitioning mail services: RMS Saint Helena has been responsible for mail services between the islands and other destinations. Effective mail delivery and collection systems need to be in place with the change to air services. This may require partnering with international courier companies or ensuring postal agreements are in place with connecting countries. 5. Addressing any potential impact on Ascension Island and Walvis Bay: As RMS Saint Helena also serves these two destinations, alternative transportation solutions must be established to maintain connections and services for these islands. This might involve arranging regular flights or finding alternative shipping providers for cargo and passengers. 6. Connectivity with other destinations: The RMS Saint Helena occasionally sails to Tenerife and Portland, UK. It is important to evaluate the necessity of maintaining links to these destinations and establish alternative connections, if necessary, to provide continued accessibility for residents and businesses. 7. Decommissioning plan: A comprehensive plan for decommissioning the RMS Saint Helena should be in place, detailing the process of retiring the ship, including potential sales or scrapping, transfer of crew members to other positions, and any associated financial or legal implications. 8. Communication and outreach: As the transition from sea to air services will impact the residents of St Helena, it is crucial to engage the community in this process. Providing information about the changes, soliciting feedback, and addressing concerns throughout the transition will be critical to ensure a smooth and successful decommissioning of RMS Saint Helena. Once all these factors are considered and satisfactorily addressed, a date can be set for the decommissioning of RMS Saint Helena, allowing for a seamless shift to air transportation and vital continued connectivity for St Helena and other remote islands in the region."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"yeah but yeah yeah uh uh there's probably that's pretty neat because i don't imagine Raleigh's so big that you have big traffic jams going one way or the other\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"Raleigh probably isn't big enough to have major traffic jams.\\"?","output":"Step 1: Identify the premise and the hypothesis Premise: \\"yeah but yeah yeah uh uh there's probably that's pretty neat because I don't imagine Raleigh's so big that you have big traffic jams going one way or the other\\" Hypothesis: \\"Raleigh probably isn't big enough to have major traffic jams.\\" Step 2: Determine if the premise entails the hypothesis To do this, I will analyze if the given information in the premise logically leads to the conclusion in the hypothesis.

Article: How often do you go on holiday? Going on holiday makes you feel good while you're there-you gain the health benefits for months, new research shows. Jetting off to exotic destinations such as the Maldives cuts your blood pressure, helps you sleep better and bounce back from stress, it found. The benefits last at least a fortnight longer than the vacation and can be felt for months in some cases where it is claimed. Experts say workers should always take their full holiday entitlement each year-as many as one in three don't-to get the benefits. The study compared key health markers in holidaymakers visiting Thailand, Peru or the Maldives, with people who stayed at home and continued working. The average blood pressure of those on holiday dropped by 6% while the workers saw their blood pressure rise by 2% over the same period. The sleep quality of holiday-makers improved by 17% while that of the non-holidaymakers _ by 14%. The study also found the ability of vacationers to recover from stress--known as the stress-resilience test-improved by 29%. There was a 71% fall in stress resilience scores among workers. Test showed a fall in blood glucose levels, reducing the risk of diabetes, trimmer waistlines and enhanced mood and energy levels, with the effects sustained for at least 2 weeks after returning home. The Holiday Health Experiment was conducted by tour operator Kuoni and Nuffield Health, the UK's largest healthcare charity. Question: Which of the following can we infer from the passage? Options: A: Holiday makers are more adaptable than non-holidaymakers. B: The result of the study is mostly based on the description from the people involved. C: The further you go, the better you benefit. D: Most people like to stay at home during the holiday. The answer is:","output":"A: Holiday makers are more adaptable than non-holidaymakers.

They’re under huge pressure to write and publish but an ever-growing mountain of teaching and admin is stopping them doing just that. Our research finds that whilst nobody is immune to these pressures, some academics cope better than others – and that’s because over the years, they’ve developed personal “systems” to help them write. We recently carried out in-depth interviews with 23 scholars across the UK, Europe and the US. We deliberately chose a diverse group so as to not make any assumptions based on age, seniority, or research background. Academic experience ranged from six months to 27 years and subject fields ranged from social sciences, economics, business, and arts. We did this as part of our user research to inform the development of Prolifiko – a digital coaching tool for writers. Whilst every academic had developed a writing productivity system personal to them, we found there were six common “habits” that the most prolific (and generally least stressed) academics tended to use. 1. They “time-block” their writing in advance Scheduling – booking in time to write in advance – was the single most common habit of our writers. It didn’t appear to matter what type of time-blocking method a scholar chose to use or how lengthy a writing session was. Some blocked out long periods of time on sabbatical, whilst others preferred to block out short, regular times throughout the day or across a week. What seemed to matter far more was the act of planning, as this mentally prepared the individual for writing – and so made the process easier and less stressful. “When I need to write I block out time. I’m lucky in that I can work from home – I block out a couple of straight days to do the writing and I plan it in beforehand. I couldn’t really write in any other way than blocking out that time.” How long had the academics surveyed been teaching? - 100 years - several years - 10 minutes - not enough information A:","output":"not enough information"},{"instruction":"How do you do this: How to store some chips you've already opened?","output":"Storing opened chips properly is essential for keeping them fresh, crisp, and tasty for as long as possible. Here are several methods and tips for storing your opened chips: Method 1: Using a chip clip or a clothespin 1. Roll down the top: Once you have opened the bag of chips, consume the desired amount and shake any remaining crumbs down to the bottom. 2. Press the air out: Gently press the top of the bag to push out the excess air while being careful not to crush the chips. 3. Roll the top: Roll the top of the bag down tightly to create a good seal. It is essential to minimize contact with air to prevent the chips from going stale. 4. Secure the top: Use a chip clip or a clothespin to secure the top of the bag, ensuring that no air can enter. Method 2: Plastic storage container or zipper bags 1. Choose the right container: Select an airtight plastic container or a resealable zipper bag that can comfortably accommodate the quantity of chips you have remaining. A tight seal is vital to preserve freshness. 2. Transfer the chips: Carefully pour or place the chips into the chosen container. Seal the container or zipper bag. 3. Store the container: Place the container in a dry, cool place, such as a cupboard or pantry to preserve taste and protect from sunlight and heat. Method 3: Using a rubber band 1. Prepare the bag: After consuming the desired amount of chips and shaking the crumbs down, gently press the air out of the bag. 2. Roll and twist the top: Roll the top of the bag down a bit and then twist the top to create a makeshift seal. 3. Secure with a rubber band: Wrap a rubber band tightly around the twisted top of the bag, ensuring that it grips and holds the twist in place. Method 4: Using airtight glass jars 1. Choose an appropriately sized jar: Find a glass jar with an airtight seal and wide opening to accommodate the remaining chips. 2. Transfer the chips: Carefully place or pour the chips into the jar with minimal crushing. 3. Seal and store: Close the lid tightly to preserve the chips' freshness and store the jar in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat sources. Method 5: The water displacement method (great for camping) 1. Prepare a large zipper bag: Pour the remaining chips into a large resealable zipper bag. 2. Submerge the bag partially in water: With the bag's top open, submerge it gently into a container of water, just enough to displace the air inside but not allowing any water to enter the bag. 3. Seal the bag: As you reach the end of the submersion, seal the bag tightly to trap the air out of it. The water's pressure should have forced out the remaining air. Whichever method you choose, make sure to consume the opened chips within about 1-2 weeks to enjoy their freshness and taste fully. Remember not to expose the stored chips to direct sunlight, heat, or humid environments, as these factors will compromise their quality."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

In Western Europe, Emperor Charlemagne painted his palace red as a very visible symbol of his authority, and wore red shoes at his coronation. Kings, princes and, beginning in 1295, Roman Catholic cardinals began to wear red costumes. When Abbe Suger rebuilt Saint Denis Basilica outside Paris in the early 12th century, he added stained glass windows colored blue cobalt glass and red glass tinted with copper. Together they flooded the basilica with a mystical light. Soon stained glass windows were being added to cathedrals all across France, England and Germany. In Medieval painting red was used to attract attention to the most important figures; both Christ and the Virgin Mary were commonly painted wearing red mantles.\\"? A:","output":"Question: Which figures in medieval paintings were often depicted wearing red mantles, and how does the use of red in these paintings and other historical contexts symbolize authority and importance? The passage highlights the significance of the color red throughout history, particularly in the context of authority figures and religious settings. In Western Europe, Emperor Charlemagne chose red for his palace and shoes during his coronation as a symbol of his authority. This association with royalty continued as kings, princes, and eventually Roman Catholic cardinals began wearing red costumes. Abbe Suger's rebuilding of Saint Denis Basilica introduced stained glass windows featuring red glass tinted with copper, which imbued the space with a mystical light. The incorporation of these windows extended to other cathedrals across France, England, and Germany. The passage then specifically mentions that in medieval painting, red was often utilized to attract attention to important figures. The striking color highlighted the significance of both Christ and the Virgin Mary, who were frequently depicted wearing red mantles. The recurring theme of red representing power, authority, and holiness exemplifies its enduring symbolism throughout various aspects of history and culture."},{"instruction":"In the beginning of this century there was scandal in the financial market regarding black market trading. A trader named Trader A was working for Bank A. He noticed country M has pegged its currency to a fixed price while country N did not do that. He opted to trade country M currency. Across the aisle his colleague trader B was working for bank B. He traded country N's currency. Would country M's currenccy be traded or not traded in the balck market? The answer to this question is:","output":"The answer to this question is not straightforward, as it depends on various factors and conditions prevailing in the financial markets and regulatory environment at that time. To fully understand the situation, let's explore the background and actions of both Trader A and Trader B, as well as the potential for black market trading opportunities. In the early 2000s, financial markets were going through significant transformations both in terms of technologies and regulations. It's important to note that the financial scandals during this period led to increased scrutiny and regulatory oversight, making it harder for traders to indulge in unethical practices. Now, let's look at the case of Trader A and Bank A. Country M had pegged its currency to a fixed price, meaning that its exchange rate against a specific currency or basket of currencies remained stable or constant. This decision could be a result of various economic factors such as political stability or a desire to attract investment. The pegged currency exchange rate may diminish the opportunities for black market trading, as there is little room for significant price fluctuations or arbitrage opportunities that could be exploited by traders. However, it's not impossible for black market trading to occur in this scenario. If there is a gap between the official exchange rate and the real market value of the currency, a black market could emerge. For example, if the fixed price of country M's currency is overvalued compared to the real market demand, a trader might still be able to sell the currency at a higher rate in the black market, as people may struggle to get the needed foreign currency through official channels. On the other hand, Trader B at Bank B was dealing with the currency of country N, which had not pegged its currency. Typically, market forces such as demand, supply, and market speculation determine the value of a free-floating currency. The chances of black market trading are higher in this scenario, as the fluctuating exchange rate could offer opportunities for traders to exploit price disparities and benefit from arbitrage. That being said, the mere existence of disparities in the foreign exchange market does not automatically lead to black market trading. Traders must also consider the risks of getting caught and the potential consequences of violating laws and regulations. In this case, Trader A and Trader B will likely factor in the increased scrutiny and evolving regulations due to scandals before engaging in black market trading or other unethical practices. In conclusion, whether or not Country M's currency would be traded in the black market depends on several factors, including the presence of exchange rate disparities, strictness of financial regulations, and risk appetite of the traders involved. While the pegged currency system could limit the opportunities for such trading, it cannot guarantee the complete absence of black market activity. The conduct of the traders and the overall economic conditions of Country M will ultimately determine the likelihood of black market trading in the given scenario."},{"instruction":"Does the sentence \\"Everton originally played in the southeast corner of Stanley Park, which was the site for the new Liverpool F.C. stadium, with the first official match taking place in 1879.\\" answer the question \\"Who was the chairman of the Everton FC in 1892?\\" OPTIONS: +yes; +no;","output":"+no; The sentence provided does not answer the question \\"Who was the chairman of the Everton FC in 1892?\\" as it only talks about the location where Everton played and the date of their first official match.

The story takes place entirely in New York. Armando works part-time at his parents' restaurant and is also a custodian at a dance studio, where he secretly practices dance moves. He befriends the beautiful Mia Franklin, a dancer who is having a relationship with the studio's owner Daniel. She catches Armando dancing alone, likes what she sees, gives him a few tips, and they dance together briefly, but are discovered by Daniel. Trying to avoid an awkward situation, Mia leaves. When Armando realizes that Mia has left her scarf behind, he calls out to her from the studio's second floor window. On the sidewalk below, Mia turns to cross the street, when she struck by a taxi and rendered a paraplegic, paralyzed from the waist down. Upon learning of this, Daniel jilts her. Armando tries to boost her confidence and persuades her and other disabled people in the local rehabilitation center, including a \\"punky\\" Latina, Nikki and a wounded Iraq-war veteran, Kenny, (Morgan Spector) to enter a wheelchair ballroom dancing competition. Despite the opposition of his mother, Armando and Mia gradually fall in love and enter into a relationship, while Armando's uncle Wilfredo falls in love with Chantelle, a disabled trans woman at the rehab center. Before the competition, Armando's mother, who has been maneuvering to get Armando hooked up with the beautiful Rosa, does her best to undermine (even to the point of \\"casting spells\\") the relationship between him and Mia, which has become sexually intimate by now.

Pogoing aside, Vicious had been involved in a notorious incident during that memorable second night of the 100 Club Punk Special. Arrested for hurling a glass at The Damned that shattered and blinded a girl in one eye, he had served time in a remand centre—and contributed to the 100 Club banning all punk bands. At a previous 100 Club gig, he had assaulted Nick Kent with a bicycle chain. Indeed, McLaren's NME telegram said that Vicious's \\"best credential was he gave Nick Kent what he deserved many months ago at the Hundred Club\\".

He was the knight in shining armour with a giant fist.\\" \\"Everyone agreed he had the look,\\" Lydon later recalled, but musical skill was another matter. \\"The first rehearsals...in March of 1977 with Sid were hellish.... Sid really tried hard and rehearsed a lot\\". Marco Pirroni, who had performed with Vicious in Siouxsie and the Banshees, has said, \\"After that, it was nothing to do with music anymore. It would just be for the sensationalism and scandal of it all. Then it became the Malcolm McLaren story\\".Membership in the Sex Pistols had a progressively destructive effect on Vicious. As Lydon later observed, \\"Up to that time, Sid was absolutely childlike. Everything was fun and giggly. Suddenly he was a big pop star. Pop star status meant press, a good chance to be spotted in all the right places, adoration.

The 64-year-old Virginia woman was found dead Sunday inside her cabin aboard the Enchantment of the Seas, The Baltimore Sun reported. The company said her husband found her dead. The FBI did not release the names of the woman or her husband Tuesday, citing their investigation into the cause of death, according to the Sun. The woman was on a six-night, seven-day cruise to Florida and the Bahamas that left Baltimore March 18. FBI Baltimore field office spokesman Rich Wolf said agents boarded the ship Monday after it returned to Baltimore as scheduled. He says an autopsy is being conducted to determine the cause and manner of death. \\"The ship was working with us the whole way,\\" Wolf told the paper, adding that agents are interviewing the unidentified woman's husband. He declined to say whether the woman suffered any trauma. Maryland Port Administration spokesman Richard Scher told the Sun that the FBI completed its interviews after the ship's 2,409 passengers disembarked in Baltimore on Monday. In a statement released to the paper, Royal Caribbean said a member of its \\"Care Team\\" was providing support and assistance to the woman's family. \\"We extend our most sincere and heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of the 64-year-old female guest from the United States who died while onboard Enchantment of the Seas,\\" the statement said.

Funnily enough , I ' ve gotten more feedback for my 5 Yrs Gone full length fiction but I do n't feel as if it 's most - loved ? It 's more like it 's got its moments ... and then the rest leaves people just skimming . Why is the narrator a bit more encouraged ?","output":"The narrator appears to be a bit more encouraged primarily because they have received feedback on their work, indicating that readers are engaging with their content and taking the time to share their thoughts. This engagement signifies that there is interest in their writing, even if it's not necessarily deemed the \\"most-loved\\" piece. The narrator recognizes that their work has resonated with some readers in its own unique way, and this can serve as a motivating factor. The phrase \\"it's got its moments\\" also implies that there are aspects of the 5 Yrs Gone full-length fiction that have struck a chord with readers. Even though these moments might be interspersed throughout the text, they still hold value and can make an impact on the reader's mind. It is the appreciation of these small moments that can be encouraging for an author, knowing that their efforts have not gone unnoticed or unappreciated. Furthermore, the fact that people are skimming the rest of the work can also be interpreted in a positive light. While it may not necessarily mean that readers are fully invested in every aspect of the story, their willingness to skim through the text reveals that they want to discover those aforementioned moments. It shows that a certain level of curiosity and engagement is present among readers, even if it isn't consistent throughout the entire work. Additionally, the narrator's self-awareness plays a role in their encouragement. They understand that their work may not be perfect and may not always captivate readers, but they acknowledge this shortcoming and remain open to feedback. This in and of itself is an act of growth and a willingness to improve, which can be a highly motivating factor for any writer. Lastly, the mention of \\"Overcoming Circumstance\\" in the original text provides a subtle context for the narrator's self-encouragement. The title hints at the idea of overcoming challenges and persevering, and it is possible that this theme is reflected in the narrator's own life and writing journey. They may have experienced setbacks or difficulties in their creative process, but receiving feedback and recognizing the value of their work serves as a reminder of their ability to overcome obstacles and continue writing. In conclusion, the narrator is a bit more encouraged due to the engagement and feedback they have received, the appreciation of the noteworthy moments in their work, the curiosity exhibited by the readers, their self-awareness, and the sense of perseverance they have drawn from their own writing journey. All these factors contribute to a feeling of motivation and encouragement for the narrator as they continue to hone their craft and produce more content."},{"instruction":"Select from: a).

Step 4: Assess the truthfulness of Sentence 2 based on Sentence 1 - The truthfulness of Sentence 2 doesn't solely depend on Sentence 1 since it expresses the speaker's feelings and adaptability, which could be true or false separately. However, both sentences indicate that the speaker will have the Parisian car, suggesting compatibility between Sentence 1 and Sentence 2.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis in this case suggests that when a person becomes a vegetarian, there may be a change in the reactions involved in the digestion process. To determine the effect (direct or indirect) of this diet change on the process, let's examine each step of digestion: 1. The saliva breaks down the chemicals in the food a bit, which helps make the food mushy and easy to swallow. - Vegetarian or not, saliva will continue to break down food and make it easier to swallow. There is no significant effect on this process. 2. Your tongue helps out, pushing the food around while you chew with your teeth. - The type of food being consumed (vegetarian or otherwise) has no impact on the tongue's role in moving food around during chewing. Therefore, no significant effect is expected. 3. The esophagus moves food from the back of your throat to your stomach. - Food transportation through the esophagus remains unaffected by dietary changes, as this process only involves the physical movement of food. Hence, no significant effect. 4. Strong muscles in the walls of the stomach and gastric juices break down food in your stomach. - Stomach muscles will still work to mix food regardless of its content. However, a vegetarian diet typically contains less protein and fat compared to a non-vegetarian diet, which might result in slightly different gastric juice composition to break down the nutrients present in vegetarian food effectively. This would be considered an indirect effect on the process. 5. Your stomach moves the food into the intestines to complete digestion. - The stomach's role in moving food into the intestines remains unaffected by the type of food a person consumes. Hence, no significant effect here. In conclusion, the perturbation from adopting a vegetarian diet has minimal effects on the digestion process. The most notable change occurs in the composition of gastric juices, adjusting them to break down the nutrients present in vegetarian food more effectively. This is considered an indirect effect on the digestion process."},{"instruction":"Write the next sentence in this paragraph: How to stop being called a child Examine other people's motivations.

Critics of antihumanism, most notably Jürgen Habermas, counter that while antihumanists may highlight humanism's failure to fulfil its emancipatory ideal, they do not offer an alternative emancipatory project of their own. Others, like the German philosopher Heidegger considered themselves humanists on the model of the ancient Greeks, but thought humanism applied only to the German \\"race\\" and specifically to the Nazis and thus, in Davies' words, were anti-humanist humanists. Such a reading of Heidegger's thought is itself deeply controversial; Heidegger includes his own views and critique of Humanism in Letter On Humanism. Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of the wars of the 20th century \\"it should no longer be possible to formulate phrases like 'the destiny of man' or the 'triumph of human reason' without an instant consciousness of the folly and brutality they drag behind them\\". For \\"it is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason\\". Yet, he continues, \\"it would be unwise to simply abandon the ground occupied by the historical humanisms.

So show-closers get 10 points, the second-to-last contestant gets 5, the opener gets minus 5, the rest zero. Performance quality: Buzz, judges' verdict and (especially) song choice are vital to a contestant's survival, but none of that would mean a thing without what we watch Idol for: the performance itself. It's worth anywhere from minus 10 to plus 10 points. Exceptional circumstances: Idol is live, and the unpredictable can happen. When it does, we'll dole out anywhere from minus 10 to plus 10 points for incidents including, but not limited to, emotional shout-outs or breakdowns, sickbed performances, superstar stage lighting, forgetting lyrics, false starts, major vocal gaffes, tantrums, overt sullenness, sassing a judge, being adopted as perverse causes clbres or anything else that might influence voting. Judges' verdict: Respect them or not, the judges' opinions can't help but influence voters. So positive comments from Randy, Steven and Jennifer are worth up to 6 points each, while a negative comment scores as much as minus 6. If a performance receives a unanimous, three-judge, flat-out rave, 3 bonus points will be added for a total of 21. Dial Idol: DialIdol.com, which calculates phone-voting strength from busy signals, has had a strong record of predicting eliminations over the years, though its accuracy might suffer this year as online voting is being allowed for the first time. While we monitor the situation, contestants receiving green (or safe) ratings from Dial Idol get 5 points. The lowest-rated contestant gets minus 5; the remainder, in the yellow danger zone, score zero. Online buzz: Standout performances tend to generate high volumes of post-show online searches, so contestants who spike in Google Trends, Yahoo Buzz, Twitter's popular topics or other queries get 14, 10 or 5 points. Outcome: Nothing spells danger for an Idol contestant more than showing up in the dreaded bottom three the previous week. Contestants score minus 5 points if they were in the bottom three or plus 20 points if they escaped. Contestants who elude elimination on their first trip to the bottom three get a one-week bounce worth 5 points. Summary:","output":"This news article discusses the scoring system and factors that impact contestant rankings on the singing competition show, Idol. Factors include performance order, performance quality, exceptional circumstances, judges' verdicts, DialIdol.com predictions, online buzz, and outcome from the previous week. Contestants can gain or lose points depending on their performance in these categories, ultimately influencing their overall score and chances of advancing in the competition."},{"instruction":"What kind of fuel is generally used in rocket engines? What is the use of oxidizer in rocket engines? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Available options: -- no; -- yes;","output":"The kind of fuel generally used in rocket engines can be categorized into two main types: liquid and solid. Liquid rocket engines utilize liquid fuels, while solid rocket engines utilize solid fuels. In both engines, the choice of fuel depends on numerous factors including energy density, storability, and overall performance requirements. Liquid rocket fuels consist of a liquid fuel and oxidizer. They can be further classified into two types: cryogenic and hypergolic. 1. Cryogenic fuels: These are fuels that require extremely low temperatures for storage. Oxygen and hydrogen are the most common cryogenic fuels, used either as a Liquid Oxygen (LOX) and Liquid Hydrogen (LH2) combination or in combination with other fuels. The reasons for using cryogenic fuels are their high energy density and performance capabilities. However, their downside is the need for complex systems to maintain the cryogenic temperatures. 2. Hypergolic fuels: Hypergolic fuels ignite spontaneously when they come into contact with their respective oxidizers. They don't require an ignition system, which simplifies engine design. Common hypergolic fuels include hydrazine, monomethylhydrazine (MMH), and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH). The most common oxidizer for hypergolic fuels is nitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) or a nitrogen tetroxide derivative. Solid rocket fuels consist of both fuel and oxidizer combined into a single solid substance. Two common types of solid rocket fuel are: 1. Composite solid propellants: These consist of a mixture of fuel and oxidizer embedded in an inert binder. The fuel is usually an organic compound like hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB), while the oxidizer is often ammonium perchlorate. 2. Double-base propellants: These usually consist of two base propellants - nitroglycerin (NG) and nitrocellulose (NC). Together, they form a rubber-like substance that is molded into the desired shape. Regarding the use of oxidizers in rocket engines, the fundamental purpose is to provide the necessary oxygen for combustion. Since space is a vacuum and lacks the oxygen present in Earth's atmosphere to support combustion, rocket engines have to carry their own oxidizers to mix with the fuel. This allows the combustion reaction to occur, producing high pressure, high-temperature gases that are expelled through a nozzle to generate thrust. Combining the fuel and the oxidizer is crucial for rocket engines to work. The choice of oxidizer depends on the fuel it needs to react with. For cryogenic fuels, liquid oxygen is often used as an oxidizer, while nitrogen tetroxide works well for hypergolic fuels. For solid rocket fuels, the oxidizer is part of the solid propellant mix. In conclusion, the questions about the kind of fuel generally used in rocket engines and the use of oxidizers in rocket engines are related but not the same. Therefore, the answer is -- no; they are not the same questions."},{"instruction":"Context:It amazes me that she has so little respect for me as to try to downplay the issue and imply that it does n't have a profound and long - lasting impact on my life , even as I ' m telling her that actually , it really does .

It 's not fair , and I feel incredibly disrespected and violated by the whole situation . Why should I have to pay for her poor choices ? Question Why is the narrator so upset about the bill ? Answer:","output":"The narrator is deeply upset about the bill for several reasons, each contributing to the emotional turmoil they are experiencing. Here are the main factors explaining the narrator's distress: 1. Lack of respect: The narrator feels disrespected by the person who has downplayed the issue, belittling its significance in their life. Instead of acknowledging the gravity of the situation, that individual has attempted to minimize its impact, undermining the narrator's emotional response. This lack of understanding and empathy is hurtful and adds to the frustration. 2. Unfair burden of responsibility: The narrator explicitly mentions not having purchased a single item on the Best Buy card, making it evident that the bill is not a result of their actions. Consequently, they are being forced to bear the financial responsibility for someone else's choices. This unjust imposition of obligation is frustrating and leads to profound disquiet. 3. Emotional violation: The whole situation has left the narrator feeling violated, as someone else's actions have interfered with their life and personal finances. This intrusion is far from a minor inconvenience; it carries emotional weight and generates a sense of vulnerability, further heightening the narrator's distress. 4. Long-lasting impact: The narrator emphasizes that the issue will have a \\"profound and long-lasting impact\\" on their life. This implies that the financial burden might affect their credit score, future opportunities, and overall stability for an extended period, significantly worsening their quality of life and causing considerable anxiety. 5. Absence of accountability: The narrator is upset because they are being forced to pay for someone else's poor choices, while the person responsible does not seem to face any consequences. This lack of accountability creates a feeling of injustice and further aggravates the narrator's discontent. In conclusion, the narrator is so upset about the bill because it represents a convergence of disrespect, emotional violation, and unfair imposition of responsibility, all stemming from another person's poor choices. This situation has caused considerable distress and is likely to have long-lasting negative consequences in the narrator's life, amplifying their sense of injustice and frustration."},{"instruction":"Money talks: December 19th 2011 This discussion demonstrates that the Economist at least still obsesses about the banks, and their Eurobonds. I know they are the ones that pay you, but as Mario Draghi of the ECB has realized, these bonds are not now the central issue. The banks have made bad and risky loans by lending to the Euro States instead of the private economy. Indeed they continue to do so. They must: 1. Be forced to realize that they are going to pay ALL the losses on the Euro bonds. 2. The banks must be forced to stop lending to the Euro states, that is stop buying (these high risk) Euro bonds, NOW. That is the ONLY way to stop these countries spending excessively. In fact the cure, the solution, to the Euro crisis is simple, and has one simple solution as all basic solutions have.

His girlfriend Karen (Christina Moore) comes up to him and quickly tells him she's pregnant, and before she can stop him, he announces to everybody that she is pregnant and proposes to her. She then tells him that it is not his baby.Meanwhile, Bill Little (Bill Engvall) is talking about marriage with his neighbor (Michael Papajohn). The neighbor points out that most marriages end in divorce, and Bill says that it takes a lot to make a marriage work, such as incriminating photos of him with a girl who was just a good listener and eager to please at the local nightclub.Elsewhere, a man opens up a storage shed to see the leotard-and-leopard-skirt (with a porn-star mustache) clad Everett (DJ Qualls) watching TV. He reprimands Everett for living here when he just works here and berates him for having been a cop for only four days.Sometime later, the three are getting set for their Monthly trip up to their deserted army recruitment camp; turns out these three are also army reservists and picking on Everett about his tendency to be trigger-happy is their form of entertainment.Meanwhile, on an army base somewhere, a Colonel gets a request for more troops for Fallujah and he pulls up the name of the base where the boys are staying and sends Sgt. Kilgore (Keith David) to assess the situation at the reserve base.Kilgore arrives there to find Bill and Larry eating chips and Everett out on a beer run. Pretty soon he has them going through an intense training regimen and not long after, they find themselves being shipped out. The day they leave, Everett and Bill are both making calls, Everett to his boss and Bill to his wife Connie (Lisa Lampinelli), but they are dragged off to a hangar by Kilgore.

A:","output":"The three friends, Larry, Bill, and Everett, are members of the Army Reserve. They are also acquaintances outside of their military service, as shown by their interactions and shared experiences in both their civilian and military lives. The movie \\"Delta Farce\\" is a comedy centered around these three unlikely and unprepared reservists who are unexpectedly called up for active duty and find themselves in a series of ridiculous and humorous situations throughout the course of the film. The plot introduces various elements that add layers to each character's background and personality, such as Larry working as a diner waiter, dealing with an unexpected pregnancy announcement from his girlfriend Karen, and ultimately proposing to her. Bill, on the other hand, discusses the challenges of marriage with his neighbor, revealing some flaws and indiscretions in his own relationship. Meanwhile, Everett is reprimanded for living in a storage shed at his workplace and exposed to ridicule for his brief experience as a cop before joining the reserves. Their dynamic as friends is further explored during their monthly trips to their deserted army recruitment camp, which serves as a bonding opportunity for the trio as well as an outlet for them to engage in lighthearted teasing, particularly towards the trigger-happy Everett. The story takes a turn when a Colonel, needing more troops for Fallujah, decides to send Sgt. Kilgore to assess the situation at the reserve base where the three friends are stationed. Upon arriving, Kilgore is unimpressed with their lack of discipline and puts them through a rigorous training regimen. This ultimately results in their deployment, adding an additional layer of confusion and comedy as they struggle to adapt to their new circumstances and face the reality of serving in a wartime situation. Through their shared experiences, both in their civilian lives and the unexpected military deployment, Larry, Bill, and Everett develop a bond that not only highlights the importance of friendship and camaraderie but also serves as a source of humor and lightheartedness amid the harsh realities they face. In deciding whether or not to invest in this film proposal, it is essential to consider the potential appeal of the characters and storyline, the strength of the comedic elements, and the overall marketability of the film. Since the movie features a mix of relatable life challenges, military experiences, and humor, it may resonate with a wide range of audiences. However, factors such as cast, production quality, and how effectively the comedy translates to screen should also be taken into account when making your decision."},{"instruction":"Q:Given this review: \\"Put an option that stop shutter sounds than its excellent third party application\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

After the death of the first chaplain Rev G. H. Nobbs in 1884, a Methodist church was formed and in 1891 a Seventh-day Adventist congregation led by one of Nobbs' sons. Some unhappiness with G. H. Nobbs, the more organised and formal ritual of the Church of England service arising from the influence of the Melanesian Mission, decline in spirituality, the influence of visiting American whalers, literature sent by Christians overseas impressed by the Pitcairn story, and the adoption of Seventh-day Adventism by the descendants of the mutineers still on Pitcairn, all contributed to these developments. The Roman Catholic Church began work in 1957 and in the late 1990s a group left the former Methodist (then Uniting Church) and formed a charismatic fellowship. In 2011, 34 percent of the ordinary residents identified as Anglican, 13 percent as Uniting Church, 12 percent as Roman Catholic and three percent as Seventh-day Adventist. Nine percent were from other religions. Twenty four percent had no religion, and seven percent did not indicate a religion. Typical ordinary congregations in any church do not exceed 30 local residents as of 2010[update]. The three older denominations have good facilities. Ministers are usually short-term visitors.

The project was organized by World Circuit executive Nick Gold, produced by American guitarist Ry Cooder and directed by Juan de Marcos Gonzalez. They named the group after the homonymous members' club in the Buenavista quarter of Havana, a popular music venue in the 1940s. To showcase the popular styles of the time, such as son, bolero and danzon, they recruited a dozen veteran musicians, many of whom had been retired for years. Shortly after the Cuban Revolution of 1959, newly elected Cuban President Manuel Urrutia Lleo, a devout Christian, began a program of closing gambling outlets, nightclubs, and other establishments associated with Havana's hedonistic lifestyle. This had an immediate impact on the livelihoods of local entertainers. As the Cuban government rapidly shifted towards the left in an effort to build a \\"classless and colourblind society\\", it struggled to define policy toward forms of cultural expression in the black community; expressions which had implicitly emphasized cultural differences. Consequently, the cultural and social centers were abolished, including the Afro-Cuban mutual aid Sociedades de Color in 1962, to make way for racially integrated societies. Private festivities were limited to weekend parties and organizers' funds were confiscated. The measures meant the closure of the Buena Vista Social Club. Although the Cuban government continued to support traditional music after the revolution, certain favor was given to the politically charged nueva trova, and poetic singer-songwriters such as Silvio Rodriguez and Pablo Milanes. The emergence of pop music and salsa, a style derived from Cuban music but developed in the United States, meant that son music became even less common. Cuban music experienced quite a radical change in the 1960s, as National Geographic notes: Cuban dance music also witnessed dramatic change beginning in the late 1960s, as groups explored the fusion of Cuban son with American rock, jazz and funk styles. Groups such as Los Van Van and Irakere established modern forms of Cuban music, paving the way for new rhythms and dances to emerge as well as fresh concepts in instrumentation. ... Cuba's dance music had already inspired a change from the older son-style dances, as younger Cubans broke free of step-oriented dances... The occurrence of these closures and the change in traditions is the simplest explanation of why many musicians were out of work, and why their style of music had declined before the Buena Vista Social Club made it popular again.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Was the program to close these establishments successful?","output":"The provided text does not contain any direct quote or information about the success of the program to close these establishments.

Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press. PUBLISHED:. 16:52 EST, 21 June 2012. |. UPDATED:. 06:12 EST, 22 June 2012. Victim in the family: Matt Sandusky was preparing to testify against his adopted father during the child sex abuse trial. Jerry Sandusky's own adopted son has dramatically accused him of abuse as a jury deliberates over scores of sex abuse charges against the former Penn State coach. A lawyer for Matt Sandusky said the man told authorities that the former Penn State assistant football coach abused him. Matt Sandusky is one of Jerry Sandusky's six adopted children. His lawyers, Andrew Shubin and Justine Andronici, issued a statement on Thursday naming Matt Sandusky and saying that the 33-year-old had been prepared to testify on behalf of prosecutors at his father's sex abuse trial. The statement says Matt Sandusky is 'a victim of Jerry Sandusky's abuse,' but doesn't go into specifics. NBC News reported that Matt Sandusky was to take the stand as a 'rebuttal witness' if Jerry Sandusky testified. Jerry Sandusky's defence team ultimately decided the 68-year-old former coach wouldn't speak in his own defence. Matt Sandusky's attorney's told the network: 'This has been an extremely painful experience for Matt and he has asked us to convey his request that the media respect his privacy,' they said. The statement came after jurors began deliberating 48 charges against the ex-coach. Prosecutors say Sandusky met the 10 sex-abuse victims through his charity, The Second Mile, which he established in 1977. Lawyers for Matt and Jerry Sandusky and. prosecutors did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Matt. Sandusky's lawyer says his client met with investigators very recently. Scroll down for video. New allegation: One of Jerry Sandusky's six adopted sons, Matt, has come forward through an attorney, saying that the ex-coach abused him too. Spouse: Jerry Sandusky and his wife Dottie, pictured Thursday outside the courthouse, were married in 1966, and have no biological children, but they adopted six times. Matt Sandusky went to live with Sandusky and his wife, Dottie, as a foster child and was adopted by them as an adult. Shortly after Sandusky's arrest in November, Matt Sandusky's ex-wife Jill Jones successfully obtained a restraining order forbidding the children from sleeping at their grandparents' home. At about the same time, details emerged that Matt Sandusky had attempted suicide just four months after first going to live with Jerry and Dottie Sandusky in 1995. He had come into the home through The Second Mile charity, and was first a foster child before being legally adopted. His name also came up last week during the testimony of one of Sandusky's 10 accusers. The man, dubbed Victim 4 by prosecutors, said Matt Sandusky was living at the Sandusky home on an occasion when he had stayed there overnight. When asked by prosecutors whether Jerry Sandusky ever engaged him in a soap battle in the showers, he recounted a time when he and Matt Sandusky had been playing racket ball. When they were done, he said, they went back to a locker room. Matt got undressed and got into the shower and then Victim 4 and Sandusky followed him in there, he testified. 'Me and Jerry came in. He started pumping his hand full of soap,' he said. At that point, Matt shut off his shower and left and went to another locker room to shower, the witness said. Asked by prosecutors about Matt's facial expression when the soap battles started, he replied: 'Nervous.' Jerry and Dottie Sandusky married in 1966 and have no biological children together, but adopted six times and have served as foster parents. The news comes just hours after a 30-year-old Ohio man became the first alleged Sandusky victim to reveal himself to the public, saying in an interview that he was sexually abused by Jerry Sandusky more than 100 times, starting when he was just ten. Travis Weaver said Sandusky preyed on. him after he and his brother went to a summer camp for the Second Mile, a. charity the coach founded and through which he is accused of cultivating. most of his victims. In the jurors' hands: Sandusky is pictured leaving court on Thursday after closing arguments in his child sex abuse trial. Coming forward: Travis Weaver is the first alleged victim of Jerry Sandusky to go public with his story of abuse at the hands of the Penn State coach. The revelation comes on the same day as a jury begins to deliberate Mr Sandusky's fate on 48 counts of sexual abuse charges. In closing arguments, his attorney said the accusers were liars who were hoping to cash in on legal settlements from the university. Mr Weaver is not one of the eight accusers who testified at trial, but he did tell his story to the grand jury that handed down the Sandusky's indictment, NBC News reported. An exclusive interview with Mr Weaver will air at 10pm Thursday on Rock Center. When asked what he would do if he ever met Sandusky again, Mr Weaver doesn't hesitate. Silence: For 15 years, Mr Weaver says, he thought he was Sandusky's only victim. That all changed last fall when the former coach was indicted on charges he abused other eight boys. 'I'd punch him in his mouth,' he said. 'There would be no reason to say anything. He knows what he did.' During the sex abuse trial, Sandusky's. lawyer Joe Amendola said the former coach is being railroaded by. overzealous investigators and prosecutors. He strenuously denied that. accusations and Sandusky has maintained his innocence since his arrest. last fall. Jurors in Jerry Sandusky's child sexual abuse case began deliberations on Thursday after his lawyer and a state prosecutor made closing arguments that followed seven days of testimony. The former Penn State University coach's attorney claimed all eight of Jerry Sandusky's accusers are lying about their sex abuse allegations in the hopes of winning big settlements from the college. Joe Amendola quoted Mother Theresa as he said his client had been railroaded by overzealous investigators and greedy witnesses. He told the jury that prosecutors' case 'doesn't make sense. Sandusky is accused of molesting eight boys over the course of 15 years in a case that shocked the nation and led to the firing of Joe Paterno, one of the most respected head coaches in college football history. When Amendola cited Sandusky's decades of charity work, he referred to the Mother Theresa 'Anyway.' It includes the line: 'If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish, ulterior motives; Be kind anyway.' Amendola laid the blame for the allegations at the feet of state police investigators who he said coached the alleged victims into giving accusatory statements. Amendola. said the accusers were greedy an they lied about the abuse in the hopes. of winning big payouts from Penn State University so they could drive. new cars and buy big houses. Mr Weaver has also filed a lawsuit and is being represented by a well-known attorney who has specialized in sex abuse cases against the Catholic church. The abuse began in 1992, Mr Weaver told NBC's Rock Center, when he met Sandusky at a swimming pool at a camp sponsored by the Second Miles, which Sandusky founded to help at-risk young boys. 'It was like meeting my hero,' Mr Weaver said of Sandusky, who was once the top pick to replace legendary Penn State football coach Joe Paterno. The individual attention Sandusky gave Mr Weaver began innocently, but gradually grew more and more sinister, he said. It began with a shower in the Penn State football team's locker room. 'After the shower was over... he'd dry me off with a towel. He'd say he was trying to wrestle with me... and then it progressed into oral sex,' Mr Weaver told NBC. He always assumed he was the only victim, he said. He never imagined there have been other boys until Sandusky was arrested last fall. Mr Weaver also blasted Sandusky's wife, Dottie, who testified that she never saw or heard anything that would have made her think her husband was molesting boys. He recalled on incident when Sandusky performed oral sex on him in a bedroom across the hall from Mrs Sandusky. 'How could she not know?' Mr Weaver said. He man said the abuse continued for four years until he moved away to Ohio to flee Sandusky. Watch video here. Visit msnbc.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy.

Multicultural, bilingual, student-centered and inclusive, Canada’s “cultural capital” performs well in all six categories of the QS Best Student Cities index – including the new Student View category, which is based on a global survey of students and graduates. There’s also good news for UK cities this year. Amidst concerns about the impact of Brexit, London climbs two places to rank third, while Edinburgh is 18th and Manchester joint 23rd. This is partly thanks to the fall in the value of the pound, which means British cities have become more affordable options for international students. German cities too are on the rise – Berlin climbs to sixth and Munich ninth – while Asia’s leading representative, Seoul, surges six positions to claim fourth place. This year the index has been extended to rank the world’s 100 top student cities. What are you waiting for? See whether your city makes the list! ||||| Published annually, the QS Best Student Cities index showcases the best urban destinations for international students, based on a diverse range of indicators grouped into five key categories. Up to 2016, these categories consisted of: University Rankings, Student Mix, Desirability, Employer Activity and Affordability. Since 2017, the QS Best Student Cities has also included a category called Student View, based on a survey of students and recent graduates around the world. To be considered for inclusion, each city must have a population of over 250,000, and be home to at least two universities featured in the most recent QS World University Rankings®. For population metrics, the metropolitan area is used where possible. Current calculations suggest that 125 cities qualify for consideration. The indicators used to assess each category are outlined below. Unless otherwise stated, the indicators are weighted equally within each category. The six categories are also given equal weighting when calculating the overall order of the index. University rankings This category aims to reflect the collective performance of a city’s universities in the QS World University Rankings®. The indicators used reflect the magnetism of the large numbers of universities found in large cities, as well as lending recognition to the locations of the world’s elite institutions. Institution Count [x2] A score based on a straight count of the number of ranked institutions in the city. Indexed Score [x3] This indicator takes into account the collective performance of all institutions in the city. Points are awarded for each institution depending on which ranking range they fall into: Range Points 1-10 100 11-25 50 26-50 30 51-100 20 101-200 10 201-300 5 301-400 3 401-500 2 501+ 1 Top Score This score is based on the position of the highest-ranked institution in the city. Student Mix This category is designed to look at the student make-up of the city, both overall and from an international perspective. Cities with higher proportions of students are likely to be better equipped with the facilities students need, while areas with high numbers of international students are more likely to be well-prepared to welcome even more. Student Population A simple score based on the number of students at ranked institutions as a proportion of the city’s population. International Volume [x2] A score based on the total number of international students enrolled at ranked institutions. International Ratio [x2] A score based on the total number of international students as a proportion of all students studying at ranked institutions in the city. Tolerance & Inclusion [x2] This indicator reflects the importance for many international students of choosing a study environment which is likely to be hospitable to their own cultural background, lifestyle and identity. This score is based on the Social Progress Index, which tracks indicators by country on a variety of aspects, including tolerance and inclusion. Desirability This category aims to reflect the overall desirability of each destination. While students may be seeking exciting cities rich in opportunity, they (and their parents) are also likely to be concerned about the safety of the locality. A broad range of metrics is considered in an attempt to reflect these diverse requirements. Economist Liveability Index [x5] A score based on the results of the Economist Intelligence Unit's Liveability Index. GaWC+ Score [x2] A score based on the Globalization and World Cities index (GaWC), compiled at the University of Loughborough. An Alpha++ rating achieves 12 points, scaled down to 1 point for a “Sufficiency” rating.Further point boosts (up to a limit based on the number of cities featured) are available for inclusion in any of the following: PwC’s Cities of Opportunity Index – up to 3 additional points – up to 3 additional points Global Power City Index – up to 4 additional points – up to 4 additional points Trip Advisor’s History & Culture List or TripAdvisor's Shopping List – up to 6 additional points – up to 6 additional points City Momentum Index - up to 5 additional points Safety Score [x2] This score is based on the safety index compiled by Numbeo (the inverse of the crime index). The Numbeo results are augmented by data from the personal safety indicator of the Social Progress Index (country level), and The Economist’s Safe Cities Index. In each case the results are scored based on the distance from the mean position, with the top cities in each index receiving a positive result and the bottom cities a negative result. In the few cases where there is no city data available, the mean of all cities in that country is applied. Pollution Score Health and wellbeing are also important factors for prospective students and their parents, and air quality can vary greatly. This aspect is not highly weighted, but provides an interesting accent in the desirability category. This score is also derived from data gathered by Numbeo. In the few cases where there is no city data available, the mean of all cities in the relevant country is applied. Corruption Score [x2] Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index provides insight into the presence of corruption in the public sector, of which higher education is typically a part, by country. This score is included to reflect the fact that international students and their parents may want to be reassured that their fees are reaching the right places. Student Desirability [x2] This indicator is based on a student survey which collected over 50,000 responses worldwide. The survey is available year round, but there have been two pushes for responses, the first from December 2016 to January 2017 and the second from March 2018 to April 2018. As part of the survey, students were asked to identify their ‘dream student city’ – the city they would choose if they could study anywhere. This score is included to reflect international students’ perceptions of the most desirable city destinations. Employer Activity This category aims to provide an indication of which cities are most highly sought-after as recruiting grounds among graduate employers. Two of the indicators considered are based on QS’s annual survey of employers worldwide, which asks recruiters to identify the institutions they believe to be producing the best graduates in their sector. Domestic Employer Popularity A score based on the number of domestic employers who identified at least one institution in the city as producing excellent graduates, in QS’s employer survey. International Employer Popularity [x4] A score based on the weighted count of international employers who identified at least one institution in the city as producing excellent graduates. Since all of QS’s work is focused on supporting international students and opportunities for mobility, this indicator carries more weight than the domestic alternative. Youth Employment Bonus A bonus or penalty is applied based on World Bank figures for youth employment in the given country. The top and bottom quartile receive a 5% boost or handicap, while the top and bottom 5% of countries for youth employment receive a 10% adjustment. Affordability The fifth category recognizes the importance of affordability for most prospective students and their families. It draws on a range of sources to give an indication of how affordable a city is likely to be, when tuition fees and general living expenses are considered. Tuition Fees [x3] Usually the most substantial outlay for students, global trends suggest that tuition fees are likely to play an increasing role in shaping international student mobility trends in the coming years. This score carries twice the weight of the other affordability indicators. Big Mac Index [x2] A score based on this well-known index of retail pricing in cities worldwide, compiled and published by the Economist Intelligence Unit. IPad Index [x2] A score based on the iPad Index, compiled by Commsec, which compares the price of an iPad in different countries, giving an additional insight into local living costs. Cost of Living [2] Thisscore is based on the Mercer Cost of Living Rankings and provides a good counterpoint to the other affordability measures considered. For instance, Hong Kong is among the cheapest locations according to the Big Mac Index, but the second most expensive city in the Mercer Cost of Living Index, due to factors such as the high costs of accommodation. Considering this selection of indicators together provides a fuller picture. Student View This indicator is based on a student survey which collected over 50,000 responses worldwide. It provides students with an opportunity to share their experience of studying in a particular city. Student Experience [x3] This score is based on students’ ratings of their city in eight categories: tolerance andinclusion, diversity, friendliness, ease of getting around, affordability, nightlife, employment opportunities, arts and culture. The score is adjusted based on the proportion of international response. Cities which come out on top of the Student Desirability indicator (see above) don’t necessarily score equally well for Student Experience, showing that the real experience may not match expectations. Staying After Graduation [x2] This score is based on the proportion of students that either stayed or said they would like to stay in their student city for at least a year after graduation. This reflects students’ perceptions of the availability and quality of employment prospects, as well as providing a reflecting on their experience of the city overall. This score is also adjusted for the level of international response. Compilation Each indicator is converted into an ordinal by ranking the results and subtracting the rank of each result from the maximum. In some cases the underlying data is slightly reconfigured to ensure comparable application of weights (i.e. tuition fee values are organized into ranges). The resulting scores are combined with the weights shown above (these are relative weights within the category) and scaled to the top-performing city in the category to give a score with a maximum of 100 for each category, which are then summed to produce the final score, out of a theoretical maximum of 600. The final table is presented based on an overall score out of 100, showing rank, score, country and city names and scores out of 100 in each of the six categories. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Montréal has ousted Paris from the top of the QS Best Student Cities index, a ranking of the best urban destinations for international students.

Options: - exercise - dehydration - breathing hard - sweat - trip and fall Explain why a human would choose \\"sweat\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"Humans would choose \\"sweat\\" as the answer to the question \\"Running is a great workout, it really works up a what?\\" for several reasons, which can be understood by analyzing the physical aspects of running, as well as the purpose and process of sweating. Running is a form of aerobic exercise that engages multiple muscle groups and demands a lot of energy from the body. When a person runs, their heart rate increases, and the body works harder in order to provide the necessary oxygen and nutrients to the working muscles. The muscles generate heat as they utilize energy to maintain the running motion. Sweating is a natural process that helps the body regulate its temperature. When the body's temperature rises, the sweat glands produce sweat, which is a fluid composed primarily of water, salt, and other minerals. As the sweat evaporates from the skin surface, it cools down the body and helps maintain an optimal internal temperature. In the context of running, the human body experiences an increase in temperature due to the intense physical activity and the heat generated by working muscles. As a result, the body starts sweating to prevent overheating and maintain homeostasis. This means that sweat is a direct outcome of the vigorous nature of running, and thus is the most relevant answer to the question posed. The other options have their own explanations as to why they might not be the best answer: - Exercise: While running is indeed an exercise, the question specifically asks what running \\"works up.\\" Running is already the exercise, so it doesn't \\"work up\\" exercise. - Dehydration: Although running can lead to dehydration if one does not stay properly hydrated, dehydration is not an inevitable outcome of running. It is a potential result of not properly replenishing fluids lost through sweat, but it's not the only possible outcome. - Breathing hard: Running can definitely result in heavy breathing due to the increased oxygen demands of the body. However, the primary focus of the question is what running \\"works up,\\" and sweating is a more direct and universal result of running than heavy breathing. - Trip and fall: This option is not an inherent aspect of running. It's a possible risk or accident that can happen during running, but it's not something that running inherently \\"works up.\\" In conclusion, a human would choose \\"sweat\\" as the answer to the question because it is the most accurate representation of a natural response the body has to the act of running. Sweating is a direct result of increased heat production during running and helps regulate body temperature, making it the most suitable answer among the given options."},{"instruction":"David Cameron must shoulder some of the blame for Mark Reckless's defection, after falling out with him over the issue of Europe. During the run-up to last week’s Ukip conference, Nigel Farage was spotted going into an elegant Georgian townhouse close to a former site of the Bedlam hospital, one of the first British mental institutions, where the gentry used to amuse themselves by laughing at the inmates. Mark Reckless, a bespectacled 6ft 3in economist and barrister who became a Tory MP at the last election, arrived around the same time. It was in the privacy of the £2 million house that they plotted their own modern-day public spectacle: the humiliation of David Cameron on the eve of the Tory Party conference. The house is owned by Malcolm Pearson, who has a 12,000-acre estate in the west of Scotland, who was elevated to the House of Lords in 1990 by Margaret Thatcher shortly before she was bundled unceremoniously from office. As Lord Pearson of Rannoch he was always on the Eurosceptic wing of the Tory Party. It was his membership of the Lords EU select committee, from 1992 to 1996, which led him to become a leading exponent of the case for the UK to leave the EU. In 2004, in despair at the Tory stance on Europe, he recommended people voted Ukip in the European elections, and was swiftly punished by having the Tory whip removed. He joined Ukip three years later. He made good use of his time on the Ukip side, becoming firm friends with Douglas Carswell, the MP for Clacton, and the first Tory MP in the current Parliament to defect to Ukip. Carswell is a close friend of Reckless. They often met for drinks at Pearson’s home as they toyed with the idea of joining Ukip. But while Carswell, an MP since 2005, is a popular figure on the Tory benches, the same is not true of Reckless, who is regarded as cold and aloof. Carswell is one of his few confidantes at Westminster. With the Clacton by-election looming on October 9, dozens of Tory MPs have discovered pressing alternative engagements when asked to go to the Essex seaside town to campaign against Carswell. But there is real anger among Tory MPs about Reckless, not least because he was lying about his intentions only hours before his bombshell announcement. So why did Reckless decide to jump? The truth is David Cameron has much to answer for. His sometimes casual attitude to party management has repeatedly alienated some MPs. If any of them criticise him privately or publicly, they can find themselves sent to the political equivalent of Siberia. In the run-up to last week's Ukip conference, Nigel Farage and Mark Reckless were spotted going into a £2million townhouse in London together. In the summer of 2013, Cameron led an away-day of Tory MPs in his Chipping Norton constituency in Oxfordshire. It was designed to foster team spirit and develop election-winning policies. Unfortunately, by the end of the gathering, the Prime Minister’s already fractious relationship with Mark Reckless had disintegrated. In a speech during that event, the PM stressed the importance of unity. Sarah Wollaston, the former GP who became MP for Totnes at the last election, interrupted to say her constituents admired her independent-minded stances on several issues. After the session ended, Cameron sought out Wollaston and said: ‘Well, Sarah, you have to understand that when you rebel you never change anything. You just make us look divided.’ Reckless, who was sitting next to Wollaston, intervened, reminding the PM the only reason Cameron cut Britain’s EU grant was because of a revolt in 2012 by Tory MPs. The PM snapped back, saying: ‘I would have cut that anyhow.’ A disagreement ensued, and Reckless’s draining ‘faith’ in the PM evaporated. In June this year, Reckless – who studied PPE at Oxford and was privately educated at Marlborough College – was the first MP to be called to speak at a meeting of the 1922 backbench committee of MPs which was addressed by Cameron. He challenged the Prime Minister over his promised renegotiation of powers from the EU ahead of a referendum in 2017 if the Tories win the General Election. Cameron is said to have been dismissive of Reckless, who concluded that the promised renegotiation was a PR stunt. The Ukip timebomb which had started ticking away the previous year was by then on a very short fuse. The first approach from Ukip to Reckless – a former economist who married Scottish solicitor Catriona Brown at Westminster Cathedral in 2011 – came from Stuart Wheeler, the spread-betting magnate who gave £5 million to the Tories in 2001 when they were committed to keeping the pound. Lord Pearson was a former Tory MP, but defected to Ukip in 2007. He also led the party for a short time. Wheeler was thrown out of the Tories in 2009 when he gave £100,000 to Ukip, which he subsequently joined. He entertained Reckless twice at Serafino – an Italian restaurant a short walk from Wheeler’s home. It was after the Wheeler lunches that Reckless got to know Farage much better. But the decisive factor in the defection of Reckless was Lord Pearson. The founder of a London-based insurance brokers, which he sold for millions in the 1990s, Pearson owns a moor, a deer forest, and a £4 million 12,000-acre country estate in Rannoch in the Highlands. He has a share portfolio worth a reputed £2.5 million. With his cut-glass accent, a legacy of his Eton education, Pearson, 72, looks and sounds like an archetypal Tory grandee. He became the leader of Ukip after Farage stood down to fight a parliamentary seat at the 2010 election. One of his first acts was to withdraw candidates in elections against four prominent Tory Eurosceptic MPs. He forced the policy through in the teeth of bitter opposition from within Ukip’s ranks. The candidates were Philip Davies, who was defending Shipley, which he won last time with a 10,000 majority, and Philip Hollobone in Kettering, which he held with a 9,000 majority. And the other two candidates? Step forward Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless. Pearson also flooded their constituencies with 50,000 Ukip leaflets, urging votes to support the Tory candidates. All four enjoyed greater swings in their favour than in other constituencies. Given that two of the four Tories he backed at the last election have since defected, Pearson admits: ‘I always thought it was the right thing to do.’ And what about the other two, Davies and Hollobone? ‘I don’t know anything about that,’ he says. Which is exactly what he said about Carswell and Reckless. How the Tories must regret the offer from Farage and Pearson to stand down every one of their candidates at the last general election if Mr Cameron would make an unequivocal declaration in favour of an EU referendum. Pearson made the offer in June 2009 to Lord Strathclyde, the then Tory leader in the House of Lords, who conveyed it to Cameron. The Tory leader rejected it out of hand. Given the events of the weekend, no wonder Tory MPs and strategists are terrified another Ukip defector is about to lob a political hand grenade into the Conservative conference hall. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"David Cameron, a leader of a group of important people, was not very nice to Mark Reckless, another important person. They were in the same team but had a disagreement about something called Europe. Then, a man named Nigel Farage from a different team, called Ukip, met with Mark Reckless at a big, fancy house. They talked and decided that Mark Reckless will join Nigel Farage's team and make David Cameron look bad. This made the people in David Cameron's team angry and worried. They are scared that more people might leave their team and join Nigel Farage's team called Ukip."},{"instruction":"Subliniez cu fermitate faptul că parteneriatele între deputați, guvernele statelor membre ale UE și ale ONU, instituții și societatea civilă sunt esențiale în vederea consolidării sprijinului pentru îndeplinirea obiectivelor stabilite ale Programului de acțiune adoptat în cadrul Conferinței internaționale a ONU privind populația și dezvoltarea în ceea ce privește Obiectivele de dezvoltare ale mileniului.

However, there are slight differences in the context and connotations of the words \\"arrested\\" and \\"detained,\\" affecting the level of formality and the legal meaning of the two sentences. 1. \\"Kuroń, Modzelewski and Michnik were arrested again, and the majority of \\"Komandosi\\" members were imprisoned.\\" In this sentence, the word \\"arrested\\" typically implies that formal charges have been brought against the individuals, and they have been taken into custody by law enforcement. Arrests are part of the legal process that leads to a trial or some other form of judicial investigation. This generally includes being read their legal rights, being booked into a facility, and potentially having a bail amount set. The use of \\"arrested\\" highlights the severity of the situation and the involvement of the criminal justice system. 2. \\"Kuroń, Modzelewski and Michnik were detained again and a majority of the \\"Komandosi\\" members were imprisoned.\\" In this sentence, \\"detained\\" refers to the temporary restraining of the individuals' freedom of movement, typically by law enforcement, which can happen for various reasons. Detainment may happen due to suspicion, questioning, or for further investigation. Detainment is less formal than an arrest, and the individuals may or may not be formally charged with any crimes. It is also possible for them to be released without any legal consequences if it is determined that they have no connection with the ongoing investigation or have not committed any criminal actions. While both sentences imply the apprehension of Kuroń, Modzelewski, and Michnik, as well as the imprisonment of a majority of the \\"Komandosi\\" members, the key difference lies in the words \\"arrested\\" and \\"detained.\\" In essence, the first sentence suggests a more formal legal process, while the second sentence portrays a situation that might not necessarily lead to charges or trial.

Context: Manny had Bob Marley cranking on the stereo, his van was full of passengers, and the air conditioning was working after a long week of giving him trouble. The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops.

On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament. She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat. Get up, stand up, the radio cried out, and that was what Manny hoped would happen. He hoped that she would at least just stir and be okay. But she just lay there. Question: Why did Manny slow down? Answer: Select from: (i) not enough information (ii) the food cart owner stepped forward (iii) the boy stepped off the sidewalk (iv) tourists were on the road Answer:","output":"(iv) tourists were on the road"},{"instruction":"Robin Rhodes, 57, is accused of saying \\"Trump... will get rid of all of you.\\" and blocking the woman from leaving her office in the Delta Sky Lounge.

Germania was located in central Europe, consisting of much of present-day Germany, Denmark, Poland, the Czech Republic, Austria, and Switzerland. The history and formation of the German people can be traced back to a mixture of several ancient tribes, namely the Teutons, Saxons, Franks, Vandals, and others. These tribes shared a common Germanic linguistic and cultural heritage, and were gradually united over time through various waves of migration, warfare, and assimilation. The historical record highlights that the early Germanic tribes were mainly migratory in nature, and regularly interacted with existing cultures in Europe, such as the Celts and Romans. Throughout the centuries, the Germanic tribes became increasingly influential and powerful, eventually taking over the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD. Following this period, the various Germanic tribes began to form distinct kingdoms, such as the Frankish, Lombard, and Visigothic kingdoms, among others. The Frankish Empire, under the rule of Charlemagne in the 800s, eventually evolved into the Holy Roman Empire, which included a large portion of Central Europe. The modern concept of Germany did not truly solidify until the 19th century under Otto von Bismarck, who united the many sovereign German states into a single, powerful German Empire. His diplomatic and political efforts led to the establishment of the German nation-state we know today, which has continued to evolve and change through the 20th century and into the present day. In summary, the origin of the Germans can be traced back to the ancient Germanic tribes of central Europe. Over time, these tribes gradually united, forming distinct kingdoms and empires. The present-day German nation was ultimately born from the unification efforts of Otto von Bismarck in the 19th century."},{"instruction":"England head coach Sven-Goran Eriksson was delighted with his side #39;s 2-0 World Cup qualifying win over Wales and happy with his new-look three-man strikeforce.

The priority for the party was a permanent shelter against the rapidly approaching southern winter. On the suggestion of George Marston and Lionel Greenstreet, a hut—nicknamed the \\"Snuggery\\"—was improvised by upturning the two boats and placing them on low stone walls, to provide around five feet (1.5 m) of headroom. By means of canvas and other materials the structure was made into a crude but effective shelter.Wild initially estimated that they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees, who was not a popular man and whose presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.As the weeks extended well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium. A permanent lookout was kept for the arrival of the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays and anniversaries were celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship.

Make at least one backup of your record card. Include supporting documentation of entries on your card. Bring your record card to all medical appointments.\\"","output":"Title: The Importance of Using an Immunization Tracker and Maintaining Accurate Records Introduction Immunizations play a vital role in safeguarding our health by helping our bodies build resilience and immunity against infectious diseases. As new vaccines are developed and immunization schedules streamline, it is essential to keep a thorough record of the vaccines we have received. This is where an immunization tracker comes in handy, ensuring that our vaccinations are up-to-date and recorded accurately. This article will delve into the importance of getting an immunization tracker, making backups, including supporting documentation and the role played by carrying your record card to all medical appointments. The Value of an Immunization Tracker Immunization trackers offer several benefits for both individuals and healthcare providers. They are easy-to-use tools that can help monitor and organize all vaccination-related information at our fingertips: 1. Staying up-to-date: With an immunization tracker, you can easily keep track of your vaccination schedule. This ensures that you never miss any important vaccines, which could potentially expose you to preventable infectious diseases. 2. Travel requirements: Some countries require proof of vaccination as part of the entry process. Presenting an updated immunization record can prevent complications and potential delays when traveling. 3. Healthcare provider collaboration: By having a comprehensive immunization history, healthcare providers can accurately assess and guide your treatment if you have a disease that needs specific immunizations. 4. Personal health management: An immunization tracker can help you become proactive about your health, making informed decisions in consultation with medical professionals. The Importance of Backups and Supporting Documentation It's never wise to rely solely on the original immunization record card. Disasters, such as fires, floods, or theft, can lead to important documents being misplaced or destroyed. Here's why you need to create at least one backup of your immunization record card and include supporting documentation for all entries: 1. Proof of immunizations: If your original record card becomes lost or damaged, a backup will serve as a reliable record of the vaccines you've received. Keeping supporting documentation, such as receipts or medical reports, will make it easier to verify the entries and details on your card. 2. Insurance claims: In the event of an injury or illness related to your vaccinations, having accurate records can support your claims and ensure that insurance companies can process them without undue delays. 3. School or work regulations: Some schools and workplaces have immunization requirements to protect the institution's population against infectious diseases. Backing up your records and having supporting documentation allows you to easily prove that you meet these requirements. Bringing Your Record Card to Medical Appointments To achieve a holistic approach to healthcare, medical professionals need access to accurate and up-to-date information about your health, including immunization history. Here are a few reasons why carrying your immunization record card to all medical appointments is essential: 1. Continuity of care: By reviewing your immunization record card, your healthcare provider can make more informed decisions about any necessary immunizations or booster shots, as well as identify and address potential vaccine-related side effects. 2. Coordination of treatments: For specific medical conditions or treatments, your medical professional may need to know if you've received certain vaccinations. For instance, your vaccination status may impact the choice of medications or timing of surgeries. 3. Preventing avoidable complications: Uninformed booster shots or additional vaccinations could lead to adverse reactions or complications. By having your immunization record available, your healthcare provider can easily cross-reference the details and prevent any potential mishaps. Conclusion In conclusion, investing in an immunization tracker and maintaining accurate records is an essential process for not just individual healthcare management but also for the betterment of public health. Backing up your records and carrying your immunization record card to all medical appointments can save time, reduce the risk of adverse reactions, and contribute to more informed medical decisions. By doing so, you play an active role in maintaining your health and promoting the overall well-being of the community."},{"instruction":"Q: You are given a sentence in Japanese.

(CNN) -- I started playing sports at a young age and gravitated toward wheelchair basketball and track. In college, I decided to focus primarily on track and pursue my dream of going to the Paralympics. With the support of a great coach and team, I was selected as a member of Team USA and competed in track at the Paralympic Games in London in 2012. On Saturday, April 6, I embarked on the most challenging journey of my life. I left Los Angeles, heading toward New York City in my racing wheelchair -- a 71-day journey of 3,300 miles. While I didn't know what to expect or how my body would react to the demands of \\"pushing\\" the equivalent of two to three marathons a day, I knew one thing for sure -- I'd get it done. I committed to Push Across America as my way of giving back to Stay-Focused, an organization that has significantly impacted my life. During my Paralympic experience in London, where 80,000 fans cheered for me and my fellow Paralympians at each and every event, I was impressed with how the fans embraced us as athletes -- athletes first,","output":"disabled second. It was this positive attitude and embracing spirit that fueled my desire to give back to my community and inspire others through my journey. Push Across America was not just about the physical challenge but also about raising awareness and funding for Stay-Focused, a non-profit organization that serves disabled children and young adults by offering adaptable sports experiences and opportunities. In the weeks leading up to my departure, I trained rigorously and prepared by reviewing expert advice on techniques, nutrition, and gear to ensure my success. Day after day, I pushed through various terrains, battling unpredictable weather conditions, including high heat, strong winds, and even hailstorms. I tackled steep inclines, difficult descents, and countless miles of rough pavement. Along the way, I encountered the most amazing and supportive people who came out to cheer me on, provide me with shelter, food, and encouragement, and share their own inspiring stories with me. These interactions drove me to keep pushing forward and inspired me to work even harder. As I approached the East Coast, media outlets picked up on my story, and the visibility for Push Across America and Stay-Focused dramatically increased. More people started to join me on my journey, either by pushing alongside me for a portion or by sharing their own stories on social media and news outlets. This widespread support showed me the true power of community and the impact a single person's story could have on so many lives. After 71 days of intense physical and emotional challenges, I finally reached my destination: New York City. I crossed the finish line in Central Park, accompanied by friends, family, and supporters who had followed my journey. Though my body was exhausted and my hands were blistered from trembling along the wheelchair's wheels, my spirit soared with a sense of accomplishment and gratitude. As I rested and reflected on my journey, I realized that I had achieved my goal: people not only saw me as an athlete but as a testament to the power of perseverance and the strength of the human spirit. Push Across America raised over 150,000 for Stay-Focused, which enabled the organization to expand its programming and reach more young adults with disabilities. My story had inspired others to break through their own limitations and chase their dreams, regardless of the obstacles they faced. The story of Push Across America doesn't just end with the completion of my 3,300-mile journey. It serves as a reminder that we all possess untapped potential and that we can achieve extraordinary feats when we step out of our comfort zones. It's a testament to the power of community and the importance of supporting each other to create a more inclusive, understanding, and just world. As I continue to compete on an international level and work with Stay-Focused, I carry the lessons and experiences of Push Across America with me, using them to shape my future and the lives of those I aim to inspire."},{"instruction":"What kind of task would test someone's ability to perform physical reasoning?","output":"A task that tests someone's ability to perform physical reasoning typically involves manipulating objects, assessing spatial relationships, and understanding basic principles of mechanics, dynamics, fluid, and materials.

Here's a detailed comparison: 1. The house was purchased by Sir David Dundas of Dunira in 1858 , who sold it on to George Dewhurst of Lymm , Cheshire , in 1864. In this sentence, Sir David Dundas is identified as being from Dunira and purchases the house in 1858. Subsequently, he sells the house to George Dewhurst, who is from Lymm, Cheshire, in 1864. 2. The house was bought in 1858 by Sir George Dewhurst of Dunira , who in 1864 sold it to David Dundas of Lymm , Cheshire. This sentence is slightly different. Here, Sir George Dewhurst is identified as being from Dunira, and he buys the house in 1858. He then sells it to David Dundas, who is from Lymm, Cheshire, in 1864. The differences in these sentences include the titles and locations attributed to the individuals involved. In the first sentence, Sir David Dundas is described as being from Dunira, while in the second sentence, he is portrayed as being from Lymm, Cheshire. Similarly, George Dewhurst's origin is switched in the two sentences. Additionally, the title 'Sir' is attributed to different people in the two statements. In the first, it is given to David Dundas, while in the second, it is assigned to George Dewhurst. Thus, the two sentences are not exact paraphrases of each other but convey a similar sequence of events with discrepancies in the details of the individuals involved."},{"instruction":"How do I lose fats and excessive weight from body?

A later tradition recorded his entry into Jerusalem: according to Josephus, Alexander was shown the Book of Daniel's prophecy, presumably chapter 8, which described a mighty Greek king who would conquer the Persian Empire. He spared Jerusalem and pushed south into Egypt. However, Alexander met with resistance at Gaza. The stronghold was heavily fortified and built on a hill, requiring a siege. When \\"his engineers pointed out to him that because of the height of the mound it would be impossible... this encouraged Alexander all the more to make the attempt\\". After three unsuccessful assaults, the stronghold fell, but not before Alexander had received a serious shoulder wound. As in Tyre, men of military age were put to the sword and the women and children were sold into slavery. Alexander advanced on Egypt in later 332 BC, where he was regarded as a liberator. He was pronounced son of the deity Amun at the Oracle of Siwa Oasis in the Libyan desert. Henceforth, Alexander often referred to Zeus-Ammon as his true father, and after his death, currency depicted him adorned with rams horn as a symbol of his divinity. During his stay in Egypt, he founded Alexandria-by-Egypt, which would become the prosperous capital of the Ptolemaic Kingdom after his death.

First, let's break down the premise. It appears to be set in a colloquial, informal tone, implying a non-technical or casual conversation. There is mention of one company, Howard's Rangers, and the fact that there's only one in the immediate vicinity. The final part of the sentence, \\"they didn't try,\\" establishes a lack of substantial competition or motivation for Howard's Rangers, possibly due to the absence of other companies. However, there's not much information provided about other places or regions, so we cannot directly deduce that there are lots of companies in other places. The limited scope of this statement hinders our ability to infer anything concrete about other locations. To determine if the hypothesis is true, we need to examine some possible interpretations of the premise: 1. Interpretation 1: The premise implies that there is a lesser concentration of companies in the speaker's local area compared to other places. In this case, the hypothesis could be considered true. However, this is still an assumption, as the statement does not explicitly contain information about other locations. 2. Interpretation 2: The unique context of the speaker's local area has resulted in there only being one company. This implies that the situation is specific to this area and does not necessarily reflect the rest of the world. Therefore, the hypothesis may or may not be true, as there's no tangible claim regarding the company concentration in other places. 3. Interpretation 3: The existence of only one company in the area is purely coincidental and doesn't hold any relation to the presence of multiple companies in other locations. In this interpretation, the premise can neither confirm nor disprove the hypothesis. Ultimately, although the premise provides insight into the local presence of one company, Howard’s Rangers, and implies a lack of competition, there is not enough information to definitely support the hypothesis that \\"In other places, there are lots of companies.\\" It's essential to gather more comprehensive data about company distribution in various regions before drawing such a conclusion."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Sheikh Chilli - Sheikh Chilli is a Bollywood film.

There may be some people who find that they have negative reactions to some of the foods on the diet – others may find that it simply is not suitable for their lifestyle. However, it is an excellent choice for most people because the health benefits are tremendous. Lower blood pressure, reduced cholesterol levels, reduced risk of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, diabetes and much more. The diet is based on consuming wholesome fresh foods in their natural state and by cooking them in a healthy ways. Red meats are eaten only on occasion; sugar, processed foods filled with additives, fast foods, and junk food, which are the cause of so many illnesses in today’s world are simply not eaten. It should not be news that most health problems in the US can be attributed to a poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle. The Mediterranean diet solves both problems, if you let it. It provides the healthy nutritious foods your body needs for energy and well-being; plus, it incorporates exercise to solve the sedentary lifestyle issue. Let’s look at some of the potential difficulties. 1. The diet can be expensive. When you eat primarily fish, fresh (preferably organic) fruits and vegetables, nuts, etc. you will find that they are more expensive than grabbing a cheeseburger from a fast food joint or buying junk food from the vending machine at work.

This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses. Question: Who is Annie Dillard?

The UK citizen, whose identity has not been disclosed, was extradited from Germany to face charges in the United Kingdom in connection with an alleged large-scale cyber attack. The individual is believed to be the person behind the infamous Mirai botnet attack, which targeted several banks and caused widespread disruption and financial losses. The Mirai botnet first gained notoriety in October 2016, when it was used in an unprecedented attack on Dyn, a major domain name service (DNS) provider. The attack resulted in temporary outages for several popular websites, including Netflix, Twitter, Airbnb, and Amazon. Mirai works by infecting vulnerable Internet of Things devices, such as routers, surveillance cameras, and digital video recorders, and then using these devices to launch massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, which overwhelm targeted websites with fake traffic and render them inaccessible to legitimate users. Following the attack on Dyn, the Mirai botnet was used in several high-profile attacks against banks and other financial institutions. These attacks resulted in significant financial losses and damage to the reputation of the targeted organizations. The suspect in question is believed to be a key player in these attacks and is facing extradition to the United Kingdom to be held accountable for their actions. The arrest and subsequent extradition of the UK citizen is part of a larger international effort to combat cybercrime and hold those responsible for such attacks accountable. Law enforcement agencies from several countries, including the United States, Germany, and the UK, have been working together to identify, track, and apprehend the individuals responsible for developing, deploying, and operating the Mirai botnet. The extradition of the suspect to the United Kingdom underscores the seriousness with which nations are combating cybercrime and the global nature of the effort required to address this growing threat. As cybercriminals become increasingly sophisticated and networked, law enforcement agencies and governments must continue to work together to identify, apprehend, and prosecute those responsible for these actions. In conclusion, the UK citizen allegedly responsible for launching the Mirai botnet against banks has been extradited from Germany to the United Kingdom to face charges related to the significant damage caused by the Mirai botnet attacks. This illustrates the ongoing efforts of governments and law enforcement agencies to collaborate and combat cybercrime in an increasingly connected world."},{"instruction":"His phone was dead and they couldn't find the expressway, he opened up the glove compartment and handed his passenger the what to navigate?

Output:","output":"The task is asking you to find the value of 'y', which represents the average speed of a train during the second part of its journey. To do this, you will need to use the given information about the train's average speeds during the different parts of the journey. The guidelines for solving the problem: 1. You are given that the train travels the first 'd' miles at an average speed of 50 miles per hour. 2. The next 'd' miles are traveled at an average speed of 'y' miles per hour, which is what you need to find. 3. The final 'd' miles are traveled at an average speed of 160 miles per hour. 4. The train's overall average speed for the entire journey (3d miles) is 96 miles per hour. Follow these steps to find the answer: 1. Remember that average speed = total distance/total time. 2. Calculate the time taken for each part of the journey, using the formula time = distance/speed. For the first part, it is time1 = d/50. For the second part, it is time2 = d/y. For the third part, it is time3 = d/160. 3. Calculate the total time for all parts of the journey: total time = time1 + time2 + time3. 4. Find the expression for total distance by adding up the distances for all parts of the journey (3d miles). 5. Use the overall average speed formula for the entire journey: 96 = total distance/total time. 6. Plug in the expressions for total distance and total time from steps 3 and 4. 7.
