The investigation aims to determine if Minneapolis police have a pattern or practice of excessive use of force or other unconstitutional policing. Chauvin was found guilty of second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter in the death of George Floyd last year. Floyd's death was captured on video, which showed Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck for over nine minutes, despite Floyd's pleas that he couldn't breathe. The verdict in the Chauvin trial represented a rare instance of a police officer being held accountable for using lethal force against a Black person in the United States. Protests against police brutality and systemic racism swept the country last summer following Floyd's death, and demands for police reform have continued to mount in the months since. Garland's investigation will look at the Minneapolis Police Department's policies, training, and use of force incidents to determine whether the department has violated civil rights laws. Garland said in a statement that the Justice Department \\"will also examine whether the MPD engages in discriminatory policing\\" and will work with community leaders, law enforcement officers, and other stakeholders to identify areas where the department can improve. The investigation is one of the first major actions taken by Garland since he was confirmed as Attorney General in March. Garland has previously served as a federal judge and was nominated to the Supreme Court by former President Barack Obama in 2016, but was not given a confirmation hearing by the Republican-controlled Senate at the time. The Minneapolis Police Department was already under scrutiny prior to the Chauvin trial. The city agreed to a settlement with Floyd's family, which included a 27 million payment, and the police department faced criticism for its handling of protests in the aftermath of Floyd's death. Garland's investigation could lead to greater federal oversight of the Minneapolis Police Department and could be a step towards meaningful police reform in the United States. However, it remains to be seen how the investigation will play out or what actions the Justice Department will take in response to its findings."},{"instruction":"Goal: How do you make a paper airplane?

In front of dozens of vials of human feces, Gates explained that the vials represent a potential breakthrough in the fight against diseases like cholera and diarrhea that are caused by poor sanitation. According to Gates, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is supporting the development of waterless toilets that can separate urine from solids and safely treat the waste. This technology can help address one of the biggest challenges in developing cities: access to proper sanitation. In fact, Gates believes that taking on this issue is key to preventing large-scale diarrhoea outbreaks. Gates cited the prevalence of slums in developing cities as a clear indication of sanitation challenges. In many of these areas, people don't have access to functioning toilets or proper waste disposal systems, leading to high rates of disease and illness. The development of waterless toilets represents a potential solution to this problem, and the foundation is actively working with partners to bring the technology to more populations in need. It's clear that sanitation is a major issue in many parts of the world, and addressing it will require a variety of solutions. However, the development of waterless toilets is an important step in the right direction.

However, police were alerted to the theft after a beekeeper noticed his hives were missing and launched an investigation. Expand this summary.","output":"A man from California, identified as Sergio Valenzuela, has been arrested on charges of grand theft and possession of stolen property after he was caught with a stolen truck carrying several hundred beehives. The incident reportedly occurred when Valenzuela stole the truck overnight and drove it to an abandoned lot where he planned to unload the beehives. However, a beekeeper alerted the police to the theft after he noticed that his beehives had gone missing. The police launched an investigation and eventually caught Valenzuela in possession of the stolen bees. The value of the stolen property is yet to be determined, but it is expected to be several thousands of dollars. Bee theft has become an increasingly common problem in California in recent years, with many beekeepers reporting the theft of their hives. The demand for bees is high due to their role in pollinating crops and producing honey. The theft of a truck full of bees is a significant loss for the beekeeper, and can have a significant impact on the local ecosystem if not recovered in time. The theft of bees is not only harmful to beekeepers but also to the bees themselves. It is a stressful and traumatic experience for the bees as they are moved and could be exposed to harmful conditions. Due to this, stolen bees have a lower chance of survival and can be a significant loss for the beekeeper who relies on them for their livelihood. To protect themselves against such theft, beekeepers have started to take measures such as using GPS to track their hives, branding their hives, and working with authorities to investigate any thefts. The authorities have also started cracking down on bee theft by increasing surveillance and imposing stricter penalties to deter thieves. While the arrest of Sergio Valenzuela is a step towards reducing bee thefts, it is essential to continue to take measures to protect both bees and beekeepers against theft. This involves educating the public about the importance of bees and their role in our ecosystem, as well as imposing harsher penalties to deter thieves from stealing bee colonies and jeopardizing our food system."},{"instruction":"the following sentence expressing positive or negative sentiment?

The pandemic has highlighted existing inequalities in the education system, particularly for lowincome and marginalized students. Some experts predict that the pandemic could lead to permanent changes in the way education is delivered.","output":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused universities around the world to adopt online learning as a means of delivering education to students while maintaining social distancing. While online learning has its advantages, such as the ability to learn from anywhere with an internet connection, there have been a number of challenges with the transition. One major challenge is the lack of access to technology. Not all students have access to a reliable computer and internet connection, which makes online learning difficult or impossible. This is particularly true for low-income and marginalized students, who are more likely to lack access to technology. Another challenge is the difficult home learning environment. Many students come from homes that are not conducive to learning, whether that's due to noise, distractions or family responsibilities. This can make it difficult to focus and complete assignments on time. The shift to online learning has also raised concerns about the quality of education and the value of a university degree. Without in-person interactions with professors and classmates, some worry that students are not receiving the same level of education they would have received in a traditional classroom. Additionally, some have raised concerns about the value of a university degree if students are not able to network and gain practical experience through internships and other opportunities. The pandemic has also highlighted existing inequalities within the education system. As mentioned previously, low-income and marginalized students are more likely to lack access to technology and have a difficult home learning environment. This exacerbates existing inequalities and makes it harder for these students to succeed. Despite these challenges, some experts predict that the pandemic could lead to permanent changes in the way education is delivered. Online learning isn't perfect, but it has the potential to make education more accessible to a wider range of students. It also allows universities to offer more flexible learning options that can better accommodate students' schedules and balance work and family obligations. In conclusion, the shift to online learning has been a challenging one for students and universities alike. However, it has also highlighted existing inequalities within the education system and has the potential to usher in permanent changes that could make education more accessible to all."},{"instruction":"the waitress the same as she in this sentence?

For example, if we were looking at a recent NFL game between the Green Bay Packers and the Chicago Bears, we could go to the NFL's official website or a sports news website such as ESPN and look at the box score for the game. The box score would tell us how many rushing yards each player on each team had. In this imaginary scenario, let's say that the Packers won the game 27-24 and their running back, Aaron Jones, had 150 rushing yards. The Bears' running back, David Montgomery, had 120 rushing yards. Therefore, the answer to the question \\"Who had the most rushing yards in the game?\\" would be Aaron Jones. It is important to remember that the player with the most rushing yards in a game is not necessarily the most valuable player on the field. Other factors, such as passing yards, touchdowns, and defensive play, also contribute to a team's success.

Our skin is the largest organ in our body and serves a vital role in protecting our internal organs. But, with so many skincare products and routines out there, it can be overwhelming to know where to start. Here are five simple tips to help you take care of your skin: 1. Use sunscreen daily: One of the most important things you can do for your skin is to protect it from the sun's harmful UV rays. Use sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 and apply it to your face, neck, and any other exposed skin 30 minutes before going outside. Reapply every two hours or more often if you swim or sweat. 2. Moisturize regularly: Keeping your skin moisturized is key to maintaining its health and appearance. Choose a moisturizer that works for your skin type and apply it twice a day, after cleansing and using any treatments. Moisturizing can help reduce fine lines and wrinkles, and keep your skin looking radiant. 3. Avoid harsh chemicals: Some skincare products contain harsh chemicals that can irritate your skin and do more harm than good. Choose products that are gentle and formulated for your skin type. Read ingredient lists and avoid anything that contains alcohol, fragrances, or sulfates. 4. Get enough rest: Getting enough sleep is important for your overall health, but it also plays a role in your skin's health. Lack of sleep can cause dark circles, puffiness, and dry skin. Aim for seven to eight hours of sleep each night to give your skin time to repair and regenerate. 5. Stay hydrated: Drinking water helps flush toxins out of your body and keeps your skin hydrated from the inside out. Aim for at least eight glasses of water a day, and eat foods that are high in water content, like watermelon, cucumbers, and citrus fruits. In conclusion, taking care of your skin doesn't have to be complicated.

Rising temperatures and unpredictable weather patterns are altering ecosystems, pushing many species to the brink of extinction. The impacts of climate change on wildlife are complex and far-reaching, affecting everything from breeding patterns to migration habits. One of the most obvious impacts of climate change on wildlife is the loss of habitat. As temperatures rise, forests and other ecosystems are increasingly vulnerable to drought, fires, and other factors that can cause substantial damage. Many species rely on these habitats for food, shelter, and nesting sites, and as these habitats disappear, so do the animals that depend on them. The changing climate is also altering the timing of lifecycle events for many species, particularly those that are migratory. For example, warmer temperatures are causing some migratory birds to arrive at their breeding grounds earlier than usual, which can cause them to miss peak food sources. This can negatively impact their breeding success, leading to a decline in population numbers. Some species are also adapting to climate change by shifting their ranges to places that better suit their needs. For example, some fish and bird species are moving to higher elevations or cooler waters as temperatures rise. While this may help these species in the short term, in the long term, these range shifts could cause ecosystem imbalances and further endanger species that don't have the ability to adapt as quickly. Climate change is also leading to more extreme weather events such as storms, droughts, and heat waves, which can have a significant impact on wildlife populations. For example, severe droughts can lead to widespread crop failures, which can impact insect populations and the animals that rely on them for food. Similarly, heat waves can cause mass die-offs of species that are not adapted to extreme temperatures. In conclusion, climate change is having a profound impact on wildlife around the world. As temperatures continue to rise and weather patterns become more extreme, many species are struggling to survive. By reducing carbon emissions and taking steps to protect wildlife habitats, we can help mitigate the impacts of climate change and ensure the survival of many species for generations to come."},{"instruction":"What is the full name of the current Queen of England?","output":"The full name of the current Queen of England is Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor."},{"instruction":"Provide a subject line for an email to HR regarding Employee Benefits Open Enrollment.","output":"Employee Benefits Open Enrollment - Action Required."},{"instruction":"ert appropriate punctuation: she walked her dog in the park played frisbee with her friends and had a picnic on the gr","output":"She walked her dog in the park, played frisbee with her friends, and had a picnic on the grass."},{"instruction":"Do these two sentences convey the same idea?

He says relationships and trust are more important than flashy ads. He says it is important to focus on serving your audience, not just selling to them. Godin: Marketing is no longer about the stuff you make, but the story you tell. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"In today's world, marketing is more about building connections than flashy advertisements. This is the belief of marketing guru Seth Godin, who preaches the importance of relationships and gaining the trust of your audience. He emphasizes that it is essential to focus on serving your audience rather than selling to them. Marketers who are committed to providing value and building relationships tend to see long-term success when compared to those who solely rely on flashy ads and sales pitches. According to Godin, marketing is no longer primarily about the product or service being sold. Instead, it is about the story that the product tells. It is about the way a product or service resonates with the audience and the story it portrays. People want to connect with products or services that align with their values and beliefs. Therefore, it is essential to craft a narrative that speaks to your audience and connects with them on a deeper level. Godin has long preached the importance of serving your audience rather than selling to them. He believes that marketers should provide their audience with value and build a relationship of trust. This approach involves understanding your audience's needs and creating content or products that solve their problems. When customers know that your brand is committed to helping them rather than only selling to them, they are more likely to trust you and become loyal customers. The focus on building relationships is especially crucial in today's interconnected world, where word-of-mouth marketing has become more important than ever. A positive recommendation from a friend or family member can sway a person's purchasing decision, even more than a flashy advertisement. Building a community of loyal customers can lead to a ripple effect, where satisfied customers recommend your business to their friends and family. In conclusion, Seth Godin's emphasis on building relationships and serving your audience is critical for marketing success. Marketers should focus on telling a compelling story that resonates with their audience, rather than just selling a product or service. By providing value and building a relationship of trust with customers, businesses can cultivate a loyal base that will naturally spread the word about their brand. These practices can lead to long-term success and make the difference between a brand that quickly fizzles out and one that thrives."},{"instruction":"Paraphrase?

This process begins with one diploid cell and involves the pairing and exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes in prophase I. Then, in metaphase I, the homologous chromosomes arrange themselves on the metaphase plate before separating and moving to opposite poles in anaphase I. The second round of division, meiosis II, is similar to mitosis but with half the number of chromosomes. In comparison, mitosis only involves one round of division, resulting in two identical daughter cells with the same number of chromosomes as the original parent cell. Mitosis does not involve homologous chromosome pairing or crossing over, and the chromosomes line up individually on the metaphase plate in metaphase. Anaphase in mitosis involves the separation of sister chromatids rather than homologous chromosomes."},{"instruction":"A: I don't know how to solve this equation.

Ancient Greece: An advanced civilization that played a significant role in shaping Western culture, though not much is known about its economy. 2. Ottoman Empire: Greece was mostly an agricultural society and under the control of Ottoman Turks, who extracted heavy taxes from the Greeks, leading to economic decline and poverty. 3. Greek War of Independence and early independence: Greece gained independence in 1821, but the country remained poor, dependent on agriculture and unable to invest in infrastructure. 4. Industrialization and the rise of nationalism: An economic boom in the late 19th and early 20th century led to the growth of cities, factories and infrastructure. Nationalism also played a key role in Greece's economic development, as it encouraged investment and growth. 5. World War II and the civil war: Greece was devastated during World War II and the civil war that followed further dented the country's economy. 6. Modernization and growth: Greece entered a golden age of growth in the 1950s and 1960s, thanks to investments in infrastructure, telecommunications and industry. 7. The fall of the military junta and the adoption of democracy: The fall of the military junta in 1974 led to a period of political instability that hurt the economy, though growth resumed in the 1980s. 8. The adoption of the euro: Greece joined the eurozone in 2001, which brought stable economic growth, but also contributed to the debt crisis that followed in 2010. In summary, analyzing Greece's economic growth from its formation up until its adoption of the euro shows a complex and often uneven trajectory, influenced by a range of political, social and economic factors."},{"instruction":"What is the value of y if 4y + 3 = 19?","output":"The value of y is 4."},{"instruction":"'s Jake's turn to walk the dog.

With the rapid advancement of technology, we find ourselves constantly connected to a virtual world that has changed the way we interact, think, and perceive ourselves. While social media can be a powerful tool for communication, it has also given rise to unintended consequences. Firstly, let us examine the addictive nature of social media. How many of us can honestly say we haven't experienced the irresistible urge to check our phones for notifications, likes, or comments? It has become an involuntary reflex, overtaking our real interactions. We have become entrapped in a digital world where the number of likes defines our worth, and validation comes from the number of followers we accumulate. It fosters a feeling of inadequacy and a constant need to present a carefully curated image to the world. This obsession with social media has created a generation that is disconnected from the present moment. We are living life through a lens, more concerned with capturing the perfect picture than savoring the beauty of the experience itself. Instead of embracing the joy of face-to-face conversations, we find solace in the virtual comfort of social media platforms. It is time to break free from this addiction and reclaim the true essence of human connection. Moreover, social media has also perpetuated a culture of materialism, where our worth is determined by the abundance of possessions we acquire. We are bombarded with advertisements of luxurious products, exotic vacations, and unattainable lifestyles. It breeds a sense of dissatisfaction and an insatiable desire for more. We prioritize material possessions over genuine happiness, constantly striving for the next best thing. It blinds us to the fulfilling experiences that truly enrich our lives – experiences that cannot be bought or measured in material terms. We are caught in a vicious cycle, where we compare our lives to carefully curated content, leaving us feeling inadequate or unworthy. It is time to break free from this materialistic mindset and recognize that our value lies not in our possessions but in the love we give, the kindness we share, and the authentic connections we forge. So, what can we do to combat these pervasive issues? Awareness is the first step. By acknowledging the addictive nature of social media, we can consciously make an effort to limit our usage and prioritize face-to-face interactions. Rediscovering the beauty of nature, engaging in hobbies, and nourishing real relationships will help restore balance to our lives. Furthermore, we must redefine our definition of success and happiness. Let us measure our accomplishments based on the positive impact we have on others, the personal growth we achieve, and the relationships we cultivate. Material possessions may provide temporary satisfaction, but true fulfillment and contentment stem from experiences, compassion, and personal development. In conclusion, my dear friends, social media addiction and the materialism it spreads are challenges that we must confront head-on. By embracing a more conscious and balanced approach to our digital lives, we can break free from the chains that bind us. Let us prioritize human connection, inner growth, and empathy over likes, followers, and material possessions. Together, we can pave the way for a more authentic, fulfilling, and meaningful existence. Thank you."},{"instruction":"Make an engaging speech on how social media works on giving our most of the time to it and emphasize on social media addiction in young age groups.","output":"Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests, and dear friends, Today, I would like to draw your attention to a pertinent issue that has infiltrated our lives, especially among young age groups – social media addiction. In a world where technology reigns supreme, we find ourselves surrendering an astonishing amount of time to social media platforms, unwittingly falling prey to its alluring grasp. It is high time we shed light on this persistent problem and its profound impact on our youth. Imagine a day without social media, without the constant scroll-through of news feeds, notifications, and the urge to share every moment of our lives with the virtual world. It seems nearly impossible, doesn't it? This is precisely why social media addiction has become a pressing concern, infiltrating the minds and lives of our young minds. Throughout the day, we notice teenagers and young adults, constantly glued to their screens, immersed in a virtual realm that consumes their precious time and attention. They're constantly swiping, liking, commenting, and comparing their lives to carefully constructed digital facades. It's become an addiction, a habit ingrained so deeply that they can barely distinguish between the real world and the virtual one. Why has social media become so captivating? It's the appeal of instant gratification, the thrill of validation, and the allure of virtual popularity. The young minds crave acceptance and approval, and social media provides an easily accessible platform for attaining this approval. The influx of likes, followers, and comments becomes a source of validation, indicating their worth in the digital realm. Sadly, this elusive sense of worth is temporary, fleeting, and often gives rise to a never-ending cycle of comparison and dissatisfaction. What does social media addiction look like? It means sacrificing valuable time that could be spent pursuing passions, exploring the world, and building genuine connections. Instead, hours upon hours are lost, endlessly scrolling through feeds, engrossed in the lives of others. The addiction hampers productivity, impacts mental health, and prevents personal growth during the crucial years of youth. But, my dear friends, we have the power to enact change. Awareness and education are key. Recognizing that social media is a double-edged sword is the first step. It's about understanding the impact and consequences of excessive usage, not just for ourselves but for the younger generation. As parents, teachers, and mentors, we have a responsibility to instill a healthy relationship with social media. Teaching resilience and self-worth beyond virtual validation is paramount. Encouraging outdoor activities, hobbies, and fostering face-to-face interactions can help restore balance in a digital world that often blurs the lines between the real and the virtual. We must empower our youth to use social media as a platform for positive change. It can be a tool for spreading awareness, amplifying important messages, and connecting with like-minded individuals. By shifting their focus towards meaningful interactions, sharing informative content, and pursuing their genuine passions, we can transform the impact of social media addiction on our young minds. In conclusion, my dear friends, social media addiction among young age groups is a growing concern that we must address urgently. Let us strive to create a healthy digital ecosystem, where virtual lives do not overshadow the beauty and significance of the real world. By fostering awareness, education, and encouraging balance, we can empower our youth to embrace their authentic selves, disentangle from the clutches of social media addiction, and lead lives filled with purpose, growth, and genuine connections.

Tensions are high as everyone prepares for the grand premiere. The play's success hinges on the opinion of revered and feared theater critic, Martin Davenport. ACT ONE: The camera pans through the bustling theater before resting on Martin Davenport, who takes meticulous notes in the dim auditorium. Meanwhile, backstage, the play's director, Phillip Randolph, confronts lead actress, Diana Lassiter, about her performance. The two have an explosive argument just as Phillip receives a note bearing bad news. ACT TWO: Hours later, after the performance, Martin is found dead in his private box, an apparent heart attack. Lieutenant Columbo arrives at the scene. His demeanor seems out of place in the grandeur of the theater, with his rumpled coat and signature cigar. Upon initial observation, the death seems natural, but Columbo's instincts tell him otherwise. He starts poking around, asking seemingly innocuous questions of everyone, from the stagehands to the performers. Columbo notices a discrepancy: Davenport's review, already published online. The review is devastating, but a timestamp reveals it was posted hours before the play's conclusion. ACT THREE: Columbo's investigation leads him closer to Phillip, who is clearly agitated whenever Davenport's name comes up. Columbo also learns about the argument between Phillip and Diana. As Columbo snoops around the critic's box, he notices a scent that reminds him of his wife's perfume, but sharper. It's residue from a powerful, fast-acting poison on the rim of a wine glass. ACT FOUR: With the poison identified, Columbo finds his stride. He confronts Phillip with evidence of a troubled financial past and a critical need for the play's success. Phillip was relying on this play to revive his career. Columbo subtly hints he knows about the digital manipulation of the review's timestamp. ACT FIVE: Phillip's nervousness is palpable as Columbo discusses the intricacies of the theater. They come upon Diana, who is rehearsing alone. Columbo offhandedly references the disagreement she had with Phillip. Diana, frazzled, lets slip more than she intends, revealing her knowledge of the poison, one she uses for her chronic migraines, which matches the one found on the wine glass. ACT SIX: At the climax, during rehearsals, Columbo orchestrates his reveal. In front of Phillip, Diana, and the cast, he recreates the movements in the critic's box on the night of the murder, having identified a specific chair where the poison was swapped. As he demonstrates how the glass with the poison could have only been reached by someone familiar with the intricacies of the theater's aisles and private box, he lets it slip that only three people had that knowledge: the theater manager, the victim, and the director, Phillip. Phillip interrupts, insisting that's not how it happened, inadvertently confessing the precise details of the murder that only the killer would know. The episode closes with Columbo gently escorting Phillip away, complimenting the director on the excellent performance of his career - his final act. FADE OUT."},{"instruction":"Write in character dialogue for this episode.","output":"FADE IN: INT. THEATER AUDITORIUM - NIGHT The camera glides over the opulent interior before settling on MARTIN DAVENPORT, sitting alone, scribbling notes. In the wings, PHILLIP RANDOLPH, a man in his 50s, confronts DIANA LASSITER, a star actress in her 30s. PHILLIP (gesturing angrily) Your timing's off, Diana! If this flops, you're not the only one sinking - we all go down! DIANA (defensive) Don't pin this on me, Phillip. If anyone's steering this ship, it's you, Captain! They break off as a STAGEHAND approaches Phillip with a note. Phillip reads and blanches. The camera shifts to show Martin, having a minor coughing fit before settling down and sipping wine. CUT TO: INT. THEATER PRIVATE BOX - NIGHT Columbo surveys the scene, a hint of tension beneath his disheveled appearance, as he looks over Martin's body surrounded by PARAMEDICS. COLUMBO (to Paramedic) Heart attack, huh? You know, my wife always says I should watch out for those. But a theater critic, they're made of sterner stuff, right? The paramedic nods, and Columbo begins exploring, his gaze lingering on the glass in Martin’s hand. CUT TO: INT. THEATER BACKSTAGE - DAY Columbo paces, questioning PHILLIP, who's distracted and on edge. COLUMBO That's some review Mr. Davenport left. He has a way with words, even if they're not the kind you'd hope for, huh? PHILLIP (reluctantly) A review's a review, Lieutenant. In this business, we must take what we're given. Columbo tucks his hands in his pockets, is about to walk away, but then turns back as if remembering something. COLUMBO Oh, just one more thing, Mr. Randolph. When did you find out about the review? You seem...well, prepared for it. Phillip's eyes dart away. He's caught off guard. PHILLIP (stammering) I suppose... word travels fast... in this business. Columbo nods, squinting as if this made perfect sense, yet the viewer sees the detective's mind whirring. CUT TO: INT. DARKENED THEATER AUDITORIUM - DAY Columbo and DIANA are seated in the critic's box, a wine glass on the table. COLUMBO (pointing to glass) You know, it's funny. I've seen this performed before. The ol' cup trick. Now, someone had to be very familiar with these surroundings to pull it off without being seen. Diana watches nervously as Columbo mimics picking up a glass. DIANA Yes, but anyone could have walked by and... COLUMBO (nodding) Sure, sure, anyone. Except it was placed exactly here. (he points precisely) Where someone not intimately knowledgeable wouldn't have dared to reach, for fear of being seen. Isn't that right, Ms. Lassiter? DIANA hesitates, then blurts out more than she intends. DIANA (frazzled) Yes, but even if Phillip knew, that doesn't mean... COLUMBO (surprised) Phillip? Oh, I never said Mr. Randolph... How curious... Columbo gives her a piercing look, Diana averts her eyes - the slip is out. CUT TO: INT. THEATER STAGE - NIGHT Phillip, Diana, and the cast gather as Columbo lays out his theory with dramatic flair, fitting for the setting. COLUMBO Imagine this. The critic sits here, everyone else... there. Our killer approaches, silent as a shadow, trading a clean glass for the poisoned one in the second act's twilight. Phillip interrupts impatiently, his voice betraying a guilty knowledge. PHILLIP No, Lieutenant! The lights would be down by that point, you wouldn't see the killer, even if you were staring right at them. The cast gasps. DIANA looks at Phillip, realization dawning; she steps away from him slightly. COLUMBO (shaking his head) Mr. Randolph, the only way you’d know that is if you’d seen it yourself. From the shadows. Phillip's composure cracks, sweat appears on his brow. Columbo steps towards him, pointing gently but firmly. COLUMBO (CONT'D) I'm afraid this is the audience you never wanted, sir. You gave a command performance - for an audience of one. Phillip deflates, the truth heavy in his eyes, as Columbo produces handcuffs. Always regretful when it comes to this part.

A COURTROOM – DAY] The courtroom buzzes with quiet anticipation. All eyes fix on the central figure, Petyr Baelish, known as Littlefinger. Dressed in a sharp, tailored suit that could have been woven with threads of silver and shadows, he exudes an air of confidence as he prepares to address the jury. Littlefinger's enigmatic smile barely touches his lips—he knows the game of court is no different from the game of thrones. Every word from his mouth is calculated, every gesture deliberate. LITTLEFINGER: (Clears his throat) Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. We live in a world of chaos, a web of human desires and intentions where the truth is oftentimes... elusive. He glances at the prosecution, a hint of disdain in his eyes. LITTLEFINGER: (Continues) My opponents would have you believe that the case before us is simple, that it is black and white. But I assure you, that is a fantasy. The reality is shades of grey—complex, uncertain, and mysterious. He walks slowly towards the jury, each step measured. LITTLEFINGER: (Softly) You've been presented with evidence and testimonies, a cacophony of voices each vying to convince you of their veracity. But I ask you, who benefits from the narrative the prosecution weaves so desperately? Who gains from the conviction of my client? His eyes scan the jurors, connecting, persuading. LITTLEFINGER: (Pausingly) Chaos, you see, is a ladder. And many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. But what if this chaos has been carefully orchestrated, what if our current proceedings are but a stage for someone else's ascent? The jury is enthralled, hanging on his every word. LITTLEFINGER: We must look beyond the veil of simplicity, unravel the threads of intention, and question the stories we are told. For the truth is rarely pure and never simple. He pauses, allowing his words to sink in before turning to the judge. LITTLEFINGER: (Respectfully) Your Honor, I submit that the evidence against my client is woven from assumptions and speculation, not facts. It is a narrative constructed by those who seek power over justice, exploitation over truth. He turns back to the jury, his eyes bright with conviction. LITTLEFINGER: Therefore, I appeal to your sense of reason, to see through the illusions and subterfuge. Acquit my client, and in doing so, choose the path of truth and righteousness—overturn the ladder of chaos that has been erected in this courtroom. The jury nods, their expressions indicative of minds persuaded by the sheer force of Littlefinger's charisma. He smiles subtly, knowing that in this courtroom, like in the halls of power he once tread, information, and cunning are the ultimate arbiters of fate.

Fed up with constantly being foiled by the town's beloved superhero, Wordgirl, they decided to go into hiding at their secret hideout - an old, abandoned warehouse at the edge of town. The warehouse was dimly lit, filled to the brim with mysterious contraptions, and filled with the echoes of villainous laughter. It had become their sanctuary, a place where they could scheme and plot their next dastardly deeds without the fear of Wordgirl's justice. Inside the hideout, there was Lady Redundant Woman, whose powers allowed her to duplicate herself with a zap of her special remote control. Then there was Dr. Two-Brains, a brilliant but eccentric scientist with a cheese addiction, and Chuck the Evil Sandwich-Making Guy, who always dreamed of becoming the city's greatest supervillain, armed only with bread, lettuce, and mayonnaise. Butcher, the latest villain to join their ranks, was a rather interesting character. With his love for chaos and all things destructive, he possessed a heightened sense of hearing. However, this unique sensory power sometimes got the better of him, causing unpredictable reactions to loud sounds. One evening, as the villains were huddled around their hideout's central table, they suddenly heard the distant blaring of police sirens coming closer and closer. Lady Redundant Woman smirked, thinking they were for once one step ahead of the law, but Butcher's ears twitched in discomfort. The sound grew louder and louder until it reached a crescendo, filling the hideout with the distant wailing of police cars. Butcher began to fidget nervously, clenching his fists tightly. He could feel his senses intensifying beyond his control. With a sudden surge of power, Butcher sprang to his feet, knocking over a chair. His eyes became wild, and he covered his ears as if trying to block out the cacophony. The loud sound had triggered a sensory overload, causing his powers to go haywire. \\"Stop it! Make it stop!\\" Butcher yelled, his voice trembling with distress. His body convulsed, and in a moment of panic, he accidentally triggered Lady Redundant Woman's remote control, duplicating her several times over. Dr. Two-Brains, always quick-witted, realized what was happening and hurriedly rushed towards Butcher, trying to calm him down. \\"Easy, Butcher! Focus on my voice. Breathe, just breathe.\\" The villains watched as Dr. Two-Brains worked his magic, gently guiding Butcher to regain control of his powers. Lady Redundant Woman's duplicates disappeared one by one, merging back into a single entity. Slowly, the chaos in the hideout subsided, and the blaring sirens became a distant hum. Butcher slumped onto the floor, exhausted yet relieved. He looked up at his fellow villains, appreciating their support and understanding. \\"Thank you, everyone.\\" Lady Redundant Woman offered him a reassuring smile. \\"We've got your back, Butcher. We're all in this together.\\" From that day forward, the villains developed a newfound respect and bond. They learned to be mindful of each other's unique abilities and to help whenever one of them faced a challenge. Though their hideout remained a place of villainous deeds, it also became a refuge where they could be themselves without judgment. And as the sound of police sirens continued to echo through the city streets, the villains gathered strength, knowing that together, they were always ready to face the world outside - even if it ignited the occasional sensory overload."},{"instruction":"Cuatro mensajeros se han repartido un cierto número de paquetes para entregar.

But within its grimy walls, dwelled a dastardly group of villains. Wordgirl's most formidable foes had chosen this place as their secret hideout, their sanctuary, away from the prying eyes of the world. Inside the warehouse, the air was thick with tension, and the villains, each with their unique strengths, were always on guard. Dr. Two-Brains, notorious for his intellect and hunger for cheese, paced back and forth, his whiskers twitching restlessly behind the forbidden cheeses he was surrounded by. Flanked by his henchmen, The Butcher, a burly man with an affinity for meat cleavers, sat near a small radio, eavesdropping on the police frequencies. The sound of police sirens blared through the air, reminding them of Wordgirl and her relentless pursuit of justice. As the sirens grew louder, Butcher felt his heart racing, his senses heightened by the overwhelming noise. His eyes darted around the room, searching frantically for an escape route that wasn't even needed. His mind, usually focused on meat-related schemes, was pushed to the brink of sensory overload. \\"Stop! Stop that noise!\\" Butcher shouted, clutching his ears and sinking to his knees. His henchmen rushed to his side, concerned for their comrade's wellbeing. They had seen this before—the sirens pushed Butcher over the edge, his senses becoming too much for him to bear. Seeing him in distress, The Whammer, a villain known for his love of smashing things, swiftly punched the radio, silencing the sirens. The sudden silence left the room in a state of unease, broken only by Butcher's heavy breathing gradually subsiding. \\"It's okay, Butcher. It's over,\\" Chuck, a technically gifted villain known as The Technomancer, said soothingly, patting Butcher on the back. \\"Take deep breaths and focus on calming down.\\" As Butcher wrestled to regain control, Granny May, the cunning elderly criminal with a fondness for petty theft, produced a small bag of calming herbs from her pockets. She brewed a strong cup of tea, its aroma drifting through the room, slowly easing Butcher's senses. Sipping the tea, Butcher closed his eyes, allowing the herbs to calm the storm within. The villains sat together, waiting patiently, a sense of camaraderie lacing the tense air. They knew the life they had chosen was fraught with peril, but their shared bond as criminals provided them strength when they needed it most. Eventually, Butcher's breathing steadied, his heart rate returning to normal. He opened his eyes, gratitude shining in them as he nodded at his fellow villains. Though their natures were wicked and their actions questionable, they had each other's backs, a support system in this chaotic world. In the silence that followed, the villains abandoned their usual pursuits, taking a moment to appreciate the odd scenery within the warehouse. Amidst shelves stacked high with forbidden cheeses, stolen treasures, and technological contraptions, they found solace. Wordgirl may be their sworn enemy, but for now, they had found respite in the whispers of understanding that floated through the room. The villains stayed quiet, a newfound appreciation for each other blossoming with each passing moment. And as the distant sirens faded away, they felt an almost comforting sense of unity, ready to face the next clash with their formidable foe."},{"instruction":"你好！","output":"你好! 有什么我可以帮助你的吗？"},{"instruction":"code for ardiuino uno to set led strip to strobe when sensor on pin4 is triggered","output":"Sure!

The result would be a dramatic, and possibly satirical, series that deals with the ambitions, alliances, and rivalries of employees in a large company. Here's how some aspects of the show might translate: 1. **Corporate Throne**: The Iron Throne could be replaced with the role of the company's CEO or a coveted top executive position, with various characters maneuvering for promotions and power within the corporate hierarchy. 2. **Houses as Departments**: The Great Houses of Westeros could represent different departments or divisions within the company. For instance, the Starks might be the upright integrity-driven HR department, the Lannisters could symbolize the cutthroat finance team, and the Targaryens might be a recently ousted leadership trying to regain their standing within the company. 3. **Office Alliances and Rivalries**: The political alliances and betrayals would transfer to corporate allegiances, mergers, and backroom deals. Characters might form strategic partnerships to oust competitors or team up for big projects instead of battling for the realm. 4. **Dragons as Secret Projects or Products**: Daenerys' dragons could symbolize secret, game-changing projects or products that could significantly affect the power balance within the company if successfully launched. 5. **The Wall as IT Security**: The Night's Watch and the Wall might represent the IT department, guarding the company against cyber attacks and data breaches, with threats from hackers (White Walkers) trying to breach the company's firewalls. 6. **Corporate Espionage and Secrets**: The networks of spies and the gathering of intelligence could be akin to corporate espionage, with characters like Varys and Littlefinger as master manipulators of insider information and trade secrets. 7. **Social Schemes and Networking**: Instead of tournaments and social gatherings, there would be corporate retreats, conferences, and networking events where characters jockey for influence and build alliances. 8. **Fantasy to Realism**: Magic and the fantasy elements would be replaced with tech innovations, corporate strategies, or perhaps more subtle forms of manipulation and influence, like psychological tactics and corporate 'mind games.' In this reimagining, \\"Game of Thrones\\" as an office drama would still center around themes of power, ambition, loyalty, and betrayal, but with the battleground set in boardrooms and offices instead of the fields of Westeros. The character arcs would focus on their professional and personal developments in a high-stakes business environment, creating a thrilling drama of its own kind."},{"instruction":"What would each character be like, look like?","output":"In an office drama adaptation of \\"Game of Thrones,\\" characters would shed their medieval garb in favor of modern business attire, and their personalities would be refashioned to suit a corporate environment. Here's how some of the main characters might be reimagined: 1. **Jon Snow**: An earnest, principled employee perhaps in middle management. He's known for his integrity and leadership qualities, often wearing simple, no-nonsense suits. He's somewhat naive about office politics but is universally respected for his fairness. 2. **Daenerys Targaryen**: A charismatic, ambitious woman who's worked her way up from the bottom, possibly in a leadership role of a struggling department. She'd have a reputation for being a visionary with transformative ideas. She'd dress in sharp, stylish business attire, commanding presence in every meeting. 3. **Tyrion Lannister**: A witty and clever member of the finance team, known for his strategic mind and penchant for office politics. Tyrion would be the guy in a well-tailored suit who's always ready with a quip and a clever plan, using his social skills to navigate corporate intrigue. 4. **Cersei Lannister**: A high-powered executive, perhaps the CEO or a board member, known for her ruthlessness and desire to maintain control at all costs. She'd be impeccably dressed in designer power suits, always projecting authority and a no-nonsense demeanor. 5. **Arya Stark**: A young, ambitious intern or entry-level employee with a sharp wit and a willingness to learn from every department. She'd likely have a casual yet practical style, and be underestimated by her peers, only to surprise them with her skills and resourcefulness. 6. **Sansa Stark**: Sansa might be a mid-level manager who has learned to navigate the complexities of office politics through difficult experiences. Initially underestimated, she would grow into a role with increasing influence, dressed in professional, elegantly understated attire. 7. **Bran Stark**: An IT specialist or data analyst known for his quiet, observant nature and uncanny ability to forecast market trends and company needs. He'd likely dress more casually than his peers, with an enigmatic presence that others find both intriguing and unsettling. 8. **Jaime Lannister**: A once-celebrated sales director or top executive whose past success is overshadowed by a recent scandal. Now attempting to rehabilitate his image, he's seen in well-cut suits that reflect his desire to return to a place of respect within the company. 9. **Littlefinger (Petyr Baelish)**: The company's HR director or a middle manager with his eye on the upper echelons of power, always seen loitering around the water cooler, gathering rumors, and subtly influencing decisions from behind the scenes. He'd wear perfectly tailored suits that are never ostentatious. 10. **Varys**: The head of corporate communications or a public relations guru, adept at gathering information and spinning narratives to the company's advantage. He's always well-dressed, though his choice of attire is understated, focusing more on blending in and being everywhere he needs to be. By melding their iconic characteristics with the contemporary corporate world, each character would present a unique blend of their \\"Game of Thrones\\" persona with the relatable realities of office life."},{"instruction":"Gendry?","output":"**Gendry**: In an office drama setting, Gendry might be reimagined as the hardworking, blue-collar worker who has recently been recognized for his talents and earned a promotion into the ranks of the company's staff. He's the physical, hands-on type, perhaps overseeing the manufacturing or operations side of the business. He could have started in the mailroom or the company's equivalent of the forge, where his strong work ethic, natural skill, and potential for leadership caught the attention of higher-ups. He'd likely wear practical business-casual attire reflecting his roots on the operational floor, but as he adapts to his new role among the office staff, we might see him transitioning into more formal workwear. Gendry is also the kind of character employees find approachable and trustworthy, someone who doesn't forget where he came from even as he starts to move up the corporate ladder. With a reputation for being straightforward and genuine, he forms a contrast to the more manipulative or politically savvy characters in the office drama. His backstory as an unrecognized heir to a powerful legacy (Robert Baratheon's lineage) could translate into him being the long-lost son of a former company leader whose identity remains hidden or only becomes known in the course of the story, adding an element of intrigue and potential claim to a leadership position."},{"instruction":"Mordernize character names.","output":"Modernizing character names from \\"Game of Thrones\\" means giving them contemporary counterparts that sound like they could belong to people in the modern business world.

Tuy nhiên, tình hình trồng rừng ở Gia Lai hiện tại còn tồn tại một số vấn đề cần được giải quyết. Thực trạng trồng rừng ở Gia Lai: 1. Khoảng cách giữa cây trồng và chất lượng cây trồng: Trồng rừng tại Gia Lai thường thiếu quan tâm đến khoảng cách giữa các cây và không đảm bảo chất lượng cây trồng. Việc trồng cây quá gần nhau dẫn đến tình trạng cạnh tranh tài nguyên và không thể phát triển tối đa của cây. Chất lượng cây trồng yếu dẫn đến hiệu quả sinh sản kém, không thể đảm bảo nguồn gỗ và sản phẩm non gỗ chất lượng. 2. Thiếu quy hoạch và quản lý: Việc thiếu quy hoạch và quản lý chặt chẽ khiến cho quá trình trồng rừng ở Gia Lai không được đồng nhất và không hiệu quả. Hệ thống cây trồng không được đồng đều và không phù hợp với đặc điểm địa phương, dẫn đến việc cây không phát triển tốt và gặp nhiều vấn đề về sâu bệnh. 3. Thiếu sự đa dạng sinh học: Trong quá trình trồng rừng, quá trình chọn cây trồng chủ yếu tập trung vào những loài cây có giá trị kinh tế cao, đồng thời không đảm bảo sự đa dạng sinh học. Điều này dẫn đến loại bỏ những loài cây phụ thuộc vào cây trồng chính và là nguồn thức ăn hàng ngày của các loài động vật hoang dã. Đề xuất biện pháp phát triển trồng rừng ở Gia Lai: 1. Quy hoạch và quản lý bền vững: Cần thiết lập một kế hoạch quy hoạch rõ ràng và đồng nhất cho việc trồng rừng ở Gia Lai. Quản lý cần được tăng cường để đảm bảo việc trồng rừng được thực hiện đúng theo quy hoạch và đồng loạt. 2. Tăng cường giáo dục và tư vấn: Cần có sự tăng cường giáo dục và tư vấn cho những người trồng rừng về kỹ thuật trồng rừng hiệu quả, giúp họ hiểu rõ về khoảng cách và chất lượng cây trồng, cũng như quy trình chăm sóc cây và xử lý sâu bệnh. 3. Đa dạng hóa cây trồng: Việc đa dạng hóa các loại cây trồng sẽ giúp tăng sự phong phú về sinh học và đáp ứng nhu cầu của cộng đồng. Quá trình chọn cây trồng cần có sự cân nhắc giữa giá trị kinh tế và đóng góp vào hệ sinh thái. 4. Tạo ra liên kết với các nguồn kinh tế khác: Sự phát triển trồng rừng ở Gia Lai cần có sự tương tác với các nguồn kinh tế khác như nông nghiệp, chăn nuôi và du lịch. Tạo ra sự kết hợp giữa các hoạt động này không chỉ giúp tạo nguồn thu nhập ổn định, mà còn bảo tồn và phát triển tài nguyên tự nhiên. Tóm lại, việc phát triển trồng rừng ở Gia Lai đòi hỏi sự quan tâm và sự đồng lòng của cả cộng đồng. Bằng cách thúc đẩy quy hoạch và quản lý bền vững, nâng cao kiến thức và tư vấn, đa dạng hóa cây trồng và tạo liên kết với các nguồn kinh tế khác, chúng ta có thể đảm bảo rừng trồng ở Gia Lai được phát triển một cách bền vững và đóng góp vào sự phát triển kinh tế và bảo vệ môi trường của khu vực này."},{"instruction":"With this information in mind, write Ollie’s fictional twitter account bio (bio also states his age, a redirect to Molly’s account and a warning about his retweets and quote tweets (which is fetish stuff, the fetishes Ollie have are female feet), stating that if you find it uncomfortable or don’t like the idea of fetish stuff frequently appearing in your timeline you probably shouldn’t follow him) (Ollie’s account is about the stuff Ollie likes) and some of Ollie’s tweets and quote tweets from female foot fetish posts, including one which is female foot fetish art of Lori Loud from The Loud House which Ollie commissioned","output":"Ollie | 26 | @OllieTweets Redirect: Follow my amazing bestie @MollyTweets for non-stop fun! 🔥 ⚠️ Warning: Frequent retweets & quote tweets about fetish stuff (female feet) ⚠️ 🚫 If you're uncomfortable or dislike this content appearing on your timeline, it's probably best not to follow me. 🙅‍♂️ Tweets and Quote Tweets: 1.

The others find him and help him though.","output":"Once upon a time in the bustling city of Fair City, WordGirl, the superhero with a love for words and justice, fought tirelessly to keep the city safe from evil. However, even the most notorious villains need a break from their mischievous schemes now and then. And so, in a hidden warehouse on the outskirts of town, the WordGirl villains found solace in their secret hideout. Inside the warehouse, the villains - the Butcher, Granny May, Dr. Two-Brains, and Chuck the Evil Sandwich-Making Guy - gathered around a large table, basking in their temporary refuge. The room was dimly lit, draped with dusty curtains, and filled with stolen treasures: gadgetry, stolen weapons, and contraband comic books. As the night grew darker, the villains sat in silence, listening to the chaotic symphony of Fair City outside. The shrill blares of police sirens pierced the air, creating an uneasy ambiance in the hideout. The villains exchanged glances, their faces etched with both amusement and concern. Butcher, a burly man with a giant cleaver strapped to his back, began shifting uncomfortably in his seat. His leathery fingers trembled, and his eyes darted around the room in search of an escape. Realizing something was amiss, Granny May, an elderly woman with a passion for swindling, called out to him. \\"Butcher, darling, are you alright?\\" Butcher turned to Granny May, his face pale and perspiring. \\"G-gotta go... to another room,\\" he stammered, his voice shaky. Curious and concerned, the other villains watched as Butcher stumbled towards a small side room within the warehouse. As he barged through the door, the sounds of sirens grew louder and more piercing outside. Inside the darkened room, Butcher found himself overwhelmed by the sensory overload. His superhuman hearing picked up every little detail, and the intense sound of the sirens sent his nerves into a frenzy. The blares echoed in his ears, seemingly magnified a hundredfold, as if each siren was meant solely for him. His head throbbed with pain, and he covered his ears, desperate for relief. Back in the main room, Dr. Two-Brains, a scientist with a brain of a mouse and the body of a human, realized the severity of Butcher's situation. Together with Granny May and Chuck the Evil Sandwich-Making Guy, they rushed to aid their comrade. Finding Butcher curled up on the floor, they gently removed his hands from his ears. Their eyes met, and Dr. Two-Brains spoke with compassion, \\"Butcher, we're here for you. You're not alone.\\" Understanding that Butcher needed a distraction from the overwhelming noise, Granny May suggested they focus Butcher's attention on something else. Turning on a radio, she tuned it to a classical music station. The soothing melodies filled the room, overshadowing the cacophony of sirens. Slowly, Butcher's trembling ceased, the pain in his head receded, and a small smile crept across his face. The villains sat around him, surrounded by the calming music, offering him comfort and support. As the sirens eventually faded away, Butcher rejoined his fellow villains, gratitude gleaming in his eyes. \\"Thank you, everyone,\\" he said, his voice filled with appreciation. \\"I couldn't have made it without you.\\" From that day forward, the hideout became a sanctuary not just to plot their next great heist, but also a place of understanding and compassion. The WordGirl villains learned that even amidst their wicked ways, there was room for kindness and support. And so, in their warehouse hideout, the villains transformed from the embodiment of chaos to a group that not only brought disorder but also provided solace to one another. For they knew that even the most evil among them still needed a helping hand to navigate the challenges life threw their way."},{"instruction":"Un message de joyeux anniversaire à moi même en date de 13/11/2022 avec de mot touchant en remerciant Dieu","output":"Cher moi-même, Aujourd'hui est un jour si spécial, car nous célébrons ton anniversaire en ce 13 novembre 2022.

At the heart of this gripping tale lies the unlikely encounter between Ares, the fearless and indomitable space warrior, and Kai, a delicate and timid space medic who possesses remarkable healing abilities. As they face interstellar conflicts, these two polar opposites will discover a profound connection that transcends the boundaries of their universe. Chapter 1: An Unexpected Collision Ares, covered in battle scars and wielding a colossal energy sword, strode through the corridors of the starship Phoenix. As he approached the medical bay, he noticed a young man busily organizing medical supplies. Ares: (smirking) \\"Hey, little medic! I hope you didn't break anything fragile in that chaotic mess you call a med bay.\\" Kai: (nervously) \\"Oh, sorry, sir. I'll make sure everything is in its proper place. Can I help you with anything?\\" Ares: (leaning against the wall) \\"You? Help me? That's a good one. But sure, if you have anything that can withstand a beating, bring it here.\\" Chapter 2: An Unexpected Bond After days of constant battles, Ares limped into the medical bay with a deep wound across his side. Despite his tough exterior, he winced in pain. Kai: (gently) \\"Please lie down; let me attend to your injuries.\\" Ares: (gruffly) \\"You expect me to trust you with my life? I'm a warrior, not some fragile creature.\\" Kai: (softly) \\"I may be gentle, but those who stand strong also deserve care. Trust me; I'll heal your wounds.\\" Chapter 3: The Healing Touch Kai and Ares spent countless hours together, bridging the gap between their worlds. As Ares healed, he began to see strength in Kai's softness, and Kai became enchanted by Ares' unwavering bravery. Kai: (whispering) \\"You know, despite your powerful presence, it takes an immense strength to face the dangers you do every day. Your courage is awe-inspiring.\\" Ares: (blushing) \\"I... I never thought someone like you would see me that way.\\" Chapter 4: Love on the Battlefield Amidst their personal struggles, an intergalactic war erupted, threatening peace across the universe. Battles raged, and Ares fearing for Kai's safety, vowed to protect him at all costs. Ares: (determined) \\"Don't worry, Kai. I'll fight for both of us. I won't let any harm come your way.\\" Kai: (holding back tears) \\"Just... promise you'll come back, Ares. We have so much more love to discover in this chaotic universe.\\" Chapter 5: Love Defeats All Facing danger and chaos, Ares fought alongside his comrades, his heart yearning for Kai's gentle touch. The war reached its climax, but Ares and Kai remained fiercely devoted to each other. Ares: (victorious) \\"This war is finally over. We can create our own sanctuary now, far from the battlefield.\\" Kai: (smiling) \\"With your strength and my healing touch, we can navigate the cosmos together. Our love will conquer all.\\" Epilogue: Ares and Kai retired from their warrior and medic roles, building a peaceful sanctuary on a distant planet.

The term \\"K-pop\\" refers to popular music originating from South Korea, which includes a variety of musical genres and is not restricted to songs in the Korean language. \\"Dynamite\\" and \\"Butter,\\" however, are both performed entirely in English, which makes them somewhat unique in the K-pop landscape. Despite the language difference from most K-pop tracks, which are typically in Korean with occasional English phrases, these songs still embody many characteristics associated with K-pop. These include the catchy pop sound, high production values, intricate choreography, and a vibrant music video, all of which are significant components of K-pop's global appeal. BTS has been instrumental in expanding the reach of K-pop around the world, and English-language songs like \\"Dynamite\\" and \\"Butter\\" have played a key role in helping them connect with wider international audiences. It is also worth noting that K-pop as a genre has become increasingly diverse, often incorporating English lyrics and drawing from different musical styles. In sum, while linguistically these songs differ from most K-pop tracks, they are still considered part of the K-pop genre due to their origin, the identity of the artists, their participation in the K-pop industry, and their adherence to the stylistic and performative elements common in K-pop music."},{"instruction":"But we don't classify Christopher Nissen's music as Danish music, we classify it as pop.","output":"You're correct that when discussing musicians like Christopher Nissen, who is from Denmark and sings primarily in English, we often use terms like \\"pop\\" without necessarily specifying \\"Danish pop,\\" particularly in an international context. This is largely because the term \\"pop\\" is a broad music genre descriptor that crosses international boundaries and doesn't necessarily denote the artist's nationality or language. With K-pop, there's a slightly different phenomenon at play. \\"K-pop\\" has become an internationally recognized term that describes not just the music but a whole cultural wave coming from South Korea, including its distinct style, presentation, and industry framework. K-pop is seen as both a genre and a cultural movement that encompasses music, dance, fashion, and fan culture. In the case of BTS, they are known globally as a K-pop group because they emerged from South Korea's music industry and continue to represent it, even when they sing in English. It's also important to note that the classification of music can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the language of the songs, the artist's origin, the music's stylistic elements, the cultural context, and industry marketing. Christopher Nissen's music is labeled as \\"pop\\" because it falls within the broad spectrum of what is internationally considered pop music, and the term \\"Danish\\" isn't commonly added unless the discussion is specifically focused on the music scene in Denmark. In contrast, \\"K-pop\\" is used to designate a unique cultural product from South Korea that includes multiple genres within it and carries with it a certain set of expectations regarding production, performance, and fan engagement. This is why songs like \\"Dynamite\\" and \\"Butter\\" by BTS, despite being performed in English, are still often classified within the K-pop umbrella."},{"instruction":"Отвечай на русском языке.

This comparison is done to assess the performance of a business and determine if it has improved or fallen behind over time. To calculate catch-up sales and profits, you will need the sales and profits data for both the current period and the previous period. Subtract the previous period's sales and profits from the current period's sales and profits to determine the difference. For example, let's say a business had sales of 100,000 and profits of 20,000 in the previous period, and in the current period, it had sales of 150,000 and profits of 30,000. To calculate catch-up sales, subtract the previous period's sales from the current period's sales: 150,000 - 100,000 = 50,000 Therefore, catch-up sales for the current period compared to the previous period are 50,000. To calculate catch-up profits, subtract the previous period's profits from the current period's profits: 30,000 - 20,000 = 10,000 Therefore, catch-up profits for the current period compared to the previous period are 10,000. This information can be used to analyze the growth and performance of a business. If catch-up sales and profits are positive, it indicates that the business is progressing well and improving. However, if catch-up sales and profits are negative or lower than expected, it may suggest that the business is not performing as well or falling behind."},{"instruction":"catch up sales and profits over the period of time improve sales and marketing management","output":"To improve sales and marketing management over a period of time and drive catch-up sales and profits, consider the following strategies: 1. Analyze and understand customer needs: Conduct market research to gain insights into customer preferences, behaviors, and pain points.

Voici comment vous pouvez configurer le placement d'une image sur votre site web : 1. Tout d'abord, assurez-vous d'avoir l'image que vous souhaitez utiliser prête à être téléchargée sur votre site web. Vous pouvez la stocker sur votre ordinateur ou dans un service d'hébergement d'images. 2. Ensuite, ouvrez le fichier HTML de la page sur laquelle vous souhaitez placer l'image, à l'aide d'un éditeur de texte ou d'un éditeur de code comme Sublime Text ou Visual Studio Code. 3. Trouvez l'endroit où vous souhaitez insérer l'image dans votre code HTML. Vous pouvez utiliser une balise <img> pour cela. Voici un exemple de code HTML pour ajouter une image : \`\`\`html <img src=\\"chemin_vers_votre_image.jpg\\" alt=\\"Description de l'image\\" /> \`\`\` Remplacez \\"chemin_vers_votre_image.jpg\\" par le chemin relatif ou absolu de l'image que vous souhaitez insérer. Assurez-vous également de remplacer \\"Description de l'image\\" par une description appropriée de l'image pour une meilleure accessibilité. 4. Maintenant, pour configurer le placement de l'image, vous pouvez utiliser des balises HTML supplémentaires ou des styles CSS. - Utilisation de balises HTML : Vous pouvez envelopper la balise <img> avec d'autres balises HTML, comme une balise <div>, pour contrôler le placement de l'image à l'aide des attributs de style disponibles. Par exemple : \`\`\`html <div style=\\"text-align: center;\\"> <img src=\\"chemin_vers_votre_image.jpg\\" alt=\\"Description de l'image\\" /> </div> \`\`\` Cela placera l'image au centre de la page. - Utilisation de styles CSS : Vous pouvez également utiliser des règles de style CSS pour définir le placement de l'image. Vous pouvez ajouter une classe ou un ID à la balise <img> et définir les styles correspondants dans la section <style> de votre code HTML ou dans un fichier CSS externe. Par exemple : \`\`\`html <img src=\\"chemin_vers_votre_image.jpg\\" alt=\\"Description de l'image\\" class=\\"image-centree\\" /> \`\`\` \`\`\`css .image-centree { display: block; margin: 0 auto; } \`\`\` Cela va centrer l'image horizontalement. Assurez-vous d'ajuster les propriétés de style selon vos préférences pour obtenir le placement souhaité. 5. Une fois que vous avez terminé de configurer le placement de l'image, enregistrez le fichier HTML et ouvrez-le dans un navigateur pour vérifier que l'image est correctement positionnée sur votre site web.

The black melanin is extracted and used to create a dark, distinctive color for the ice cream. The process of making black melanin painted ice cream involves mixing the melanin with a traditional ice cream base. The melanin powder is added gradually while churning the ice cream mixture to ensure it is evenly dispersed. The result is a rich, dark black color reminiscent of black charcoal or black sesame. The flavor of the ice cream can vary, depending on the additional ingredients used. Common flavors that pair well with the black melanin base include chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and even unique flavors like lavender or matcha. The final product is often served in a black cone or dish to enhance the overall aesthetic. Toppings such as dark chocolate shavings, blackberries, or edible charcoal dust can be added to enhance the flavor and provide a visually striking presentation.

Based on the formula, it appears to be a combination of silane (SiH4), ethane (C2H6), and possibly methanol (CH3OH). Silane (SiH4) is a colorless and flammable gas primarily composed of silicon and hydrogen atoms. It is used in various industrial applications, including as a precursor for creating silicon-based materials such as silicon films or coatings. Ethane (C2H6) is a simple hydrocarbon consisting of two carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms bonded together. It is a colorless and odorless gas at room temperature and is commonly used as a fuel, refrigerant, or as a raw material in the production of various chemicals. Methanol (CH3OH), also known as wood alcohol, is a liquid alcohol composed of one carbon atom, four hydrogen atoms, and one oxygen atom. It is widely used as a solvent, antifreeze, and as a raw material for manufacturing formaldehyde, acetic acid, and other chemicals. Combining these compounds to form Si2H6C results in an interesting combination of silicon, carbon, and hydrogen atoms. However, without further information, it is challenging to determine the exact properties, stability, or any potential applications of this compound in a planetary context. It's worth noting that compounds with this specific formula and combination of elements do not exist as known substances in chemistry.

COLUMBO: Excuse me, are you the, uh, the gentleman they call Tintin? TINTIN: Yes, that's me. And who might you be? COLUMBO: Ah, Lieutenant Columbo, ma'am. Homicide. I understand you've got some mysteries that need solving. Mind if I take a look? Got a bit of a puzzle bug myself, you see. TINTIN: Of course, Lieutenant. We could use all the help we can get. This first case involves a secret identity. Someone masquerading as someone they're not. COLUMBO: A secret identity, you say? Fascinating! Go on. TINTIN: We suspect it has something to do with this old family crest and the message inscribed behind the picture frame. But we're stuck. COLUMBO: (peering over the crest) Hm, you know this reminds me of something. My wife, she's got this picture with a message from her aunt on the back. But the funny thing is, you'd never think to look there unless you had a reason. Now, why would someone hide a message behind a family crest? Unless... That's it! The message wasn't meant to be found by just anybody. Maybe the real identity is hidden in plain sight, inside the message! Snowy barks and wags his tail excitedly as Tintin's eyes widen. TINTIN: I never thought of it that way! Snowy, the lieutenant might be onto something! COLUMBO: (smiling) Just one of those things. So, you said there were other mysteries? TINTIN: Yes, indeed. One involves a statue of an ancient god that points to hidden treasure. COLUMBO scratches his head and circles the room, examining the details Tintin provided. COLUMBO: Ancient god, eh? Now that's quite the melodrama. You know, this visible wear on one of the arms, it looks unnatural. Like it's been handled more than the other parts of the statue. Could be folks have been missin' the obvious because they're so focused on the myth. TINTIN: (amazed) Of course! The arm's position must have been changed. It's possible that the original pointing direction indicates where the treasure lies. We've been looking in the wrong place! SNOWY barks in agreement, as if in approval of Columbo's sharp observation. COLUMBO: Glad to help. But before I forget, there was one more thing... What was it? (fumbling with his notes) Oh yes, the case of the missing emerald. Anything particular about the scene of the theft? TINTIN: Now that you mention it, there was an odd scent in the air. Almost chemical. COLUMBO: Chemical, huh? That's interesting. I knew a guy once who was a chemist – said you could use certain compounds to almost... freeze a lock, make it brittle. Might not leave the usual signs of a break-in. TINTIN: Remarkable! That would explain the lack of forced entry. Columbo nods, pausing a moment as if in deep thought.

Thank you. You've been incredibly helpful. COLUMBO: Ah, think nothing of it. Just happy to chip in. Oh, one more thing, Tintin...

We're trying to decipher the secret of Sir Francis Haddock's treasure, as told through these three parchments we've recovered. Each has a riddle with a ship on it. CAPTAIN HADDOCK: A blasted confounding mess! We've been at our wits' end! COLUMBO: (scratching his head) Three parchments, huh? And ships, you say? Reminds me of a model ship my cousin once had. Pretty little thing, but it had this piece that always seemed a little out of place. Now, these riddles of yours, is there anything that seems out of place about them? TINTIN: Oddly enough, each parchment has a different ship, but it's the same ship – the Unicorn. COLUMBO: Interesting... and these riddles, do they connect in any way? TINTIN: We thought aligning the ships together would reveal the location, but it doesn't quite add up. COLUMBO: (peering closely at the parchments) Well, would you look at that... The ships, they seem to be at different angles. I wonder, have you tried holding them up to the light? TINTIN: (with sudden realization) Hold them up to the light? Of course! Snowy, you see?! SNOWY barks affirmatively as Tintin holds the parchments up, the light shining through them. COLUMBO: You see, my wife, she likes these jigsaw puzzles. Says it's all about the different pieces fitting just right. Maybe you got to look at these parchments not just side by side but stacked. As the parchments are held to the light and stacked, the hidden message becomes clear, showing coordinates when the ship masts line up. PROFESSOR CALCULUS: (adjusting his glasses) By Haddock's beard, Columbo, you've done it! CAPTAIN HADDOCK: (grabbing Columbo's hand) My ancestor's treasure has been waiting! Blistering barnacles!

There are these patterns in the sky—lights no one can explain—and I thought, who better to ask than someone who knows the stars? POWER COSMIC BEING: The celestial mysteries are boundless, Lieutenant. What patterns do you speak of? COLUMBO: Well, that's just it. These lights, they show up every 27.3 days, just above the city.

Kinda like how my wife has a way with plants—they don't talk, but she knows exactly what they need. Maybe Earth needs to listen in a different way? POWER COSMIC BEING: Precisely. Explore beyond your conceptions, Columbo. The answers may not lie within the patterns themselves but in their intervals, their timing, their alignment with your world. COLUMBO: Huh, intervals, you say? Kinda like beats in music or... (a spark of realization) or timing! The gaps might be as important as the lights themselves. You know, that's a great point you got there. I hadn't considered that. POWER COSMIC BEING: You possess keen insight for a mortal. Use it well—seek the harmony between the cosmic music and your own earthly intuition. COLUMBO: (nodding) Harmony, got it. I can't thank you enough.

Remember, though you are of Earth, you are also of the cosmos. The light of understanding shines within you. COLUMBO: (smiling) Who would have thought? Well, I better get back to it. Thank you for your time... and your perspective. You got quite the view up here. (turning to leave) Take care now.

Численность работников составляет 20 человек. За месяц (21 рабочий день) было заключено 12 договоров средней стоимостью по 600 тыс руб за каждый.","output":"Для определения фактической трудоемкости в организации, нужно знать, сколько времени работники затратили на выполнение данных 12 договоров, а также на другие задачи, которые выполнялись в течение месяца. Показатель выработки можно определить как общую стоимость выполненной работы за месяц, поделенную на численность работников. Для расчета фактической трудоемкости, нужно знать, сколько времени среднестатистический работник затратил на выполнение одного договора средней стоимостью. Допустим, что для выполнения одного договора среднестатистический работник затратил 3 дня, то есть 3/21 от общего рабочего времени в месяце. Следовательно, общая трудоемкость на выполнение всех 12 договоров составит 12 * (3/21) = 1,71 работы работника (число дней). Показатель выработки рассчитывается по формуле: Показатель выработки = (Сумма всех договоров) / (Число работников) Общая стоимость всех 12 договоров составляет 12 * 600 тыс руб = 7 200 тыс руб. Тогда показатель выработки будет равен: Показатель выработки = 7 200 тыс руб / 20 = 360 тыс руб на одного работника.

There's a knock on the door frame, and the mysterious G-Man from the \\"Half-Life\\" series steps into the doorway, straightening his tie. His expression is unreadable, an air of otherworldly calm about him.] Columbo: [Without looking up from his file, speaks in a friendly, offhand manner] Come on in, sir. Sorry for the mess - never got the hang of filing. Make yourself at home, though there isn't much room for that, I'm afraid. G-Man: [His voice is smooth and his speech pattern, deliberate] Detective Columbo, I presume? I see you are as... meticulous as they say. Columbo: [Finally looks up, squinting as he assesses the impeccably dressed stranger] Uh, yeah, that's me. I didn't catch your name, sir? G-Man: Names, Detective, are... immaterial. Let us say I am someone who takes an interest in... particular events. I understand you are investigating an incident that has piqued my curiosity. Columbo: [Leaning back in his chair, nodding slowly] Is that so? You know, I’m just peeling back layers on a tricky little case. So, what can I do for ya? G-Man: Perhaps it is a question of what I can offer you, Detective. Assistance, maybe... beyond the usual scope of your—how shall I say—earthly confines. Columbo: [Visibly intrigued but cautiously skeptical as he fiddles with a pencil] That sounds tempting, I must admit. But I gotta tell ya, I'm a simple man with simple methods. I’m not sure I need that kind of help. G-Man: [Tilting his head slightly, studying Columbo] Simplicity, yes, a deceptive guise for one who unravels complexity. Your reputation, detective, does not go unnoticed... by those who watch. Columbo: [Smiles awkwardly, trying to read between the lines] Well, if you're offering help, maybe you could start by telling me what you know about the case? It's this scientist, see. Disappeared into thin air just when his experiment went... well, they say it went kaboom. G-Man: Ahh, disappearance... a vanishing act of no small consequence. Suffice to say, the scientist in question has embarked on an... extended assignment. One that does not concern your jurisdiction, or your plane of... existence, for that matter. Columbo: [Scratches his head and lets out a small chuckle] That's some story, huh? Gotta say, never had a case reach quite that far before... but alright, let's suppose I believe you. What's the angle? I mean, every story's got an angle. G-Man: Detouring from established paths often reveals new... angles. What is important is that your search, while admirable, might best be directed elsewhere. There are always... consequences—for prying too deeply. Columbo: [Gets up, moving ponderously towards G-Man] You know, I get the feeling there’s something you're not telling me. And it just so happens, I got a little thing about unsolved cases. They keep me up at night; my wife will tell you. Say, you wouldn’t wanna be responsible for that, would you? G-Man: Detective, rest assured, your sleep patterns are of little concern. However, consider this a... professional courtesy. Should you persist, the fabric of your reality might... fray. And we wouldn't want that, would we? Columbo: [Leans in, squinting one eye as if studying a peculiar puzzle] Look, I’ll level with you, Mister... G-Man, was it? If there's something out of whack here, something more than meets the eye, I gotta know. It's just the way I’m wired. G-Man: [Straightens up and looks at Columbo intently] Very well, Detective. Do pursue your investigation with your... traditional methods. But remember, some clocks cannot be unwound. Columbo: [Smiling gently, unphased] I'll keep that in mind. And hey, thanks for dropping by. You’ve given me a lot to think about. Maybe I’ll see you again? G-Man: [Steps back, the corners of his mouth curving in a not-quite-friendly smile] Time, Detective Columbo, is an illusion. But, in due course, our paths may indeed... cross once more.

He squints at his reflection, readies his shaving foam and razor, and starts talking to himself in the mirror.] Columbo: [Murmuring to his reflection] So there you are. The face I wake up to every morning. Not getting any younger, are we? [He shakes the can of shaving foam, squirts some into his hand and begins to lather up his face.] Columbo: [Continuing the conversation] Now, what are we dealing with today? Oh, right—the case with the missing painting. Funny thing, that. Whole thing's vanished without a trace, and here I am, talking to you about it. [Pauses to give his reflection a pointed look.] Columbo: You know, sometimes I think you're the only one who really listens. No interruptions, no objections. Just me, you, and the case. [He starts to shave carefully, his eyes meeting his own in the mirror.] Columbo: The thing is, everyone's a suspect, and nobody's talking. But someone's gotta know something. If only walls could talk, huh? Or mirrors, for that matter. [He chuckles softly at his own joke, then grows contemplative.] Columbo: You ever get that feeling, like you're just one step away from putting it all together? That's me, right now. But that last piece of the puzzle... it's a doozy. [A small frown forms on his face as he continues to shave.] Columbo: There's something we're missing. The wife, maybe? She's got an alibi, but...

Nonetheless, I can provide information about francium and tennesside as separate entities. Francium is a highly unstable and rare element belonging to the alkali metal group of the periodic table. It is the heaviest naturally occurring element and is radioactive. Due to its extremely short half-life (about 22 minutes), francium is not found in substantial quantities on Earth. Consequently, it is difficult to study its properties and chemical compounds. Tennesside, on the other hand, is a hypothetical element that has not been discovered or synthesized. It is named after the state of Tennessee in the United States, where several prominent research institutions are located. Similar to francium, tennesside is hypothetical and does not have any known properties or chemical compounds. Considering that neither francium tennesside nor stabilized francium tennesside exist, it is not possible to accurately describe their color or any other physical or chemical characteristics."},{"instruction":"Ты пишешь курс по похудению.

Она может быть представлена в виде упражнений, спортивных тренировок, физической работы и т.д. Физическая нагрузка необходима для поддержания здоровья, физической формы и достижения похудения. Индивидуальные особенности и различия уровня физической активности у разных профессий: Уровень физической активности может зависеть от характера работы и требований профессии. Например, люди, занятые физическим трудом, обычно испытывают значительную физическую нагрузку в связи с выполнением повседневных задач. Они могут иметь более высокую выносливость и физическую форму. В то же время, у людей, работающих в офисе или другой сидячей работе, уровень физической активности может быть намного ниже. Они проводят большую часть своего времени в статическом положении и незначительно используют свои мышцы. В результате у них может отсутствовать физическая форма и стать причиной накопления лишнего веса. Понимание различий в уровне физической активности, вызванном работой, может помочь в разработке индивидуального плана физической нагрузки для достижения похудения. Учитывая особенности каждой профессии, можно определить оптимальные виды тренировок и интенсивность нагрузок, подходящие для конкретного человека."},{"instruction":"Виды физической нагрузки. опиши каждый вид","output":"Аэробная нагрузка: Аэробная нагрузка основана на использовании кислорода для производства энергии. Это тип тренировок, при которых вы длительное время занимаетесь физической активностью с умеренной интенсивностью. Аэробные тренировки способствуют укреплению сердечно-сосудистой системы, повышению выносливости и ускорению метаболизма. Примеры аэробных тренировок включают бег, ходьбу на свежем воздухе, езду на велосипеде, плавание и танцы. Они часто рекомендуются для похудения, так как помогают сжигать калории и улучшают общую физическую форму. Анаэробная нагрузка: Анаэробная нагрузка включает в себя короткое, но интенсивное физическое упражнение, которое выполняется без доступного кислорода. Во время анаэробных тренировок мышцы работают на пределе своих возможностей и не получают достаточное количество кислорода для поддержания активности. Такие тренировки помогают развивать мощность и силу мышц, а также повышают скорость обмена веществ. Примеры анаэробных тренировок включают подъемы на гири, подтягивания, упражнения с гантелями и высокоинтенсивные интервальные тренировки (HIIT). Анаэробные тренировки позволяют укрепить мышцы, что способствует увеличению сжигания калорий даже в покое, что помогает в процессе похудения. Комбинированные тренировки: Комбинированные тренировки объединяют элементы аэробной и анаэробной нагрузки. Они предлагают разнообразие и эффективность, объединяя тренировку сердечно-сосудистой системы с упражнениями для развития силы и мышц. Это может включать, например, пробежку с включенными интервалами высокой интенсивности или комбинированные упражнения с гантелями и кардиотренировками. Комбинированные тренировки обеспечивают комплексный подход к физической активности и позволяют улучшить общую физическую форму в процессе похудения."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY] Detective Lieutenant Columbo sits across a table from an enigmatic man known only as Gman. The room is dim, the hum of the fluorescent lights barely overpowering a pervasive silence. Gman, dressed in a nondescript suit, radiates an aura of mystery. Columbo, disheveled as ever in his rumpled coat, squints thoughtfully as he flips through a notebook filled with scribbles. COLUMBO: (scratching his head) You know, Mr. Gman, I've been on the force a good number of years, and I've seen a lot of puzzling cases. But you—(chuckles)—you're a real enigma. GMAN: (calmly) I am simply a man who values his privacy, Lieutenant. COLUMBO: Oh, I get that, I really do. But here's the thing that's been nagging at me—(taps his notebook)—everyone has a motive. Everyone has a reason they do things. But you, sir, you've got no fingerprints on the proverbial murder weapon. You're a ghost in the machine. GMAN: (with a slight smile) Perhaps the machine is not meant to be understood by all. Columbo leans forward, peering at Gman with curious intensity. COLUMBO: (pointing with a pencil) Now, you see, that's just it! When I talked to those folks at Black Mesa—the scientists, the security personnel—they all mention this man. A man who appears and disappears, pulling strings, shaping events. You! (leans back) But who are you workin' for? That's the sixty-four-dollar question. GMAN: My employers are of no consequence to this discussion. We are beyond your jurisdiction, Lieutenant. Columbo looks around the room as if the answer is etched in the walls, then turns back to Gman, tapping his foot unconsciously. COLUMBO: Oh, I think it is. (pauses) You see, we found these classified documents, and your name... or lack thereof, pops up like a bad penny. Now, I got a theory. You, Mr. Gman, you've been meddlin' in things. Big things. And the fallout—(he sighs)—well, I've seen what it can do. GMAN: (unfazed) And what theory is that? Columbo pretends to fumble for a cigar, patting his pockets before producing one. He looks up suddenly, as if just remembering something. COLUMBO: Just one thing that keeps me up at night, sir—I can't figure out how a man who doesn't exist can leave such a trail. You know, it's the little details that always give it away. Like how every witness can't recall a thing until we show 'em your picture. And then there's this... timing thing you got goin' on. Always at the right place, right time. Gman's eyes narrow slightly, but he says nothing. COLUMBO: (nodding) Yeah, yeah. It's like you're messin' with the fabric of... I dunno, reality or somethin'. And maybe you got the power to do all that. You and your... employers. But power, see, it's got one weakness. It's always gotta serve a purpose. Gman's composure remains unchanged, but there's a glint in his eyes, a sign that Columbo's words haven't gone unnoticed. COLUMBO: (pointing with the cigar) My hunch? You're tamperin' with forces you're controllin' for now. But forces like that, they're wild cards. And wild cards have a way of causin' trouble. So, Mr. Gman... what's your endgame? There is a brief silence as Gman and Columbo lock eyes. GMAN: (standing) Lieutenant, you have been most... entertaining. My endgame, as you put it, is not a puzzle for you to solve. But rest assured, when the time comes, all will be made clear. Columbo nods slowly and watches as Gman walks toward the door, untouched by the handcuffs or the law. The detective tucks his notebook away, a plan formulating in his inquisitive mind. COLUMBO: (calling out) Just one more thing, Mr. Gman! You wouldn't happen to know a guy named Freeman, would you? (smirks) Just a thought. Gman pauses at the door but doesn't turn around. With a tip of an invisible hat, he vanishes as mysteriously as he came, leaving Columbo to ponder the deepening mystery of the man who defies understanding."},{"instruction":"Columbo talks about the hl2 plot.","output":"[INT.

Various pieces of technology, unlike anything of the current era, are scattered around. Several police officers are examining the scene as Columbo approaches his colleague, Sergeant Green. Columbo removes a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket, referencing notes as he speaks. COLUMBO: (squinting) Y’know, Sergeant, this whole situation reminds me of this story I heard. SERGEANT GREEN: (curiously) What story is that, Lieutenant? COLUMBO: It's a real doozy—a fella by the name of Gordon Freeman. (gesturing with the paper) According to this, the guy's a theoretical physicist turned... well, I guess you'd call him a freedom fighter. SERGEANT GREEN: (looking around) Theoretical physicist here? (chuckles) That's a new one. COLUMBO: Oh yeah, it’s true! But the kicker is—the whole thing takes place in the future. This... Freeman fella wakes up after being on ice for a long time. The world's changed, see? It's not in our hands anymore. It's under the thumb of these alien types. SERGEANT GREEN: Aliens, Lieutenant? You're pulling my leg. COLUMBO: No, no, I'm serious! They call themselves the Combine. And they're not the friendly type. They've got this iron grip on the Earth, rationing supplies, putting up these... (glances at notes) suppression fields. People aren't too happy, I'll tell you that much. SERGEANT GREEN: So, what does this Freeman guy do? COLUMBO: Well, from what I gathered, he becomes a sort of symbol. An uprising starts the moment the fellow steps out of this train station called City 17. It's a nasty situation. People fighting for a scrap of freedom, throwing everything they got at these alien overlords. Chaos and resistance, a lot of it led by Freeman himself. SERGEANT GREEN: And what does this have to do with our case? COLUMBO: Ah! That's where things get interesting. You see, this warehouse has been flagged by some high-tech task force. Signals, weird energy readings, stuff like that. Now, I'm not saying it's the same scenario, but (tapping his notebook) these gadgets, the strange tech we’re finding... it feels like someone's getting ready for a big showdown, like in that story. SERGEANT GREEN: (impressed) You think there's a resistance forming right here? COLUMBO: Could be. Might just be some kids playing make-believe, or maybe we got ourselves some sort of militia gearing up for who knows what. But I’ll tell you this, Sergeant, it wouldn’t hurt to learn a bit from Mr. Freeman. SERGEANT GREEN: How so? COLUMBO: (shakes his head) When you're outmatched and outgunned, sometimes the underdog's got to use his wits. Create hope, inspire others, and most importantly, never give up. (glancing around) And knowing when to pick your battles. SERGEANT GREEN nods contemplatively, as COLUMBO wanders deeper into the warehouse, examining a peculiar piece of tech left behind, a ponderous look on his face, wondering if there's more to this case than meets the eye."},{"instruction":"What is the difference between Oracle Fusion and Oracle EBS?","output":"Oracle Fusion and Oracle EBS (E-Business Suite) are both enterprise resource planning (ERP) solutions offered by Oracle, but they have some key differences: 1.

Add dialogue","output":"Title: Celestial Bonds Synopsis: In the vast expanse of the cosmos, where danger lurks at every turn, two souls from completely opposite ends of the spectrum find themselves entwined in an interstellar romance. A love story between Adrik, the revered and relentless space warrior, and Caleb, a delicate and compassionate space medic, unfolds as they navigate the trials of their individual strengths and vulnerabilities. Their journey towards discovering love amidst chaos and unveiling the depths of their hearts makes \\"Celestial Bonds\\" an epic tale of passion, trust, and redemption. --- Chapter 1: Encounter Adrik stood on the spaceship's bridge, a towering figure with battle scars etched across his chiseled face. As the strongest and most feared space warrior, Adrik was known to conquer any adversary that dared appose him. However, beneath his hardened exterior was a yearning for tranquility beyond the stars. Caleb, on the other hand, delicately moved through the medical bay. With compassion shining through his gentle blue eyes, he dedicated himself to saving lives amidst the chaos of intergalactic conflict. The meekest and most fragile, some would mistake his disposition as weakness, yet his inner strength knew no bounds. The paths of Adrik and Caleb crossed during a harrowing space battle. Adrik was wounded, and Caleb rushed to his aid without hesitation. Their eyes locked, an unspoken connection formed, and a series of seemingly impossible events set their worlds on an unexpected course. --- Chapter 5: Revealing Emotions Adrik, feeling the weight of his emotions, sought out Caleb in the medical bay. He found him tending to a wounded crew member, his healing touch radiating warmth and compassion. Adrik hesitated for a moment before approaching Caleb, a thousand thoughts racing through his mind. \\"Caleb... I've never known anyone like you. You, with your healing hands and tender heart, have ignited something I never thought possible within me.\\" Caleb's eyes widened, amazed by Adrik's unexpected vulnerability. He lowered his gaze, fearing the overwhelming emotions might betray him. \\"Adrik, the strength you possess, the way you fight for what's right... It's incomparable. But underneath it all, I see a yearning for peace... for love.\\" Adrik took a step closer, his deep voice filled with longing. \\"I've fought countless battles, but none have ever stirred my heart like this. Caleb, I want to protect you, to show you a love that defies the odds. Will you let me?\\" Caleb felt his fragile heart flutter, his walls crumbling before Adrik's words. \\"Adrik, your strength doesn't overpower me; it brings me solace. I never thought I'd find love in the vastness of space, but with you, I feel safe. Yes, Adrik, I want to experience that love with you.\\" --- Chapter 10: Defying the Cosmos Their love blossomed even amidst the chaos and danger swirling around them. Adrik and Caleb became an unstoppable force, their bond forming an unbreakable shield against the challenges they faced. One day, as the spaceship braced for yet another grueling battle, Adrik took Caleb's trembling hand in his own, providing reassurance through their connection. \\"Caleb, no matter what happens next, remember my love for you is as vast as the cosmos itself. Together, we can face anything.\\" Caleb gazes deeply into Adrik's eyes, his voice filled with unwavering trust. \\"I believe you, Adrik. Your strength and courage have shown me what it means to love fearlessly. In your arms, I am invincible.\\" The battle ensued, hearts pounding with adrenaline. Adrik and Caleb fought side by side, their love intertwining with their warrior spirit, as they faced the greatest challenge the galaxy had ever witnessed. --- Celestial Bonds concludes with Adrik and Caleb emerging victorious, their love having transcended not only the vast expanse of space but also the boundaries of their own expectations. Together, they stand as a testament that even the strongest warrior can find solace in the heart of the meekest healer, and that love knows no limitations, not even those set in the infinite reaches of the universe."},{"instruction":"Describe their first sight and conversation and how the warrior teases the medic with flirting but is still gruff and tough","output":"Chapter 2: First Sight Amidst the chaos of the interstellar battle, Adrik's armor was battered, his face streaked with dirt and sweat.

The medic moved gracefully, tending to injured crew members with compassion and gentleness that fascinated Adrik. Absorbed in his task, Caleb looked up just as Adrik entered, their eyes locking in an intense moment of recognition. --- Chapter 3: Unexpected Chemistry Caleb, taken aback by the presence of the imposing warrior, quickly composed himself. \\"Can I help you? Are you injured?\\" Adrik smirked, his voice gruff but laced with hints of charm. \\"Well, doc, seems like I've managed to take a few hits. Could use a bit of your tender care.\\" Caleb raised an eyebrow, seeing right through Adrik's teasing facade. \\"I'll need you to take a seat, warrior, and let me assess the damage.\\" As Caleb tended to Adrik's wounds, Adrik found himself unable to resist flirting, even amidst his gruff demeanor. \\"You know, doc, you have an awfully pliant touch for someone as fragile as you.\\" Caleb's cheeks flushed, but he maintained his composure. \\"Appearances can be deceiving, Adrik. Just because I'm gentle doesn't mean I'm fragile. We all have our inner strength.\\" Adrik's eyes glinted with a mixture of mischief and curiosity. \\"Is that so?

You should be more careful, Adrik. You might find yourself too distracted to properly defend yourself.\\" Adrik feigned offence, his tone filled with mock indignation. \\"I'll have you know, doc... I can fight just fine, even with thoughts of you swirling in my head.\\" Caleb chuckled softly, his hands gently caressing Adrik's arm. \\"Oh, I have no doubt about that, warrior. But just remember, I'm here to heal your wounds, not cause more.\\" Adrik's gruff laughter filled the air as he leaned closer to Caleb, his voice growing softer. \\"Well, doc, maybe it wouldn't be so bad having you heal something beyond just physical wounds.\\" --- As their banter continued, Adrik's teasing flirtations mixed with his gruff but genuine nature only deepened the connection between the warrior and the medic. With each encounter, it became increasingly clear that there was more to their cosmic bond than mere banter, and their journey towards love and acceptance was just beginning."},{"instruction":"Leter motivusa","output":"Kedves [Név], Nap mint nap elismerem az erőfeszítéseidet és hozzájárulásodat mind a munkavégzésben, mind pedig a csapatunk sikereiben.

FRP is often used in smaller recreational boats, as well as for components like hulls, decks, and bulkheads in larger vessels. 4. Wood: Historically, wood was the primary material used in shipbuilding. While it is no longer the most common material, it is still used in traditional or luxury boat construction. Wood offers a natural aesthetic appeal, good tensile strength, and lightweight qualities. However, it requires regular maintenance and is less durable compared to steel or composites. 5. Concrete: In specific shipbuilding applications, concrete is used as a construction material, particularly for floating structures like docks, pontoons, and offshore platforms. Concrete offers stability, durability, and the ability to withstand harsh marine conditions. Reinforced concrete is often used to provide additional strength and structural integrity. These materials can be combined or used in conjunction with one another depending on the ship's design requirements, intended purpose, and the properties desired for specific ship components. The choice of material is a critical decision in shipbuilding as it impacts the ship's performance, longevity, maintenance requirements, and overall cost-effectiveness."},{"instruction":"How are the various ship types classified?","output":"Ships are classified into different types based on their design, purpose, and characteristics. The classification of ships can vary depending on the classification society, maritime organization, or regional regulations. However, here are the general categories of ship types: 1. Cargo Ships: These ships are designed for transporting goods and materials in bulk. They include various types such as bulk carriers (carrying dry bulk commodities like coal, grains, and ores), container ships (transporting cargo in standardized containers), and refrigerated cargo ships (for transporting perishable goods). 2. Tankers: Tankers are specifically designed to transport liquid cargo, such as crude oil, petroleum products, chemicals, and liquefied natural gas (LNG). They come in different types like oil tankers, product tankers, chemical tankers, and LNG carriers. 3. Passenger Ships: These ships are built primarily for transporting passengers. They include cruise ships (large vessels offering leisure trips), ferries (carrying passengers and vehicles across short sea distances), and ocean liners (luxury passenger ships for long-distance voyages). 4. Offshore Support Vessels (OSVs): OSVs are specialized ships that support offshore exploration and production activities. They include supply vessels (transporting goods, equipment, and personnel to offshore installations), anchor-handling tug supply vessels (for moving and positioning offshore platforms), and platform supply vessels (providing essential supplies to offshore installations). 5. Warships: Warships are naval vessels used for military purposes. They include aircraft carriers, destroyers, frigates, submarines, and patrol boats. Each type has specific capabilities and functions related to defense, combat, and maritime operations. 6. Research Vessels: These ships are designed for scientific research and exploration. They support various fields such as oceanography, marine biology, geology, and meteorology. Research vessels are equipped with specialized equipment, laboratories, and technologies to conduct scientific experiments and surveys. 7. Tugboats and Workboats: Tugboats are small but powerful vessels used for towing and maneuvering larger ships. Workboats include a variety of smaller vessels used for tasks like dredging, firefighting, pilotage, and maintenance work in ports and harbors. These are just a few examples of ship types, and there are numerous variations and subcategories within each type. The classification of ships is necessary for regulatory compliance, safety standards, and operational efficiency within the maritime industry."},{"instruction":"What is the main use of ships?","output":"The main use of ships is transportation, both for people and goods, across water bodies such as oceans, seas, rivers, and lakes.

Here are some key aspects of ships' role in world trade: 1. Bulk Transportation: Ships are utilized for bulk transportation, carrying large volumes of essential commodities such as oil, natural gas, coal, iron ore, grains, and other raw materials. These goods are loaded onto specialized vessels called bulk carriers and transported to markets worldwide, supporting industries like energy, manufacturing, and agriculture. 2. Containerized Cargo: Ships play a crucial role in the containerization revolution. Container ships transport goods in standardized metal containers, allowing for efficient loading, unloading, and intermodal transport. Containers provide a secure, protected, and standardized method of transporting diverse goods. This has greatly streamlined supply chains, facilitating global trade in manufactured goods, consumer products, electronics, and more. 3. Intercontinental Trade Routes: Ships connect continents and regions through long-haul transoceanic routes. They transport goods between major ports in different countries, covering vast distances that would be impractical or economically unviable by other means of transportation. Ships traverse dedicated trade routes, ensuring the steady flow of goods across the globe. 4. Access to Global Markets: Ships provide landlocked countries with access to global markets by utilizing inland waterways, rivers, and canals. This enables efficient trade routes for countries that lack direct access to oceanic ports but have navigable waterways or connect to major rivers. 5. Cost-Effective Transportation: Ships offer a cost-effective mode of transportation when compared to air or land transport for long-distance and large-volume shipments. The economies of scale associated with ships allow for cost efficiencies, making shipping a preferred choice for trade over long distances. 6. Support for Specialized Industries: Ships serve specialized sectors such as the oil and gas industry, with tankers transporting crude oil, petroleum products, and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Similarly, specialized vessels are used for transporting perishable goods, chemicals, finished automobiles, and other industry-specific cargo. 7. Global Supply Chain and Just-in-Time Manufacturing: Ships are a critical element of the global supply chain, ensuring the timely delivery of components, raw materials, and finished goods. They support the concept of just-in-time manufacturing, enabling companies to maintain lean inventories and reduce storage costs by receiving goods precisely when required. The efficiency and reliability of ships in transporting goods across borders and continents make them an essential component of world trade, facilitating economic growth, globalization, and the interconnectedness of nations."},{"instruction":"1.

Picture this: you're sitting in a study room, surrounded by stacks of textbooks and notes, preparing for that dreaded exam that seems to be looming over your head. But somehow, every few minutes, you find yourself instinctively reaching for your phone, scrolling aimlessly through your social media feed. Sound familiar? This is the reality of social media addiction, a phenomenon that has increasingly taken hold of our lives. It's like a thief that sneaks in, silently steals our concentration, and leaves us unable to complete those important tasks that require focus and attention. So, what exactly is happening when we become addicted to social media? Have you ever wondered why it's so difficult to break free from the cycle of constantly checking our notifications, likes, and comments? The answer lies within our brains. The constant stream of information, eye-catching visuals, and instant gratification that social media offers triggers the release of dopamine - a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and reward. It's that rush of excitement we feel when we get a notification or receive a bunch of likes on our latest selfie. And just like any addictive substance, our brain craves more of it. As a result, our ability to concentrate on tasks that require effort, patience, and focus suffers. Our attention span dwindles and we find it increasingly difficult to engage in hard and boring tasks that demand mental exertion. Instead, our fingers automatically reach for that app, feeding our hunger for immediate gratification and leaving us feeling trapped in a never-ending cycle of distraction. But why does this matter? Why should we be concerned about social media's impact on our ability to concentrate? Well, my friends, the ability to concentrate and focus is a fundamental skill necessary for success in every aspect of our lives. Whether it's acing an exam, completing a project at work, or pursuing our goals, focused attention is the key that unlocks our potential. Unfortunately, social media addiction not only robs us of our ability to concentrate but also contributes to feelings of anxiety, low self-esteem, and even isolation. We become so engrossed in the online world that we forget to connect with the real world and the people around us. Our virtual lives become more important than our real lives, and that's a dangerous path to tread. So how do we reclaim our ability to concentrate and break free from social media addiction? It starts with self-awareness. Recognize the signs of addiction and the impact it has on your ability to focus. Understand the importance of balance and set healthy boundaries with technology. Designate specific times for social media use and create \\"no-phone zones\\" during important tasks. Engaging in activities that require deep focus, such as reading, drawing, or practicing meditation, can be powerful antidotes to social media addiction. These activities exercise our attention muscles and help rebuild our capacity for concentration. Additionally, fostering a supportive environment is vital. Encourage empathy, communication, and healthy relationships among friends, family, and classmates. By connecting on a deeper level, we can counteract the superficiality that social media often promotes. In conclusion, let us be aware of the insidious ways in which social media addiction steals our ability to concentrate on hard and boring tasks. Let us reclaim our power by setting healthy boundaries, engaging in activities that require focus, and fostering meaningful connections. Only then can we truly unlock our potential and live a life of fulfillment and achievement. Thank you."},{"instruction":"Write me a story about the Wordgirl villains hiding out at their warehouse and listening to police sirens blaring when Butcher excuses himself to another room and has a sensory overload. The others find him and help him though.","output":"Once upon a time in the city of Fair City, a group of villains known as the Butcher, Granny May, Chuck the Evil Sandwich-Making Guy, and Dr. Two-Brains had gathered at their hidden warehouse. They were the arch-nemeses of Wordgirl, the city's superheroine with the power of words. On this particular evening, the villains had planned to lay low and avoid the superheroine's attention. They sat around a table, playing cards and discussing their most recent failed attempts to outsmart Wordgirl. Suddenly, the peaceful atmosphere was shattered by the loud blaring of police sirens in the distance. The sound grew louder and more intense, causing unease among the villains. The shrieking wails and flashing lights penetrated through the walls of the warehouse, shaking them to their core. Butcher, known for his immense strength and love of all things meat-related, found the noise unbearable. It was as if every wail of the siren pierced through his ears, sending waves of pain through his head. He clutched his temples and groaned, feeling overwhelmed by the sensory chaos. A worried frown etched across Granny May's face. Realizing that Butcher was in distress, she said, \\"Chuck, Dr. Two-Brains, we need to find Butcher and see if we can help him!\\" The group split up, searching every nook and cranny of the warehouse, calling out for Butcher. Finally, they discovered him in a small, dimly lit room, huddled in a corner, still holding his ears tightly. Butcher's usual strength dissipated, replaced by vulnerability and fear. Granny May approached, her voice filled with concern, \\"Butcher, it's okay. We're here to help you. Take slow, deep breaths.\\" Chuck, known for his eccentric sandwich-making antics, handed Butcher a brown paper bag. \\"Here, take this and breathe into it. It'll help you calm down,\\" he suggested, his voice surprisingly gentle. Butcher, still overwhelmed by his sensory overload, hesitantly followed their instructions. As he breathed into the bag, the rhythmic motion began to slow his racing heart. The loud sirens outside seemed further away, dulling their impact. He gradually regained control over his senses. Dr. Two-Brains, a former scientist with two brains in his head, spoke kindly, \\"Butcher, what you experienced is known as sensory overload. It's when our senses become overwhelmed, leaving us feeling drained and frightened. There's no shame in it. It happens to the best of us.\\" Butcher nodded, feeling grateful for his fellow villains' understanding and support. They had always been rivals, but in that moment, they were united in helping him through a difficult time. Together, they sat in the room, taking turns sharing stories of their own struggles and vulnerabilities. As the stories flowed, each villain realized that they were not alone in their fears and weaknesses. The bond that formed among them was unexpected but precious. Outside, the police sirens gradually faded away, and the city returned to its usual rhythm. Butcher, now feeling more like himself, thanked his comrades for their kindness. The experience had brought them closer than they ever thought possible. From that day forward, whenever any of them exhibited signs of anxiety or sensory overload, the villains were there to support and comfort one another. They learned that even as evil-doers, they could find strength in unity and understanding. And so, as the villains continued their mischievous plans to outsmart Wordgirl, they did so with a newfound sense of camaraderie, making their alliance stronger than ever before."},{"instruction":"What are the two distinct futures of Ottoman Governments reply to the draft Treaty of Sevres as mentioned in Baskin Oran book?","output":"According to Baskin Oran's book, \\"Two Different Perspectives on the Turkish-Armenian Relations and the Treaty of Sèvres,\\" there are two distinct futures of Ottoman Governments' reply to the draft Treaty of Sèvres. 1. The first perspective is that if the Ottoman Government had responded positively to the draft Treaty of Sèvres, they would have accepted the terms and implemented the provisions outlined in the treaty. This would have led to the dismantling of the Ottoman Empire and the establishment of a new state with significantly reduced territory, following the decisions made by the International Anatolian Commission. This perspective assumes that the Ottoman Government, under pressure from the occupying powers and aware of the dire situation of the country, would have taken a pragmatic approach in accepting the treaty's terms and attempting to navigate through the difficult post-war period. 2. The second perspective is that if the Ottoman Government had rejected the draft Treaty of Sèvres, it would have resulted in a continuation of the war with the Allies. This perspective argues that the Ottoman Government, led by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, would have rallied the Turkish resistance movement and fought against the occupying powers. This resistance would eventually lead to the Turkish War of Independence and the establishment of the Republic of Turkey, instead of the proposed state outlined in the Treaty of Sèvres. This perspective emphasizes the role of nationalist movements and the determination of the Turkish people in defending their homeland.

The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. * The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the aunt fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the aunt - who is standing in flat’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the flat, the obstructing aunt intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned aunt attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the aunt’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing aunt to step aside and just let her enter the flat. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the aunt’s obstruction and into the flat. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting aunt inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed aunt is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. As if out of instinct, the returning woman leans into the pressure that the aunt is applying on the returning woman’s stomach because of how good releasing her bowels feels for her, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a facial expression and leaned into the aunt’s pressing grip while exerting. The aunt asks the returning woman what’s the matter, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s peculiar behavior once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. The returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the aunt about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, the aunt is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the aunt to let go of her grip and finally allow the returning woman to enter. The laughing aunt relents because the returning woman pooped her pants and lets the returning woman enter. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat while holding/cupping the back of her pants, passing by the laughing aunt. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the astonished aunt taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this taunting with sheepish indignation. The astonished aunt continues to tease the returning woman for the way in which the returning woman pooped her pants and for the big, smelly load in the returning woman’s pants. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully replies to the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is the aunt’s fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The aunt playfully and incredulously denies the returning woman’s accusation, teasingly telling her that she should know better than pooping her pants and making a smelly mess. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman scoffs, apprises the bulge in her pants with her hand, winces and playfully complains as she describes the sensation of the poop in her pants, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant, reluctant and protesting but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, inquisitively grabs the bulge in the returning woman’s pants by hand, teasingly comments on how the bulge feels upon touch and proceeds to incredulously taunt the returning woman for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). * The returning woman coyly cringes the aunt’s inspection of her rear end, describing the sensation of her pants being full of so much poop and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. * The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). * The returning woman wryly acknowledges the aunt’s mocking and teasing while physically reacting to her own poop-filled pants and to the odor that is emanating from herself (describe this in elaborate detail). * Finally, as she’s cackling and still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing aunt waves the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up.","output":"# INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY FADE IN: A hallway in a nondescript apartment building. Neutral-colored walls, somewhat dim lighting. A figure, NADEEN (late 20s, Pakistani-American, wearing a loose-fitting tunic over slacks, hair tied back in a practical ponytail revealing frazzled edges - the tell-tale signs of a long day), scurries along it, in obvious distress. Her face is contorted, holding one hand to her stomach and the other clutching her purse, rifling through it in a blind panic. NADEEN (mutters to herself) No, no, no... This can't be happening... She reaches her flat's door, pause for a second and then frantically pats down her pockets before trying the handle. Locked. A look of sheer panic sets in as she rummages through her bag once more, now spilling contents onto the floor. NADEEN (calls out) MAYA! PLEASE tell me you're home! No answer. She whips out her phone and dials. It rings. And rings. NADEEN (voice strained, to voicemail) Maya, pick up, pick up, pick up… It's an emergency! She begins knocking on the door, practically pounding with force, urgency escalating by the second. NADEEN (murmurs) Please, please... Suddenly, a groggy voice emerges from the other side. It's her aunt, SHABANA (mid-50s, wearing an old-season designer loungewear set, hair in a silk wrap, and sporting glasses slipping down her nose). SHABANA (through the door) Nadeen? Is that you making all this noise? Nadeen's heart sinks at the realization that it’s the very person she was hoping not to face in such a state. NADEEN Yes, Auntie! Please, open the door! Shabana takes her sweet time, multiple locks clinking and clanking—a cacophony to Nadeen’s ears. NADEEN (pleading) Auntie, hurry up, please! The door finally swings open. SHABANA stands there, puzzled and half-awake, blocking the way as NADEEN bursts past her. SHABANA (concerned) What in the world is wrong? Without a word, NADEEN tries to sidestep her, but SHABANA reaches out, gripping NADEEN’s arms with genuine concern. NADEEN (struggling) I need to get inside NOW! SHABANA’s grip tightens, and she accidentally puts pressure on NADEEN’s belly. NADEEN’s eyes pop wide open, a groan of both discomfort and urgent relief escaping her lips. NADEEN (grunting) Oh god... not now... SHABANA (confused) What’s happening? Talk to me! NADEEN, caught in the unwinnable tussle, leans into the pressure, grimacing from the unexpected pleasure and relief of letting go. Still pressing, SHABANA remains oblivious to the gravity of the situation. NADEEN (strained whisper between grunts) …Auntie... the smell... A moment of silence is quickly pierced by the sound of revelation: SHABANA's nostrils flare, her face scrunches up as she smells the result of NADEEN’s accident. Realization paints her features. SHABANA (trying to contain laughter) Did you just... no way! NADEEN, pride wounded but desperate, gives up on denials. NADEEN (embarrassed) Can you please let me go? SHABANA bursts into laughter, releasing her niece from the grip. SHABANA (laughing) Sure, go on, kiddo. NADEEN gingerly makes her way past, cupping the back of her pants as SHABANA watches in mixed horror and amusement. SHABANA (teasing) Really, Nadeen? Pooped your pants like a toddler? Look at you waddle! NADEEN (sheepish yet indignant) Not funny, Auntie. Undeterred, SHABANA teases further about NADEEN’s less-than-glamorous situation. SHABANA (teasingly clucking) What a mess you’ve made. This is one for the books! NADEEN, embracing her predicament, turns to SHABANA with exaggerated sulkiness. NADEEN (playfully mournful) This is on you... you squished it out of me! SHABANA (playfully dismissive) As if I forced you! You should've known better. NADEEN scoffs, pins a hand on her hip, grimacing as she appraises the load. NADEEN (mock outrage) Feels like a disaster area back there. She tries to move past, but SHABANA can't resist further inspection. She gently grabs NADEEN's wrist and rotates her for a closer look, poking the obvious bulge. SHABANA (appalled curiosity) I can't believe this... feels like you’re smuggling a full Thanksgiving dinner! NADEEN cringes, desperate to escape. NADEEN (playful whine) Auntie, stop. Please. I’ve got to clean up. SHABANA exaggerates her response to the odor, waving her hand in front of her nose but can't quell her teasing grin. SHABANA (teasing) Oh, you’re absolutely right! That stench could wilt flowers. Off you go! NADEEN, now playing along with a mix of self-mockery and resignation, pinches her nose and inspects herself. NADEEN (grimacing) Oh, the horror, the horror... SHABANA, laughing heartily, still physically recoiling from the smell, shoos NADEEN towards the bathroom. SHABANA (cackling) The shower is that way, love. March on! With one last, exaggerated gag and wave, SHABANA’s laughter echoes as NADEEN exits the frame, wincing with each step. FADE OUT.

We embrace technology to create artistic value, solve practical social needs, enhance public vitality, and ultimately make it the most important component of social and cultural diversity. China's urban development has gone through a period of rapid expansion. In the midst of this busyness, I reflect on what this \\"prosperity\\" has brought us. When I return from Beijing to my hometown 1200 kilometers away or travel to distant places, I feel that every city is extremely similar. We call it \\"a thousand cities with the same face\\". If it weren't for the accents of people around me or the different regional cuisines, I would hardly sense any difference between cities. During my work, I have been involved in residential planning and design projects in different regions, including projects in major cities along the southeast coast and small towns in northern China. Through the design process, I deeply realize that due to the fundamental market attributes of real estate development (obtaining maximum economic benefits with minimal cost, and constraining design with highly modular conditions), combined with almost identical control conditions (such as planning indicators, sunlight conditions, and form control) among different regions, the spatial forms presented by such projects of major building types in cities are extremely similar. This ultimately makes cities become more and more homogeneous in different regions, scales, and cultural backgrounds, losing their distinctive features and vitality. These project experiences made me realize the importance of maintaining urban diversity, as diversity is the source of urban vitality. In order to maintain urban diversity and enhance urban vitality, whether it be urban administrators, developers, or architects, they should possess interdisciplinary thinking abilities and study cities and architecture from multiple perspectives such as urban planning, design of urban public spaces, and creation of landscape spaces. Therefore, I hope to have more exposure to urban design content in my future studies, and gain a macro perspective to understand architecture, as well as to understand and accumulate knowledge in various professional disciplines. Furthermore, the rapid development of the construction industry has made us become mere cogs in the assembly line, leaving us with little opportunity and time to deeply ponder the various possibilities of future architecture. Sometimes, we pay too much attention to the external form of buildings, but pay too little attention to the relationship between buildings and the environment, the true experiences of building users, the current and future development of green buildings, and even the impact and role of other disciplines on architecture. This is something I urgently hope to change. Fortunately, in 2016, I participated in the renovation design of the Intercontinental Holiday Resort at Chongli by Fulong. Before being designated as the hotel where the organizing committee of the 2022 Winter Olympics would stay, the hotel was originally designed and implemented as a three-star hotel. When the design task was assigned, the building structure had already been topped out, which imposed significant restrictions on the renovation plan. The client entrusted us to renovate the hotel according to the Intercontinental standard. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the original structural system, and had extensive discussions and collaborations with colleagues from the mechanical and electrical discipline and equipment manufacturers. Ultimately, we were able to optimize the renovation to ensure excellent spatial effects and architectural experiences. Another aspect of the project that needed breakthrough was the enhancement of the building's image. Considering the positioning of Chongli Intercontinental Holiday Resort as an international ski resort hotel, after conducting in-depth research on architectural forms of ski resorts around the world, we focused on the Whistler Resort style in Canada and successfully realized it in the building. As for landscape and interior design, we retained a modern Chinese design language. In this way, through the fusion of diverse styles, we created a unique architectural image. This project made me fully realize that architecture is a highly comprehensive discipline. The final form, space, and experiential effects of any good architecture are inseparable from the support of other interdisciplinary fields and a more diverse design perspective. Therefore, I believe that the master's program is an excellent opportunity to pause and reflect, to learn advanced design concepts, broaden my horizons and ways of thinking, enrich self-awareness, and allow architecture to better adapt to the diverse needs of future society. At the same time, I also hope to learn more cutting-edge architectural technologies and concepts, such as green energy-saving technologies, in order to integrate architectural design with the environment and climate, and create a more comfortable and climate-adaptive built environment."},{"instruction":"определите фактическую трудоемкость в организации и показатель выработки численность работников составляет 20 человек. за месяц 21 рабочий день было заключено 12 договоров средней стоимостью по 600 тысяч рублей за каждый","output":"Для определения фактической трудоемкости в организации, нужно знать среднее количество рабочих часов, которые работники тратят на выполнение каждого договора.

The others find him and help him though, even when he starts crying how everything is simultaneously burning and freezing and the noise just really hurts and he wants it to stop.","output":"Once upon a time in the city of Fair City, a group of notorious villains known as The Butcher, The Baker, and The Candlestick Maker found themselves hiding out in their secret warehouse hideout. The Wordgirl had once again foiled their evil plans, leaving the trio frustrated and seeking solace within the confines of their sanctuary. As the villains soaked in their individual melancholy, the distant sound of police sirens pierced the air. The blaring noise grew louder, filling the warehouse with an unsettling symphony of wailing sirens. The Baker and The Candlestick Maker exchanged worried glances, recognizing the signs of an approaching police chase. The cacophony caused a sensory overload for The Butcher, whose super-sensitive senses made the sirens unbearable. Realizing he couldn't endure the noise any longer, The Butcher excused himself and stumbled into a separate room, desperately seeking a moment of solace. Inside the room, The Butcher's heightened senses pushed him to his limits. He closed his eyes, trying to escape, but even in darkness, the noise bombarded him. It was as if everything was simultaneously burning and freezing, tormenting his mind and driving him to the brink of despair. Back in the main room, The Baker and The Candlestick Maker became increasingly concerned about their friend's prolonged absence. Worried that something might be gravely wrong, they decided to search for The Butcher. Room by room, they scoured the warehouse until they stumbled upon The Butcher, curled up on the floor, his face contorted in pain and tears streaming down his cheeks. The others immediately rushed to his side, their concern eclipsing any thoughts of their own turmoil. \\"What's wrong, Butcher? Can we help?\\" The Candlestick Maker gently asked, his voice filled with genuine worry. But The Butcher couldn't speak; his sensory overload overwhelmed him to the point of being unable to articulate his suffering. All he could do was cry, feeling the burning and freezing sensations intensify, desperately yearning for the noise to stop. Knowing they couldn't simply stand by and do nothing, The Baker and The Candlestick Maker rallied their strengths to support their friend. Working together, they created a makeshift barrier around The Butcher to muffle the blaring sirens outside, shielding him from the painful cacophony. As The Butcher felt the noise lessen, his muscles relaxed, and he slowly regained control over his senses. The burning and freezing sensations subsided, leaving him with a sense of profound relief. With tears still glistening in his eyes, The Butcher looked at his accomplices and managed a weak smile. \\"Thank you. I couldn't have endured it without you,\\" he said softly, his voice filled with gratitude. The Baker and The Candlestick Maker smiled back, realizing the immense importance of supporting and caring for one another, even in the face of their own villainous ambitions. In that moment, they understood that their bond as friends surpassed their acts of wrongdoing. As the sirens finally faded into the distance, The Butcher, The Baker, and The Candlestick Maker reunited, finding reassurance in their unity. With newfound determination, they vowed to forge ahead, using their unique talents for something greater - not just for villainy, but for the betterment of society. And so, the story of these Wordgirl villains took an unexpected turn, reminding us all that even villains have the capacity for redemption and compassion, and that every individual, no matter how flawed, deserves a chance at finding their true purpose."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:N,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"search-container"},z={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],H={key:0},B={key:1};function E(n,e,h,p,o,s){const m=f("PoemCard");return i(),a("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",M,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(i(),a("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",z,[(i(!0),a(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(i(),k(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(i(),a("div",D,' No results found for "'+c(o.searchQuery)+'".
