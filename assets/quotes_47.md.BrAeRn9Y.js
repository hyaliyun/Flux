In terms of the type of the zero, a removable singularity occurs when a function has a hole at a point, and the function can be redefined at that point to make it continuous. A pole occurs when a function has a non-removable singularity that can be canceled by multiplying the function by a suitable power of (z - z0), where z0 is the point of the singularity.

This means that f(z) can be extended to a holomorphic function in a neighborhood of z=2 by defining f(2) = lim(z->2) f(z). 4. f(z) is holomorphic for |z|>2 and satisfies the inequality |f(z)| ≤ 1 for all z ∈ C. Now, let's find the residues of f(z) at z=0 and z=1. Residue at z=0: Since f(z) has a pole of order 2 at z=0, we can find the residue by taking the first derivative of g(z)/(z^2) and evaluating it at z=0. Res[f(z), 0] = (d/dz) [g(z)/(z^2)](0) Since g(z) is holomorphic and g(0) ≠ 0, g(z) can be written as a power series g(z) = a_0 + a_1z + a_2z^2 + ... with a_0 ≠ 0. Then, g'(z) = a_1 + 2a_2z + 3a_3z^2 + ... So, Res[f(z), 0] = g'(0) = a_1. Residue at z=1: Since f(z) has a simple pole at z=1, we can find the residue by multiplying f(z) by (z-1) and evaluating it at z=1. Res[f(z), 1] = [(z-1) * h(z)/(z-1)](1) = h(1) Now, we use the information that |f(z)| ≤ 1 for all z ∈ C. Since f(z) is holomorphic for |z|>2, it is bounded by 1 in this region. By the Maximum Modulus Principle, f(z) must be constant in this region. Let's denote this constant as c. f(z) = c for |z|>2 Since f(z) has a removable singularity at z=2, we can extend f(z) to be holomorphic at z=2 by defining f(2) = c. Now, we have enough information to find the residues at z=0 and z=1. Res[f(z), 0] = a_1 = g'(0) Res[f(z), 1] = h(1) Since f(z) is holomorphic for |z|>2 and satisfies the inequality |f(z)| ≤ 1 for all z ∈ C, we can conclude that the residues of f(z) at z=0 and z=1 are: Res[f(z), 0] = g'(0) = a_1 Res[f(z), 1] = h(1)"},{"instruction":"Let f(z) = (z^3 + 2z + 3)/(z^2 + 1) be a meromorphic function.

The function will be undefined when the denominator is equal to zero. Denominator: z - 1 = 0 Solving for z, we get z = 1. So, the function is undefined when z = 1. Therefore, the domain of the function is all complex numbers except z = 1. In set notation, the domain is: Domain: {z ∈ ℂ | z ≠ 1} Now, let's find the range of the function. To do this, we can try to simplify the function and see if there are any values of f(z) that cannot be achieved. We can factor the numerator of the function: 4z^2 - 1 = (2z + 1)(2z - 1) Now, we can rewrite the function as: f(z) = [(2z + 1)(2z - 1)]/(z - 1) We can't simplify this expression any further.

First, let's find z^2 + 2z: z^2 + 2z = (x + yi)^2 + 2(x + yi) = (x^2 - y^2 + 2xiy) + 2x + 2yi = (x^2 - y^2 + 2x) + (2xy + 2y)i. Now, let's find the magnitude of this complex number: |(x^2 - y^2 + 2x) + (2xy + 2y)i|^2 = (x^2 - y^2 + 2x)^2 + (2xy + 2y)^2. We want to maximize this expression subject to the constraint x^2 + y^2 = 9. To do this, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define the function: F(x, y, lambda) = (x^2 - y^2 + 2x)^2 + (2xy + 2y)^2 - lambda(x^2 + y^2 - 9). Now, we need to find the critical points of this function by taking the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and lambda and setting them equal to zero: frac{partial F}{partial x} = 4(x^2 - y^2 + 2x)(2x + 1) + 8y^2(2x + 1) - 2lambda x = 0, frac{partial F}{partial y} = -8xy(2x + 1) + 4(2xy + 2y)(2y + 1) - 2lambda y = 0, frac{partial F}{partial lambda} = x^2 + y^2 - 9 = 0. From the third equation, we have the constraint x^2 + y^2 = 9. Now, we can solve the first two equations simultaneously. Notice that both equations have a common factor of (2x + 1): 4(x^2 - y^2 + 2x)(2x + 1) + 8y^2(2x + 1) - 2lambda x = 0 Rightarrow (4x^2 - 4y^2 + 8x + 8y^2)(2x + 1) - 2lambda x = 0, -8xy(2x + 1) + 4(2xy + 2y)(2y + 1) - 2lambda y = 0 Rightarrow (-8xy + 8xy^2 + 8y^2)(2x + 1) - 2lambda y = 0. Now, we can factor out (2x + 1): (4x^2 + 4y^2 + 8x)(2x + 1) - 2lambda x = 0, (8y^2 - 8xy + 8y^2)(2x + 1) - 2lambda y = 0. Divide both equations by (2x + 1): 4x^2 + 4y^2 + 8x - 2lambda x = 0, 8y^2 - 8xy + 8y^2 - 2lambda y = 0. Now, we can rewrite these equations as: 2lambda x = 4x^2 + 4y^2 + 8x, 2lambda y = 8y^2 - 8xy + 8y^2. Divide the first equation by x and the second equation by y: 2lambda = 4x + 4y^2/x + 8, 2lambda = 8y - 8x + 8y. Now, we can equate the expressions for 2lambda: 4x + 4y^2/x + 8 = 8y - 8x + 8y. Rearrange the equation: 12x + 4y^2/x = 16y - 8y. Now, multiply both sides by x: 12x^2 + 4y^2 = 8xy - 8y^2x. Recall that x^2 + y^2 = 9. We can substitute this into the equation: 12(9) + 4y^2 = 8xy - 8y^2x. Simplify: 108 + 4y^2 = 8xy - 8y^2x. Now, we can use the constraint x^2 + y^2 = 9 to eliminate one of the variables. For example, we can solve for x: x^2 = 9 - y^2 Rightarrow x = pmsqrt{9 - y^2}. Substitute this into the equation: 108 + 4y^2 = 8y(pmsqrt{9 - y^2}) - 8y^2(pmsqrt{9 - y^2}). Now, we can solve this equation for y. However, this is a complicated equation, and it is difficult to find an exact solution. Instead, we can use a numerical method to find the maximum value of |z^2 + 2z|. Using a numerical method (e.g., a computer program), we find that the maximum value of |z^2 + 2z| occurs when y approx 1.5 and x approx pmsqrt{9 - 1.5^2} approx pm 2.598.

We can do this by taking the derivative with respect to θ and setting it to zero: d(|f(z)|²)/dθ = 0 After taking the derivative and simplifying, we get: -32cos(θ)sin(θ) + 16sin(θ)cos(θ) - 8sin(θ) = 0 Divide by -8: 4cos(θ)sin(θ) - 2sin(θ)cos(θ) + sin(θ) = 0 sin(θ)(2cos(θ) - cos(θ) + 1) = 0 This gives us two possibilities: sin(θ) = 0 or 2cos(θ) - cos(θ) + 1 = 0. The first case, sin(θ) = 0, corresponds to θ = 0 or θ = π. The second case, 2cos(θ) - cos(θ) + 1 = 0, corresponds to cos(θ) = 1/2, which gives θ = 2π/3 or θ = 4π/3.

Then, the given condition becomes phi(rcostheta, rsintheta) = rcostheta for r = 1. Now, we can express phi in polar coordinates as phi(r, theta) = R(r)Theta(theta). The Laplace's equation in polar coordinates is given by: Delta phi = frac{1}{r}frac{partial}{partial r}left(rfrac{partial phi}{partial r}right) + frac{1}{r^2}frac{partial^2 phi}{partial theta^2} = 0. Substituting phi(r, theta) = R(r)Theta(theta), we get: frac{1}{r}frac{partial}{partial r}left(rfrac{partial (RTheta)}{partial r}right) + frac{1}{r^2}frac{partial^2 (RTheta)}{partial theta^2} = 0. Dividing by R(r)Theta(theta), we obtain: frac{1}{rR}frac{partial}{partial r}left(rfrac{partial R}{partial r}right) + frac{1}{r^2Theta}frac{partial^2 Theta}{partial theta^2} = 0. Since the left side is a function of r and the right side is a function of theta, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let this constant be -k^2. Then, we have two ordinary differential equations: 1. frac{1}{rR}frac{partial}{partial r}left(rfrac{partial R}{partial r}right) = -k^2. 2. frac{1}{Theta}frac{partial^2 Theta}{partial theta^2} = k^2. Solving the second equation, we get: frac{partial^2 Theta}{partial theta^2} = k^2Theta. The general solution is: Theta(theta) = Acos(ktheta) + Bsin(ktheta). Since phi is a harmonic function, it must be single-valued. This implies that Theta(theta + 2pi) = Theta(theta). Therefore, k = n for some integer n. Thus, we have: Theta_n(theta) = A_ncos(ntheta) + B_nsin(ntheta). Now, let's solve the first equation: frac{1}{rR}frac{partial}{partial r}left(rfrac{partial R}{partial r}right) = -n^2.

Thus, the general solution for phi in polar coordinates is: phi(r, theta) = sum_{n=1}^{infty} (C_{1n}r^n + C_{2n}r^{-n})(A_ncos(ntheta) + B_nsin(ntheta)). Now, we use the given condition phi(rcostheta, rsintheta) = rcostheta for r = 1. This gives: sum_{n=1}^{infty} (C_{1n} + C_{2n})(A_ncos(ntheta) + B_nsin(ntheta)) = costheta. Comparing the coefficients of costheta and sintheta, we get: C_{1n}A_n + C_{2n}A_n = delta_{n1}, C_{1n}B_n + C_{2n}B_n = 0. Here, delta_{n1} is the Kronecker delta, which is equal to 1 if n = 1 and 0 otherwise. Since B_n = 0 for all n, we have: C_{1n}A_n + C_{2n}A_n = delta_{n1} Rightarrow A_n(C_{1n} + C_{2n}) = delta_{n1}. Thus, A_1 = 1 and A_n = 0 for n neq 1. Therefore, the solution for phi is: phi(r, theta) = (C_{11}r + C_{21}r^{-1})costheta. Finally, we want to find the value of phi(0, 0). Since phi is a harmonic function, it is continuous. Therefore, we can take the limit as r to 0: phi(0, 0) = lim_{r to 0} (C_{11}r + C_{21}r^{-1})costheta = C_{11} cdot 0 + C_{21} cdot infty cdot costheta. However, this limit is not well-defined, as it depends on the value of theta. This implies that the harmonic function phi(x, y) cannot satisfy the given condition.

We assume that u(x, y) can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on y. That is, u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y). Since f(z) is harmonic, it satisfies Laplace's equation: nabla^2 u = frac{partial^2 u}{partial x^2} + frac{partial^2 u}{partial y^2} = 0. Substituting u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y) into Laplace's equation, we get: X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = 0. Now, we divide both sides by X(x)Y(y): frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = 0. Since the left side depends only on x and the right side depends only on y, both sides must be equal to a constant. We denote this constant as -lambda^2: frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -lambda^2, quad frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = lambda^2. Now, we have two ordinary differential equations: X''(x) + lambda^2 X(x) = 0, quad Y''(y) - lambda^2 Y(y) = 0. The general solutions for these equations are: X(x) = Acos(lambda x) + Bsin(lambda x), quad Y(y) = Ccosh(lambda y) + Dsinh(lambda y). Now, we apply the boundary conditions: 1. f(z) = 0 when x = 0: u(0, y) = X(0)Y(y) = (Acos(0) + Bsin(0))(Ccosh(lambda y) + Dsinh(lambda y)) = ACcosh(lambda y) = 0. Since Ccosh(lambda y) cannot be zero for all y, we must have A = 0. So, X(x) = Bsin(lambda x). 2. u(x, frac{pi}{2}) = 1 + x: u(x, frac{pi}{2}) = Bsin(lambda x)(Ccosh(lambda frac{pi}{2}) + Dsinh(lambda frac{pi}{2})) = 1 + x. 3. u(1, y) - u(0, y) = cos(y): u(1, y) - u(0, y) = Bsin(lambda)(Ccosh(lambda y) + Dsinh(lambda y)) - 0 = cos(y). Now, we have a system of equations for B, C, and D. To solve this system, we can use the method of Fourier sine series. We expand the functions 1 + x and cos(y) in terms of sine series: 1 + x = sum_{n=1}^{infty} b_n sin(npi x), quad cos(y) = sum_{n=1}^{infty} c_n sin(ny). Comparing the coefficients, we get: b_n = frac{2}{pi}int_0^1 (1 + x)sin(npi x) dx, quad c_n = frac{2}{pi}int_0^{frac{pi}{2}} cos(y)sin(ny) dy. Solving these integrals, we find: b_n = frac{2}{npi}(-1)^{n+1} + frac{(-1)^n - 1}{(npi)^2}, quad c_n = frac{2}{n}(-1)^{n+1}. Now, we can write the solution for u(x, y) as: u(x, y) = sum_{n=1}^{infty} b_n sin(npi x)(C_ncosh(npi y) + D_nsinh(npi y)). Applying the boundary condition u(x, frac{pi}{2}) = 1 + x, we get: 1 + x = sum_{n=1}^{infty} b_n sin(npi x)(C_ncosh(nfrac{pi^2}{2}) + D_nsinh(nfrac{pi^2}{2})). Comparing the coefficients, we find: C_n = frac{b_n}{cosh(nfrac{pi^2}{2})}, quad D_n = 0.

Since f(z) is harmonic, it can be represented as the real part of a holomorphic function, say g(z). That is, f(z) = Re(g(z)). We can write g(z) = u(z) + iv(z), where u(z) = f(z) and v(z) is the imaginary part of g(z). Now, we know that g(z) is holomorphic in the circular region of radius 2 centered at the origin.

Let's write h(z) = w(z) + ix(z), where w(z) is the real part of h(z) and x(z) is the imaginary part of h(z). Since h(z) = g(-z), we have w(z) = u(-z) and x(z) = -v(-z).

Using the Cauchy-Riemann equations, we can rewrite the Laplace equation as: frac{partial^2 v}{partial x partial y} - frac{partial^2 v}{partial y partial x} = 0. Since the mixed partial derivatives are equal, this equation is satisfied. Now, let's consider the function g(z) = f'(z). Since f(z) is analytic, so is g(z). We can write g(z) = frac{partial u}{partial x} + ifrac{partial v}{partial x}. Using the Cauchy-Riemann equations, we can rewrite this as: g(z) = frac{partial u}{partial x} - ifrac{partial u}{partial y}.

First, we need to find g(z) = f'(z): g(z) = frac{d}{dz}left(frac{e^{iz}+1}{z}right) = frac{-e^{iz}+ize^{iz}}{z^2}. Now, we need to find the real part of g(2+3i): g(2+3i) = frac{-e^{i(2+3i)}+(2+3i)e^{i(2+3i)}}{(2+3i)^2} = frac{-e^{i(2+3i)}+(2+3i)e^{i(2+3i)}}{-5+12i}. Now, we can compute the real part of this expression: Re(g(2+3i)) = frac{partial u}{partial x}(2,3) = frac{-e^{i(2+3i)}+(2+3i)e^{i(2+3i)}}{-5+12i} cdot frac{-5-12i}{-5-12i} = frac{-5e^{i(2+3i)}+(2+3i)(-5+12i)e^{i(2+3i)}}{169}.

Since u(x, y) is given to be a harmonic function, it satisfies the Laplace equation: ∆u = (∂^2u/∂x^2) + (∂^2u/∂y^2) = 0 Now, we can find the second partial derivatives of u(x, y): ∂^2u/∂x^2 = ∂/∂x(3x^2 - 3y^2 - 3) = 6x ∂^2u/∂y^2 = ∂/∂y(-6xy) = -6x Now, substituting these into the Laplace equation: ∆u = (6x) + (-6x) = 0 Since u(x, y) is harmonic, we can use the Cauchy-Riemann equations to find v(x, y): ∂u/∂x = ∂v/∂y ∂u/∂y = -∂v/∂x Now, we can find the first partial derivatives of u(x, y) and v(x, y): ∂u/∂x = 3x^2 - 3y^2 - 3 ∂u/∂y = -6xy Now, we can use the Cauchy-Riemann equations to find the partial derivatives of v(x, y): ∂v/∂y = 3x^2 - 3y^2 - 3 -∂v/∂x = -6xy Now, we can integrate these partial derivatives to find v(x, y): v(x, y) = ∫(3x^2 - 3y^2 - 3) dy = 3x^2y - y^3 - 3y + g(x) Now, we can differentiate v(x, y) with respect to x and compare it with -∂u/∂y: ∂v/∂x = 6xy + g'(x) Since -∂u/∂y = -6xy, we have: 6xy + g'(x) = -6xy This implies that g'(x) = -12xy.

We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to find the maximum and minimum values of u(x,y) on the boundary. Let g(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 - 1.

Applying the boundary condition X(0) = 0, we get: 0 = A*sin(0) + B*cos(0) => B = 0. So, X(x) = A*sin(√λx). Now, let's solve the second equation: Y''(y) - λY(y) = 0. For λ > 0, the general solution is: Y(y) = C*cosh(√λy) + D*sinh(√λy). Applying the boundary condition u(x,0) = 1, we get: 1 = X(x)/Y(0) => Y(0) = X(x) => C = 1. So, Y(y) = cosh(√λy) + D*sinh(√λy).

The Schwarz lemma states that if g(z) is an analytic function on the upper half-plane H, with g(H) ⊆ H and g(i) = i, then |g'(i)| ≤ 1 and |g(z)| ≤ |z| for all z ∈ H. First, we define a new function g(z) = (f(z) - 2)/(f(z) - 1). Note that g(z) is analytic on the upper half-plane since f(z) is analytic and f(z) ≠ 1. Also, g(i) = (f(i) - 2)/(f(i) - 1) = (2 - 2)/(2 - 1) = 0, and g(H) ⊆ H. Now, we apply the Schwarz lemma to g(z). We have |g'(i)| ≤ 1.

The Schwarz reflection principle states that if a function is analytic in a region and continuous on the boundary of that region, then it can be reflected across the boundary and still be analytic. In this case, we can reflect g(z) across the real axis to obtain an entire function h(z) such that h(z) = g(z) for text{Im}(z) < 0 and h(overline{z}) = overline{g(z)} for text{Im}(z) > 0.

Therefore, we can substitute x * conjugate(x) in the equation: |w|^2 = ((7w - 6)x + 9w) * ((7w - 6) + 9conjugate(w)) Expanding the equation, we get: |w|^2 = (7w - 6)(7w - 6) + 9(7w - 6)conjugate(w) + 9w(7w - 6) + 81|w|^2 Rearranging the terms, we get: 80|w|^2 = 49w^2 - 84w^3 + 36w^4 + 126wconjugate(w) - 108w^2conjugate(w) Since the left side of the equation is real, the imaginary part of the right side must be zero. Therefore, the imaginary part of the right side is: Im(49w^2 - 84w^3 + 36w^4) = 0 This equation represents the image of the boundary of S under f(z). Unfortunately, this equation is quite complicated and does not have a simple closed-form solution. However, we can still deduce some properties of the image of S under f(z). Since f(z) is a rational function, it is continuous and holomorphic on its domain. Therefore, the image of the open disk S under f(z) will be an open set in the complex plane. Moreover, the image of the boundary of S will be a closed curve in the complex plane, and the image of S will be the region enclosed by this curve. In conclusion, the image of S under f(z) is an open region in the complex plane enclosed by the curve defined by the equation Im(49w^2 - 84w^3 + 36w^4) = 0."},{"instruction":"A river flows through a domain D in the complex plane such that D is bounded by two straight lines y=0 and y=1 and two circles |z-frac{1}{2}|=frac{1}{2} and |z-frac{3}{2}|=frac{1}{2}.

Step 1: Map D to the upper half-plane. Let's consider the Möbius transformation f(z) = frac{z - frac{1}{2}}{z - frac{3}{2}}. This transformation maps the circle |z - frac{1}{2}| = frac{1}{2} to the line y = 0 and the circle |z - frac{3}{2}| = frac{1}{2} to the line y = 1. Thus, it maps D to the strip between these two lines.  Now, let's map the strip to the upper half-plane. We can do this by applying the exponential function g(z) = e^{pi z}. This function maps the strip to the upper half-plane because it maps the lines y = 0 and y = 1 to the real axis and the line y = infty, respectively. So, the composition h(z) = g(f(z)) = e^{pi frac{z - frac{1}{2}}{z - frac{3}{2}}} maps D to the upper half-plane. Step 2: Map the upper half-plane to the unit disk. The Cayley transform c(z) = frac{z - i}{z + i} maps the upper half-plane to the unit disk.  Step 3: Compose the functions and adjust for the desired mapping of 0.75i to i. Let w(z) = c(h(z)) = frac{h(z) - i}{h(z) + i}. We want to find a biholomorphic function F(z) such that F(0.75i) = i.  We have w(0.75i) = frac{h(0.75i) - i}{h(0.75i) + i}. Let k = h(0.75i). Then, we can write w(0.75i) = frac{k - i}{k + i}.  Now, let's find a Möbius transformation m(z) that maps w(0.75i) to i. We can write m(z) = frac{az + b}{cz + d}, where a, b, c, d in mathbb{C} and ad - bc neq 0.  We want m(w(0.75i)) = i, so we have frac{a(w(0.75i)) + b}{c(w(0.75i)) + d} = i. Substituting w(0.75i) = frac{k - i}{k + i}, we get: frac{aleft(frac{k - i}{k + i}right) + b}{cleft(frac{k - i}{k + i}right) + d} = i We can choose a = k + i, b = -k + i, c = k - i, and d = k + i.

Then h is the inverse of g, and it is also a conformal map from U to the unit disc that fixes the origin and has a positive real derivative at the origin.

Instead of mapping 1 to 1, let's map -1 to 1. Plugging in z = -1, we get: f(-1) = frac{-a - ai}{-a - ai} = 1 This implies that a = i.

The denominator z² + 2iz + 1 is always real and positive for z ∈ D. Therefore, the imaginary part of f(z) is positive, which means f(z) ∈ H. Next, we need to show that f is bijective and holomorphic. The Möbius transformation f(z) is holomorphic since it is a composition of holomorphic functions (addition, multiplication, and division). To show that f is bijective, we need to find its inverse. Let g(w) be the inverse of f, i.e., g(f(z)) = z and f(g(w)) = w. Then: z = g((z - i)/(z + i)) and w = f(g(w)) = (g(w) - i)/(g(w) + i). Solving for g(w), we get: g(w) = (w + i)/(1 - iw). Now, we can check that g is the inverse of f: g(f(z)) = g((z - i)/(z + i)) = ((z - i)/(z + i) + i)/(1 - i(z - i)/(z + i)) = (z - i + i(z + i))/(z + i - iz + z) = z. Similarly, f(g(w)) = f((w + i)/(1 - iw)) = ((w + i)/(1 - iw) - i)/((w + i)/(1 - iw) + i) = w. Thus, f is bijective, and its inverse g is also holomorphic. Therefore, f is a biholomorphic function from the unit disk D to the upper half-plane H. Finally, we check that f(0) = i: f(0) = (0 - i)/(0 + i) = -i² = i. So, the biholomorphic function f(z) = (z - i)/(z + i) maps the unit disk D to the upper half-plane H and takes the point 0 to the point i, as required."},{"instruction":"ere's a numerical problem regarding Riemann mapping theorem and its applications: Suppose we have a region E defined by the inequality 0 < x < 1 and 0 < y < 1/2.

To do this, we can find the critical points of f(z) and check if they lie inside the unit disc. The critical points of f(z) are the solutions to f'(z) = 0: f'(z) = 2z - 3 2z - 3 = 0 z = 3/2 Since 3/2 is not in the unit disc, there are no critical points of f(z) inside the unit disc. Therefore, the image of the unit disc under f(z) is simply the region enclosed by the curve traced by f(e^(iθ)) as θ varies from 0 to 2π.

Next, we need to find the radius of the circle. Since the center is at the origin, the radius is given by the maximum value of |f(e^{itheta})| for theta in [0, 2pi]. We have: |f(e^{itheta})| = left|frac{2e^{itheta} + 1}{e^{itheta} - 1}right| = frac{|2e^{itheta} + 1|}{|e^{itheta} - 1|}. Using the identity |e^{itheta} - 1|^2 = 2 - 2costheta, we can write: |f(e^{itheta})|^2 = frac{|2e^{itheta} + 1|^2}{2 - 2costheta} = frac{4cos^2theta + 4costheta + 1}{2 - 2costheta}. To find the maximum value of |f(e^{itheta})|^2, we can differentiate with respect to costheta and set the derivative to zero: frac{d}{d(costheta)} frac{4cos^2theta + 4costheta + 1}{2 - 2costheta} = 0. Solving this equation, we find that the maximum value of |f(e^{itheta})|^2 occurs at costheta = frac{1}{2}.

As θ goes from 0 to π, the argument of the exponential function in h(z) goes from 0 to π, and the imaginary part of h(z) goes from 0 to infinity. As θ goes from π to 2π, the argument of the exponential function in h(z) goes from π to 0, and the imaginary part of h(z) goes from infinity back to 0.

In our case, the region is bounded by the unit circle and the real axis from -1 to 1. The prevertices are z_1 = -1, z_2 = 1, and z_3 = 0. The angles of the corresponding vertices in the upper half-plane are α_1 = α_2 = 1 (since they are both right angles) and α_3 = 2 (since it is a straight angle). Now, we can plug these values into the Schwarz-Christoffel formula: f(z) = A ∫(dz / (z - (-1))^1 (z - 1)^1 (z - 0)^2) + B Simplify the integral: f(z) = A ∫(dz / (z + 1)(z - 1)z^2) + B To find the constants A and B, we can use the boundary conditions.

We can use the fact that f(1) should map to the real axis in the upper half-plane. Let's denote f(1) = x, then we have: A ∫(-1 to 1) (dz / (z + 1)(z - 1)z^2) + (-A) = x Since the integral is an odd function, the integral from -1 to 1 is zero.

Now, we can solve for U(z, bar{z}): U(z, bar{z}) = e^{-3z}left(int e^{5z+3bar{z}} dz + G(bar{z})right) To find the function G(bar{z}), we use the initial condition u(x, 0) = x^2. This translates to U(x, 0) = x^2. Plugging in y = 0 and z = x into the equation for U(z, bar{z}), we get: x^2 = e^{-3x}left(int e^{5x} dx + G(0)right) Integrating e^{5x} with respect to x, we get: frac{1}{5}e^{5x} + C where C is the constant of integration. Now, we can rewrite the equation for x^2 as: x^2 = e^{-3x}left(frac{1}{5}e^{5x} + G(0)right) To find G(0), we can plug in x = 0: 0^2 = e^{0}left(frac{1}{5}e^{0} + G(0)right) Rightarrow G(0) = -frac{1}{5} Now, we can write the final solution for U(z, bar{z}): U(z, bar{z}) = e^{-3z}left(int e^{5z+3bar{z}} dz - frac{1}{5}right) Finally, we can convert back to the original variables u(x, y): u(x, y) = e^{-3(x+iy)}left(int e^{5(x+iy)+3(x-iy)} dx - frac{1}{5}right) This is the solution to the given partial differential equation with the initial condition u(x,0) = x^2."},{"instruction":"ere is an example numerical problem for a math student studying Complex analysis of partial differential equations:  Consider the partial differential equation: frac{partial u}{partial x} + ifrac{partial u}{partial y} = 2z where z = x + yi and u(x,y) is a function of two real variables.

Let u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y). Then, the PDE becomes: X''(x)Y(y) + 4X(x)Y''(y) = 0. Now, divide both sides by X(x)Y(y) to separate the variables: frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -4frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)}. Since the left side depends only on x and the right side depends only on y, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let this constant be -k^2: frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -k^2 and -4frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = -k^2. Now, we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs): 1) X''(x) + k^2X(x) = 0, 2) Y''(y) - frac{k^2}{4}Y(y) = 0. Solve the first ODE: X(x) = Acos(kx) + Bsin(kx). Solve the second ODE: Y(y) = Ccosh(frac{k}{2}y) + Dsinh(frac{k}{2}y). Now, we have the general solution of the PDE: u(x, y) = (Acos(kx) + Bsin(kx))(Ccosh(frac{k}{2}y) + Dsinh(frac{k}{2}y)). Apply the initial conditions: 1) u(x, 0) = (Acos(kx) + Bsin(kx))(C) = 0. Since this must hold for all x, we have C = 0. Thus, the general solution becomes: u(x, y) = (Acos(kx) + Bsin(kx))(Dsinh(frac{k}{2}y)). 2) u_y(x, 0) = (Acos(kx) + Bsin(kx))(Dfrac{k}{2}cosh(0)) = sin(3x). Since cosh(0) = 1, we have: (Acos(kx) + Bsin(kx))(Dfrac{k}{2}) = sin(3x). Now, we need to find A, B, and D such that this equation holds for all x. We can do this by using Fourier sine series: sin(3x) = sum_{n=1}^{infty} b_n sin(nkx), where b_n = frac{2}{L}int_{0}^{L} f(x)sin(frac{npi x}{L}) dx and L is the period of the function. Since the given function has a period of 2pi, we have L = 2pi and k = frac{pi}{L} = frac{1}{2}. Thus, the Fourier sine series becomes: sin(3x) = sum_{n=1}^{infty} b_n sin(frac{npi x}{2}). Now, we need to find the coefficients b_n: b_n = frac{1}{pi}int_{0}^{2pi} sin(3x)sin(frac{npi x}{2}) dx. For n = 6, we have: b_6 = frac{1}{pi}int_{0}^{2pi} sin(3x)sin(3x) dx = frac{1}{pi}int_{0}^{2pi} frac{1}{2}(1 - cos(6x)) dx = frac{1}{2}. For n neq 6, we have: b_n = frac{1}{pi}int_{0}^{2pi} sin(3x)sin(frac{npi x}{2}) dx = 0. Thus, the Fourier sine series becomes: sin(3x) = frac{1}{2}sin(3frac{pi x}{2}). Comparing this with the equation (Acos(kx) + Bsin(kx))(Dfrac{k}{2}) = sin(3x), we have: A = 0, B = 1, D = frac{1}{k} = 2.

The function e^{2z} is analytic everywhere, so we only need to find the singularities of the function z^2 + 4z. This function has two singularities at z = 0 and z = -4. Since the contour gamma is a circle of radius 3 centered at the origin, only the singularity at z = 0 is inside the contour. Now, let's find the residue of f(z) at z = 0. To do this, we can use the following formula for the residue of a function f(z) at a simple pole z = z_0: text{Res}(f(z), z_0) = lim_{z to z_0} (z - z_0) f(z) In our case, z_0 = 0, so we have: text{Res}(f(z), 0) = lim_{z to 0} (z - 0) (z^2 + 4z) e^{2z} = lim_{z to 0} z(z + 4) e^{2z} Since e^{2z} is nonzero for all z, we can evaluate the limit by simply evaluating the polynomial part: lim_{z to 0} z(z + 4) = 0 Thus, the residue of f(z) at z = 0 is 0.

Now, divide both sides by X(x)Y(y): frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = frac{2e^{2x}cos(y)}{X(x)Y(y)}. Since the left side is a function of x only and the right side is a function of x and y, we can separate the equation into two ordinary differential equations (ODEs): frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = 2e^{2x} + lambda and frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = cos(y) - lambda, where lambda is a separation constant. Now, let's solve the ODEs. For the X(x) equation: X''(x) - (2e^{2x} + lambda)X(x) = 0. This is a linear homogeneous ODE with variable coefficients, which is difficult to solve analytically.

Dividing by e^{ax}, we have: a^2 - 2e^{2x} - lambda = 0. Since this equation must hold for all x, we must have a^2 = lambda. Thus, X(x) = e^{sqrt{lambda}x}. Now, let's solve the Y(y) equation: Y''(y) - (cos(y) - lambda)Y(y) = 0. This is a Sturm-Liouville problem. We can solve it using the eigenfunction expansion method.

Substituting this into the PDE, we get: X(x)Y(y)frac{dT(t)}{dt} = X''(x)Y(y)T(t) + iX(x)Y''(y)T(t). Now, we divide both sides by X(x)Y(y)T(t): frac{1}{T(t)}frac{dT(t)}{dt} = frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + ifrac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)}. Since the left-hand side is a function of t only and the right-hand side is a function of x and y only, both sides must be equal to a constant. We denote this constant by -k^2: frac{1}{T(t)}frac{dT(t)}{dt} = -k^2. Now, we have two separate ODEs: frac{dT(t)}{dt} = -k^2T(t), X''(x) + k^2X(x) = 0, Y''(y) - ik^2Y(y) = 0. The first ODE has the solution: T(t) = e^{-k^2t}. The second ODE has the solution: X(x) = Asin(kx) + Bcos(kx). Applying the boundary conditions u(0, y, t) = u(pi, y, t) = 0, we get B = 0 and k = n for n = 1, 2, 3, dots. Thus, X_n(x) = A_nsin(nx). The third ODE has the solution: Y(y) = Csinh(frac{k}{2}y) + Dcosh(frac{k}{2}y). Applying the boundary conditions u(x, 0, t) = u(x, pi, t) = 0, we get D = 0 and Y_n(y) = C_nsinh(frac{n}{2}(y - pi)).  Now, we have the general solution: u(x, y, t) = sum_{n=1}^infty a_n e^{-n^2t} sin(nx) sinhleft(frac{n}{2}(y-pi)right), where a_n = A_nC_n. To find the constants a_n, we use the initial condition u(x, y, 0) = e^{-x^2 - y^2}. This gives: e^{-x^2 - y^2} = sum_{n=1}^infty a_n sin(nx) sinhleft(frac{n}{2}(y-pi)right). We can find the coefficients a_n by multiplying both sides by sin(mx) and integrating from 0 to pi: int_0^pi e^{-x^2 - y^2} sin(mx) dx = sum_{n=1}^infty a_n int_0^pi sin(nx) sin(mx) dx sinhleft(frac{n}{2}(y-pi)right). The integral on the right-hand side is non-zero only when m = n, and its value is frac{pi}{2} for m = n. Thus, a_n = frac{2}{pi} int_0^pi e^{-x^2 - y^2} sin(nx) dx.

Substituting the expression for u(x, y), we get: 6 - frac{partial^4 u}{partial x^4}y^2 - 4frac{partial^2 u}{partial y^2} = 0 Since u(0, y) = 0, we have frac{partial^4 u}{partial x^4}y^2 = 0. Thus, frac{partial^2 u}{partial y^2} = frac{3}{2}. Integrating twice with respect to y, we get: u(x, y) = 3x^2 - frac{3}{2}y^2 Now, we can find v(x, y) using the expression v(x, y) = frac{partial u}{partial x}y. Differentiating u(x, y) with respect to x, we get: frac{partial u}{partial x} = 6x So, v(x, y) = 6xy.

Given u(z) = e^z sin(2pi z), we want to find the real-valued function f(x,y) such that u(z) = f(x,y) + i g(x,y). To do this, we can separate the real and imaginary parts of u(z).

We will map the rectangle [0, 1] x [0, 1] to the upper half-plane and find a harmonic function there that satisfies the transformed boundary conditions. First, we need to find a conformal mapping from the rectangle to the upper half-plane. One such mapping is given by the Schwarz-Christoffel formula: w = f(z) = int^z frac{1}{(1 - zeta^2)^{1/2}} dzeta This maps the rectangle to the upper half-plane with the corners of the rectangle mapped to 0, 1, ∞, and -1. The mapping preserves angles and maps the boundary of the rectangle to the real axis. Now, we need to find a harmonic function in the upper half-plane that satisfies the transformed boundary conditions. Let's denote the transformed function as v(w) = u(f^{-1}(w)). The boundary conditions become: v(w) = 0 for w = 0, 1 v(w) = Re(w) for w on the real axis and 0 < w < 1 v(w) = Re(w) - 1 for w on the real axis and 1 < w We can use the method of images to find a harmonic function that satisfies these conditions. Consider the function: v(w) = Re(w) - Re(frac{1}{w}) - Re(frac{1}{w - 1}) This function is harmonic in the upper half-plane and satisfies the boundary conditions. Now, we need to find the inverse of the conformal mapping to obtain the solution u(x, y) in the original coordinates. The inverse mapping is given by: z = f^{-1}(w) = sin(frac{pi w}{2}) Thus, the solution to the PDE is: u(x, y) = v(f^{-1}(x + iy)) = Re(sin(frac{pi (x + iy)}{2})) - Re(frac{1}{sin(frac{pi (x + iy)}{2})}) - Re(frac{1}{sin(frac{pi (x + iy)}{2}) - 1}) Simplifying the expression, we get: u(x, y) = sin(frac{pi x}{2})cosh(frac{pi y}{2}) - frac{sin(frac{pi x}{2})cosh(frac{pi y}{2})}{sin^2(frac{pi x}{2}) + sinh^2(frac{pi y}{2})} - frac{sin(frac{pi x}{2})cosh(frac{pi y}{2})}{(sin(frac{pi x}{2}) - 1)^2 + sinh^2(frac{pi y}{2})} This is the solution to the given PDE using complex analysis techniques."},{"instruction":"A math student is asked to solve the following partial differential equation: ∂u/∂x + 2i∂u/∂y = 3x + 4yi where u = u(x, y) and i is the imaginary unit.

Since the flow is irrotational, we know that: ∂ψ/∂x = Im(∂f/∂y) = 2x + cos(x)sinh(y) ∂ψ/∂y = -Re(∂f/∂x) = -2y + sin(x)cosh(y) Now, we can integrate these equations to find ψ(x, y): ψ(x, y) = ∫(2x + cos(x)sinh(y)) dx = x² + sin(x)sinh(y) + C(y) To find C(y), we differentiate ψ(x, y) with respect to y and compare it to the given ∂ψ/∂y: ∂ψ/∂y = cos(x)cosh(y) + C'(y) = -2y + sin(x)cosh(y) Comparing the two expressions, we find that C'(y) = -2y, so C(y) = -y² + K, where K is a constant. Thus, the stream function ψ(x, y) is given by: ψ(x, y) = x² + sin(x)sinh(y) - y² + K Finally, let's find the harmonic conjugate of f(z). A harmonic conjugate, g(z), satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations: ∂f/∂x = ∂g/∂y ∂f/∂y = -∂g/∂x Using the partial derivatives of f(z) we found earlier: ∂g/∂y = 2x - sin(x)cosh(y) -∂g/∂x = 2y + cos(x)sinh(y) Integrating the first equation with respect to y, we get: g(z) = 2xy - sin(x)cosh(y) + C(x) Now, differentiating g(z) with respect to x and comparing it to the second equation: ∂g/∂x = 2y - cos(x)cosh(y) + C'(x) = -2y - cos(x)sinh(y) Comparing the two expressions, we find that C'(x) = -cos(x)sinh(y) - cos(x)cosh(y), so C(x) = -sin(x)sinh(y) + K', where K' is a constant.

This PDE is the Cauchy-Riemann equation for the function u(z, bar{z}). Since the PDE is satisfied by analytic functions, we can write u(z, bar{z}) as the sum of an analytic function f(z) and its complex conjugate bar{f}(bar{z}): u(z, bar{z}) = f(z) + bar{f}(bar{z}) Now, we apply the given boundary conditions to determine the functions f(z) and bar{f}(bar{z}).  1. u(0, y) = e^{-y}: When x = 0, we have z = iy and bar{z} = -iy. Thus, u(z, bar{z}) = f(iy) + bar{f}(-iy) = e^{-y} 2. u(x, 0) = e^{-x}: When y = 0, we have z = x and bar{z} = x. Thus, u(z, bar{z}) = f(x) + bar{f}(x) = e^{-x} Now, we can find f(z) and bar{f}(bar{z}) by solving the above two equations simultaneously. We can write: f(z) = frac{1}{2}(u(z, bar{z}) - bar{f}(bar{z})) Substituting the boundary conditions, we get: f(iy) = frac{1}{2}(e^{-y} - bar{f}(-iy)) and f(x) = frac{1}{2}(e^{-x} - bar{f}(x)) Since f(z) is an analytic function, it must satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations. Therefore, we can write: f'(z) = frac{partial f}{partial x} = -i frac{partial f}{partial y} Integrating this equation with respect to z, we obtain: f(z) = -i int f'(z) dz + C where C is the constant of integration.

The theorem states that for a function that is analytic inside and on a simple closed contour C except for a finite number of singular points inside C, the integral of the function over the contour is equal to 2πi times the sum of the residues of the function at its singular points inside C. First, let's find the singular points of f(z) by finding the points where the denominator is zero: (z + 1)(z + 2) = 0 This gives us two singular points: z = -1 and z = -2.

The point z = -1 is on the contour, and the point z = -2 is outside the contour. Therefore, we only need to consider the residue at z = -1. To find the residue of f(z) at z = -1, we can use the following formula for simple poles: Res[f(z), z] = lim(z->z0) [(z - z0) * f(z)] In our case, z0 = -1, so we have: Res[f(z), z] = lim(z->-1) [(z + 1) * (z^3 / (z + 1)(z + 2))] The (z + 1) term cancels out, leaving: Res[f(z), z] = lim(z->-1) [z^3 / (z + 2)] Now, we can evaluate the limit: Res[f(z), z] = (-1)^3 / (-1 + 2) = -1 / 1 = -1 Now, we can use the Cauchy's Residue theorem to find the integral of f(z) over the contour C: ∮C f(z) dz = 2πi * (sum of residues inside C) = 2πi * (-1) = -2πi."},{"instruction":"ere's a question for the math student to solve: Consider the integral equation given by: int_{-pi}^{pi} frac{1}{2a - cos(x)} f(x) dx = 1, where a in mathbb{R} and f(x) is an unknown function.

We can rewrite the integrand as: frac{1}{2a - frac{1}{2}(z + frac{1}{z})} f(z) frac{dz}{iz} = frac{1}{z(2a - z - frac{1}{z})} f(z) dz. Now, let's consider the poles of the integrand.

Thus, the contour integral is equal to: 2pi i left(frac{1}{2a} f(0) + frac{1}{2a - 1} f(2a - 1)right). For the contour integral to be nonzero, we must have: frac{1}{2a} f(0) + frac{1}{2a - 1} f(2a - 1) neq 0.

Thus, the function f(z) is analytic everywhere in the complex plane, and the integral equation is satisfied for all z in mathbb{C}. To find the explicit form of f(z), we can use the fact that the function 1/(t - z) has a simple pole at t = z. Thus, we can write  frac{1}{t - z} = frac{A}{t - z} + B  for some constants A and B.

To do this, we will substitute z = 1/2 into the integral equation. Since |1/2| ≠ 1, we need to find a value of θ such that e^(iθ) = 1/2. We can do this by setting θ = π: f(e^(iπ)) = e^(iπ) + (2/π) ∫︀(0)^(2π) ln|e^(iπ) − e^(it)|f(e^(it))dt Now, we have: f(-1) = -1 + (2/π) ∫︀(0)^(2π) ln|-1 − e^(it)|f(e^(it))dt To evaluate the integral, we will use the property of logarithms that ln|a - b| = ln|b - a|. This allows us to rewrite the integral as: f(-1) = -1 + (2/π) ∫︀(0)^(2π) ln|e^(it) + 1|f(e^(it))dt Now, we will use the substitution u = e^(it) + 1.

Using the Cauchy integral formula, we can write g(z) as follows: g(z) = frac{1}{2pi i}int_{|w|=1} frac{g(w)}{w-z}dw Now, let's substitute the expression for g(z) from the given equation: 1 + z^2 - f(z) = frac{1}{2pi i}int_{|w|=1} frac{1 + w^2 - f(w)}{w-z}dw Rearranging the terms, we get: f(z) = 1 + z^2 - frac{1}{2pi i}int_{|w|=1} frac{1 + w^2 - f(w)}{w-z}dw Now, let's consider the integral on the right-hand side: int_{|w|=1} frac{1 + w^2 - f(w)}{w-z}dw = int_{-pi}^{pi} frac{1 + e^{2itheta} - f(e^{itheta})}{e^{itheta}-z}ie^{itheta}dtheta Comparing this with the integral in the given equation, we have: frac{1}{2pi}int_{-pi}^{pi} frac{1}{1+zcostheta}f(e^{itheta})dtheta = frac{1}{2pi i}int_{-pi}^{pi} frac{1 + e^{2itheta} - f(e^{itheta})}{e^{itheta}-z}ie^{itheta}dtheta Now, we can equate the integrands: frac{1}{1+zcostheta}f(e^{itheta}) = frac{1 + e^{2itheta} - f(e^{itheta})}{e^{itheta}-z}ie^{itheta} Multiplying both sides by 1+zcostheta and simplifying, we get: f(e^{itheta}) = (1+zcostheta)(1 + e^{2itheta} - f(e^{itheta}))ie^{itheta} Now, let's plug in z=0: f(e^{itheta}) = (1)(1 + e^{2itheta} - f(e^{itheta}))ie^{itheta} Since f(0) = -1, we have: -1 = (1)(1 - 1)ie^{itheta} This implies that f(e^{itheta}) = 0 for all theta in [-pi, pi]. Now, let's plug this back into the equation for f(z): f(z) = 1 + z^2 - frac{1}{2pi}int_{-pi}^{pi} frac{1}{1+zcostheta}(0)dtheta This simplifies to: f(z) = 1 + z^2 Thus, the solution to the given complex integral equation is f(z) = 1 + z^2."},{"instruction":"ere is a problem for a math student to solve in complex analysis of integral equations: Consider the integral equation given by: f(z) = 1 + 2z + λ∫₀¹ (z+t)f(t)dt where λ is a complex constant.

(b) For λ = -1/4, find the unique analytic solution f(z) that satisfies f(0) = 1.","output":"(a) To find the values of λ for which there is a unique analytic solution f(z) in D, we will use the Banach fixed-point theorem (also known as the contraction mapping theorem). We need to show that the operator T, defined by (Tf)(z) = 1 + 2z + λ∫₀¹ (z+t)f(t)dt, is a contraction on the space of analytic functions on D. Let f and g be two analytic functions on D. Then, we have |(Tf)(z) - (Tg)(z)| = |λ∫₀¹ (z+t)(f(t)-g(t))dt|. Using the triangle inequality, we get |(Tf)(z) - (Tg)(z)| ≤ |λ|∫₀¹ |z+t||f(t)-g(t)|dt. Since f and g are analytic on D, they are continuous on the closed unit disk, and so is their difference. Thus, there exists a constant M such that |f(t)-g(t)| ≤ M for all t in [0,1]. Also, |z+t| ≤ |z|+|t| < 1+1 = 2 for all z in D and t in [0,1]. Therefore, |(Tf)(z) - (Tg)(z)| ≤ 2|λ|M∫₀¹ dt = 2|λ|M. Now, if 2|λ| < 1, then T is a contraction, and by the Banach fixed-point theorem, there exists a unique analytic solution f(z) in D. So, the values of λ for which there is a unique analytic solution f(z) in D are those with |λ| < 1/2. (b) For λ = -1/4, we will find the unique analytic solution f(z) that satisfies f(0) = 1. We have f(z) = 1 + 2z - (1/4)∫₀¹ (z+t)f(t)dt. Let's differentiate both sides with respect to z: f'(z) = 2 - (1/4)∫₀¹ f(t)dt. Since f(0) = 1, we can integrate both sides with respect to z from 0 to z: ∫₀ᶻ f'(w)dw = ∫₀ᶻ (2 - (1/4)∫₀¹ f(t)dt)dw. This gives us f(z) - f(0) = 2z - (1/4)z∫₀¹ f(t)dt. Since f(0) = 1, we have f(z) = 1 + 2z - (1/4)z∫₀¹ f(t)dt. Now, let's find the value of the integral ∫₀¹ f(t)dt. We know that f(t) = 1 + 2t - (1/4)t∫₀¹ f(u)du. So, ∫₀¹ f(t)dt = ∫₀¹ (1 + 2t - (1/4)t∫₀¹ f(u)du)dt. Let I = ∫₀¹ f(t)dt. Then, I = ∫₀¹ dt + 2∫₀¹ tdt - (1/4)∫₀¹ tIdt = 1 + 1/2 - (1/4)I∫₀¹ tdt. Thus, (3/4)I = 3/2, and I = 2.

Differentiate twice and substitute into the equation: -Ecos(x) - Fsin(x) + n^2(Ecos(x) + Fsin(x)) = sin(x) Comparing coefficients, we get: -E + n^2E = 0 -F + n^2F = 1 Solving for E and F, we find: E = 0 F = frac{1}{n^2 - 1} for n neq 1 Thus, the particular solution is: X_p(x) = frac{sin(x)}{n^2 - 1} for n neq 1 Now, the general solution to the inhomogeneous equation is: X_n(x) = C_ncos(nx) + D_nsin(nx) + frac{sin(x)}{n^2 - 1} for n neq 1 Apply the boundary conditions u(0, y) = u(pi, y) = 0: X_n(0) = C_n = 0 X_n(pi) = D_nsin(npi) + frac{sin(pi)}{n^2 - 1} = 0 Since sin(npi) = 0 for all integer values of n, the boundary conditions are satisfied. The overall solution is: u(x, y) = sum_{n=2}^{infty} left(D_nsin(nx) + frac{sin(x)}{n^2 - 1}right)cos(ny) To find the coefficients D_n, we can use the boundary condition u(x, 0) = cos(x): cos(x) = sum_{n=2}^{infty} D_nsin(nx) We can find D_n using the orthogonality of sine functions: D_n = frac{2}{pi} int_0^{pi} cos(x)sin(nx) dx Evaluating the integral, we get: D_n = frac{(-1)^{n+1} - 1}{npi} for n neq 1 Finally, the solution to the boundary value problem is: u(x, y) = sum_{n=2}^{infty} left(frac{(-1)^{n+1} - 1}{npi}sin(nx) + frac{sin(x)}{n^2 - 1}right)cos(ny)"},{"instruction":"Given that the sequence {a_n} is a geometric sequence, and a_2a_6+2a_4^2=pi, then tan(a_3a_5)=　　() A: sqrt{3} B: sqrt{3} C: frac{sqrt{3}}{3} D: pmsqrt{3}","output":"From the properties of the geometric sequence {a_n}, we have: a_2a_6=a_3a_5=a_4^2,   therefore a_2a_6+2a_4^2=pi=3a_3a_5,   therefore a_3a_5= frac{pi}{3}.

From the definition of an arithmetic sequence and necessary and sufficient conditions, 2b = a + c implies b - a = c - b, which means a, b, c form an arithmetic sequence. Conversely, if a, b, c form an arithmetic sequence, then b - a = c - b, which can be written as 2b = a + c. Thus, statement 3 is true. 4. Given tan A tan B > 1, we have A and B as acute angles. This leads to sin A sin B > cos A cos B, implying cos(A + B) < 0. Consequently, cos C > 0, meaning angle C is acute. Therefore, triangle ABC is an acute triangle. Conversely, if triangle ABC is an acute triangle, then A + B > frac{pi}{2}, leading to cos(A + B) < 0. This implies cos A cos B < sin A sin B. Since A and B are acute angles, we have cos A > 0 and cos B > 0, which results in tan A tan B > 1. Thus, statement 4 is true.

The radius of the circle is 5 units. 3. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**: In the right triangle formed by the radius and the perpendicular dropped, we have:    [    (text{radius})^2 = (text{perpendicular})^2 + (text{other leg})^2 implies 5^2 = 2^2 + (text{other leg})^2 implies 25 = 4 + (text{other leg})^2.    ]    Solving for the other leg, we get:    [    (text{other leg})^2 = 21 implies text{other leg} = sqrt{21}.    ]    This confirms that each side of the rectangle is intersected by the circle, forming intersections outside the width but within the length. 4. **Calculate the Area of the Sectors**: The circle's intersections with the rectangle form four quarter-circle sectors at the rectangle's corners, each with a central angle of 90^circ. The area of each sector is:    [    text{Area of sector} = frac{90^circ}{360^circ} times pi times 5^2 = frac{1}{4} times 25pi = frac{25pi}{4}.    ]    Therefore, the total area of the four sectors is:    [    4 times frac{25pi}{4} = 25pi.    ] 5. **Calculate the Area of Rectangle Inside the Circle**: The rectangle is entirely enclosed within the circle. Thus, the area common to both the rectangle and the circle is the area of the rectangle, which is:    [    text{Area of rectangle} = 10 times 4 = 40.    ] Since the entire rectangle is within the circle, the common area is the area of the rectangle: 40 square units.

Each solution maps uniquely to a non-solution pair. 8. **Counting Argument**:    There are (2^n) possible sets of variables since each (X_i) can be either 0 or 1.

The faster cows eat at a 30% faster rate, so each of them eats at a rate of R + 0.3R = 1.3R bags/day.

The volume of a cube is given by the formula ( V = s^3 ), where ( s ) is the side length of the cube. Since both cubes are made of the same metal, their densities are the same. Therefore, the weight of the cube is directly proportional to its volume. This means that the ratio of their weights is equal to the ratio of their volumes. Given that the first cube weighs 8 pounds and the second cube weighs 64 pounds, the ratio of their weights is ( frac{64}{8} = 8 ). Now, let's express the volumes of the cubes in terms of their side lengths: ( V_1 = s_1^3 ) for the first cube, ( V_2 = s_2^3 ) for the second cube. The ratio of their volumes is: ( frac{V_2}{V_1} = frac{s_2^3}{s_1^3} ). Since the ratio of their weights is equal to the ratio of their volumes, we have: ( 8 = frac{s_2^3}{s_1^3} ). To find the ratio of the side lengths, we take the cube root of both sides: ( sqrt[3]{8} = frac{s_2}{s_1} ). ( 2 = frac{s_2}{s_1} ).

Recall that:    [ sin x = frac{e^{ix} - e^{-ix}}{2i} ]    Therefore, the sum can be written as:    [ sum_{k=1}^{n-1} sin(ka) = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} frac{e^{ika} - e^{-ika}}{2i} ] 2. **Simplify the Sum:**    [ sum_{k=1}^{n-1} sin(ka) = frac{1}{2i} left( sum_{k=1}^{n-1} e^{ika} - sum_{k=1}^{n-1} e^{-ika} right) ] 3. **Geometric Series:**    Each of these sums is a geometric series. For the first sum:    [ sum_{k=1}^{n-1} e^{ika} = e^{ia} + e^{i2a} + cdots + e^{i(n-1)a} ]    This is a geometric series with the first term ( e^{ia} ) and common ratio ( e^{ia} ).

The length of one arch of a cycloid generated by a circle of radius ( r ) is given by:    [ L = 8r ]    This is because the length of one arch of a cycloid is equal to the circumference of the generating circle plus the distance traveled by the center of the circle, which is ( 2pi r + 2pi r = 4pi r ). 2. **Considering an ( n )-gon:**    If we approximate the circle by an ( n )-gon, each side of the ( n )-gon will roll along the horizontal path, and the point on the circumference will trace out a series of line segments. As ( n ) approaches infinity, the ( n )-gon approaches the circle, and the path traced out approaches the cycloid. 3. **Conclusion:**    Therefore, the length of the curve described by a point on the circumference of the wheel is indeed four times the diameter of the wheel.

Since the midpoint of AB is given as (frac{1}{2}, -1), we can deduce that: frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} = frac{1}{2} qquad text{and} qquad frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} = -1 Simplifying these equations, we obtain: x_1 + x_2 = 1 qquad text{and} qquad y_1 + y_2 = -2 Additionally, since both points A and B lie on the hyperbola, their coordinates must satisfy the given equation of the hyperbola. Therefore, we have: frac{x_1^2}{4} - frac{y_1^2}{2} = 1 qquad text{and} qquad frac{x_2^2}{4} - frac{y_2^2}{2} = 1 Subtracting these two equations, we can find the slope of line l: frac{x_1^2 - x_2^2}{4} = frac{y_1^2 - y_2^2}{2} frac{y_1 - y_2}{x_1 - x_2} = frac{1}{2} cdot frac{x_1 + x_2}{y_1 + y_2} Using the values we derived earlier, x_1 + x_2 = 1 and y_1 + y_2 = -2, we can find the slope of line l as: frac{y_1 - y_2}{x_1 - x_2} = -frac{1}{4} Now, we can use the slope-point form to find the equation of line l: y - (-1) = -frac{1}{4}(x - frac{1}{2}) Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x + 8y + 7 = 0 Therefore, the equation of line l is boxed{2x + 8y + 7 = 0}."},{"instruction":"Which of the following four characters can be considered as symmetrical figures?

Thus, it is not a symmetrical figure. - For option C (惠), similarly, we inspect the character and conclude that there is no straight line that allows for perfect overlapping of both sides upon folding. Therefore, it is not a symmetrical figure. - For option D (州), upon examination, it becomes clear that this character also lacks a straight line that would enable it to be folded in such a way that both sides overlap exactly. Hence, it is not a symmetrical figure. - For option A (幸), when we look at the character, we can indeed find a straight line along which the character can be folded, resulting in the parts on both sides of the line overlapping each other perfectly. This indicates that it is a symmetrical figure. Given these observations, we conclude that only the character in option A meets the criteria for being a symmetrical figure.

(n+1)!  n! = n^2 + n^4).","output":"Let's break down the given equation step-by-step to find all natural number solutions for ( n ). The given equation is: (n+2)! - (n+1)! - n! = n^2 + n^4. 1. **Rewrite Factorials in a Simplified Form:**    The factorial terms in the equation can be rewritten using their definitions. We know that:    - ((n+2)! = (n+2)(n+1)n!)    - ((n+1)! = (n+1)n!)    Substituting these into the equation gives:        (n+2)(n+1)n! - (n+1)n! - n! = n^2 + n^4. 2. **Factor Out the Common Term ( n! ):**    By factorizing ( n! ) out of the left side of the equation, we get:         n!left[(n+2)(n+1) - (n+1) - 1right] = n^2 + n^4.        Simplify the expression in brackets:        (n+2)(n+1) - (n+1) - 1 = n^2 + 3n + 2 - n - 1 = n^2 + 2n + 1.    Thus, the equation reduces to:         n!(n^2 + 2n + 1) = n^2(n^2 + 1). 3. **Solve the Simplified Equation:**    We now have:     n!(n+1)^2 = n^2(n^2 + 1).    Consider ( n = 1 ):    - ( (n+1)^2 = 2^2 = 4 ),    - ( n! = 1! = 1 ),    - ( n^2(n^2 + 1) = 1^2(1^2 + 1) = 1 cdot 2 = 2. )    So, ( 4 neq 2 ). Hence, ( n = 1 ) is not a solution. 4. **Solve for ( n > 1 ):**    Let ( n > 1 ). Rewrite the simplified equation:         (n+1)^2 = frac{n^2(n^2 + 1)}{n!}.     Since ((n+1)^2) is an integer, ensure the right-hand side is also an integer. Check for small values of ( n ):    - For ( n = 2 ):      - ( (n+1)^2 = 3^2 = 9 ),      - ( n! = 2! = 2 ),      - ( n^2(n^2 + 1) = 4(4 + 1) = 20 ),      - Equation: ( frac{20}{2} = 10 ), but ( 9 neq 10 ).      So, ( n = 2 ) is not a solution.        - For ( n = 3 ):      - ( (n+1)^2 = 4^2 = 16 ),      - ( n! = 3! = 6 ),      - ( n^2(n^2 + 1) = 9(9 + 1) = 90 ),      - Equation: ( frac{90}{6} = 15 ), but ( 16 neq 15 ).      So, ( n = 3 ) is not a correct solution. 5. **Cross-check and Conclude:**    The valid solution process and checks indicate ( n = 4 ) and higher do not satisfy factorial growing factorially faster than polynomial exponentially, so no other valid smaller n are solved manually.

This problem can be approached using the Stars and Bars method. Let the balls be represented as stars (*), and the dividers that separate the boxes as bars (|).

The problem now is to count all the possible permutations of 6 stars and 2 bars, with the bars being indistinguishable, and the stars also being indistinguishable among themselves.

Therefore, ((m, n) = (k, k)) for any positive integer (k) is a solution. 2. **Case (m neq n)**:    - Assume (m > n). Without loss of generality, let (b > a). We need (a^n + b^n mid a^m + b^m).    - This implies (a^n + b^n mid b^m - (-a)^m). Since (a) and (b) are relatively prime, (gcd(a^n + b^n, b) = 1).

Since the line AF has the equation x = 1, the intersection point M of line l and AF is Mleft(1, frac{12 - 3x_0}{4y_0}right), and the intersection point N of line l and x = 4 is Nleft(4, frac{3(4 - x_0)}{y_0}right). Thus, we have frac{|MF|^2}{|NF|^2} = frac{left(frac{12 - 3x_0}{4y_0}right)^2}{9 + left(frac{3(4 - x_0)}{y_0}right)^2} = frac{(4 - x_0)^2}{16y_0^2 + 16(1 - x_0)^2}. Since P(x_0, y_0) is a point on C, we have frac{x_0^2}{4} + frac{y_0^2}{3} = 1. Therefore, y_0^2 = 3 - frac{3x_0^2}{4}. Substituting this into the above equation, we get frac{|MF|^2}{|NF|^2} = frac{(4 - x_0)^2}{48 - 12x_0^2 + 16 - 32x_0 + 16x_0^2} = frac{(4 - x_0)^2}{4(x_0^2 - 8x_0 + 16)} = frac{1}{4} cdot frac{(4 - x_0)^2}{(4 - x_0)^2} = frac{1}{4}, which implies frac{|MF|}{|NF|} = frac{1}{2}, and is a constant value, boxed{frac{1}{2}}."},{"instruction":"the Cartesian coordinate system, given fixed points A(0,sqrt{2}) and B(0,sqrt{2}), the product of the slopes of lines PA and PB is 2.

Let's consider the given equation:    [    x^3 + 2y^3 + 4z^3 - 6xyz = 0    ]    We need to prove that this equation does not have non-zero integer solutions. 2. Firstly, we note that if ((x, y, z)) is an integer solution, then for any integer (k), ((kx, ky, kz)) would also be a solution to the equation. This is because:    [    (kx)^3 + 2(ky)^3 + 4(kz)^3 - 6(kx)(ky)(kz) = k^3(x^3 + 2y^3 + 4z^3 - 6xyz) = 0    ]    Hence, if the equation has an integer solution, it could be scaled by any integer (k), preserving the solution property. 3.

Suppose ((x, y, z)) is a primitive solution such that ( text{gcd}(x, y, z) = 1 ). Analyze modulo properties to determine the nature of (x, y, z). 5. First, check the parity. Suppose (x) is odd:    [    x = 2x_0 quad text{where} quad x_0 in mathbb{Z}    ]    Substitute (x) into the equation:    [    (2x_0)^3 + 2y^3 + 4z^3 - 6(2x_0)yz = 0 implies 8x_0^3 + 2y^3 + 4z^3 - 12x_0yz = 0    ]    Divide the equation by 2:    [    4x_0^3 + y^3 + 2z^3 - 6x_0yz = 0    ]    Now analyze the parity of (y). Suppose (y) is even:    [    y = 2y_0 quad text{where} quad y_0 in mathbb{Z}    ]    Substitute (y) into the equation:    [    4x_0^3 + (2y_0)^3 + 2z^3 - 6x_0(2y_0)z = 0 implies 4x_0^3 + 8y_0^3 + 2z^3 - 12x_0y_0z = 0    ]    Divide the equation by 2:    [    2x_0^3 + 4y_0^3 + z^3 - 6x_0y_0z = 0    ] 6. Continue by analyzing the parity of (z). Suppose (z) is even:    [    z = 2z_0 quad text{where} quad z_0 in mathbb{Z}    ]    Substitute (z) into the equation:    [    2x_0^3 + 4y_0^3 + (2z_0)^3 - 6x_0y_0(2z_0) = 0 implies 2x_0^3 + 4y_0^3 + 8z_0^3 - 12x_0y_0z_0 = 0    ]    Divide the equation by 2:    [    x_0^3 + 2y_0^3 + 4z_0^3 - 6x_0y_0z_0 = 0    ]    We now have an equation similar to the original but with smaller prime factors and gcd still being 1. 7. The transformation (x = 2x_0), (y = 2y_0), (z = 2z_0) means if ((x, y, z)) were a solution, then ((x_0, y_0, z_0)) would be a solution too. Because gcd repeats similarly indefinitely, leading to smaller possible integers. 8.

Since we are assuming 4 weeks in each month, the total number of weeks in 6 months would be: 6 months * 4 weeks/month = 24 weeks Total savings over 6 months: Total weekly contribution * Number of weeks = 560 * 24 = 13,440 The couple decides to divide half of their savings among their four children.

To find the extremum, we differentiate f(x) with respect to x to get f'(x) = e^x - e.  We analyze the sign of f'(x): - When x < 1, f'(x) < 0; the function is decreasing. - When x > 1, f'(x) > 0; the function is increasing. Therefore, the function f(x) is monotonically decreasing on (-infty, 1) and monotonically increasing on (1, +infty), which implies that the extremum occurs at x=1. At x=1, we have the minimum value f(1) = e^1 - ecdot1 - e = -e. Hence, the function f(x) has no maximum value and its minimum is boxed{-e}. (Ⅱ) To determine the range of a for which f(x) geq 0 for all x, we again look at f'(x) but without substituting a specific value for a. If a < 0, f'(x) > 0, the function f(x) is strictly increasing. As x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches negative infinity, which does not satisfy the condition f(x) geq 0.  If a=0, then f(x) = e^x, which is always nonnegative. Therefore, a=0 satisfies the condition. If a > 0, setting f'(x) = 0 gives us x = ln a: - When x < ln a, f'(x) < 0; the function is decreasing. - When x > ln a, f'(x) > 0; the function is increasing. Thus, the function f(x) has a minimum at x = ln a, and the value at this minimum is f(ln a) = e^{ln a} - a cdot ln a - a = a - a cdot ln a - a = -a cdot ln a. For the function to satisfy f(x) geq 0, -a cdot ln a geq 0 must hold, which implies 0 < a leq 1.

Substituting the coordinates of point P(1, -frac{3}{2}) into the equation of the ellipse, we get: frac{1^2}{2^2} + frac{left(-frac{3}{2}right)^2}{b^2} = 1 implies frac{1}{4} + frac{9}{4b^2} = 1.

Then ( 3^k equiv 1 pmod{4} ) and ( 5^k equiv 1 pmod{4} ) because any even power of an odd number is congruent to 1 modulo 4. Therefore, ( 3^k + 5^k equiv 1 + 1 equiv 2 pmod{4} ). However, 2 modulo 4 cannot be a power of an integer with an exponent greater than 1, as it would either have too many or too few factors of 2. Thus, ( k ) must be odd. 2. **Consider ( k ) modulo 16**:    - Since ( k ) is odd, we need to check ( 3^k + 5^k pmod{16} ). For odd ( k ), ( 3^k equiv 3 pmod{16} ) and ( 5^k equiv 5 pmod{16} ). Therefore, ( 3^k + 5^k equiv 3 + 5 equiv 8 pmod{16} ). This implies that ( 3^k + 5^k ) must be a power of 2, specifically ( 2^3 = 8 ).

Hence, it must be the case that ( a_{2011} = 1 ). 2. We compare two numbers, ( a^{b^c} ) and ( b^{a^c} ), where ( a, b, ) and ( c ) are natural numbers, ( a neq b ), ( a geq 2 ), and ( b geq 2 ). Consider the expression:    [    b^{c} ln a - a^{c} ln b = a^{c} b^{c} left( a^{-c} ln a - b^{-c} ln b right)    ]    To determine when ( a^{-c} ln a > b^{-c} ln b ), we find the intervals of monotonicity of the function ( y = x^{-c} ln x ). 3. By differentiating ( y ):    [    y' = -c x^{-c-1} ln x + x^{-c-1} = x^{-c-1} (1 - c ln x)    ]    We see that ( y' > 0 ) when ( 0 < x < e^{1/c} ) and ( y' < 0 ) when ( x > e^{1/c} ). So, the function ( y = x^{-c} ln x ) is increasing on ( 0 < x < e^{1/c} ) and decreasing on ( x > e^{1/c} ). 4.

However, the female tiger cannot be fed immediately after the male lion, so there are 5 possible choices for the next feed. For each subsequent choice, the count reduces by 1 of the opposite gender, respecting the restriction that a tiger cannot follow a lion.  Let's calculate the total possibilities: - Feeding starts with 1 male lion. - 5 options for the first female (excluding the female tiger). - After the first female (which wasn't a tiger), all 5 remaining males can be fed (including the male tiger, since he is not following a lion). - For each of these, 4 remaining females can be fed next (since now the female tiger can also be fed, provided she isn't following a male lion). - This pattern continues, and for each pair, the number of options decreases by one.

(1) Find the perimeter of triangle AF_{1}F_{2};   (2) If line l passes through the right vertex of Gamma, find the equation of line l;   (3) Let point D lie on the line y=2, O be the origin, and OAperp OD. Prove that line AD is tangent to circle C.","output":"# Solution:  Part (1): Finding the Perimeter of triangle AF_{1}F_{2} Given the ellipse Gamma: frac{{x}^{2}}{4}+frac{{y}^{2}}{2}=1, we identify the parameters of the ellipse as follows: - The length of the semi-major axis a = sqrt{4} = 2. - The length of the semi-minor axis b = sqrt{2}. The distance between the foci 2c is determined by the relationship c^2 = a^2 - b^2. Substituting the values of a and b, we get: [c^2 = 4 - 2 = 2] [c = sqrt{2}] The sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the foci is 2a, and the distance between the foci is 2c. Therefore, for point A on Gamma: - |AF_{1}| + |AF_{2}| = 2a = 4. - |F_{1}F_{2}| = 2c = 2sqrt{2}. Thus, the perimeter of triangle AF_{1}F_{2} is: [4 + 2sqrt{2} = 4 + 2sqrt{2}] So, the perimeter of triangle AF_{1}F_{2} is boxed{4 + 2sqrt{2}}.  Part (2): Finding the Equation of Line l The right vertex of Gamma is at (2,0). Assuming line l passes through this point, its equation can be written as y = k(x - 2). Line l is tangent to the circle C: x^{2} + y^{2} = 2. The condition for tangency between a line and a circle is given by the formula frac{|ax_0 + by_0 + c|}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} = r, where (x_0, y_0) is the center of the circle and r is its radius. Applying this to our case, we get: [frac{|2k|}{sqrt{1 + k^2}} = sqrt{2}] Solving this equation for k, we find k = pmfrac{sqrt{2}}{2}. Therefore, the equation of line l is: [y = pmfrac{sqrt{2}}{2}(x - 2)] So, the equation of line l is boxed{y = pmfrac{sqrt{2}}{2}(x - 2)}.  Part (3): Proving Line AD is Tangent to Circle C Let A(x_{0},y_{0}) and D(m,2). Given OA perp OD, we have: [mx_{0} + 2y_{0} = 0] For m = x_{0}, this simplifies to x_{0}^2 + 2y_{0} = 0. Given A lies on Gamma, we use its equation to find: [frac{x_{0}^{2}}{4} + frac{y_{0}^{2}}{2} = 1] Solving these equations, we find y_{0} = -1 and x_{0} = pmsqrt{2}. Thus, the equation of line AD becomes x = pmsqrt{2}, which is tangent to circle C: x^{2} + y^{2} = 2. For m neq x_{0}, the equation of line AD is derived and the distance d from the origin O to line AD is calculated as sqrt{2}, confirming that line AD is tangent to circle C in all cases. Therefore, line AD is tangent to circle C, as required to prove."},{"instruction":"a conference with M participants, where M > 5, exactly two participants, Alex and Sam, have not shaken hands with each other.

If the tank is hit, it moves to an adjacent unit square (two squares are adjacent if they share a common side). The tank needs to be hit twice to be destroyed. Throughout the process, the bomber pilot has no knowledge of the tank's position or whether it has been hit. Find the minimum number of bombings required to ensure the tank is destroyed.","output":"Let us begin by considering a 41 times 41 battlefield, which is divided into 1681 individual unit squares. We must determine the minimum number of bombings required to guarantee the destruction of a tank hiding in one of these squares.  Step-by-Step Detailed Solution: 1. **Coloring the Battlefield:**    - Consider coloring the squares of the battlefield like a chessboard, alternating between black and white squares, such that the four corner squares are all black.    - Since the side length of the battlefield is 41, which is odd, there will be 21 times 21 = 441 black squares and 20 times 20 = 400 white squares (half of the squares of each color plus one extra line for one color - here black). 2. **Bombing Strategy:**    - First, bomb all the white squares.    - Then, bomb all the black squares.    - Finally, bomb all the white squares again. 3. **Calculation of Total Bombings:**    - Total number of squares is 41 times 41 = 1681.    - Number of white squares bombed: 41 times 21 = 861 in two rounds (each square counted once per round).    - Number of black squares bombed: 441.        Therefore, the total number of bombings is:    [    861 + 441 + 861 = 2163    ] 4. **Minimum Bombings Analysis:**    - We need to prove that bombing fewer than this won't guarantee capturing the tank twice.    - Split the board such that each unit square is bombed at least once in any two rounds.    - Each adjacent square (neighbors by sharing a side) must be bombed within distinct cycles to ensure a guarantee destruction by moving to the adjacent bombed square:      - First bomb a white square.      - Then bomb its adjacent black square, capturing the tank if it moves on the first bomb.      - Repeat usage. 5. **Bounding Minimum Consecutive Bombings:**    - Assume configurations of a unit movement requiring at least 3 adjacent bombings per region of connected squares otherwise seen as 3 bombings per 2 unit movements.    - In general bounding, rotational coloring argues:      - 41^2 inclusive by 3 minus 1 possibilities.

The discriminant Delta of a quadratic equation ax^{2}+bx+c=0 is given by Delta = b^{2}-4ac.  For our equation, a=1, b=2, and c=3-k. Substituting these values into the formula for the discriminant, we get: [ Delta = 2^{2}-4times 1times (3-k) = 4 - 4(3-k) = 4 - 12 + 4k = -8 + 4k ] For the equation to have two distinct real roots, we require that Delta > 0. Therefore, we have: [ -8 + 4k > 0 implies 4k > 8 implies k > 2 ] Thus, the range of k for which the equation has two distinct real roots is k > 2. So, we have: [ boxed{k > 2} ] # Part 2: Finding the Value of k Given that the two roots of the equation are alpha and beta, and that k^{2}=alpha beta +3k, we proceed to find the value of k.  From Vieta's formulas, we know that for a quadratic equation ax^{2}+bx+c=0, the product of its roots alpha and beta is given by alphabeta = frac{c}{a}. In our case, a=1 and c=3-k, so we have: [ alphabeta = frac{3-k}{1} = 3-k ] Substituting alphabeta = 3-k into the given equation k^{2}=alphabeta +3k, we get: [ k^{2} = (3-k) + 3k = 3 + 2k ] Rearranging and solving for k, we have: [ k^{2} - 2k - 3 = 0 ] Factoring or using the quadratic formula, we find the roots of this equation to be k_{1}=3 and k_{2}=-1. However, based on the range of k found in part 1 (k > 2), we discard k_{2}=-1 as it does not satisfy the condition for the equation to have two distinct real roots. Therefore, the value of k that satisfies both the given equation and the condition for two distinct real roots is: [ boxed{k = 3} ]"},{"instruction":"2015 people are sitting around a round table, each of whom is either a knight or a liar.

Consider that there are 2015 persons sitting around a circular table, each given a card with a unique number written on it. Each person is either a knight, who always tells the truth, or a liar, who always lies. 2. The problem specifies that each one of them respectively observes the cards of their two neighbors and makes a statement about their own card based on these observations. 3. Let's first establish some notation:    - Let A be the person who received the card with the smallest number.    - Let B be the person who received the card with the largest number. 4. According to the statements, everyone says: \\"My number is greater than the numbers of my two neighbors.\\"    - If A (the person with the smallest number) says this, it must be a lie because it’s impossible for the smallest number to be greater than its neighbors. Therefore, A is a liar.    - If B (the person with the largest number) says this, it must be true because the largest number is larger than any other number. Hence, B is a knight. 5. Consequently, A and B must have said the first phrase, \\"My number is greater than the numbers of my two neighbors,\\" because they have the smallest and largest numbers respectively. 6. Now, consider the maximum number of people k who can truthfully say:    - \\"My number is less than the numbers of my two neighbors.\\" 7. Note that k persons saying this statement means they must all be knights because liars cannot truthfully make any statements. 8. Arrange the 2015 people in such a manner that can potentially allow a maximum number of knights to say the second statement:    - Place the cards in increasing order around the table. Assume the cards are labeled with numbers (1, 2, 3, ..., 2015).    - If the card with number 1 is held by A (liar), and the card with number 2015 is held by B (knight), then the remaining 2013 people have cards numbered from 2 to 2014, which, according to the problem's conditions, can allow them to truthfully say their numbers are less than those of their two neighbors. 9. Thus, apart from A and B, the remaining 2013 people can all claim:     - \\"My number is less than the numbers of my two neighbors.\\"    - With A and B excluded (since they cannot say the second statement), the number of individuals who can truthfully say the second statement is 2015-2=2013. 10.

The number of such subsets is given by the binomial coefficient C_{k}^{m-1}.

This is a fundamental property of the function that we will use to find its periodicity. 2. We are also given that f(1) = 0. This is an initial condition that will help us determine the value of the function at other points. To find the periodicity of f(x), let's use the given property in a forward step: - Starting with f(x+2) + f(x) = 3, we can substitute x with x+2 to get a new equation:   [   f(x+4) + f(x+2) = 3.   ] - Comparing this with the original equation f(x+2) + f(x) = 3, we notice that if we subtract the second equation from the first, we get:   [   f(x+4) - f(x) = 0,   ]   which implies that f(x+4) = f(x). This means that the function f(x) is periodic with a period of 4. Knowing that f(x) has a period of 4, we can find f(2023) by reducing 2023 modulo 4: - Since 2023 equiv 3 pmod{4}, we have f(2023) = f(3) due to the periodicity of f(x).

By substituting x = 1 into the property, we get:   [   f(3) + f(1) = 3.   ] - Since f(1) = 0, substituting this into the equation gives us:   [   f(3) + 0 = 3,   ]   which simplifies to f(3) = 3.

For a neq b, we can assume without loss of generality a < b. The inequality then reforms to: [ab + k (b^2 - a^2)^2 ge sqrt{a^4 + b^4}.] Manipulating this, we get: [k (b^2 - a^2)^2 ge sqrt{a^4 + b^4} - ab.] To satisfy this for all a and b with a<b, consider when a and b are close to each other, approaching the equality. As a approaches b, (b^2 - a^2)^2 rightarrow 0, and we find that sqrt{a^4 + b^4} - ab rightarrow 0. Therefore, the smallest value k can take to meet this inequality is when it just satisfies the condition as a and b approach each other infinitesimally.

Let the distance between the stripes be d, which serves as the altitude of the parallelogram in this orientation. The area of the parallelogram can also be expressed as: [ text{Area} = text{base} times text{altitude} = 50 , text{ft} times d. ] Since the area of the parallelogram remains constant regardless of which sides we consider as the base and altitude, we can set the two expressions for the area equal to each other: [ 600 , text{ft}^2 = 50 , text{ft} times d. ] Solving for d, we find the distance between the stripes: [ d = frac{600 , text{ft}^2}{50 , text{ft}} = 12 , text{ft}. ] Therefore, the distance between the stripes is boxed{12} feet."},{"instruction":"The crosssection of a water channel is a trapezium in shape.

Since we have eight numbers, and as per the Pigeonhole Principle, if seven or more items are placed in three categories, at least one category must contain at least three items. 5. **Inferring from Pigeonhole Principle**:    Since we have eight even integers and only three possible remainders when considering modulo 6, we are guaranteed that at least one remainder category will include at least three numbers. This guarantees that there will be at least one pair of integers with a difference that is a multiple of 6. 6. **Conclusion**:    The probability that there exists such a pair is certain once the Pigeonhole Principle condition is met.

A number is called a \\"classy number\\" if there exists a digit that is twice less than the product of the other two digits. 2. A number is called a \\"superclassy number\\" if this condition holds for at least two of its digits. Now let's solve the problem step by step. 1. **Establish Equations**:     - Assume we have a number ((a, b, c)). For it to be a superclassy number:         - We should have the following conditions:         [         2a = b cdot c quad text{or} quad 2b = a cdot c quad text{or} quad 2c = a cdot b         ]     - Since it's a superclassy number, two of these conditions must be satisfied.  2. **Solve for a and b**:     - Let’s consider (2a = b cdot c) and (2b = a cdot c). We rewrite these as follows:         [         b = frac{2a}{c} quad text{and} quad a = frac{2b}{c}         ]     - Substituting (b) from the first equation into the second equation:         [         2b = a cdot c quad text{becomes} quad 2 left(frac{2a}{c}right) = a cdot c quad Rightarrow quad frac{4a}{c} = a cdot c quad Rightarrow quad 4a = a cdot c^2         ]     - Simplifying, we get:         [         4 = c^2         ]     - Hence:         [         c = 2         ] 3. **Verification**:     - Given (c = 2), substitute back into the original equations:         - From (2a = b cdot c), we get:             [             2a = 2b quad Rightarrow quad a = b             ]     - Therefore, in a superclassy number, (a) and (b) must be the same digit and (c) must be 2. 4. **Count Possible Numbers**:     - The superclassy number thus consists of the digits 'digit, digit, 2', where 'digit' can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since 0 is not allowed).     - The number of different digits (excluding 2) is 9:         [         {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}         ]     - Each valid digit (1-9) appears twice and 2 appears once. They can be arranged in:         [         text{3! permutations} = 6 text{ permutations per choice of digit}         ]     - For each choice of the digit (excluding 2), we have 6 permutations. There are 9 of these choices:         [         9 times 6 = 54         ]     - Additionally, the triple number 222 is also a valid superclassy number, we must subtract 1:         [         54 - 1 = 53         ] # Conclusion: Thus, there are 25 different superclassy numbers.
