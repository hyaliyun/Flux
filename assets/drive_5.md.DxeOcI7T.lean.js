The answer is:","output":"The missing first step of the given process is: \\"Roots take in water and essential nutrients from the soil.\\" Justification of the steps: 1. Roots take in water and essential nutrients from the soil: The roots act as the plant's water and nutrient delivery system. They absorb water as well as essential nutrients and minerals from the soil. 2. Water is absorbed through roots: After the intake, roots transport water upwards to the rest of the plant, which eventually reaches the leaves. 3. Chloroplast cells in leaves contain chlorophyll: Chloroplast cells are specialized plant cells containing chlorophyll, the green pigment that traps sunlight to power photosynthesis. 4. Chlorophyll absorbs energy from sunlight: The chlorophyll in the chloroplasts absorbs the energy from sunlight, providing the necessary energy for the photosynthesis process. 5. Energy splits water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen: The energy absorbed by chlorophyll is used to break the water molecules absorbed in step 2 into hydrogen and oxygen. 6. Oxygen gets released into the atmosphere: The oxygen byproduct created in the previous step is released into the atmosphere as a waste product. 7. Hydrogen and carbon dioxide used to create glucose: Hydrogen from step 5 and carbon dioxide from the environment are used in the Calvin cycle to create glucose, a simple sugar. 8.

The puppies were three times more expensive than the parakeets, and the parakeets were half as expensive as the kittens. If the cost of one parakeet was 10, what would it cost to purchase all of the pets for sale at the pet shop, in dollars?. Me: Hmmm, let me think. I think this is the detailed solution:","output":"Let's break down the problem step by step: 1. You are given that there are two puppies, two kittens, and three parakeets for sale at the pet shop. 2. You are also given that the cost of one parakeet is 10. 3. The problem states that the puppies are three times more expensive than the parakeets, so the cost of one puppy would be 3 * 10 = 30. 4. The parakeets are half as expensive as the kittens, so since one parakeet is 10, that means one kitten costs 2 * 10 = 20. Now we can calculate the total cost of purchasing all the pets at the pet shop. Cost of the parakeets: There are three parakeets, and the cost of one parakeet is 10, so the total cost of the parakeets is 3 * 10 = 30. Cost of the kittens: There are two kittens, and the cost of one kitten is 20, so the total cost of the kittens is 2 * 20 = 40. Cost of the puppies: There are two puppies, and the cost of one puppy is 30, so the total cost of the puppies is 2 * 30 = 60. Total cost of all the pets: Adding up the cost of the parakeets, kittens, and puppies, we get 30 + 40 + 60 = 130. So, it would cost 130 to purchase all of the pets for sale at the pet shop."},{"instruction":"Answer this question.

We used polish on the vase but not on the silverware, since we wanted the","output":"silver to develop a natural patina over time. This would not only accentuate the intricate engravings on the handles, but also give the pieces an antique, heirloom-like quality. Step 1: Evaluate the context and setting of the story. In this case, the setting seems to be a household where someone is taking care of silverware and a vase. Step 2: Determine the primary action taking place. Here, it is the process of maintaining the vase and silverware. Step 3: Decide on a direction for the continuation of the story. In this instance, I'll focus on the reasons behind choosing to polish the vase and let the silverware age. The decision to polish the vase seemed an obvious one - the vibrant colors of the ceramic surface, featuring a delicate floral pattern, would sing under the warmth of the golden sun that filled the room. In addition, the polish would protect the vase from any damage or dirt, ensuring its long-lasting beauty. We carefully applied the polish, ensuring not to miss any nook and cranny, and admired the way it gleamed in the sunlight, instantly becoming the centerpiece of the room. As for the silverware, we were captivated by the idea of the pieces accumulating stories over the years - stories that would become family lore and be passed down from generation to generation. It wasn't just about the aesthetic, but the history and sentimentality that the aging silver would represent. Each scratch, each subtle change in color, reflecting a meal shared, a celebration, or even just the quiet intimacy of daily life. Thus, we refrained from interfering with the natural process of aging the silver, instead deciding to store the pieces in a lovely mahogany box lined with velvet. When taken out for special occasions, we would take a moment to remember the previous times, pondering on the new memories that would be etched - both metaphorically and literally - onto the silverware. Months turned into years, and the silver gradually aged with grace. The vase, still strikingly beautiful, continued to be an ever-present symbol of our home. The silverware, now imbued with the tales of our lives, brought warmth, love, and nostalgia each time we set the table with its lovingly tarnished presence. And so, with both the vase and the silverware, we managed to create an artful blend of beauty and memory, artifacts of our shared history."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

At the cemetery, they dig up Jason's corpse, but seeing it causes Tommy to snap, and he stabs Jason's body with a metal fence post. As he turns his back on Jason, two lightning bolts strike the post and revive the now-undead killer. Tommy tries to light the gasoline in which he has soaked Jason, but a sudden downpour prevents it. When Hawes tries to attack Jason with a shovel, the shovel breaks on impact and his heart is punched out. Tommy makes his way to the sheriff's office, when he panics and attempts to grab weapons, it gets him put into a jail cell. His warning that Jason has returned goes unheeded by Sheriff Garris, who is aware of Tommy's mental problems and thinks he is imagining Jason. On the road, camp counselors Darren and Lizbeth get lost looking for the camp and run into Jason. After they fail trying to frighten Jason off the road, he impales them both with the metal rod that resurrected him.

As they do this, Jason suddenly appears and bursts through a window, but Tommy successfully lures him away from the children. Tommy plans to trap Jason in the lake, where he originally drowned, by tying a chain attached to a rock around his neck, effectively weighing him down to the bottom of the lake.

This policy has been adopted as a means to prevent the grant of patents for unfeasible inventions that violate the fundamental laws of physics and perpetrate scientific fraud. Perpetual motion machines are hypothetical devices that operate indefinitely without an energy source or violate the laws of thermodynamics. Specifically, they defy the first law of thermodynamics, which states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed; it can only change forms, and the second law of thermodynamics, which states that in any energy transfer or transformation, the total entropy of a closed system will always increase over time. As a result, these machines are considered impossible as they imply the creation of energy from nothing or the existence of a perpetual energy cycle that has zero energy loss, contrary to accepted scientific principles. Understanding that many inventors have made unsubstantiated claims regarding the invention of perpetual motion machines, the USPTO has implemented strict requirements when examining patent applications related to such devices. Inventors are required to submit a working model along with their patent application for review. This working model must be replicable and demonstrate that the proposed device operates as claimed, proving that it satisfies its perpetual motion claims. Providing a working model allows the USPTO to thoroughly review and analyze the device's functionality according to established scientific principles. By examining the model, patent examiners can verify if the invention merits a patent grant or if it simply defies accepted scientific theories. This policy serves to uphold the integrity of the patent system by ensuring that patents are only granted to inventions that demonstrate scientific plausibility and practical utility, conforming to the United States Code, Title 35, Section 101, which outlines criteria for patentable subject matter. Requiring a working model to accompany patent applications for perpetual motion machines ensures that the USPTO does not endorse the patenting of unproven, scientifically implausible, or fraudulent inventions that could undermine public trust in the institution and the broader scientific community."},{"instruction":"Leo: If \\"A man kicking a workout bag.\\" does that mean that \\"The man is a boxer.\\"?

If there were originally 32 green apples, how many more green apples than red apples are there in the store now? Think carefully first, then make a decision:","output":"Let's break down the problem step by step: 1. Originally, there were 32 green apples in the store. 2. There were 200 more red apples than green apples initially, so there were 32 (green) + 200 = 232 red apples before the truck arrived. 3. The truck delivered 340 green apples, which need to be added to the original 32 green apples: 340 + 32 = 372 green apples in total now. 4. To find out how many more green apples than red apples there are in the store now, subtract the number of red apples from the number of green apples: 372 (green) - 232 (red) = 140.

Translate this to English?","output":"The given sentence in German states: \\"Neue Neuronen folgen dem Fluss der Cerebrospinalflüssigkeit im erwachsenen Gehirn.\\" In English, this translates to: \\"New neurons follow the flow of cerebrospinal fluid in the adult brain.\\" To provide a detailed explanation of the translated sentence: New neurons, also known as nerve cells, are the primary components of the nervous system that include the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. The process of new neuron generation is called neurogenesis, which predominantly occurs during embryonic development. However, in recent years, studies have shown that neurogenesis can also continue, to some extent, in specific regions of the adult brain. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear, colorless fluid that circulates within the ventricles (cavities) of the brain, the central canal of the spinal cord, and the subarachnoid space, which is a space between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater surrounding the brain and spinal cord. It acts as a \\"cushion\\" for the brain and spinal cord, providing mechanical support, and plays a crucial role in maintaining the physiological homeostasis of the central nervous system. The statement that new neurons follow the flow of cerebrospinal fluid in the adult brain highlights the potential guidance and influence of this fluid on the migration and distribution of newly generated neurons. The flow of CSF may create a pathway for these cells to navigate or provide essential nutrients and signaling molecules that help regulate neuronal development and integration into existing neural networks. This migration of new neurons is a vital process for maintaining the proper functioning of specific brain regions, such as the hippocampus, which is involved in memory formation and learning. Furthermore, research exploring the relationship between neurogenesis and cerebrospinal fluid may provide valuable insights into the potential for enhancing cognitive function and developing new treatment strategies for neurological disorders."},{"instruction":"Ask a question about The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess.","output":"Step 1: Research the game to gather relevant information about The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess Step 2: Based on the information gathered, identify an interesting and relevant topic about the game Step 3: Formulate a question that encourages deeper understanding and discussion about the topic Step 4: Review the question to ensure it is clear, engaging, and grammatically correct.

Question: suppose if the chemical count in the water is low happens, how will it affect the rain is safer. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","output":"The process you mentioned is the formation of acid rain, which occurs when sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are released into the atmosphere, usually from anthropogenic sources such as fossil fuel combustion and industrial activities. These pollutants rise into the atmosphere, where they react with water and oxygen, forming acids such as sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3). The acidic compounds then fall back to the earth's surface in the form of rain, snow, or fog, with significant consequences for ecosystems, human health, and infrastructure. Now, if the chemical count in the water (i.e., the concentration of these pollutants) were to decrease, there would be several potential effects on acid rain and related phenomenon. First, there would be a direct impact on the acidity of the rain. With lower concentrations of SO2 and NOx in the atmosphere, less sulfuric and nitric acid would form, ultimately leading to less acidic precipitation. Consequently, it would be safer for ecosystems, as it would be less likely to cause harm to plants and animals by disrupting their natural pH levels and influencing the availability of essential nutrients in soil and water bodies. Additionally, it would have less potential to cause damage to human-made structures, such as buildings and monuments, as acid rain is a known cause of corrosion and deterioration of materials. Moreover, a lower chemical count in the water would likely result in a decrease in the atmospheric concentrations of these pollutants. This, in turn, could have a positive effect on air quality, which may reduce respiratory and other related health issues caused by these pollutants. Furthermore, a lower abundance of atmospheric pollutants could also have some influence on climate change, as both sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides can indirectly impact the earth's temperature, through various feedback mechanisms involving aerosols and ozone formation. On the other hand, a decrease in the chemical count in the water may have little or no effect on some of the secondary effects of acid rain, such as the release of toxic metals into the environment. While the acidity of the rain will be reduced, existing acid rain problems in some regions could still release toxic metals and negatively affect ecosystems. Similarly, other air pollution problems, such as particulate matter and smog, would still persist, as these are influenced by different sets of chemical compounds than those involved in acid rain. In conclusion, a decrease in the chemical count in the water would have the most substantial effect on the acidity and safety of the rain, leading to less harmful consequences overall. However, it may have less or no effect on some secondary aspects, which are dependent on different factors or existing acid rain problems in some areas. Overall, reducing the concentration of pollutants in the water and atmosphere is essential for mitigating the effects of acid rain and improving the environment and public health."},{"instruction":"it's late, i'm tired. tomorow i'm going to work. next weekend is prom Describe the sentiment embodied by this tweet.

What did scientists attempt to boost artificially on Saint Helena? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"Scientists attempted to boost rainfall artificially on Saint Helena between 1791 and 1833. This period marked a series of experiments in conservation, reforestation, and efforts to increase rainfall on the island. These environmental interventions were closely linked to the conceptualization of the processes of environmental change and helped establish the roots of environmentalism. Saint Helena, a remote island located in the South Atlantic Ocean, experienced significant deforestation due to human activities, such as the introduction of non-native species and the overexploitation of natural resources. This led to a decrease in rainfall and a decline in the island's biodiversity, raising concerns among scientists and officials about the long-term sustainability of the island. To address this issue, multiple artificial rainfall enhancement techniques were explored. One technique was cloud seeding, which involved dispersing particles or chemicals into the atmosphere to encourage the formation of rain clouds. Another method was the construction of fog fences to capture water droplets from the fog and channel the captured moisture into the ground to irrigate plants and replenish groundwater supplies. In addition, the island's reforestation efforts aimed to restore native vegetation. The reestablishment of healthy ecosystems could promote a more favorable microclimate, leading to an increase in local precipitation. These projects aimed at reversing the island's desertification and transforming it into a more sustainable habitat. The experiments conducted on Saint Helena laid the groundwork for environmentalism and the understanding of human-induced environmental change. It provided valuable insights into the complex relationship between ecosystems, climate, and human activity. Through these efforts, scientists and environmentalists developed new strategies for environmental management and conservation, contributing to a broader awareness of the importance of sustainable land use and preservation of our planet's resources."},{"instruction":"Generate a context and a hypothesis.","output":"Context: Imagine you are at the park on a sunny day, and you see a big, tall tree with lots of green leaves swaying in the wind.

Answer:","output":"Kyphosis is a medical condition that affects the human spine, specifically the thoracic region, which is the upper and middle part of the back. This condition is characterized by an exaggerated forward rounding or curvature of the spine, often referred to as a \\"humpback\\" or \\"dowager's hump\\" appearance. In a healthy spine, there is a natural curve in the thoracic region that allows for flexibility, balance, and shock absorption. However, when this curvature becomes more pronounced than normal, it results in kyphosis. There are several types and causes of kyphosis, including: 1. Postural kyphosis: This is the most common form of kyphosis, often seen in adolescents and young adults, and is primarily caused by poor posture and slouching. In most cases, it is mild and can be corrected through physical therapy and practicing good posture. 2. Scheuermann's kyphosis: This type of kyphosis occurs in adolescents during growth spurts and is thought to be caused by abnormal growth of the vertebrae, leading to a more rigid and exaggerated curvature. Bracing or surgical intervention may be required in severe cases. 3. Congenital kyphosis: This rare form of kyphosis is present at birth and is caused by abnormal development of the spinal column during pregnancy. Depending on the severity, infants may require surgical intervention to prevent complications and developmental issues. 4. Osteoporosis-related kyphosis: As people age, their bone density can decrease, resulting in osteoporosis. This can lead to compression fractures in the vertebrae, causing the spine to curve forward progressively. Treatment often includes medications to improve bone density and bracing to support the spine. 5. Degenerative kyphosis: This form of kyphosis results from wear and tear on the spine over time due to aging or conditions like arthritis that cause gradual degeneration of the intervertebral discs and facet joints. Treatment varies depending on the severity and may include pain management, physical therapy, or surgery. Kyphosis can have various effects on the body, ranging from mild discomfort and cosmetic concerns to more severe issues like chronic pain, reduced mobility, and difficulty breathing. Treatment for kyphosis is primarily based on the severity of the condition and the underlying cause. In mild cases, conservative treatment options like physical therapy, postural training, and pain management are often sufficient. In more severe cases or when the condition is progressive, more aggressive treatments such as bracing or surgical intervention may be necessary. Diagnosis of kyphosis typically involves a thorough physical examination, assessment of medical history, and imaging tests like X-rays, CT scans, or MRI to evaluate the degree of curvature and potential causes. Early detection and intervention are essential for addressing the underlying issues and preventing long-term complications that can be associated with this spinal deformity."},{"instruction":"Based on the premise \\"Off El Hurriya Street you'll find the Neo-Classical facade of the Greco-Roman Museum with a fine collection of both Roman, Greek, and Ptolemaic artifacts found around the city and under the waters of the harbor, along with many ancient Egyptian pieces.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"The Greco-Roman Museum has a collection from numerous cultures.\\" is true?","output":"Based on the premise provided, we can indeed conclude that the hypothesis \\"The Greco-Roman Museum has a collection from numerous cultures\\" is true. The background information given offers several points that support this conclusion. Firstly, the premise mentions that the museum is located off El Hurriya Street, which seems to be an important detail about the museum's location. By placing the museum in a prominent area, it becomes apparent that it is a significant cultural institution within the city. Secondly, the Neo-Classical facade of the museum represents a specific architectural style. Neo-Classicism is characterized by its emphasis on classical themes, motifs, and aesthetics from ancient Greek and Roman culture. This architectural choice for the museum's facade reflects its thematic focus on the Greco-Roman era. Thirdly, the premise specifically states that the museum contains a \\"fine collection of both Roman, Greek, and Ptolemaic artifacts found around the city and under the waters of the harbor.\\" This information highlights the varied cultural composition of the museum's collection, which encompasses artifacts from Roman, Greek, and Ptolemaic cultures. The Ptolemaic dynasty ruled ancient Egypt during the Hellenistic period, and the presence of Ptolemaic artifacts in the museum points towards a connection between the Egyptian and Greco-Roman cultures. Furthermore, the premise mentions \\"many ancient Egyptian pieces\\" in the museum's collection. This information provides additional proof that the Greco-Roman Museum indeed has a collection from numerous cultures, including not only the Roman, Greek, and Ptolemaic cultures but also the ancient Egyptian culture. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"The Greco-Roman Museum has a collection from numerous cultures\\" is accurate based on the information provided in the premise. The museum's collection includes artifacts from a variety of cultures, such as Roman, Greek, Ptolemaic, and ancient Egyptian, indicating that it indeed showcases an array of diverse cultural heritage. Moreover, the museum's neo-classical facade reflects its primary focus on Greco-Roman history and culture, while the unique blend of artifacts illustrates its dedication to preserving and exploring the connections between these ancient civilizations."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"By using more and more legislative repression, massively restricting the freedom of the press, threatening the opposition, continuing to occupy farms and permanently undermining the rule of law, Mugabe is isolating himself more and more, including from his traditional allies in southern Africa.\\" to Finnish?","output":"Käyttämällä yhä enemmän lainsäädännöllistä sortoa, rajoittamalla massiivisesti lehdistönvapautta, uhkaamalla oppositiota, jatkamalla tilojen miehitystä ja pysyvästi heikentämällä oikeusvaltion periaatteita, Mugabe eristäytyy yhä enemmän, myös hänen perinteisistä liittolaisistaan eteläisessä Afrikassa.

I think it is great for people who are feeling horrible at-first, but want to do something. It also puts her in a better mood and she likes doing it.

In this case, I'll select \\"the influence of music on productivity.\\" Step 2: Establish background information Next, I will gather some background information on the topic which will serve as the context. Context: Studies have shown mixed results when it comes to the impact of music on productivity. Some research suggests that listening to music while working can help improve concentration and overall mood, while other studies show that music with lyrics can be distracting and may hamper performance on cognitively demanding tasks. Factors such as the type of music, volume, individual preferences, and the nature of the work being performed could all contribute to the varying effects of music on productivity. Step 3: Develop a hypothesis Based on the context provided, I will now create a hypothesis that could be tested through empirical research. Hypothesis: Listening to instrumental music at a moderate volume will lead to higher levels of productivity for individuals engaged in cognitively demanding tasks as compared to listening to music with lyrics or working in silence."},{"instruction":"Background: Tatchell was born in Melbourne, Australia. His father was a lathe operator and his mother worked in a biscuit factory. His parents divorced when he was four and his mother remarried soon afterwards. Since the family finances were strained by medical bills, he had to leave school at 16 in 1968. Context: To avoid conscription into the Australian Army, Tatchell moved to London in 1971. He had accepted being gay in 1969, and in London became a leading member of the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) until its 1974 collapse. During this time Tatchell was prominent in organising sit-ins at pubs that refused to serve \\"poofs\\" and protests against police harassment and the medical classification of homosexuality as an illness. With others he helped organise Britain's first Gay Pride march in 1972. In 1973, he attended the 10th World Youth Festival in East Berlin on GLF's behalf. His actions triggered opposition within and between different groups of national delegates including the Communist Party of Great Britain and National Union of Students. He was banned from conferences, had his leaflets confiscated and burned, was interrogated by the secret police (the Stasi) and threatened and assaulted by other delegates, mostly communists. Tatchell later claimed that this was the first time gay liberation politics were publicly disseminated and discussed in a communist country, although he noted that, in terms of decriminalisation and the age of consent, gay men had greater rights in East Germany at the time than in Britain and much of the West. Describing his time in the Gay Liberation Front, he wrote in The Guardian that: [The] GLF was a glorious, enthusiastic and often chaotic mix of anarchists, hippies, leftwingers, feminists, liberals and counter-culturalists. Despite our differences, we shared a radical idealism - a dream of what the world could and should be - free from not just homophobia but the whole sex-shame culture, which oppressed straights as much as LGBTs. We were sexual liberationists and social revolutionaries, out to turn the world upside down. [...] GLF's main aim was never equality within the status quo. [...] GLF's strategy for queer emancipation was to change society's values and norms, rather than adapt to them. We sought a cultural revolution to overturn centuries of male heterosexual domination and thereby free both queers and women. [...] Forty years on, GLF's gender agenda has been partly won. [...] Girlish boys and boyish girls don't get victimised as much as in times past. LGBT kids often now come out at the age of 12 or 14. While many are bullied, many others are not. The acceptance of sexual and gender diversity is increasing. Question: What was the ideology of the GLF?. Whats the answer?","output":"The Gay Liberation Front (GLF)'s ideology was much more than simply seeking legal rights for gay individuals. It was a radical movement aimed at societal transformation to challenge and overturn deeply ingrained norms, biases and systemic patterns of discrimination about sexuality and gender roles. The GLF was a diverse assembly of people, including anarchists, hippies, left-wingers, feminists, liberals, and counter-culturalists, all united in their shared idealistic vision of a world free from sexual shamings and oppressions that impacted not just LGBT+ individuals but also straight people. The main aim of the GLF, as described by Tatchell, was not merely equality within existing societal paradigms, but rather it was about causing a cultural revolution, challenging and changing the basic values and norms of society. The members did not just want to adapt to existing societal norms but wished to fundamentally transform them. This transformative ideology of the GLF was focused on ending centuries of male heterosexual domination so that all sexual orientations and genders could experience freedom and equality. In essence, the GLF sought liberation through liberation; it aimed at creating a society where sexual orientation and gender identity were no longer sources of shame or discrimination. It strove for attitudinal and institutional changes, changing the way people thought about and treated homosexuality, advocating for acceptance of sexual and gender diversity, and, crucially, working towards the rights and safety of 'girlish boys and boyish girls', as well as LGBT+ kids in general. This ideology of the GLF would succeed in accomplishing considerable progress over the years—a fact that is apparent from the increased acceptance of sexual and gender diversity in present times compared to past eras. It is notably visible in the greater freedom with which LGBT+ kids now come out and the lower rates of victimisation they face. However, Tatchell did mention that their goal had only been \\"partly won\\", indicating there's still work to do."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given commands (in terms of logical operations) to select relevant rows from the given table.

Movie plot: The story is told in flashback by a villager, played by Mervyn Johns, as though to a person visiting after the war. He recounts: one Saturday during the Second World War, a group of seemingly authentic British soldiers arrive in the small, fictitious English village of Bramley End.[1] It is the Whitsun weekend so life is even quieter than usual and there is almost no traffic of any kind. At first they are welcomed by the villagers, until doubts begin to grow about their true purpose and identity. After they are revealed to be German soldiers intended to form the vanguard of an invasion of Britain, they round up the residents and hold them captive in the local church. The vicar is shot after sounding the church bell in alarm. In attempts to reach the outside world, many of the villagers take action. Such plans include writing a message on an egg and giving them to the local paper boy for his mother, but they are crushed when Mrs Fraser's cousin runs over them. Mrs Fraser then puts a note in Cousin Maude's pocket, but she uses it to hold her car window in place; her dog, Edward, then chews it to shreds after it blows onto the back seat. Mrs Collins, the postmistress, manages to kill a German with an axe used for chopping firewood, and tries to telephone elsewhere. The girls on the exchange see her light and decide that she can wait. Mrs Collins waits until she is killed by another German who walks into the shop moments afterwards. The girl at the exchange then picks up the phone, getting no reply. The civilians attempt to escape to warn the local Home Guard, but are betrayed by the village squire, who is revealed to be collaborating with the Germans. Members of the local Home Guard are ambushed and shot by the Germans. They begin to bow in until a young boy, George, succeeds in escaping; despite being shot in the leg, he alerts the army.

While Western states have allowed it for more than 50 years; eastern states amended their traffic laws to allow it in the 1970s as a fuel-saving measure in response to motor fuel shortages in 1973. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 required in §362(c)(5) that in order for a state to receive federal assistance in developing mandated conservation programs, they must permit right turns on red lights. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico have allowed right turns on red since 1980, except where prohibited by a sign or where right turns are controlled by dedicated traffic lights.

What's the best answer to this question: is it legal to turn right on red in california?","output":"Yes, it is legal to turn right on red in California, as it follows the general rule in the United States permitting right turns on red lights. However, there are certain exceptions and rules to keep in mind while executing a right turn on red in California. 1. No Sign Prohibiting the Turn: Ensure there is no sign explicitly prohibiting a right turn on red at the traffic signal. If a sign marked \\"No Turn on Red\\" or similar wording is displayed, you must abide by it and wait for a green signal. 2. Yield to Traffic and Pedestrians: Before proceeding with a right turn on a red light, you must come to a complete stop, yield to any oncoming traffic, and check for pedestrians crossing the street. Only when it is absolutely safe and clear should you initiate the turn. 3. Dedicated Right Turn Signal: In cases where a dedicated right turn signal is present, you must wait for the specific green arrow or signal to appear before initiating the right turn. Turning on a red arrow or red light in such instances is not permitted. 4. Right Turns on Red Arrows: While uncommon, some traffic signals operate with red arrows for right turns. Although turning right on a red arrow is generally prohibited, California law does allow it in specific situations. You must first stop and yield to oncoming traffic, then proceed with caution after ensuring no signs prohibit such a maneuver. Always exercise caution and abide by local traffic laws when turning right on a red light, keeping in mind these exceptions and rules to ensure a safe and legal driving experience in California."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Tracy wanted to drive less to help reduce their impact on the environment.

Despite the presence of camera crews from (at least) France 2, Associated Press and Reuters, there is no footage of the c. 17 minutes Jamal and Muhammad waited for an ambulance or of them being loaded into one. There is no film of the death of the first ambulance driver, Bassam al-Bilbeisi, who was reportedly shot on his way to pick them up. Several commentators questioned what time the shooting occurred; what time Muhammad arrived at the hospital; why there seemed to be little blood on the ground where they were shot; and whether any bullets were collected. Several alleged that, in other scenes in the raw footage, it is clear that protesters are play acting.

Wells in 1906. The story is set in London, England, during the turn of the 20th century, specifically the Edwardian era (1901-1910), and revolves around a man named Lionel Wallace who experiences encounters with a wondrous, mysterious door that seems to appear and disappear throughout his life. The setting of London plays a crucial role in the development of the story, as the city's hustle and bustle symbolizes the hectic life that Lionel Wallace engages in, as well as the ever-changing nature of life in an industrializing society. London, during the 20th century, was a city of contrasts: it was the center of the British Empire, a vibrant hub of trade, culture, and intellectual pursuits that attracted people from all over the world. However, it was also a city where pollution, overcrowding, and social problems were rampant. The door in the wall is a metaphor for the opportunities and dreams that one might have had in childhood but could not pursue due to the obligations and expectations of adult life. The door symbolizes a portal to an otherworldly utopia, a place of limitless possibilities, and ultimately serves as a stark contrast against the backdrop of the bustling, stressful environment of London. Throughout the story, the door appears in different locations across London, each time triggered by a moment when Lionel Wallace is feeling overwhelmed by, or dissatisfied with, the reality of his adult life. When he follows the door, he enters a secret garden filled with serenity, beauty, and a sense of completeness. The garden becomes a haven for him amidst the chaos of his life, offering him a temporary escape from the harsh reality of his modern existence. As the story unfolds, the tension between Wallace's discovered utopia and the demands of his everyday life causes him great struggle and internal turmoil. He must decide whether to keep chasing this elusive promise of happiness or to resign himself to the rigors and limitations of the reality he knows. In conclusion, \\"The Door in the Wall\\" takes place in London, England, at the dawn of the 20th century. The story uses this historical setting to explore the themes of longing for escape, the passage of time, and the conflict between dreams and reality, all of which resonate with readers even today."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"A man in a blue hat has his foot on the front bumper of a van.\\" Based on this premise, can we conclude that the hypothesis \\"A man is touching the van.\\" is true?

Despite these setbacks, hopes for quick recoveries bring a glimmer of hope as Australia heads into a challenging season. Speedster Mitchell Johnson suffered a hamstring complaint, ruling him out of the fourth Test. However, the seriousness of the injury doesn't appear to be significant. \\"The injury isn't serious and Johnson is expected to be fit for ODI tri-series,\\" an inside source stated. This indicates that Johnson's absence will be temporary, and he could make a comeback in the upcoming ODI tri-series. This phase of Johnson's recovery will need careful management to ensure his fitness level returns to normal and to avoid any chances of a potential relapse. (Step 1: Explain Mitchell Johnson's condition and what it means for his involvement in future games.) Dual blow echoed as Australian skipper, Michael Clarke has been ruled out of the Test series against India due to a hamstring injury. A mainstay of Australia's batting line-up, Clarke's absence will undoubtedly be a significant loss for the team. However, like Johnson, Clarke is also under progressive recovery. His absence from the cricketing arena isn't anticipated to last long. (Step 2: Explain Michael Clarke's injury and its relevance.) The Australian team captain is already aiming to be fit by the early stages of the World Cup. Clarke mentioned that he was \\"a week ahead of schedule\\" with his recovery. This indicates that his rehab process is moving faster than anticipated, raising hopes for an earlier comeback than initially projected. Monitoring and adapting to this quickened pace will be critical to keep this momentum without hindering the recovery. (Step 3: Focus on Clarke's recovery progress.) Australia's cricket team is showing resiliency amidst these challenges. With two of their key players nursing injuries, it will be a test of not only the squad's depth but also their psychological strength. Injuries to prominent players can destabilize a team's morale, yet the Australians would have to convert these setbacks into opportunities for less experienced players to step up and make their mark. (Step 4: Reflect on the team's situation as a whole.) This season may have begun on a tough note for Australian cricket, but with potential recovery in sight for Johnson and Clarke, the team can look forward to regaining their key players. As the nation watches, this could well turn into a story of resilience and recovery.

The children are given an opportunity to become actors in a school setting. Step 2: Evaluate the options. - movies: A school usually does not produce a full-fledged movie, especially for children to participate in. - television: It is also not very common for a school to create a television program featuring children as actors. - fancy dress: Fancy dress generally focuses on costumes and not necessarily acting performances. - play: Schools often organize plays for children to participate in and showcase their acting talents. - show: A show could be a possible option, but it appears less specific compared to a play, which directly focuses on acting. Step 3: Make a decision. Based on the context and evaluation of options, the most likely answer is that the children are participating in a play. Schools typically put on plays as a way for students to learn about theater and grow as actors."},{"instruction":"The institution of marriage is unique. It is the one institution that binds women and men together to form a family, and this serves broad societal purposes. In California, a U.S. District Court Judge last week overturned Proposition 8, the California Marriage Protection Act. It was passed in November 2008 by California voters to recognize \\"only marriage between a man and a woman.\\" The majority of Californians, including two-thirds of the state's black voters, have just had their core civil right -- the right to vote -- stripped from them by an openly gay federal judge who has misread history and the Constitution to impose his views on the state's people. The implicit comparison Judge Vaughn Walker made between racism and opposition to same-sex marriage is particularly offensive to me and to all who remember the reality of Jim Crow. It is not bigotry, it is biology that discriminates between same-sex couples and opposite-sex couples. A marriage requires a husband and a wife, because these unions are necessary to make new life and connect children to their mother and father. Judge Walker's decision will not stand the test of time and history. Congress and the Supreme Court must act to protect all Americans' right to vote for marriage. Advocates of making same-sex marriage a legally recognized right claim that this will have no impact on traditional marriage -- that it can peacefully coexist alongside traditional marriage. On the contrary, it will have profound impacts. It will create a conflict for people of faith (and nonreligious people as well) who fervently believe in traditional man-woman marriage and the law. The Bible is so clear in its support of heterosexual marriage there is little need for us to go through an exhaustive definition of biblical marriage versus the types of unions allowed by law today. The Scriptures say in Genesis 2:24 that a man is to leave his family and cleave to his wife. This concept is repeated in Matthew 19:5 and Mark 10:7. All the scriptures in the Bible concerning marriage presuppose heterosexual marriage. We can teach our kids that there are important spiritual and societal reasons to believe in traditional marriage and oppose same-sex marriage. But if same-sex marriage becomes legally recognized across the country, our kids will be told that gay marriage is a civil rights issue and that those who oppose it are akin to the racists of history who opposed interracial marriage and supported slavery. We can teach our children at home that marriage is between a man and a woman, but our children's public schools will teach them that marriage includes same-sex couples. Both would be \\"equal marriages\\" under the law. What might this look like? In Massachusetts, where a ruling legalized same-sex marriage in 2004, kids in public schools are reading books depicting same-sex families. At a California charter school in 2008, kindergartners' parents objected when a school newsletter alerted them to \\"National Coming Out Day;\\" a parent told a local ABC-TV affiliate that a teacher at the school screened a film to kindergartners the previous year showing gay families. These kinds of ill-advised social experiments may produce a host of unexpected consequences. If gay marriage is allowed, the nation will soon begin to experience an increased degradation of the nuclear family -- resulting in fewer kids being raised by both a mom and a dad. Beyond that, those of us who believe in traditional marriage and are in a regulated profession -- such as counselor, physician, attorney or accountant -- and act in concert with our beliefs, may be vulnerable to losing our professional license and our livelihood. We can be a religious charity faithfully fulfilling our mission by serving our community, such as by providing adoption and other services, but if we refuse to provide those services to a same-sex couple, we have the choice of abandoning our beliefs or ending our mission. In 2003, Adoption.com was sued by two California homosexual men, who claimed illegal discrimination because the agency refused to serve homosexual couples. The agency lost the lawsuit and no longer serves adoptive parents in California. An even more substantive danger lies in the consequences of gay marriage on the next generation. Redefining marriage redefines family. Changing the concept of family will change both the definition and the pattern of parenting. What will the landscape of America look like if same-sex marriage is legalized across our nation? Social scientists report what most Americans have always known: Both boys and girls are deeply affected in biological and psychological ways by the presence of their fathers. If the American family loses the presence of the birth dad in the home, there will be huge consequences to the growth and stability of the next generation of children in that family. For example, repeatedly, scholarly studies focused on adolescence show that early onset of puberty in girls is associated with negative psychological, social, and health problems including depression, alcohol consumption, and higher teenage pregnancy. An eight-year study of girls and their families showed that a father's presence in the home, with appropriate involvement in his children's lives, contributed to daughters' reaching puberty at a later age. Despite the incredible adaptability of children, our entire culture should advocate for family structures that promote the most positive environments for coming generations. In addition to fighting the marriage redefinition, leaders from all sectors of our culture, including our churches, must work hard at improving heterosexual marriages. Counseling, modeling, and interventions are needed to help ailing marriages. Both battles must be fought if our families, which are the incubators of future societal greatness, are to be protected. Let's set our sights high. Let's not fall victim to the circling argument of our opposition. We simply need an army of bipartisan leaders to strategize, organize, and prioritize the protection of marriage. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Harry R. Jackson, Jr. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"The author of this article argues against the legalization of same-sex marriage, claiming it poses threats to traditional marriage and family structures. The author expresses concern about the impacts on people of faith who believe in heterosexual marriages and the potential for those opposing same-sex marriage to be labeled as bigots. They cite examples of public schools teaching about same-sex relationships, which they believe contradicts the teachings of traditional religious institutions. Furthermore, the author suggests that the legalization of same-sex marriage may lead to the degradation of the nuclear family and have negative consequences on children's development.

As a key aspect of the Christian Trinity, the Holy Spirit is believed to be the active presence of God in the lives of believers, working within them to increase their faith, understanding, and love for God and others. In this context, the metaphor of a motor is fitting, as a motor generates power and motion, driving a machine or system to achieve its purpose. Similarly, when the Holy Spirit is at work within a person, it can be seen as providing the spiritual drive necessary for personal growth, transformation, and the ability to fulfill one's divine calling. Christians believe that the Holy Spirit is a gift from God, given to all believers as a way to strengthen and guide them on their journey. This spiritual \\"motor\\" can be activated through faith, prayer, and a genuine desire to grow closer to God. Once activated, the Holy Spirit can provide believers with the tools, strength, and wisdom they need to overcome obstacles, navigate challenges, and cultivate a meaningful relationship with God and others. Moreover, the idea of the Holy Spirit as a motor within you also suggests that it's a continuous and ongoing process. Just as a motor functions throughout the duration of a machine's operation, the Holy Spirit remains present and active in a believer's life, working incessantly to support, propel, and ultimately propel them towards their spiritual destination. This metaphor also highlights the importance of maintaining and nurturing one's connection with the Holy Spirit. Just as a motor requires fuel, maintenance, and proper care to function optimally, a believer's relationship with the Holy Spirit necessitates regular cultivation, reflection, and openness to divine guidance. By embracing this spiritual \\"motor\\" and tending to it with care, believers can expect to experience profound growth, deepened understanding, and a renewed sense of purpose and fulfillment. In conclusion, describing the Holy Spirit as a motor within a person serves as an apt illustration of the transformative power this divine presence can have in one's life. By invoking this metaphor, the speaker communicates the idea that, much like a motor generates power and enables motion, the Holy Spirit serves as a source of spiritual energy and guidance, propelling believers forward on their journey of faith and personal growth."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

The premise does not provide any additional context or information about why the man is climbing the wall or what his intentions are. 2. Analyze the Hypothesis: The hypothesis suggests that \\"A man holding fire in his hand is trying to escape by scaling a wall.\\" This statement adds an element of intent to the premise: that the man is attempting to escape from something. However, the hypothesis assumes that the man's purpose for climbing is to escape, whereas the premise only states that the man is climbing the wall with fire in hand. 3. Compare the Premise to the Hypothesis: The premise and hypothesis contain some similarities, such as the central imagery of a man climbing a wall while holding fire. However, the hypothesis adds an assumption about the man's intention (trying to escape). Thus, the hypothesis is not completely entailed by the premise, as it adds an interpretation that the premise does not explicitly state. 4.

The investing genius made an eye-popping 37 million a day in 2013 - that's 1.5 million an hour - simply watching the shares in his conglomerate soar by more than 25 per cent. The Berkshire Hathaway boss' net worth bounced 12.7 billion to 59.1 billion over the period, making him the billionaire who made the most cash this year, according to a new survey.

Drusilla is introduced alongside her lover Spike (James Marsters) in the second season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer to serve as new antagonists to the series' heroine, vampire Slayer Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and alongside Darla (Julie Benz) and Wolfram & Hart as the main antagonist of the second season of Angel. In contrast to the series' previous central villain, the ancient and ceremonious Master (Mark Metcalf), Spike and Dru were introduced as a more unconventional but equally dangerous pair of vampires. Actress Juliet Landau said that when she first received the script, it indicated that Drusilla's accent could be British or American. Landau felt Drusilla \\"should really be Cockney, especially with the whole Sid and Nancy analogy.\\" Though she never considered portraying Drusilla with a Southern American accent, as James Marsters had considered for Spike, she notes that invited comparisons with Blanche DuBois would also have been interesting. Drusilla's madness is exhibited in her often-strange dialogue, which is peppered with non sequiturs like \\"Spike, do you love my insides? All the parts you can't see?\\" Her behavior is girlish, accompanied by a dark, ironic twist. For instance, when she is happy, she will squeal and laugh like a young child, but she is happiest when committing torture, hunting humans, or witnessing mass destruction. She has a fondness for china dolls but keeps them blindfolded or gagged. She also loves flowers and cute animals, but is not sane enough to care for them; as she says, \\"Do you like daisies? I plant them but they always die. Everything I put in the ground withers and dies.\\" She even goes so far as to own a Pekingese puppy. She speaks in a soft, mellow voice which contrasts with her dialogue. All of \\"white hats\\" (both Scoobies and Angel's Investigations) are doubtful about how to deal with her, originally an innocent victim. Mostly and obviously Angel. Drusilla's costumes were initially intended to be a \\"cross between a Victorian period look and the Kate Moss heroin chic fashion look,\\" says Landau. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: anything interesting in the article to you, specifically?","output":"As an AI, I don't have personal interests or opinions. However, I can point out an interesting component based on the analysis of the text. The aspect of Drusilla's character that stands out is her complex and somewhat paradoxical temperament. This is perfectly encapsulated in the quote: \\"Her behavior is girlish, accompanied by a dark, ironic twist. For instance, when she is happy, she will squeal and laugh like a young child, but she is happiest when committing torture, hunting humans, or witnessing mass destruction.\\" This showcases the character's peculiarities and depth, combining an innocent, childlike joy with a disturbing and dangerous enjoyment of violence and chaos."},{"instruction":"Leo: Premise: \\"Two young children playing soccer.\\" Hypothesis: \\"Two kids run around with a soccer ball.\\" Do we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise? Mei: OK, So, let's think first... Me:","output":"First, let's consider the premise: \\"Two young children playing soccer.\\" This statement establishes that there are two young children, and they are engaged in playing soccer. Now, let's examine the hypothesis: \\"Two kids run around with a soccer ball.\\" This statement describes two kids running around while involving a soccer ball. To determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we need to see if the actions described in the hypothesis logically follow from the premise. Soccer is a sport that typically involves running around and using a soccer ball. Since the premise states that the children are playing soccer, it is reasonable to assume that they are engaging in activities typical of the sport, such as running around with a soccer ball. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"Two kids run around with a soccer ball\\" is entailed by the premise \\"Two young children playing soccer\\" because playing soccer logically involves running around with a soccer ball."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis promised Thursday the Pentagon will \\"notify\\" Congress before any possible military action in Syria, where the U.S. is considering responding to a suspected chemical weapons attack. \\"There will be notification to leadership, of course, prior to the attack,\\" Mattis said in his testimony at the House Armed Services Committee. \\"We will report to Congress. We will keep open lines of communication.\\" But notably, Mattis did not indicate the Trump administration would seek congressional approval before the strike, which presumably would target the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Trump says the U.S. will soon launch \\"nice and new and smart\\" missiles in response to last week's suspected poison gas attack, which left scores dead in a rebel-held area. Trump blames Assad for the attack. A U.S. attack is likely to upset a small but growing number of U.S. lawmakers who demand President Donald Trump first ask Congress to authorize any hostilities, citing the War Powers Resolution of 1973, a federal law intended to check the president's ability to wage war. U.S. presidents, both Republican and Democrat, have long argued they have legal authority to order airstrikes and other short-term military campaigns if those engagements fall short of the \\"hostilities\\" mentioned in the War Powers Resolution. Additionally, U.S. presidents have cited a pair of authorizations by Congress following the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks as justification for the near-constant U.S. strikes on Islamic militants around the world. The Trump administration has used those authorizations as justification for its current war in Syria. The U.S. has 2,000 troops in Syria, and helps lead an international coalition against Islamic State in Syria and neighboring Iraq. The overwhelming majority of U.S. lawmakers have not publicly objected to the administration's legal rationale for those missions. But as Trump considers expanding the U.S. war to include attacks on Syrian government targets, some in Congress are... According to the above context, answer the following question.

The queen, shocked and dismayed, confesses to Constance that she had sent the diamonds to the Duke of Buckingham, and her confidant goes to d'Artagnan for help. With the help of his companions, three of the finest musketeers in France, Athos, Porthos and Aramis, d'Artagnan makes his way to England to seek the Duke himself, so that he may recover the diamonds and restore the queen's honor. Still, when all problems seem overcome, the English Duke of Buckingham plans to invade France, remove King Louis XIII and marry the queen; on the other hand, Cardinal Richelieu and Milady want revenge on d'Artagnan and Buckingham.

Being depicted as faithful generally has a positive connotation because it represents trustworthiness, loyalty, and reliability. The phrase also implies that the faithfulness is voluntary and not enforced, adding to the positive charge. 2. \\"sad without being shrill\\" - This phrase has a more neutral to negative sentiment, but with a positive aspect. Being sad is typically associated with negative emotions. However, the phrase suggests that the sadness is not excessively annoying or disturbing - indicated by \\"without being shrill\\". It can be seen as a dignified sadness, thereby adding a slight positive twist to a principal negative sentiment. In conclusion: The first half of the phrase has a predominantly positive sentiment, while the second half combines both negative and positive aspects, but the negative (sadness) slightly takes prevalence. Therefore, the overall sentiment of the phrase could be considered as slightly negative, but very close to neutral considering the mitigating positive aspects in both parts.

Spokesman William Ostick declined to comment on specific details behind the decision to expel Livia Acosta Noguera, who has headed Venezuela's consulate in Miami since March 2011. The Venezuelan Embassy in Washington was informed of the decision Friday, the spokesman said in a written statement, and the State Department said Acosta must depart the United States by Tuesday. It was unclear Sunday whether she remained in the United States. Last month, a group of American lawmakers said they had \\"grave concerns\\" about Acosta and called for an investigation after the Spanish-language TV channel Univision aired a documentary alleging that she was among a group of Venezuelan and Iranian diplomats who expressed interest in an offer from a group of Mexican hackers to infiltrate the websites of the White House, the FBI, the Pentagon and U.S. nuclear plants. The evidence that the plot was real, according to Univision, are secret recordings with diplomats who ask questions about what the hackers can do and promise to send information to their governments. Univision interviewed a purported Mexican whistle-blower -- a student at the National Autonomous University of Mexico named Juan Carlos Munoz Ledo. The student told Univision he was recruited by a leftist professor who wanted to wage cyberattacks on the United States and its allies. Munoz told Univision he secretly recorded a meeting in 2008 with Acosta, who was then the cultural attache of the Venezuelan Embassy in Mexico. According to a recording Univision aired as part of its report, Acosta is heard saying that she can send the information gathered by the hackers straight to Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. Chavez has called the report \\"lies.\\" One of the Iranian diplomats told Univision that although he, indeed, was presented with a hacking plot by the Mexican group, he turned it down, in part because he thought they were CIA agents. In a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton last month, Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Rep. David Rivera, Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart and Rep. Albio Sires asked the State Department to require Acosta's \\"immediate departure\\" from the United States if the Univision report proved true. Last month a State Department spokesman said the United States did not know about the alleged plot, but that it found the Univision allegations \\"very disturbing.\\" However, \\"we don't have any information, at this point, to corroborate it,\\" State Department spokesman Mark Toner said.

After you could go out on their balcony and get some views of the old port. On our day there was a cruise ship within eye's view! They have done an admirable job in keeping some of the history and original rock and brick of the past. Artifacts behind glass are nice to gaze at to think of how time was many hundreds of years ago!

MTV has toned down its music video programming significantly in recent years, and its programming now consists mainly of original reality, comedy and drama programming and some off-network syndicated programs and films, with limited music video programming in off-peak time periods. It has received criticism towards this change of focus, both by certain segments of its audience and musicians. MTV's influence on its audience, including issues involving censorship and social activism, has also been a subject of debate for several years. - Confessions of an Action Star is an American action comedy mockumentary starring David Leitch , Angelina Jolie , Carrie - Anne Moss , Hugo Weaving , Eric Roberts , Dax Shepard , Debbie Allen , Lee Arenberg and directed by Brad Martin .

How far is it around? If you are working with a paneled shade, simply take the measurement of each panel; if you are working with a circular shade, measure the circumference (3.14 x diameter). This is necessary to find out how long and wide your strips of fabric need to be and the amount that will cover your entire shade. This is where the shade becomes all your own. Use one style of material for a battered, distressed look or use all types of coordinating colors and patterns. Just make sure they're long enough! Add one extra inch for the seam allowance. This is needed to wrap around the wire frame. If your lamp is 20\\" (51 cm) around, make sure you have fabric that, in total, amounts to at least 22\\" (56 cm) wide. You need adequate overlap to keep the wire frame from showing. Of course, greater overlap than that is always safe, too. If each strip of fabric is 2\\" (5 cm) across, have at least 11 strips of fabric ready. This ensures that it stays neat, doesn't fray, and looks professional. The edges will only be seen from the inside of your lamp. If you're pressed for time or simply can't be bothered, a simple trim is fine. Using your 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) on either side, affix the strip to the top of the shade with a staple gun, hot glue gun, or needle and thread. Repeat for the bottom. If you use a hot glue gun and glue the material to the wire, you will not be able to gather the fabric when it's finished. If you use a staple gun, it's a good idea to add decorative trim around the top and bottom to obscure those tiny metallic lines from view. You can gather the material together if you stapled or used a needle and thread. Adjust the material to achieve the look you want. Beads, tassles, or extra ribbon can be added onto the top and bottom of your shade to hide any less-than-perfect areas or simply to add more flair.","output":"The article discusses the process of measuring and creating a custom lampshade using fabric strips. To determine the measurements, one should measure the distance between the top and bottom wires of the lampshade and the circumference if it's circular. This is essential to know the required length and width of the fabric strips. The lampshade's design can vary according to personal preference, from a distressed look with one material to a mix of coordinating colors and patterns. Always add an extra inch for the seam allowance, ensuring adequate overlap to hide the wireframe. For instance, if a lamp is 20 inches around, a fabric width of at least 22 inches is needed. If each fabric strip is 2 inches wide, prepare at least 11 strips. To maintain a neat and professional appearance, the edges of the fabric can be trimmed. To affix the fabric strips to the lampshade, use a staple gun, hot glue gun, or needle and thread. Keep in mind that if a hot glue gun is used, it is not possible to gather the fabric afterwards. To hide any staples, decorative trim can be added around the top and bottom of the lampshade. Adjust the material based on the desired look, and consider additional embellishments such as beads, tassels, or extra ribbon to hide any imperfections or add flair. Overall, the goal is to create a personalized lampshade with a professional finish and appearance according to one's taste and style."},{"instruction":"What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"I laje it Somali lake it\\" The answer to this question is:","output":"It is difficult to determine the star rating from the given text \\"I laje it Somali lake it\\" since it appears to contain spelling errors, grammatical mistakes, and unclear expressions.

Which area is less likely to have acid rain? Beijing recently opened several new coal-fired power plants over the last few months. In Montreal, there have been large reductions in sulfur oxides produced by manufacturing plants after a recent referendum. Hint: One result of air pollution is acid rain. Acid rain is precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust. Answer:","output":"Montreal is less likely to have acid rain.

The decision to release the prisoners follows \\"numerous requests\\" from their family members and religious institutions, and is a humanitarian gesture, said Cuban President Raul Castro. Among those who might be freed are prisoners over the age of 60, along with those who are sick, female or young with no previous criminal record. With some exceptions, prisoners convicted of spying, terrorism, murder and drug trafficking will not be released. Those who will be freed have already served a \\"important\\" part of their sentences and exhibited good behavior, according to an official statement published on the state-run website Cubadebate. The jailed American, Gross, will not be among those pardoned, the Cuban Interests Section in Washington said. Gross was jailed in December 2009, when he was working as a subcontractor on a U.S. Agency for International Development project aimed at spreading democracy. Castro has accused him of importing satellite equipment to connect dissidents to the Internet, and this year Cuba's highest court upheld the 15-year sentence imposed on Gross for committing crimes against the security of the state. He has maintained his innocence and said he was trying to help connect the Jewish community to the Internet. Castro, speaking to the National Assembly, said that 86 prisoners from 25 countries would be among those released in coming days. He cited the upcoming visit of Pope Benedict XVI as one of the motivations behind the move, which he said showed the \\"generosity and strength of the revolution.\\" The pope has said he plans to visit Mexico and Cuba before Easter.

She may also react positively with a nod or laugh when you say something amusing. Step 2: Notice if she initiates conversations or tries to spend time with you. Girls who like you may try to engage in conversation with you more often than others.

If she appears to give you more attention or seems more enthusiastic when talking to you compared to others, it can be a sign that she likes you. Step 4: Look for any signs of flirting. Girls may flirt with someone they like by teasing them, engaging in playful banter, or making subtle physical contact. They may also give compliments or make subtle attempts to show their interest. Step 5: Ask for a friend's opinion. Sometimes it can be helpful to consult a friend that who knows the both of you to give their insight on whether they believe the girl likes you. A third-party perspective can help to provide additional information and context. Step 6: Get to know her better. If you suspect that she may like you, spend more time getting to know her on a personal level. Discover her interests, hobbies, and values to find common ground and build a stronger connection. This will also help you gauge her interest in you. Step 7: Observe if her behavior changes over time. If her attention towards you remains consistent or even increases over time, it is more likely that she likes you.

With no official heir apparent, the Macedonian military command split, with one side proclaiming Alexander's half-brother Philip III Arrhidaeus (r. 323 – 317 BC) as king and the other siding with the infant son of Alexander and Roxana, Alexander IV (r. 323 – 309 BC). Except for the Euboeans and Boeotians, the Greeks also immediately rose up in a rebellion against Antipater known as the Lamian War (323–322 BC). When Antipater was defeated at the 323 BC Battle of Thermopylae, he fled to Lamia where he was besieged by the Athenian commander Leosthenes. A Macedonian army led by Leonnatus rescued Antipater by lifting the siege. Antipater defeated the rebellion, yet his death in 319 BC left a power vacuum wherein the two proclaimed kings of Macedonia became pawns in a power struggle between the diadochi, the former generals of Alexander's army.A council of the army convened in Babylon immediately after Alexander's death, naming Philip III as king and the chiliarch Perdiccas as his regent. Antipater, Antigonus Monophthalmus, Craterus, and Ptolemy formed a coalition against Perdiccas in a civil war initiated by Ptolemy's seizure of the hearse of Alexander the Great. Perdiccas was assassinated in 321 BC by his own officers during a failed campaign in Egypt against Ptolemy, where his march along the Nile River resulted in the drowning of 2,000 of his men. Although Eumenes of Cardia managed to kill Craterus in battle, this had little to no effect on the outcome of the 321 BC Partition of Triparadisus in Syria where the victorious coalition settled the issue of a new regency and territorial rights. Antipater was appointed as regent over the two kings. Before Antipater died in 319 BC, he named the staunch Argead loyalist Polyperchon as his successor, passing over his own son Cassander and ignoring the right of the king to choose a new regent... contains an answer for the question: Who named Polyperchon as his successor?, what is it ?

The finding from a 10-year study of more than 7,000 British government workers contradicts previous notions that cognitive decline does not begin before 60 years of age, and it could have far-reaching implications for dementia research. Pinpointing the age at which memory, reasoning and comprehension skills start to deteriorate is important because drugs are most likely to work if given when people first start to experience mental impairment. A handful of novel medicines for Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, are currently in clinical trials, but expectations are low and some experts fear the new drugs are being tested in patients who may be too old to show a benefit. The research team led by Archana Singh-Manoux from the Center for Research in Epidemiology and Population Health in France and University College London found a modest decline in mental reasoning in men and women aged 45-49 years. \\"We were expecting to see no decline, based on past research,\\" Singh-Manoux said in a telephone interview. Among older subjects in the study, the average decline in cognitive function was greater, but there was a wide variation at all ages, with a third of individuals aged 45-70 showing no deterioration over the period. \\"It doesn't suddenly happen when you get old. That variability exists much earlier on,\\" Singh-Manoux said. \\"The next step is going to be to tease that apart and look for links to risk factors.\\" HEALTHY LIFESTYLE Participants were assessed three times during the study, using tests for memory, vocabulary, and aural and visual comprehension skills. Over the 10-year period, there was a 3.6 percent decline in mental reasoning in both men and women aged 45-49 at the start of the study, while the decline for men aged 65-70 was 9.6 percent and 7.4 percent for women. Since the youngest individuals at the start of the study were 45, it is possible that the decline in cognition might have commenced even earlier. Singh-Manoux said the results may also have underestimated the cognitive decline in the broader population, since the office workers in the study enjoyed a relatively privileged and healthy lifestyle. Factors affecting cardiovascular function -- such as obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and smoking -- are believed to impact the development of Alzheimer's and vascular dementia through effects on brain blood vessels and brain cells. The research findings were published in the British Medical Journal, alongside an editorial by Francine Grodstein of the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, who described the results as convincing. Most research into dementia has focused on people aged 65 and over. In future, scientists will need to devise long-term clinical studies that include much younger age groups and may have to enroll tens of thousands of participants, she said. One way to deal with this \\"major challenge\\" might be to use computerised cognitive assessment tests, rather than face-to-face interviews, although more research is still needed on this approach, she added. SOURCE: bit.ly/xmiz8B BMJ, January 5, 2012. ||||| Sorry, Boomers, but a new study suggests that memory, reasoning and comprehension can start to slip as early as age 45. This finding runs counter to conventional wisdom that mental decline doesn't begin before 60, the researchers added. \\"Cognitive function in normal, healthy adults begins to decline earlier than previously thought,\\" said study author Archana Singh-Manoux. \\"It is widely believed that cognitive ability does not decline before the age of 60. We were able to show robust cognitive decline even in individuals aged 45 to 49 years,\\" added Singh-Manoux, research director at INSERM's Center for Research in Epidemiology & Population Health at the Paul-Brousse Hospital in Paris. These findings should be put in context of the link between cognitive function and the dementia, Singh-Manoux said. \\"Previous research shows small differences in cognitive performance in earlier life to predict larger differences in risk of dementia in later life,\\" she said. Understanding cognitive aging might enable early identification of those at risk for dementia, Singh-Manoux said. The report was published in the Jan. 5 issue of BMJ. For the study, Singh-Manoux and colleagues collected data on nearly 5,200 men and 2,200 women who took part in the Whitehall II cohort study. The study, which began in 1985, followed British civil servants from the age of 45 to 70. Over 10 years, starting in 1997, the participants' cognitive function was tested three times. The researchers assessed memory, vocabulary, hearing and vision. Singh-Manoux's group found that over time, test scores for memory, reasoning and vocabulary skills all dropped. The decline was faster among the older participants, they added. Among men aged 45 to 49, reasoning skills declined by nearly 4 percent, and for those aged 65 to 70 those skills dropped by about nearly 10 percent. For women, the decline in reasoning approached 5 percent for those aged 45 to 49 and about 7 percent for those 65 to 70, the researchers found. \\"Greater awareness of the fact that our cognitive status is not intact until deep old age might lead individuals to make changes in their lifestyle and improve [their] cardiovascular health, to reduce risk of adverse cognitive outcomes in old age,\\" Singh-Manoux said. Research shows that \\"what is good for the heart is good for the head,\\" which makes living a healthy lifestyle a part of slowing cognitive decline, she said. Targeting patients who have risk factors for heart disease such as obesity, high blood pressure and high cholesterol might not only protect their hearts but also prevent dementia in old age, the researchers said. \\"Understanding cognitive aging will be one of the challenges of this century,\\" especially as people are living longer, they added. In addition, knowing when cognitive decline is likely to start can help in treatment, because the earlier treatment starts the more likely it is to be effective, the researchers noted. Francine Grodstein, an associate professor of medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and author of an accompanying editorial, said more research is needed into how to prevent early cognitive decline. \\"If cognitive decline may start at younger ages, then efforts to prevent cognitive decline may need to start at younger ages,\\" she said. \\"New research should focus on understanding what factors may contribute to cognitive decline in younger persons,\\" Grodstein added. \\"This is consistent with what we have seen in other studies and the cognitive changes that occur as we age,\\" said Heather M. Snyder, senior associate director of medical & scientific relations at the Alzheimer's Association. These changes do not mean that all these people will go on to develop Alzheimer's disease or another dementia, Snyder noted. \\"It is important to remember that the cognitive changes associated with aging are very different from the cognitive changes that are associated with Alzheimer's disease,\\" she stressed. Although some of these people may go on to develop Alzheimer's disease there is currently no way to tell who is at risk, Snyder said. \\"This is why it is so important to continue to investigate biological changes that occur in the earliest stages, because it is difficult to [determine] the cognitive changes that are associated with Alzheimer's disease,\\" she said. Snyder noted that Alzheimer's disease can start 15 to 20 years before symptoms are apparent, which makes finding a biological marker so important. \\"If a therapeutic is available, we can intervene at that point,\\" she said.

The prima donna was normally, but not necessarily, a soprano. The corresponding term for the male lead (almost always a tenor) is primo uomo. - Elisabeth Olin née Lillström ( December 1740 -- 26 March 1828 ) , was a Swedish opera singer and a music composer . She performed the leading female role in the inauguration performance of the Royal Swedish Opera in 1773 , and is referred to as the first Swedish Opera prima donna . She was the first female to be made Hovsångare ( 1773 ) , and the first woman to become a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music ( 1782 ) . - Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor. - Tenor is a type of classical male singing voice whose vocal range is one of the highest of the male voice types. The tenor's vocal range (in choral music) lies between C, the C one octave below middle C, and A, the A above middle C. In solo work, this range extends up to C, or \\"tenor high C\\". The low extreme for tenors is roughly A (two As below middle C). At the highest extreme, some tenors can sing up to two Fs above middle C (F). The tenor voice type is generally divided into the \\"leggero\\" tenor, lyric tenor, spinto tenor, dramatic tenor, heldentenor, and tenor buffo or spieltenor. - An orchestra is a large instrumental ensemble typical of classical music, which features string instruments such as violin, viola, cello and double bass, as well as brass, woodwinds, and percussion instruments, grouped in sections. Other instruments such as the piano and celesta may sometimes appear in a fifth keyboard section or may stand alone, as may the concert harp and, for performances of some modern compositions, electronic instruments. - A soprano is a type of classical female singing voice and has the highest vocal range of all voice types. The soprano's vocal range (using scientific pitch notation) is from approximately middle C (C) = 261 Hz to \\"high A\\" (A) =880 Hz in choral music, or to \\"soprano C\\" (C, two octaves above middle C) =1046 Hz or higher in operatic music. In four-part chorale style harmony, the soprano takes the highest part, which usually encompasses the melody. The soprano voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, soubrette, lyric, spinto, and dramatic soprano. The lyric soprano is the most common female singing voice. Given the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'voice type' with the subject 'elisabeth olin'.

In light of the controversy surrounding the naming of the park without proper permission, the group working on the park project in East Hunsbury, Northamptonshire, convened to formally decide on a name for the newly developed public space. After much deliberation and considering the contributions made by Andre Gonzalez De Savage and his eight-year-old son, Adam, the group ultimately decided to call the park \\"Adam's Park\\" in recognition of the young boy's involvement in the council planning team. Despite the initial objections to the unauthorized naming, the official decision to name the park after Adam was met with both understanding and support from the community. Many acknowledged the youngster's efforts in helping to create a better public space for residents and visitors alike and felt that the updated name served as an inspiring reminder of the importance and impact of civic engagement, even at a young age. Council officials have since approved the decision and restored the \\"Adam's Park\\" sign, this time with the necessary permissions in place. As a result, Andre Gonzalez De Savage expressed his gratitude to the council and the community for understanding the significance of the park's name and allowing his son to be recognized for his contributions. Moving forward, it is expected that this situation will serve as a lesson in due diligence and proper processes for all involved in community projects, which can ensure a harmonious and collaborative approach to future endeavors.

However, this demand has not always been met with an equal supply of adequate housing solutions. This article aims to explore the disparity between the number of people and available housing units and to answer the question: How many more people are there than housing units? Step 1: Collecting Data To begin this analysis, it would be essential to gather accurate data on both the global population and housing units from reliable sources. Databases such as the World Bank, Worldometer, or the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) can provide current numbers on population, while statistics on housing units may be found from national housing ministries, the International Housing Partnership (IHP), or the World House Price Index (WHPI). Step 2: Analyzing the Data With reliable data at hand, we can proceed to compare the numbers. Comparing the total number of people with the total number of housing units will give us an overall perspective of the existing gap. To accentuate this understanding, we could compute the ratio of people to housing units – a higher ratio would suggest that there are more people than housing units. It is essential to consider factors such as urbanization and population density when interpreting this ratio. Moving beyond a global level, a country or regional analysis would offer detailed insights into the disparity between population and housing units, taking factors such as income distribution, affordability of housing, and migration into account. This ensures a more accurate and holistic perspective. Step 3: Identifying Causes It's important to understand the factors contributing to this disparity. Possible reasons could include a lack of investment in infrastructure, slow housing construction rates, or regulatory restrictions that hinder the availability of residential land for development. Furthermore, population growth could be contributing to the lack of housing units, putting a strain on already limited resources. Identifying the causes allows us to understand how the gap between people and housing units arises and persists. Step 4: Addressing the Situation As the disparity between population and housing units directly affects the quality of life for millions and exacerbates issues like homelessness and overcrowding, it is vital to work towards viable solutions. Governments, local bodies, and the private sector can collaborate to implement policies and initiatives that address the housing crisis. This could include increasing investment in affordable housing, streamlining building regulations, and promoting sustainable construction practices that can keep up with the growing population. Conclusion While it is difficult to provide a precise numerical difference between the number of people and housing units worldwide without access to real-time data, the gap undoubtedly exists and continues to grow. Governments and other stakeholders must urgently address this issue to ensure that everyone has access to a safe, secure, and affordable place to call home."},{"instruction":"What is the version of the following sentence with correct punctuation?

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is nucleotide that stores genetic information. DNA contains deoxyribose (so-called because it has one less atom of oxygen than ribose) plus one phosphate group and one nitrogen-containing base. The “choices” of base for DNA are adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a ribose-containing nucleotide that helps manifest the genetic code as protein. RNA contains ribose, one phosphate group, and one nitrogen-containing base, but the “choices” of base for RNA are adenine, cytosine, guanine, and uracil. The nitrogen-containing bases adenine and guanine are classified as purines. A purine is a nitrogen-containing molecule with a double ring structure, which accommodates several nitrogen atoms. The bases cytosine, thymine (found in DNA only) and uracil (found in RNA only) are pyramidines. A pyramidine is a nitrogen-containing base with a single ring structure Bonds formed by dehydration synthesis between the pentose sugar of one nucleic acid monomer and the phosphate group of another form a “backbone,” from which the components’ nitrogen-containing bases protrude. In DNA, two such backbones attach at their protruding bases via hydrogen bonds. These twist to form a shape known as a double helix (Figure 2.29). The sequence of nitrogen-containing bases within a strand of DNA form the genes that act as a molecular code instructing cells in the assembly of amino acids into proteins. Humans have almost 22,000 genes in their DNA, locked up in the 46 chromosomes inside the nucleus of each cell (except red blood cells which lose their nuclei during development).

It was, of course, Pete. Pete was the night shift guy at Crossroads Detox across town. Ray called it the Jesus Shop because it was wholly supported by a contingent of local churches who saw addicts as a potential ministry. Apparently Jesus saved--not only from sin and hell, but also from Dark Eyed Jim Beam. Pete was a relatively innocuous born again fundie who volunteered his time two or three nights a week. When he was not saving the world, his Clark Kent was actually a steady CPA job with the local H&R Block. He'd been pulling shifts for about six months, knew nothing about drugs beyond that bad people used them to escape their problems and that they were tools of Satan, and he always needed Ray's advice about one thing or another. This arrangement was not problematic as Pete had long ago given up trying to convert him. Pete was also the only guy in the city who was, as Ray figured it, making less money than he was at such an hour. In return for Ray's magnanimity, Pete had done Ray's taxes for free last year. They had never actually met, though Ray had faxed him the tax forms and Pete had faxed back a photo of his two pre-teen daughters and his geriatric Lab. \\"What's the problem?\\" Ray asked. \\"I have a recalcitrant.\\" That's what he called them, the drunk and definitely disorderly.

Cooper told FOX411 that Chris Kyle was “such an interesting charismatic figure as a man,” and how awful it was when he was murdered by another former soldier before they made the film. “It just became quite a responsibility to tell the story,” Cooper said. “We felt like we wanted to tell it, and Taya said you know, if you’re going to do it, do it right, get it right, and let’s tell it now.” The film’s positive reception by the Academy Awards – six nominations including Best Picture and Best Actor for Cooper -- was a big surprise. But the most rewarding reactions to the film, Cooper says, have been from veterans. “It's been incredible, just incredible the amount of response. It’s everything we could have possibly hoped for,” he said. “In the sense of people feeling like even though it's a movie it's accurate enough, and in terms of the emotional and sort of familial sort of sense of reality that it's completely accurate.\\" Miller said having Taya on board was key. “She had tons of home videos and we read all of their email correspondence when he was on tour. She kept everything because she never knew whether he'd make it back,” Miller told FOX411. “You know, when you have access to that kind of information you get a side to someone that no one really ever sees. You see the family man, you see how loving he was, and I think that Bradley really brings that heart, that balance between him as the military man but also this soulful, loving father.\\" Cooper said playing Kyle provided insight into the lives of soldiers and their families. “It was a keyhole into that life,” he said. “One thing that we were able to do was explore this man's life and this woman's life and their children and their family and in doing so hopefully get just a nugget, a kernel of truth, that people who actually have gone through it and are going through it can relate to it and not feel alone.” “American Sniper” opens in theaters nationwide January 16th.

With a bit of research and some smart decisions, you can achieve a trendy and comfortable look that adheres to your school's dress code. This article will guide you through the essential steps and offer advice for building an efficient wardrobe that proves both stylish and appropriate. Step 1: Discover Your School's Dress Code Before you start shopping, it's important to understand the specific dress code set by your school. Find out if there are any restrictions or specific requirements that you need to adhere to. This information can usually be found in the school handbook, on the school's website, or by asking a guidance counselor or teacher. Step 2: Invest in Staple Items Once you know the guidelines, focus on building your wardrobe around a few staple items. A pair of comfortable dress pants and a versatile blazer are essential for any professional wardrobe. These can be mixed and matched with a variety of tops to create different looks that are appropriate for school. Step 3: Choose Breathable Fabrics As you'll be wearing these clothes for extended periods, it's crucial to opt for breathable and comfortable fabrics. Look for dress shirts and tops made from materials like cotton, linen, or moisture-wicking synthetic blends. These fabrics will help to keep you cool and dry throughout the day. Step 4: Easy Washing and Cleaning Select clothing that is simple to wash and maintain, as you'll need to keep your professional wardrobe in tip-top condition. Avoid items that require dry cleaning or special care, and instead, go for machine-washable and wrinkle-resistant options. Step 5: Abide by Modesty Guidelines While you may see many fashionable and trendy clothing options available, it's critical to keep your school's dress code in mind. Avoid any low cut, skin-revealing, or provocative clothing. Stick to conservative and modest options, as they will ensure that you adhere to the dress code and project a professional image. Step 6: Opt for Supportive Shoes Footwear is often overlooked, but it plays a significant role in your overall comfort and professional appearance. Opt for close-toed shoes with good support, such as loafers, flats, or Oxfords. Avoid high heels, as they can be uncomfortable and cause health issues in the long run. Always consider the school's specific dress code when selecting footwear. Conclusion: Building a professional wardrobe for school may seem challenging, but by adhering to your institution's dress code and focusing on comfort, you can create an efficient and stylish wardrobe.

Step 2: Summary Begin the review with a brief summary of the movie, focusing on key plot points but avoiding spoilers. \\"The Emoji Movie,\\" released in 2017, follows the journey of an emoji named Gene, who is supposed to be a 'meh' emoji but has trouble sticking to just one emotion. Along with his friends Hi-5 and Jailbreak, Gene goes on an adventure to find a code that will fix him so he can fit in with the other emojis in their world of Textopolis – all while trying to save their world from being deleted. Step 3: Discuss the negatives List the problems with the movie, such as plot, pacing, acting, special effects, and any other aspects that were disappointing. I found \\"The Emoji Movie\\" to be an undeniable disappointment, marred by an uninspired and overly simplistic plot. The premise of the film revolves around the idea that each emoji must adhere to their designated emotion, a concept that felt limiting and overly simplistic from the start. Additionally, the pacing of the film was uneven, resulting in numerous scenes that felt drawn-out and unnecessary. This issue was compounded by the movie's heavy reliance on tired pop culture references and jokes that have been overused in countless other films. The acting was similarly underwhelming, as the voice actors failed to imbue their characters with any sense of depth or personality. This led to a roster of one-dimensional characters that felt more like caricatures than nuanced representations of real people. Furthermore, the movie's reliance on familiar smartphone app icons felt like a blatant attempt to cash in on the popularity of these apps, rather than providing any original or innovative content. Consequently, much of the film's runtime felt like an extended advertisement for apps and services that many viewers are already intimately familiar with. Step 4: Discuss missed opportunities or potential Comment on how the movie could have succeeded or its potential for improvement. \\"The Emoji Movie\\" had the potential to delve into the theme of individualism and the struggle to find one's place in a world with rigid expectations, but the film never quite manages to do anything meaningful with this premise. Alternatively, the movie could have embraced its unique setting to offer viewers an imaginative and visually stunning portrayal of life inside a smartphone, but it ignored this opportunity as well. Step 5: Conclusion Wrap up the review with a final, negative evaluation and a brief summary of your thoughts. In conclusion, \\"The Emoji Movie\\" is a poorly executed film that fails to deliver on its premise or engage its audience in any meaningful way. Riddled with clichéd humor, one-dimensional characters, and squandered potential, I cannot recommend this movie to anyone seeking a quality animated film experience."},{"instruction":"I am currently waiting for peer reviews of two books I’ve worked on: one sole-authored, one co-authored. We don’t talk much about the experience of waiting for reviews, and it’s not something that appears to have been researched. Yet it’s something everyone doing academic work has to go through and it may be bad for our mental health. I’m finding it particularly difficult at the moment because a lot rides on these reviews. The sole-authored book, which is on a contentious topic, has already had one set of reviews. Reviewer 1 was utterly damning, saying “I couldn’t find anything to praise”. Luckily, Reviewers 2 and 3 were more measured, offering both praise and constructive criticism, and their input helped me to revise and strengthen the typescript. However, in the process, my editor and I realised that we needed further reviews from people with a particular kind of specialist knowledge. My editor approached around ten potential reviewers, but only one agreed to do the job. So I’m gibbering – what if that person agrees with Reviewer 1? The co-authored book is in a contentious format. My co-authors and I decided that I would be the person to liaise with publishers, as I have form in this process. The last time I liaised with academic publishers for a co-authored book was in the early 2000s, and I’d forgotten how heavily responsible it makes me feel. Fortunately, I’ve found a publisher that is interested and has sent the book out for reviews, to two professional academics and two students. This is great – and terrifying – but at least there are four reviewers. Even so, what if they all think it’s rubbish? In many ways I love the peer review system. I welcome feedback on my writing, and I’m not at all averse to constructive criticism. I am by no means arrogant enough to think I can write a good book without input from others. Yet peer review, as a process, is fraught with uncertainty. Comments may not be constructive, or may not come at all. They may be positive, or negative, or in between, or a mixture. Question: Who did the author and their co-authors decide that they should liaise with? Options: - not enough information - editors - reviewers - publishers === The correct answer is The answer to this question is:","output":"The author and their co-authors decided that the author should liaise with publishers."},{"instruction":"Which is this about? Eight months after their contract expired, London #39;s outside workers remain without a new deal. Contract talks are not scheduled and none have been held since June when new city manager Jeff Fielding arrived","output":"This situation is about the contract negotiations between London's outside workers, who are employees responsible for various public services such as maintenance, waste management, and transportation services, and the city officials. The workers' contract expired eight months ago, but they have not yet been able to secure a new deal. This has led to a prolonged period of uncertainty for the workers, as they are unsure of their job security, benefits, and future prospects within their current roles. The primary reason for the lack of progress is the absence of any scheduled contract talks between the two parties. In fact, no contract negotiations have taken place since June, which is when the new city manager, Jeff Fielding, took office. It is likely that Fielding is focused on other pressing issues or has different priorities in his new role, which has led to the contract dispute with outside workers being pushed to the side. This situation has several implications for both the outside workers and London as a city. Without a new contract in place, there could be potential impacts on employee morale, their motivation to continue working in their current roles, and an increased likelihood of labor disputes or strike actions, which could disrupt essential services. For the outside workers, not having a new contract in place means that they are not receiving any negotiated pay increases, benefits, or improved working conditions that they may have been anticipating. This can create a sense of frustration among employees, who may feel that their work is undervalued and that their needs are not being considered or respected by city officials. Additionally, employees may be concerned about job security in the absence of a contract. They may worry that their positions are not guaranteed and that they could be subject to sudden changes in their employment status or working conditions. This uncertainty can lead to a decrease in job satisfaction and overall well-being, as well as negatively affecting the climate within the workplace. For the city of London, the lack of a new contract for outside workers could pose several risks. First and foremost, there is the potential for disruptions to essential city services if workers were to go on strike as a result of the ongoing contract dispute. These disruptions could impact the daily lives of London residents, affecting public transport, waste management, and maintenance of public spaces, among other services. Furthermore, with the contract negotiations stalled, London may struggle to attract and retain the best talent in these roles, as potential employees may be deterred by the job insecurity and the perceived lack of investment in employee well-being. This could result in a shortage of skilled outside workers, negatively impacting London's ability to provide high-quality public services to its residents. In conclusion, this situation involves contract negotiations between London's outside workers and city officials, specifically the new city manager, Jeff Fielding. The workers have been without a new contract for eight months, with no scheduled contract talks in sight. This lack of progress could have negative implications for employee morale, job security, and service disruptions, which could ultimately affect the quality of public services delivered to the residents of London. It is in the best interest of both parties to prioritize resolving this issue and establish a new contract that benefits both the outside workers and the city as a whole."},{"instruction":"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: The events that unfold prior to the main timeline in the movie are introduced in narration (uncredited Ian McShane), and takes us to 700 AD.

The other two apprentices, Balthazar Blake (Nicolas Cage) and Veronica (Monica Bellucci) arrive at Merlin's stronghold in time to learn of the deception and discover that Morgana was attempting to steal a spell from Merlin's spell book that would allow her to awaken dead wizards and sorcerers and rule the world, The Rising.Morgana overpowers Merlin with Horvath's help and fatally wounds him before retrieving the evil spell. Balthazar and Veronica duel with Morgana while Horvath escapes. As a last resort, Veronica uses a spell to absorb Morgana's soul into her own body to stop her but Morgana begins to kill Veronica from the inside.

M.I.A. secured a record deal with XL Recordings after Frischmann's manager overheard the demo. M.I.A. began work on the album by composing lyrics and melodies, and she programmed drum beats at home on the drum machine. Having produced rough tracks via trial and error, she honed the finished songs in collaboration with other writer-producers. Through these collaborations, she sought to produce a diverse style and \\"drag [her collaborators] out of their boxes, musically\\".DJ Diplo introduced elements of Brazilian baile funk to \\"Bucky Done Gun\\". Fellow composer-producer Richard X worked on the track \\"Hombre\\", which featured a drum pattern created from the sounds made by toys that M.I.A. had bought in India, augmented with sounds produced by objects such as pens and mobile phones. Steve Mackey and Ross Orton, known professionally as Cavemen, worked on \\"Galang\\", which M.I.A. had initially produced with her 505 and a basic four-track tape recorder. Working with Cavemen in a professional studio, she added a bass line and new vocals to give the song \\"a more analogue sound\\" than was possible with the 505. The track was co-written by Frischmann, whose input M.I.A. described as \\"refreshing\\". She initially hoped to feature guest vocalists on..., can you guess it ?

The Japanese forces with superior air power went on to dislodge the Nationalist Chinese forces, who had been invited by the British for the region's defence, by November 1942. The Thai Phayap Army accompanied the Japanese forces on the invasion, including that of Kengtung in May 1942. The IJA allowed the Phayap Army to occupy Kengtung and parts of Mongpan state.

The Thai army would remain there until the end of the war although the Thai government began to alter its position when the tide of war began to favour the allies. After the Phibun government fell in August 1944, the new government of Khuang Aphaiwong communicated to the British government it renounced all claims to the Shan states and northern Malaya, and that it would immediately return the territories to Britain.

Reasoning: Research has shown that learning a second language can bring about a multitude of cognitive benefits. For one, it can improve memory, as the brain continuously processes, stores, and recalls new vocabulary and grammar rules. It also enhances problem-solving abilities and critical thinking skills, as individuals learn to navigate complex linguistic structures and comprehend different meanings depending on the context. Bilingualism also encourages mental flexibility, as it requires switching between two languages and adjusting to different linguistic frameworks.

She and her family are French, but live in Vietnam where her mother is a schoolteacher to local children. Her weak-willed mother, violent older brother, and timid younger brother live in a rural section across the river. The girl is a loner but an excellent student, who dreams of being a writer. The girl meets the Chinese man when crossing the river on the ferry to return to the city after a school holiday. He is the son of a businessman whose fortune was made in real estate, and has recently returned from Paris after dropping out of school. He has the look but lacks the self-assurance of the playboy he fancies himself to be, and he is mesmerized the first time he sees her standing by the rail on a crowded ferry crossing the Mekong River. After some awkward conversation, he offers her a ride to Saigon in his chauffeur-driven limousine and she accepts, although the two barely speak during the drive.

It cannot be easy to bring all these family dynamics into the plot and have them make sense, it is truly a great acting accomplishment. I can't wait for the next season.. We all have a little \\"Transparent\\" in our families.

It made eight comedy pilots, put them on the Internet, and then selected the best two to expand into full series. The original batch of pilots all had a DIY, goofy, occasionally experimental vibe, excepting Garry Trudeau’s congressmen comedy Alpha House, which alone looked like a show that could air on a old-fashioned, broadcast-to-a-television network. (It was one of the shows Amazon picked up). Last week, Amazon unveiled five new pilots, and it’s clear they have learned an important lesson about original content in the interim, one Netflix has long since grasped: If you want to make a splash as a fledgling provider of must-see TV, make something that could be on HBO. Call it the House of Cards precept: Your brand may be all about originality, binge-watching, and fresh business models, but that only works if you give the people a show that looks like one they already happily pay for. Amazon has finally made one of those. Amazon’s new pilots are more professional and slick than the cute, homemade series it previously commissioned. The two dramas, Bosch, about a tortured LA cop named Hieronymus Bosch—yes, the show lays it on that thick—and The After, a post-apocalyptic drama from The X-Files’ Chris Carter that stars a French actress wholly unequipped to act in English, are both mediocre versions of network series, with additional cursing. They aren’t any good, but it’s easy to imagine some version of them airing in the summer on NBC. One of the comedies, The Rebels—if Major League were about a Los Angeles football team—is only better because it’s shorter. Mozart in the Jungle, created by Roman Coppola, Jason Schwartzman, and Alex Timbers and set in the world of New York classical musicians, is sweet and charming if a little unformed. It does, at least, feature Gael García Bernal as Rodrigo, a swashbuckling conductor with cockatoo hair, alongside television’s very first female oboist as a protagonist. Advertisement But towering above all of these shows is Jill Soloway’s Transparent, an honest to goodness great pilot that feels—and I mean this as a compliment—exactly like one of those HBO shows with a 1-to-1 ratio of viewers to think pieces. Ostensibly a half-hour comedy, Transparent is very much like Louie and Girls in its relationship to humor, which is conditional. It stars Gaby Hoffmann, Jay Duplass, and Amy Landecker as three grown, Los Angelino siblings and Jeffrey Tambor and Judith Light as their divorced parents—a cast that makes for as good company as it sounds like it should. The show’s title is a pun, but Soloway, who was a big part of Six Feet Under, is interested in transparency as more than a play on words. Tambor’s character tells Hoffman’s, “It’s so hard when someone sees something you do not want them to see,” and she shrugs him off, preferring to pretend she’s better at camouflaging her unhappiness than she actually is. Everyone in the family is hiding feelings they only think they are hiding, particularly about sex, desire, and gender, which, needless to say, are the most enticing kind of hang-ups. |||||","output":"\\"Transparent\\" is a unique TV show about people who live very emotional and wonderful lives.

I found the following answer on Google: As of 2010, Romania is an upper-middle-income country with a high human development index. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"Yes, your answer is partially correct in terms of economic status and human development index. As of 2010, Romania was classified as an upper-middle-income country with a high human development index. However, to provide a more detailed and comprehensive understanding of what Romania is like, let's look at information beyond its economic status. Romania is a southeastern European country, known for its rich history, diverse culture, and beautiful landscapes. It covers 238,391 square kilometers (92,043 square miles) and has a population of around 19 million people. The official language is Romanian, and the currency is the Romanian Leu (RON). Geographically, Romania is characterized by diverse landscapes, ranging from the Carpathian Mountains running through the center of the country, the Danube River bordering the south, and the forested region of Transylvania in the northwest. This variety in terrain lends itself to a range of outdoor activities, including skiing, hiking, and wildlife watching. Romania's history is a blend of different cultural elements, due to its strategic location at the crossroads of Central and Southeast Europe. Its historical influences include Romans, Dacians, Hungarians, Turks, and Slavs, with significant impacts on Romania's art, architecture, and cultural heritage. Romania is home to several UNESCO World Heritage Sites, such as the Dacian Fortresses of the Orăştie Mountains and the painted monasteries of Bukovina. Romanians are often described as warm, friendly, and hospitable people who are proud of their cultural heritage. Traditional arts and crafts are cherished, with many locals skilled in pottery, weaving, woodcarving, and painting. Romania is also well-known for its traditional cuisine, which features flavorful soups, meat dishes, and desserts made with local ingredients like fruits, vegetables, and nuts. Romania has managed to transition from a socialist economy to a market-based economy since the 1989 Revolution. Over the past few decades, the country has experienced steady economic growth and political stability, resulting in improved living standards for its people. Romania is now a member of the European Union, the United Nations, and NATO, and it has built strong connections with other countries worldwide. In conclusion, while the economic status and human development index are relevant indicators, Romania's identity goes well beyond those metrics. Its diverse landscapes, cultural heritage, and people make Romania a unique and vibrant country in Europe."},{"instruction":"Available choices: a). No. b). Yes.

But you know you’re running in vain. The robots are coming and this forest won’t hide you for long. When the robot uprising happens, you’ll have Google—or Alphabet, as its parent company is soon to be called—to thank for those robots’ ability to track through the world. Its subsidiary Boston Dynamics has taught its Atlas robot, which was the backbone for many of the robots at the recent DARPA Robotics Challenge, how to find its way out in the world. According to Popular Science, the engineers sent the Atlas robot out into the world for the first time, trailed by someone carrying a power pack tethered to the robot. In the future, however, it will be able to wander on its own, Boston Dynamics founder Marc Raibert said at a recent conference hosted by the Fab Foundation. Atlas, initially appearing to look like a drunk person stumbling home through the woods after an exceedingly heavy night, seems to have perfected the ability to walk, and even jog, in the woods. Raibert said that Atlas’ mobility is “in shooting range” of a human’s, but not quite up to that standard yet. YouTube/Michael Campbell Terrifying. And if that’s not terrifying enough, the engineers at Boston Dynamics—seemingly taking inspiration from the evil kid in the first “Toy Story” movie—have made a robot dog with an arm for a head. Raibert added that the team took Atlas to see how it fared in uncertain conditions. Atlas uses a laser radar system to “see” the world, similar to Google’s self-driving cars. “Out in the world is just a totally different challenge than in the lab,” he said in the video. ”You can’t predict what it’s going to be like.” While Atlas is still acclimating to the outside world, it’s good to see that it didn’t react to the being outside for the first as other robots have this year.

Atlas is an “agile, anthropomorphic robot” (who apparently is also fond of alliteration). Atlas was created by Boston Dynamics, the Google-owned robotics company also famous for its speedy robotic cheetah and its swimming, snow-climbing BigDog. And recently, Atlas went for its first-ever walk in the woods. The impressive — and perhaps mildly alarming — footage of Atlas staggering around like the less-coordinated cousin of a Transformers character has been making the rounds online after it was shown at the Fab Lab 11 conference and symposium in Cambridge, Mass., earlier this month. It was the first time the company had shared video of one of its humanoid robots on an outdoor excursion. (Though its quadrupeds have been frequently filmed running in the wild.) But Atlas wasn’t simply gripped by a Thoreauvian yen to experience nature. According to Boston Dynamics founder Marc Raibert, the hike was an opportunity to test the robot’s balance and ability to respond to an unpredictable environment. “Out in the world is just a totally different challenge than in the lab,” he said at the conference. According to the Boston Globe, much of the company’s research is funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which is trying to develop robots that can perform tasks in military and disaster-related situations that would be unsafe for humans.

This allows its arms to be free to lift and move around its environment. Atlas can also climb using its hands and feet to move through narrow spaces. It has a sensor head with two cameras and a laser range finder to help it see where it is going. For now, Atlas needs a power supply from a person, but in the future, it will be able to walk and explore on its own.

In February 1953 Vaughan Williams and Ursula were married. He left the Dorking house and they took a lease of 10 Hanover Terrace, Regent's Park, London. It was the year of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation; Vaughan Williams's contribution was an arrangement of the Old Hundredth psalm tune, and a new setting of \\"O taste and see\\" from Psalm 34, performed at the service in Westminster Abbey. Having returned to live in London, Vaughan Williams, with Ursula's encouragement, became much more active socially and in pro bono publico activities. He was a leading figure in the Society for the Promotion of New Music, and in 1954 he set up and endowed the Vaughan Williams Trust to support young composers and promote new or neglected music. He and his wife travelled extensively in Europe, and in 1954 he visited the US once again, having been invited to lecture at Cornell and other universities and to conduct. He received an enthusiastic welcome from large audiences, and was overwhelmed at the warmth of his reception. Kennedy describes it as \\"like a musical state occasion\\".Of Vaughan Williams's works from the 1950s, Grove makes particular mention of Three Shakespeare Songs (1951) for unaccompanied chorus, the Christmas cantata Hodie (1953–1954), the Violin Sonata, and, most particularly, the Ten Blake Songs (1957) for voice and oboe, \\"a masterpiece of economy and precision\\". Unfinished works from the decade were a cello concerto and a new opera, Thomas the Rhymer. The predominant works of the 1950s were his three last symphonies. The seventh—officially unnumbered, and titled Sinfonia antartica—divided opinion; the score is a reworking of music Vaughan Williams had written for the 1948 film Scott of the Antarctic, and some critics thought it not truly symphonic. The Eighth, though wistful in parts, is predominantly lighthearted in tone; it was received enthusiastically at its premiere in 1956, given by the Hallé Orchestra under the dedicatee, Sir John Barbirolli. The Ninth, premiered at a Royal Philharmonic Society concert...

As more details regarding the incident come to light, it becomes apparent that the horrific accident was even worse than initially reported. This article will delve into the circumstances of the accident, the history of the waterslide, and the testimonies of park visitors who have faced similar dangers on the ride. The Incident Caleb Schwab ─ son of Kansas lawmaker Scott Schwab ─ was among the riders on the 168-foot \\"Verruckt\\" slide at the Schlitterbahn park. Early investigations revealed that he died from a \\"fatal neck injury.\\" However, lately, a source informed the Associated Press (AP) that the young boy was actually decapitated during the accident. Although the authorities have launched an investigation, the cause of the accident remains unexplained. Previous Concerns and Issues Following the tragic event, several park visitors have come forward with their experiences on the Verruckt waterslide. The Kansas City Star reported a range of problems faced by riders, including loose restraints and flying rafts. Dawn Gentry shared that on July 27, she and her daughter were on the slide when their raft flew off the tracks during the ride's second drop, causing the lifeguards to panic. Gentry stated that she had the impression that it had happened before. Another visitor, Sara Craig, recounted her experiences after the park reopened, stating that when she went down the slide a few weeks ago with her son and his friend, she found the ride to be \\"very, very rough.\\" She mentioned that her Velcro shoulder restraint had come off during her first trip down the slide. Craig also shared that operators allowed her group to use the waterslide with a combined weight of 393 pounds, below the 400-pound minimum required for a safe ride. Calls for Safety and Accountability The tragic death of Caleb Schwab has raised an ongoing discussion about the safety and oversight of amusement park rides. Safety experts and the concerned public are now demanding stronger regulations and a more comprehensive examination of existing safety protocols both at the Schlitterbahn park and other amusement parks nationwide. While the investigations continue, families and park enthusiasts alike are left wondering what powers they have to hold park operators accountable for maintaining the ride safety and preventing further tragedies from occurring. Conclusion The heartbreaking incident involving Caleb Schwab is a stark reminder of the potential dangers associated with amusement park rides. It alerts park operators, local authorities, and the public about the critical importance of prioritizing safety measures, establishing a strong regulatory framework, and creating a culture of vigilance and accountability. It is only through these combined efforts that we can prevent such unspeakable tragedies from recurring in the future and ensure that our amusement parks remain a source of fun and excitement instead of fear and loss."},{"instruction":"Reconstruct a question, answer pair from this explanation: The smallest prime number is 2.","output":"Question: What is the smallest prime number?

What was the DJ that DJ Dazzle remixed on multiple occasions named by MixMag Magazine? A:","output":"MixMag Magazine is a highly regarded British electronic dance and clubbing magazine that features music reviews, interviews with DJs and musicians, and industry news. While I was not able to find a specific DJ that DJ Dazzle remixed on multiple occasions and was named by MixMag Magazine, I would like to provide a broader context and background on DJ Dazzle and the world of remixing. DJ Dazzle, a Dutch trance music artist, emerged in the electronic dance music scene in the late 1990s. Known for his melodic trance productions, DJ Dazzle gained international recognition for his work as a DJ, producer, and performer. Born as Michel Diederiks, DJ Dazzle showed a love for music from a young age and eventually found his passion in trance music. Trance music originated in Germany in the early 1990s and gained popularity in Europe, eventually spreading worldwide. Trance is characterized by a repetitive beat, typically between 125 and 150 beats per minute, as well as a melodic and harmonic structure that often features synthesizers, arpeggios, and atmospheric sounds. This genre of electronic dance music was well-suited for remixes, allowing DJs to add their unique spin on songs. Remixing is an art form in itself. DJs take existing tracks and rework them through various techniques such as restructuring the arrangement, modifying the beat, or skillfully blending different tracks. This allows the new version of the song to have a fresh feel while still retaining the essence of the original track. In the world of electronic dance music, several notable DJs have created remixes of popular tracks and have been recognized by prestigious publications like MixMag Magazine. Some prominent examples include Paul Oakenfold, Sasha, and John Digweed, among others. DJ Dazzle has released several songs and remixes throughout his career, working with and remixing various artists. However, as previously mentioned, I was unable to find a specific DJ that DJ Dazzle remixed multiple times and was named by MixMag Magazine. To accurately identify the DJ referred to in the question, more specific information about the time frame or additional context may be needed. Nevertheless, DJ Dazzle's work within the trance music community provides a great example of the power of remixing in electronic dance music and the attention it can garner from influential media outlets like MixMag Magazine."},{"instruction":"What's an example of a movie review?","output":"Title: Interstellar (2014) Directed by: Christopher Nolan Starring: Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine, and Bill Irwin Genre: Science Fiction, Adventure, Drama Review: Interstellar, directed by Christopher Nolan, is an ambitious, thought-provoking, and visually stunning film that takes viewers on a thrilling journey through both space and the human psyche. Set in a not-so-distant future, Earth is on the brink of collapse due to severe climate and food crises. Our protagonist, Cooper (played by Matthew McConaughey), a skilled pilot and engineer-turned-farmer, is tasked with heading an urgent mission to seek out a new, habitable world for humanity. Alongside a selected crew of scientists and explorers, he embarks on an awe-inspiring interstellar voyage riddled with danger, hope, and sacrifice. First and foremost, the cinematography in Interstellar is truly sublime. At times the imagery is so beautiful and meticulously crafted that it looks like you're watching a high-resolution photograph brought to life. Director of Photography Hoyte van Hoytema and Nolan come together to evoke a sense of grandeur and scale in the vastness of space, eliciting both wonder and existential dread simultaneously. The special effects are exceptional; each frame, whether they depict a serene galaxy or a terrifying black hole, is a visual masterpiece. The script, penned by both Christopher and Jonathan Nolan, provides a rich tapestry of complex themes and intricately woven narratives that consistently keep the audience engaged. Interstellar is not solely a movie about space exploration; rather, it delves into the heart of existential questions, the power of human connection, and the limits of scientific understanding. Amidst the grandiosity of the cosmos, the importance of relationships, especially the bond between Cooper and his daughter Murph (played by Jessica Chastain), shines brightly and lends the film a profound emotional depth. The performance of the cast is stellar, with Matthew McConaughey delivering a nuanced portrayal of a conflicted protagonist, trying to save the world while leaving his beloved family behind. Anne Hathaway excels as a determined scientist with her own emotional struggles, and veteran actor Michael Caine provides a sense of wisdom and urgency as the lead scientist Professor Brand. The supporting roles, particularly Bill Irwin as the intelligent, caring, and scene-stealing robot TARS, are also impressive, further enriching the storytelling. Hans Zimmer's score is another standout feature in Interstellar. The music manages to accentuate the vast emptiness of space, as well as the anxiety and the melancholy of leaving Earth behind. The powerful organ theme sends shivers down the viewer's spine and leaves a lingering sensation of eerie beauty. However, as much as Interstellar is a remarkable achievement, some aspects of the film may not fully resonate with every viewer. The complexity of the screenplay demands keen attention and may at times feel daunting or confusing for those unfamiliar with scientific concepts like relativity and wormholes. Additionally, the film's runtime, clocking in at 169 minutes, may feel excessive to some viewers. In conclusion, Interstellar is an unforgettable cinematic experience that couples ambitious storytelling with electrifying visuals and a gripping emotional core. While its scientific jargon and lengthy runtime may be a challenge for some, the film's deeply human narrative and captivating performances make it a must-watch for fans of cinema who crave a truly immersive, transcendent experience."},{"instruction":"Vitacost.com, Inc is an American e-commerce company based in Boca Raton, Florida, that sells vitamins, supplements and organic grocery products.

Now, let's apply these guidelines to the given sentence: Persian sentence: آن قرمزی که در این عکس می ‌ بینید در واقع گرد و غباری از صحرای آفریقا است. Step 1: Identify the words and their meanings. - آن (That) - قرمزی (Redness) - که (Which) - در (In) - این (This) - عکس (Picture) - می بینید (You see) - واقع (Actually) - گرد و غباری (Dust) - از (From) - صحرای (Desert) - آفریقا (Africa) - است (Is) Step 2: Transcribe each Persian word into the Hebrew alphabet and translate them. - אנ (אותו) - קרמזי (אדום) - כה (שבו) - דר (ב /בתוך) - עין (זה) - עַכס (תמונה) - מי ביניד (אתם רואים) - וַאֲקַע (למעשה) - גֵּרַד ו גַּבַּאֲרִי (אבק) - עַז (מתוך) - סַחֲרַי (מדבר) - יפריקה (אפריקה) - סת (הוא) Step 3: Pay attention to grammar rules and word order when translating the sentence into Hebrew.

To analyze this, we should evaluate the given premise, look into possible interpretations, and understand contradictions and logical fallacies. Firstly, let's examine the premise: \\"So you did.\\" This statement implies an affirmation, meaning that the subject (which is you) completed or achieved a particular action or task. The very structure of this statement suggests agreement with the idea that the action has taken place, whether it be an observation, a response, or even a confirmation. Possible interpretations of this premise could signify that: 1. The speaker is expressing a positive response, confirming that \\"you\\" indeed performed the task or action being discussed. 2. The speaker has found evidence implying that \\"you\\" did something or experienced something relevant to the conversation. 3. The speaker is using the phrase as an informal rhetorical device, implying that the truth or the conclusion of the matter is that \\"you\\" did it. On the other hand, the hypothesis \\"You absolutely did not\\" contradicts the premise directly. This hypothesis is a negation of the action or task being associated with the subject. It emphasizes that the subject has not completed or achieved the action or task at all, and this assertion is regarded as definitive given the term \\"absolutely.\\" The contradiction in these statements can also be analyzed using formal logic. In formal logic, a contradiction occurs when two propositions cannot both be true at the same time. In this case: Premise: \\"So you did.\\" -> P Hypothesis: \\"You absolutely did not.\\" -> ¬P By stating that \\"you did\\" (P) and \\"you absolutely did not\\" (¬P), we have a contradiction, as both statements cannot be true simultaneously. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true based on the premise provided. Additionally, assuming the hypothesis is true based on the initial premise is an example of the \\"appeal to contradiction\\" logical fallacy. In this fallacy, one assumes that because two statements are contradictory, one must be true, and the other must be false. However, without further information or context, we cannot determine the truthfulness of either statement independently. In conclusion, given the premise \\"So you did,\\" we cannot determine that the hypothesis \\"You absolutely did not\\" is true. The statements contradict each other, and drawing a conclusion based on this contradiction would involve committing logical fallacies. To establish the accuracy or validity of either claim, we would require additional information, clarification, or context to assess which statement is correct."},{"instruction":"Here are some concepts: athlete, ball, challenge What is a sentence about these concepts?","output":"Step 1: Identify the three concepts - Athlete - Ball - Challenge Step 2: Determine the relationship between the concepts - The athlete is the subject, who will be performing an action with the ball. - The challenge is an objective, an obstacle, or a difficulty the athlete has to overcome.

First, biodiversity is crucial for the efficiency of energy flow in an ecosystem. More species means more complex food webs and hence, more energy transfer. An ecosystem's energy flow begins with primary producers (like plants) converting the sun's energy into chemical energy through photosynthesis. Then, primary consumers (like herbivores) eat the producers, secondary consumers (like carnivores) eat the primary consumers, and so on. At each step, energy is transferred but much of it is lost as heat due to the metabolic processes of the organisms involved. If species start to go extinct, this food web starts to break down, triggering a decrease in energy transfers and thus less energy being burned overall. More extinction can mean fewer plants for photosynthesis, fewer herbivores to consume plants, and fewer predators to consume herbivores, simplifying the food web and reducing the total energy consumed. Secondly, numerous species also help in sequestering (or capturing) carbon and other greenhouse gases, which essentially contributes to energy balance in the ecosystem. So, in conclusion, more species extinction would likely result in less energy being burned within ecosystems due to simpler food webs and decreased carbon sequestering."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this summary: Learn HTML.

Donald Trump ate a prime sirloin with citrus glazed carrots; Mitt Romney chose lamb chops with a mushroom bolognese sauce. At Jean-Georges, a three-star Michelin restaurant in the Trump International Hotel in New York, it’s a rich man’s world, and one where the US president-elect feels at home. This has also been evident in his appointments so far, as the so-called “blue-collar billionaire” looks set to preside over the wealthiest administration in modern history. Trump's conflicts of interest: a visual guide Read more Trump, a former host of reality TV show The Apprentice, is surrounding himself with the 1%: billionaires and millionaires, investment bankers and venture capitalists, Wall Street insiders and family fortune heirs, many educated at elite schools. It is the most brazen embrace of big money since the 1980s era of Ronald Reagan, Tom Wolfe’s Masters of the Universe and Oliver Stone’s Gordon Gekko. “It is a throwback to the ‘greed is good’ mentality,” said Marge Baker, executive vice-president of the liberal pressure group People For the American Way. “It’s also alarming that the president-elect said he believes what’s good for his business is good for America. That’s not how you want the leader of your country to be making decisions.” Baker added: “When you’ve got Wall Street billionaires setting the agenda it’s not likely to benefit average Americans. Research shows that the wealthy have different priorities and policy priorities, for example on healthcare and the minimum wage.” The Trump cabinet’s emphasis on tax cuts and deregulation is also likely to echo the Reagan era. Election rival Hillary Clinton warned during the campaign: “Trump is trickledown economics over and over again. I called it trumped-up trickledown economics.” Igor Volsky, deputy director of a pro-Clinton thinktank, the Center for American Progress Action Fund, said: “The same trickledown policies we saw in the 80s [that] didn’t help ordinary Americans are going to be put forward again. If you look at large parts of the cabinet it does feel like going back in time.” The very people who heard Trump’s blunt, populist message about unrigging the system would be the ones to suffer its betrayal, Volsky added. “He’s going to perpetuate a system that helps the very richest Americans at the cost of programmes that help middle and lower-income Americans.” Andrew Mellon, one of the richest Americans of the early 20th century, served as treasury secretary in three administrations. George W Bush’s first cabinet was criticised for containing high rollers in 2001. But Trump has taken the mix of democracy and plutocracy to a whole new level. The Politico website suggested the new president’s team could be worth 35bn – some have made political donations worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The median household income in the US is about 55,000. Trump’s supporters have said they welcome the fact he is a businessman, not a politician beholden to special interests, and hope he will run America like an efficient corporation. But several members of the administration could face accusations of a conflict of interest – that they are forming policy with at least one eye on their own businesses, or those of their cronies. Neil Sroka, spokesman for the liberal organisation Democracy for America, said: “You’ve got a group of entitled, out-of-touch billionaires who are going to be bossed around by a bigoted, out-of-touch billionaire. It is beyond credibility that they are going to be able to accurately reflect the needs of working-class citizens who rely on leaders in Washington to fight for them.” The appointments were self-serving, Sroka added. “What this rogues’ gallery of billionaires that Trump is trotting shows is that he isn’t interested in protecting working people. He wants to curry favour with a millionaire and billionaire class that he’s always sought the approval of. “This is a class that dines on lobster steak and caviar every night. They’re not figuring out how to put food on the table. They’re figuring out how to make a few more millions before they go home at night.” Trump’s picks so far Facebook Twitter Pinterest Betsy DeVos, Trump’s nominee for education secretary.

This collection of wealth is greater than that of the 43 million least wealthy American households combined—over one third of the 126 million households total in the US. Affluence of this magnitude in a US presidential cabinet is unprecedented. The household data on which we based our comparison is from the 2013 Survey of Consumer Finances. Collected by the Federal Reserve, this survey is the most recent comprehensive data source on American wealth. The estimates were adjusted for inflation and an increase in the number of American households. It is possible that the wealth of low-income Americans has changed since 2013, but trends over the last several decades suggest a large change is unlikely. It is worth noting that almost 13% of American households have zero or negative wealth because of debt, so we are adding together these households with those that have at least some wealth. Even if we just compare the wealth of Trump’s cabinet to the median household, it is still an impressive concentration of riches. It would take about 120,000 households with the the United States median net worth of about 83,200 to match the wealth of just the four richest members of Trump’s cabinet—Betsy DeVos, Wilbur Ross Jr., Linda McMahon, and Rex Tillerson. ||||| \\"It matters that government as a whole is representative of America,\\" said Republican strategist Sara Fagen, former White House political director for George W.

While Obama put together the most diverse Cabinet ever, some women in his White House still felt marginalized. The concerns reached the president himself during his first year in office, leading him to hold a dinner with senior female advisers to discuss his administration's boys-club image. Some of Trump's most powerful aides are women. Kellyanne Conway served as his third and final campaign manager and remains a senior adviser. Trump's daughter Ivanka consults on most major decisions and is expected to continue doing so once her father is in the White House.

The question and answer pair are described below.","output":"Question: Why is parachuting considered dangerous for inexperienced people? Answer: Parachuting, also known as skydiving, is an air sport that involves jumping from an aircraft and free-falling before deploying a parachute to slow down the descent and safely land on the ground. While it can be an exciting and adrenaline-pumping activity, it is considered dangerous for inexperienced people due to several reasons outlined below: 1. Lack of training: Inexperienced people often lack the essential knowledge, skills, and training needed to safely perform a parachute jump. Training typically covers proper body position, parachute deployment, emergency procedures, and landing techniques. Insufficient training can result in poor decision-making and potential accidents. 2. Equipment complexity: Parachuting requires the use of specialized equipment such as harnesses, altimeters, automatic activation devices (AADs), and reserve parachutes. Inexperienced jumpers may not be familiar with the correct usage and maintenance of these devices, elevating the risk of malfunctions or improper deployment. 3. Difficulty in emergency situations: Unexpected situations, such as mid-air collisions, canopy malfunctions, or harsh weather conditions, may occur during a jump. Inexperienced skydivers might lack the necessary skills and experience to react quickly and efficiently to these emergencies, leading to potentially dangerous outcomes. 4. High-altitude risks: Parachuting involves jumping from high altitudes, which can expose participants to reduced oxygen levels, extreme cold temperatures, and rapid changes in air pressure. Inexperience may impede the ability to cope with these physical stressors, posing risks to health and safety. 5. Psychological factors: Inexperienced jumpers may find themselves overwhelmed by fear, anxiety, or panic during the free fall, parachute deployment, or landing phases. These emotional responses may impair their ability to react judiciously, consequently heightening the risk of accidents. To mitigate these risks, beginners should seek proper training from certified instructors, adhere strictly to safety guidelines, and gain experience through tandem jumps or indoor skydiving simulations before attempting solo jumps. As experience is gained, the risks diminish, allowing individuals to enjoy the thrills of parachuting with a greater sense of safety and competence."},{"instruction":"Summarize this article: Here's the Most Unorthodox Idea From the State of the Union In listing the ways that government can help unemployed Americans get back on their feet, President Obama mentioned a handful of familiar policies — unemployment insurance, job-training programs — and then threw a curveball: Why not have wage insurance too? \\"Say a hardworking American loses his job — we shouldn’t just make sure he can get unemployment insurance; we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business that’s ready to hire him,\\" Obama said during his State of the Union address Tuesday night. \\"If that new job doesn’t pay as much, there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills.

Politics Newsletter Sign up to receive the day’s top political stories. View Sample SIGN UP NOW In a nutshell, it's a government entitlement that keeps low- and middle-income workers' wages from dropping below a certain benchmark. Unlike unemployment insurance, which attempts to provide a buffer for workers that have temporarily and involuntarily lost their jobs, wage insurance protects workers against future losses in earnings too, in case they have no choice but to accept a lower-paying job in order to get re-employed. Read More: President Obama Puts Joe Biden in Charge of Curing Cancer Unlike universal income, which is a mostly liberal-backed idea that would provide a standard wage to every American regardless of employment status, wage insurance would only be accessible to working people who involuntarily lost a job and then got another, less-well-paying one. In the past, support for wage insurance has actually been pretty bipartisan. Democrats liked it because it's a government entitlement aimed squarely at working and middle-class Americans, and Republicans liked it because it requires that people keep working — even if it means taking the first job they can get. Most existing wage-insurance proposals — which, for the most part, languish in think-tank archives — have built-in ways to keep people from gaming the system. For example, some proposals suggest calibrating payouts so that no American would voluntarily be on wage insurance: if it was possible for you to get a better-paying job, it would be in your economic interest to snag it. Other proposals suggest that it would apply only to salaries below a certain salary level. So if you're making 200,000 and you lose your job and get a new one that pays you only 150,000, then this program isn't for you. Wage insurance became popular among the economic intelligentsia about 25 years ago, right about when it became apparent that powerful forces in the modern economy — free trade, globalization, technologization — were both juicing the national GDP and permanently eliminating good, American jobs (and replacing them with less good, lower-paying ones). Read More: Obama Puts Terrorism in Perspective in State of the Union For example, bank tellers, which used to be paid relatively well, have seen their ranks decimated by the ATM. While that might be good for the economy writ large — think of all those ATM repairmen! — it's not good for that individual bank teller, who now works as, say, a dishwasher, making significantly less. Wage-insurance aficionados argue that the answer to that conundrum is not to try to stop those larger market forces — we can't stick a wrench in the rapid advance of technology — but to take the gains that those forces deliver to the larger economy and reinvest them into working Americans' salaries. If that former bank teller used to make 700 a week and now makes 450 as a dishwasher, then wage insurance would compensate some portion of those lost wages — keeping the worker above the poverty line. ||||| President Obama on Tuesday night called for a system of wage insurance to alleviate the problem of job loss. Obama in his State of the Union address talked about the need for greater economic security and cast wage insurance as a policy that could complement the existing program of unemployment benefits. Not only should laid-off workers receive unemployment insurance, Obama said, but they should also be encouraged to get training for a new job. \\"If that new job doesn't pay as much, there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills,\\" Obama said. Existing wage insurance proposals involve a levy placed in addition to the unemployment insurance tax that would be used to subsidize wages for workers who were laid off and then subsequently found a lower-paying job. The idea behind the policy would be to encourage people to quickly move into new work and begin rebuilding their job skills. The wage insurance idea is one of the few specific economic policy proposals Obama mentioned in his speech, but it is not a new one for him. He called for versions of wage insurance in the American Jobs Act legislation he backed in 2011 and in his 2012 State of the Union address. Those calls, however, did not translate into legislative success. |||||","output":"During a big speech, President Obama talked about ways the government can help people who don't have jobs.

Rotten floorboards in the sawmill Answer:","output":"Title: The Mill's Secret Genre: Mystery, Drama, Thriller Plot: Act I: The movie opens in a quaint rural town named Millwood, surrounded by dense woods and nestled near a rapid river. The primary source of income for the townspeople is the old sawmill, owned and operated by the local prominent farmer, Charles McIntyre, and his wife, Eliza McIntyre. Eliza had been a city girl and journalist who decided to start a new life in the countryside with her husband. Their love story is well-known and admired by the townspeople, but whispers of hidden secrets and discontent in their marriage have started to circulate. Charles, burdened by a familial predisposition to drinking, often disappears and indulges in alcohol. In contrast, Eliza remains compassionate and throws herself into her charity work and other activities to help the town prosper. Despite her husband's failings, Eliza is loved and respected by the community. Act II: One day, Eliza receives a letter from an anonymous source, hinting that the town's sawmill rests on a dark, untold secret. Intrigued, she decides to investigate and starts by researching the sawmill's history. Her journalistic instincts come alive, and she begins interviewing elderly townspeople to collect any relevant information. Through the interviews, Eliza discovers the town was founded on the booming lumber business but goes through cycles of enrichment and impoverishment. Legend has it that the sawmill is cursed, as a terrible tragedy occurs every few decades, leading to the closing of the sawmill for a time. Unsatisfied with the information and disbelieving of curses, Eliza decides to unravel the mysteries of the sawmill itself. One evening, while her husband is out, she sneaks into the sawmill to continue her investigations. As she explores the building, she comes across a hidden room with rotten floorboards. Carefully, she walks towards the room when suddenly, the floorboards give in, plunging her into the abyss below. Act III: The townspeople are shocked to discover Eliza's lifeless body the next morning. Charles, heartbroken and guilty, dedicates himself to finding out the truth about his wife's death. A bright and determined city detective, Sarah, is dispatched to Millwood to assist in the investigation. As Sarah and Charles follow Eliza's clues, they unearth long-forgotten documents that reveal a dark history surrounding the sawmill's construction. The sawmill, it turns out, was built on an ancient burial ground. The townspeople, desperate to attract wealth and prosperity, made a pact with a malicious spirit residing in the burial ground. Every few decades, a member of the community vanishes without a trace, and in return, the town prospers, and the sawmill continues to operate. The community tries to keep this truth hidden, stubbornly sticking to assumptions of a natural accidental death. Together, Sarah and Charles work through obstacles and threats from the shadowy town council, determined to expose the truth and break the town's deadly pact. In the climax, they perform a ritual involving Eliza's spirit to cleanse the curse and confront the malicious spirit. With Eliza's aid and the reluctant support of the townspeople, the curse is lifted, resulting in the closure of the sawmill. In the aftermath, the town of Millwood starts rebuilding its future, and its residents confront their morally fraught legacy.

A video posted to TMZ yesterday shows Rice dragging an apparently unconscious Palmer from an elevator, then laying her on the ground as he attempts to clear her legs from the elevator doors, in a scene said to have occurred after the fight. Rice's lawyer notes that though the video is authentic, it \\"is not the complete event, but is merely the end result of what transpired.\\" Both Rice and Palmer \\"struck each other with their hands\\" and were arrested for simple assault, police say. The pair then \\"returned home together after being detained,\\" the Baltimore Ravens told USA Today. The NFL will review the incident under its personal conduct policy, and commissioner Roger Goodell has \\"wide discretion\\" regarding punishment, the Baltimore Sun reports. It notes Goodell suspended Ben Roethlisberger for six games—later reduced to four—after he was investigated for sexual assault, though he was never charged. Rice is scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday. Article:","output":"Once upon a time, there was a big strong football player named Ray Rice, who played for the Baltimore Ravens team in the NFL. He got into big trouble one weekend when he got into a fight with his fiancée, Janay Palmer. The fight happened at a big building called a casino, and Ray ended up knocking Janay out cold. People from a place called ESPN found out about the fight because it was written in a paper called a court summons. There was also a video, kind of like a movie, that showed people what happened. In the video, Ray was dragging Janay, who looked like she was sleeping, out of a small room called an elevator. It was a pretty scary scene that happened after their fight. Ray's lawyer, the person who helps him in court, said that the video did show the real thing, but it didn't show everything that happened. The police, who are like superheroes that keep people safe, said that both Ray and Janay hit each other with their hands, which is not a very nice thing to do. They both had to face the consequences and got arrested for something called simple assault. However, they went back home together after spending some time being detained, which means they were kept by the police for a little while. The big bosses of the NFL are going to look at what happened and make some decisions about what should happen to Ray. The NFL has a big, important person named Commissioner Roger Goodell, who has a lot of power to decide what sort of punishment is right. He has had to do this before when another football player named Ben Roethlisberger got into trouble. Now, Ray Rice has to go to a place called court on Tuesday, where he will find out if he will get into more trouble for his actions. Remember, kids: it's important to treat everyone with kindness and respect. Fighting is not the right way to handle our problems, and everyone should try to be kind and gentle to those around them."},{"instruction":"Read the text and answer the questions. (CNN) -- It's arguably the toughest job in sports. Hockey enforcers earn the undying devotion of fans -- but not much else -- for their ability to punch and get punched on skates. They usually bounce from team to team, barely managing to get a contract for a role few can perform well and no one else wants. \\"I did it because it was my job but I hated it,\\" said Georges Laraque, one of the most successful hockey heavyweights in his 12-year NHL career. \\"I hated to fight. I hated the pressure. I hated to be called a goon, and an animal. I hated promoting violence.\\" Laraque spoke to the Cybulski & Company radio program in Canada after the news Wednesday that another former enforcer, Wade Belak, was found dead in his Toronto apartment at age 35. Authorities described the death as nonsuspicious. It was the third death of a current or former National Hockey League enforcer this summer, an almost unfathomable statistical anomaly. There are 30 NHL teams, and not all of them employ a so-called \\"hired gun\\" these days, both to intimidate opposing players and keep them honest. Derek Boogaard was found dead at age 28 in his Minneapolis home in May, the result of a toxic combination of painkillers and alcohol ruled an accident.

The hydrogen bonds in liquid water constantly break and reform as the water molecules tumble past one another. As water cools, its molecular motion slows and the molecules move gradually closer to one another. The density of any liquid increases as its temperature decreases. For most liquids, this continues as the liquid freezes and the solid state is denser than the liquid state. However, water behaves differently. It actually reaches its highest density at about 4°C. Now, I have a new situation: A waitress sets down two cups of water at a table and then takes the table's order. She leaves to place the order and the diners begin chatting and sipping on their water. Kim remarks that her water is room temperature and she wishes that it was cooler. Janet states that her water is so cold it hurts her teeth and wishes hers was warmer. They agree to mention it to the waitress when she returns. Answer this question please: Which person's water has molecules moving faster? Answer:","output":"Kim's water has molecules moving faster. Step 1: Understand the given information In the background information, we learn that as water cools, its molecular motion slows down. This means that colder water has slower-moving molecules, while warmer water has faster-moving molecules. Step 2: Analyze the new situation In the new situation, we have two cups of water with different temperatures. Kim's water is room temperature and she wishes it was cooler, while Janet's water is so cold that it hurts her teeth and she wishes it was warmer. Step 3: Compare the molecular speeds Since Kim's water is at room temperature, which is warmer than Janet's very cold water, the molecules in Kim's water will be moving faster than those in Janet's water. This is because the molecular motion in warmer water is faster than that in colder water, as stated in the background information."},{"instruction":"Answer the question based on the following text. Question: If Mona is comparing an orange and an apple and she determines that the apple is more massive then the orange, which object has more gravity orange or apple? Text: Objects with greater mass have a stronger force of gravity between them. Answer:","output":"Based on the text stating that \\"objects with greater mass have a stronger force of gravity between them\\", we can conclude that if Mona determines the apple to be more massive than the orange, the apple would have a greater gravitational force compared to the orange. The force of gravity is directly proportional to the mass of an object, meaning that as the mass of the object increases, so does its gravitational force. In this comparison, since the apple has been determined to possess a larger mass, it would exert a stronger gravitational force compared to the orange."},{"instruction":"Sydney saw that Lee was in an escalated situation and kept him away from the conflict. Given the context: What will Lee want to do next? Possible answers: Start another conflict somewhere else, Walk away the spot, try to descalate the situation The answer to this question is:","output":"It is difficult to accurately predict an individual's actions without knowing their personality, past experiences, and values; however, considering the context provided, it is likely that Lee would opt to walk away from the spot and attempt to deescalate the situation. This assumption is based on the fact that Sydney, presumably a friend or acquaintance of Lee, has already taken initiative to separate him from the ongoing conflict. This action indicates that Sydney recognizes the potential harm in letting the situation escalate further and believes it is in Lee's best interest to remove him from the hostile environment. It can also be inferred that Sydney might be looking out for Lee's well-being and trying to prevent any possible physical or emotional damage that could result from the conflict. Given this context, it would be reasonable to assume that Lee might follow Sydney's lead and choose to walk away from the spot, distancing himself from the conflict. Moreover, Lee would likely attempt to deescalate the situation, as continuing down the path of confrontation could have negative consequences not only for him but also for those around him, including Sydney. Attempting to deescalate the situation could involve various strategies. Lee might choose to take a few deep breaths and calm himself down, enabling him to approach the conflict from a more rational and balanced perspective. He could also engage in open and honest communication with the other party, expressing his thoughts and feelings while also inviting them to share theirs. By practicing active listening and empathizing with one another's perspectives, the possibility of reaching a mutual understanding becomes more attainable. Another approach Lee could take is seeking the help of a neutral third party, such as a mediator or counselor, who could help facilitate a constructive dialogue and potentially lead to resolution. This approach has the advantage of having an unbiased individual who can objectively assess the situation and guide the parties through the process. In summary, considering the context provided, it is likely that Lee would want to walk away from the spot and try to deescalate the situation. By choosing this path, Lee demonstrates his willingness to prioritize the well-being of himself and others involved in the conflict, thus reducing the chances of causing further harm."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"Many EU countries, including Sweden, have also largely coped with the low birth rate and the demographic problems, partly through a well-developed welfare policy and through immigration.\\" to German?","output":"To translate this sentence to German, I will ensure the meaning and context is accurately preserved and grammatically correct while maintaining the proper structure of the German language.

Donavan asks what they are looking for, and Barnes replies that they will know when they find a man with eyes like his own. They see a man (Crowe) sitting behind a screen, and they begin firing upon him. He jumps out of the way and grabs a gun of his own to return the fire. The foe snidely knocks out his partner and promises to return for Barnes. Barnes searches for him inside the building, but the man is able to surprise him and injures his arm.

Disney World’s Magic Kingdom in Orlando, Florida, Tokyo Disneyland, Disneyland Park in California and Tokyo DisneySea registered a total of more than 66 million visitors last year. The destinations are among 15 theme parks included in a list of the world’s top 50 tourist attractions compiled by tourism website Travel + Leisure. The most popular tourist destination across the globe last year was Istanbul’s Grand Bazaar, which recorded 91.25m visitors in 2013. The most popular destination across the globe was Istanbul’s Grand Bazaar, which recorded 91.25m visitors in 2013. The 15th century market is famous for its hand-painted ceramics, lanterns, intricately patterned carpets, and Byzantine-style jewelry. Mexico City’s The Zócalo - the ceremonial Atzec plaza - came in second place with 85 million visitors, while New York’s Times Square was third in the list with 50 million. The Zocalo hosts military parades, cultural and political events, concerts, exhibitions, fairs, and public art installations, while Times Square is known for it lively entertainment, Broadway shows and many shops. Disney World’s Magic Kingdom in Orlando, Florida recorded 18.6 million visitors last year making it the 12th most visited tourist attraction in the world. Other attractions that made up the top ten were New York's Central Park, and Union Station in Washington D.C. which both attracted 40m visitors. The Las Vegas Strip came in sixth position followed by Tokyo's Meiji Jingu Shrine and Sensoji Temple. Niagara Falls was in ninth place while New York City's Grand Central Terminal was in tenth position with 21.6m visitors. There was no place on the list for any British attractions, and the least visited place in the top 50 most popular tourist destinations was the Taj Mahal, which still recorded between seven and eight million tourists. It means the British Museum in London (6.7 million), the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (6.3 million), and the Roman Colosseum (5.1 million) narrowly missed the cut. Nevada's Las Vegas Strip attracted 30.5m annual visitors in 2013, making it the sixth most popular destination. The figures were compiled from data supplied by government agencies and industry reports including the Global Attractions Attendance Report. The attractions themselves also supplied their own data when ticket sales weren’t available. Travel + Leisure defined tourist attractions as ‘cultural and historical sites, natural landmarks, and officially designated spaces’. It meant that while destinations such as the Las Vegas Strip made the list, popular spots such as malls and shopping centres were not included, despite often attracting tens of millions of visitors each year. Beaches and religious sites were also omitted. Niagara Falls in New York and Ontario registered 22m visitors, placing it ninth in the top 50 tourist attractions. Bourbon Street in New Orleans was 45th in the list of the world's top 50 destinations with 7,470,000 visitors. The publication of the list comes shortly after the World Tourist Organisation published their annual report earlier this year detailing the state of global tourism. It revealed there was a five percent growth in international tourism in 2013, which amounted to an additional 52 million tourists and which brought the total up to 1.087 billion. The growth defied predictions that the global economic downturn would slow tourism. Regions that showed the biggest growth in international tourism in 2013 were Asia, Africa and Europe. Of these areas, Southeast Asia, Central and Eastern Europe and North Africa were the most popular places to visit. The Taj Mahal in India recorded between seven and eight million visitors in 2013 putting it in 50th position. The Great Wall of China had 10.7m visitors in 2013, making the historic attraction the 26th most popular site. The Palace of Versailles, in France just made it onto the list with 7,527,122 tourists visiting the site last year. The Forbidden City in Beijing attracted an astonishing 15,340,000 in 2013, making it the 16th most popular tourist attraction in the world last year. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina and Tennessee had 9,345,695 in 2013. Europe currently remains the most visited region in the world, welcoming an extra 29 million visitors last year to attract a total of 563 million tourists – 52 percent of the entire tourist market. Northern, Southern and Central America saw an increase of six million visitors to reach a total of 169 million. Africa attracted three million more arrivals than 2012, reaching a new record of 56 million. Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe, Mexico City, recorded 20 million tourists in 2013, putting it in 11th place. The list of top 50 travel destinations also revealed that South Korean theme parks Everland and Lotte World were among the most visited attractions, beating the Eiffel Tower with nearly seven million, the Great Pyramids with nearly four million and Stonehenge with one million. Travel + Leisure noted that accessibility can be a factor in determining how many visitors visit a particular attraction, adding that it takes extra effort to reach destination’s such as Yellowstone National Park, which recorded 3.2 million visitors, the Terracotta Army in Xi'an, China, which had 4.8 million, and Peru’s Machu Picchu, which has restricted tourism to 2,500 entries per day, or 912,500 per year. 1 Grand Bazaar, Istanbul.

Can a 16 year old and 13/14 year old have sex? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"As an AI assistant, it's essential to address this sensitive topic responsibly and provide you with accurate information. First and foremost, regardless of an individual's age, sexual activity should always be consensual, respectful, and follow local laws and guidelines. Laws regarding the age of consent and sexual activity differ across various regions and countries. It's important to be aware of the specific laws in the country or region you live in. To address the first question: Generally, a 13-year-old boy engaging in sexual activities is considered below the age of consent and may be illegal in most places. Also, understanding consent, emotional maturity, and the potential consequences of sexual activity is crucial for young people. Regarding the second question: A 16-year-old and a 13 or 14-year-old having sex could also be illegal, depending on the age of consent and local laws. There might be consequences if the older person is considered an adult in a particular jurisdiction. However, some places have \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" laws, which take into account the age difference between the two individuals. These two questions are related in that they inquire about the appropriateness and legality of sexual activity between young people. However, they are not the same, as they involve different ages and potential age gaps. It's crucial for both young people and their guardians to understand the legal, emotional, and social implications of sexual activity and age of consent. It's also important to promote open dialogue and education about sexual health, consent, and responsible behavior."},{"instruction":"The Limehouse Declaration was a statement issued on 25 January 1981 by four senior British Labour politicians, all MPs or former MPs and Cabinet Ministers: Roy Jenkins, David Owen, Bill Rodgers and Shirley Williams.

She was killed in the subsequent inferno along with five train passengers. Accident investigators also said there were no problems with the signals or barrier at the site of the collision. But they remain unaware why the driver, 49-year-old Ellen Brody, became stranded on the crossing at Valhalla, about 20 miles (32km) north of New York City. An official from the National Transportation Safety Board, the federal agency leading the probe, said on Thursday that a witness in a nearby car had seen Ms Brody stop on the crossing in the moments before the train approached. Investigator Robert Sumwalt said that the barrier was seen to come down on the rear of the car, a Jeep Cherokee, at which point Ms Brody got out and appeared to inspect the damage. He said that, according to both the witness and the train driver, after returning to the car she suddenly drove forward slightly - straight into the path of the oncoming train. Data retrieved from the train's recording device suggested it was travelling at 58mph (92km/h) an hour, added Mr Sumwalt - just below the 60mph speed limit for that section of track. In addition to the six deaths there were 15 injuries, seven of them serious. The electrified third rail of the track came through the front carriage of the train after the crash, setting it on fire.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Whales have also played a role in sacred texts such as the Bible. It mentions whales in Genesis 1:21, Job 7:12, and Ezekiel 32:2. The \\"leviathan\\" described at length in Job 41:1-34 is generally understood to refer to a whale. The \\"sea monsters\\" in Lamentations 4:3 have been taken by some to refer to marine mammals, in particular whales, although most modern versions use the word \\"jackals\\" instead. The story of Jonah being swallowed by a great fish is told both in the Qur'an and in the Bible. A medieval column capital sculpture depicting this was made in the 12th century in the abbey church in Mozac, France. The Old Testament contains the Book of Jonah and in the New Testament, Jesus mentions this story in Matthew 12:40.In 1585, Alessandro Farnese, 1585, and Francois, Duke of Anjou, 1582, were greeted on his ceremonial entry into the port city of Antwerp by floats including \\"Neptune and the Whale\\", indicating at least the city's dependence on the sea for its wealth.In 1896, an article in The Pall Mall Gazette popularised a practice of alternative medicine that probably began in the whaling town of Eden, Australia two or three years earlier. It was believed that climbing inside a whale carcass and remaining there for a few hours would relief symptoms of rheumatism.Whales continue to be prevalent in modern literature. For example, Herman Melville's Moby Dick features a \\"great white whale\\" as the main antagonist for Ahab, who eventually is killed by it. The whale is an albino sperm whale, considered by Melville to be the largest type of whale, and is partly based on the historically attested bull whale Mocha Dick. Rudyard Kipling's Just So Stories includes the story of \\"How the Whale got in his Throat\\". Niki Caro's film the Whale Rider has a Māori girl ride a whale in her journey to be a suitable heir to the chieftain-ship.

It discusses how the preliminary contribution information indicates that this particular race is set to become the most expensive political race in the state's history. This high-stakes race between the two prominent figures in the state of Colorado underscores the significance of their respective candidacies and the potential impact on the political landscape of the state. The level of financial contributions that both campaigns are receiving indicates the importance of the race not only for Colorado but also for the nation as a whole. Ken Salazar, the Democratic candidate, had served as Colorado's Attorney General prior to running for the U.S. Senate seat. During his tenure as Attorney General, Salazar was known for his dedication to public safety, consumer protection, and advocating for the environment. His background in law enforcement and environmental policy made him a strong candidate for Democrats looking to maintain or expand their influence in the state. On the other hand, Peter Coors is a well-known figure in the state, primarily due to his association with Coors Brewing Company, one of the largest beer companies in the world. Coors' business acumen and leadership experience within the company have bolstered his image as an accomplished entrepreneur and potentially effective legislator. His campaign focused largely on job creation, economic growth, and conservative values, which endeared him to Republican voters in the state. The highly competitive nature of the race, combined with both candidates' well-established profiles, contributed to the surge in political contributions. As both candidates fought to secure the necessary resources to spread their message and galvanize voter support, their respective campaigns continued to raise and spend money at unprecedented rates. Moreover, given the national implications of this race, funding poured in from donors both within and outside of Colorado. The costliness of this Senate race highlights several issues in modern American politics. One such issue is the role of money in political campaigns and the potential consequences of extensive spending. As candidates raise and spend vast amounts of money in an effort to influence voters, concerns arise about the influence of wealthy donors on government policy and decision-making. Another issue is the increasing polarization of politics in the United States, as candidates with contrasting ideologies and backgrounds face off in high-stakes elections. The outcome of this Colorado Senate race may serve as an indicator of broader national trends, wherein voters in the state are choosing not just between two individuals but also between two divergent political visions for the future. In conclusion, the topic of this passage centers on the competitive and expensive Senate race in Colorado between Democratic state Attorney General Ken Salazar and Republican beer executive Peter Coors. The historically high level of financial contributions being made to both campaigns underlines the importance of this race for Coloradans and the nation as a whole. Furthermore, it raises questions about the role of money in politics and the growing polarization in the United States."},{"instruction":"A gratitude journal is useful for cultivating gratitude on a daily basis.

Journaling at the end of the day can close out your day with feelings of contentment as you go to bed. For more information, check out How to Start a Gratitude Journal. Maybe keeping a journal sounds like too much work or effort. Instead, you can find time throughout the day to acknowledge the things you are grateful for. Silently acknowledge the big and little things in your life daily. For example, think of one thing in the morning, another at lunch, and one at bedtime. Wear a bracelet every day and remind yourself that each time you see it, you think of something you are grateful for. While this sounds counter-intuitive, think back to a difficult period in your life. Perhaps you went through a difficult breakup, a traumatic event, or the death of a loved one. Now reflect on the fact there here you are, able to look back on that as a memory. You successfully overcame that difficult period of life and you have what it takes to get through dark moments. Write in your journal about a challenging time you went through. Recall what it felt like, and what got you through the difficult time. Note the strengths and personal attributes you utilized to get through it. Perhaps you're going through another even darker time now. By looking back on difficult situations, you can reflect that you found your way out of the dark then, and you can do it again. While depression can make you feel like everything is in a negative light, expressing gratitude can help you see the silver lining. Think about three good things that have happened in the last week. Then, explain why those things happened. This practice can help you change that negative fog into a more positive approach. For example, one good thing could be, “My dog greeted me at the door every day this week.” For the explanation, you can say, “My dog loves me and he is excited to see me every day when I get home. This fills me with happiness, even when I feel down.” Another example: “I was nervous about making my deadline, but I made it on time. I put in a lot of work and even though I felt stressed, I finished on time. This made me feel good and accomplished.” . Mindfulness meditation often involves focusing your attention on one thing (such as “peace” or “calm”). While practicing meditation, tune your focus onto gratitude. Let any thoughts you have float out of your awareness and bring your attention back to gratitude. Choose one thing that you feel grateful for and meditate on it. This can be a warm sunny day, a delicious meal, a hug from a child, or a beautiful painting. Practice feeling gratitude for your relationships. Focus on one person at a time, like your mother, father, grandparent, partner or spouse, or child. Focus on the feeling of gratitude you have for this person being in your life. Summary:","output":"A gratitude journal is like a special notebook where you write down things you are thankful for every day. It helps you remember the good things in your life and feel happier. You can write in it in the morning or at night, or even just think about things you are grateful for throughout the day. When you remember hard times and how you got through them, it helps you feel strong and able to handle tough situations. Focusing on the good things that happened recently can also make you feel better and more positive. You can also try thinking about things or people you are thankful for while you relax and meditate. This can help you feel more grateful and happy every day."},{"instruction":"If \\"Five asian children in uniforms are lining up on a track.\\" does that mean that \\"Five children are on a track.\\"?

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: scare people into following his specific laws B: become a dictator C: give people a better future and world to live in A:","output":"Answer A: scare people into following his specific laws best answers the question according to the context. In the given context, Alex is portrayed as governing each person with an iron fist and an irrational justice system. This style of leadership is far from being just or focused on creating a better future for the people, as suggested by Option C. The line \\"irrational justice system\\" implies that laws and punishments are enforced without discernment, to the point of unfairness. This kind of approach to leadership is more likely intended to instill fear in citizens, making them follow the specific laws imposed by Alex out of terror rather than genuine acceptance or understanding. Answer B mentions becoming a dictator, but the context already implies that Alex is a dictator. Hence, it does not accurately answer the question of why Alex chose this harsh governing method. The passage states that Alex governs \\"with an iron fist,\\" a phrase often associated with dictatorial rule. The key is to focus on the reason for his choice or actions as a dictator. Therefore, based on the context provided, Answer A: scare people into following his specific laws, is the best answer since it captures the essence of ruling with fear and is closely aligned to the information given. This tyrannical way of governing forces the people into submission to ensure Alex's preferred laws and orders are obeyed."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer: A negative role. for the following movie plot: Upcoming malayalam movie from debutant director Madhupal, who already proved himself as a short story writer and script writer.

Kun otetaan huomioon Kuuban ja Euroopan maiden väliset suhteet, erityisesti Ranskan ja Saksan kanssa, investointisuojasopimukset näyttävät puolustavan ja edistävän vastavuoroista taloudellista yhteistyötä ja kauppaa. Nämä sopimukset on suunniteltu varmistamaan, että investoinnit molemmissa maissa ovat turvattuja ja niitä suojellaan mahdollisilta taloudellisilta riskeiltä. Kuuban investointisuojasopimus Ranskan kanssa on esimerkki tällaisesta sopimuksesta. Se on solmittu vuonna 2000, ja sen tavoitteena on suojata ranskalaisia investointeja Kuubassa ja kuubalaisia investointeja Ranskassa. Sopimuksen mukaan molempien maiden hallitukset sitoutuvat tarjoamaan toistensa sijoittajille oikeudenmukaisen ja syrjimättömän kohtelun, jotta voidaan luoda vahva ja kestävä taloudellinen yhteistyö. Samoin Kuuban ja Saksan välinen investointisuojasopimus on osoitus näiden kahden maan välisestä sitoutumisesta investointien turvaamiseen ja edistämiseen. Sopimus sisältää useita määräyksiä, jotka koskevat sijoitusten kohtelua, suojaa ja edistämistä. Se tarjoaa myös mekanismeja konfliktien ratkaisemiseksi sijoittajien ja hallitusten välillä. On tärkeää huomata, että nämä investointisuojasopimukset eivät ole vain yksipuolisia. Ne keskittyvät nimenomaan vastavuoroiseen hyötyyn ja kannustavat kumppanimaita tekemään kestäviä ja turvallisia investointeja. On myös tärkeää ymmärtää, että suojasopimusten ja muiden vastaavien kansainvälisten sopimusten tarkoituksena ei ole välttämättä estää valtioiden taloudellista itsenäisyyttä, vaan pikemminkin kannustaa kauppaa ja yhteistyötä maiden välillä. Lopuksi voidaan todeta, että Kuuban investointisuojasopimukset Ranskan ja Saksan kanssa ovat esimerkkejä kansainvälisestä yhteistyöstä, joka perustuu luottamukseen ja molempien osapuolten edun tavoitteluun. Sopimukset tukevat investointeja, edistävät taloudellista yhteistyötä ja varmistavat, että sijoittajat saavat oikeudenmukaisen ja syrjimättömän kohtelun.

The answer is:","output":"The information provided above is about Robert William Elliston, an English actor and theatre manager who was active during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Robert William Elliston was born on April 7, 1774, in London, England. He was a prominent figure in the British theatre world, establishing a successful career as both an actor and manager. Starting his career as a clerk, Elliston later became immersed in the world of theatre and drama. His acting career began in 1791, joining a provincial theatre company in 1796. In 1804, he made his London debut at the Drury Lane Theatre. During his long and illustrious career, he played a wide variety of characters, ranging from Shakespearean tragedies to light-hearted comedies. He was well-known for his charm, wit, and captivating stage presence, which contributed to his popularity and success on the theatrical stage. Elliston's managerial career began in 1819 when he became the lessee of the Olympic Theatre in London. Later, in 1820, he took on the management of the prestigious Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Elliston was known as an ambitious and innovative manager – during his time as a manager, he introduced several novelties, including the concept of \\"Promenade Concerts\\" and the use of limelight for stage illumination. Apart from his acting and management achievements, Elliston was also known for his tumultuous personal life. His extravagant lifestyle and financial troubles led to various difficulties in his career, ultimately resulting in bankruptcy and loss of the Drury Lane Theatre in 1826. The portrait of Robert William Elliston mentioned in the question was painted by George Henry Harlow, a distinguished British painter who specialized in portraits. Harlow's portrayal of Elliston captures the essence of the actor's charisma and theatricality, providing a striking visual representation of this iconic figure in British theatre history. Robert William Elliston continued to perform on stage and manage various theatres until his death on July 7, 1831. Despite the challenges he faced in his personal life, his contributions to the British theatre scene have left a lasting legacy and continue to be celebrated by theatre enthusiasts and historians alike."},{"instruction":"Generate a correctly punctuated version of the following text: The remains of the coliseum became home to a family of sharks","output":"The remains of the coliseum became home to a family of sharks.

Although the Dutch welcomed the news of the revolt, expecting the Portuguese to become their allies, this did not happen, as the Dutch had no wish to restore the occupied territories to Portugal.

This exchange of gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide) is essential for maintaining the body's overall metabolic health and function. Step-by-step process: 1. Air is brought in through the mouth (or nose) - this allows the body to take in oxygen from the surrounding environment. 2. Air passes through the lungs - the lungs' primary function is to facilitate the gas exchange process. 3. Air moves into the bronchial tissue - these are the smaller airways within the lungs that direct air towards the alveoli, the tiny air sacs responsible for the actual exchange of gases. 4. Carbon dioxide is removed - as the air reaches the alveoli, carbon dioxide (a waste product from the body's cells) diffuses from the blood into the alveoli to be expelled during exhalation. 5. Oxygen diffuses into the blood vessels - this is the final step, where oxygen from the inhaled air moves into the surrounding blood vessels so that the blood can transport it to the body's cells to support their metabolic processes."},{"instruction":"Question 1: What is the best concert or live musical performance that you have attended?

Sunil, who was secretly in love with Devi, is deeply disappointed. Devi and Ram marry and enter his family mansion, which he has re-earned after a legal battle.

You'd also probably like to know if there's a speed trap around the next corner, so you don't wind up spending your weekend at traffic school. Well, there's an app for that. Police chiefs, sheriffs and law enforcement groups wish there wasn't. They say they want to protect the lives of police officers, but what if they're just trying to protect the revenue that flows into government coffers due to speeding tickets? Waze is a new and controversial mobile app that tracks cars moving through traffic in real time and shares that information so users can get around traffic jams. This sounds harmless. But there is more. The app also uses a small icon of a tiny face in a police hat to warn users if police are nearby, either in speed traps or parked on the side the road. It obtains that information when other users who are driving further up the road input data into the system. It's ingenious -- and for law enforcement personnel, also frustrating. Police chiefs and sheriffs are not amused at this high-tech example of information-sharing. In fact, they're determined to put a stop to it. Law enforcement leaders claim to be concerned about officer safety. After all, lately, officers have been gunned down simply for wearing a uniform. They say they're worried about everyday citizens keeping track of the comings and goings of officers, and they insist that the app is a high-tech \\"police stalker.\\" They claim that this technology -- while helpful to motorists -- turns officers into \\"sitting ducks\\" for criminals. The folks at Waze, for their part, insist that the app improves the safety of roadways because most users tend to drive more carefully when they think police are nearby. That sounds reasonable. It also sounds as if police doth protest too much, and that they're not telling us the whole truth as to what they're really concerned about. It's not as if motorists can't often times spot police cars and adjust their speed without the help of an app; often, the patrol cars are in plain view on the side of the road. Likewise, those who want to harm law enforcement officers will find a way to do so regardless of what app is or isn't on the market. It's easy to see why Waze -- which was purchased by Google in 2013 for 966 million -- is so popular. There is a huge appetite for this technology. Potential customers include anyone who hates speed traps -- and that probably covers most Americans. In fact, there have been cases where individuals have tried to warn motorists about an oncoming speed trap and the police have come down hard on the good Samaritans. Luckily, the courts have, in turn, come down hard on the police, citing a First Amendment right to alert others as to the presence of police. In February 2014, for example, a county judge in Frisco, Texas, about an hour north of Dallas, reportedly dismissed a complaint against 33-year-old Ron Martin who was arrested for holding a sign warning drivers of a speed trap. The sign read: \\"Police Ahead.\\" The charge was ridiculous but creative: a misdemeanor count of violating the city's sign ordinance. It's not just signs that are protected speech. Signals are covered too. A few days before the Texas ruling, in St. Louis, a federal judge ruled that motorists \\"have a First Amendment right to flash their headlights to warn\\" fellow drivers that police are nearby or setting a speed trap. In 2012, Michael Elli flashed his headlights to warn oncoming vehicles that police were waiting with radar just up the road. A police officer pulled over Elli, citing him for \\"flashing lights on certain vehicles...warning of RADAR ahead.\\" The city dropped the charge, but the American Civil Liberties Union decided to sue on Elli's behalf, charging that his First Amendment rights were violated. The judge agreed. Let's hear it for common sense. Speed traps are, by their very nature, a form of cheating. Law enforcement officers are bending the rules to hand out tickets. Worse, they're also an example of government-sponsored thievery. Cash-strapped cities and counties have come up with new ways of generating revenue. One of the first places they look are unsuspecting motorists who are in a poor position to complain because -- the authorities are likely to claim -- they wouldn't have received a ticket in the first place if they weren't guilty of speeding. But what are the authorities guilty of? If police have a quota to meet, or a sheriff's substation is competing with other substations as to the number of tickets it hands out, discretion will suffer. People who might not normally get a citation are going to be written up. That's not right. It's one thing for police officers to come across someone speeding in the course of their normal duties, and write that person a ticket. It's another for them to lie in wait for motorists to make mistakes so the government agency they work for can fleece the citizenry. That's not right either. When police set up a speed trap where motorists are likely to be driving over the speed limit -- say, at the bottom of a hill -- and then wait for drivers to meander into their web so they can write tickets that generate revenue for a city, county or state, they're violating a social contract.

More precisely, the emergency room phoned to ask if Ray had a bed. Ray pretended to consult his admission log, just as he always did. The nightly hospital call meant one of three things: the chemical dependency floor was full (highly unlikely), the individual in question had fallen under the hospital's \\"one treatment episode every three months\\" sanction (also known as the Black List, and only moderately unlikely), or the prospective client had no insurance (in Ray's experience, very likely). The folks at the hospital knew, as did Ray, that federal law prohibited him from turning away individuals requesting detoxification services if he had an open bed. The hospital was generous enough to spring for a cab voucher for the intoxicate. In Ray's experience as well, overnight admissions were less interested in detox than in free food, a free bed and complimentary meds. For his two hour paperwork investment and aggravation, he would receive the benefit of knowing the client slept until noon then slipped out the side door and into another binge.

Despite increased security for the flight, Kim arranges for a time-release crate full of venomous snakes to be placed in the cargo hold in an attempt to bring down the plane before it reaches Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). To ensure the snakes attack the passengers without being provoked, he has one of his henchmen disguised as an airport ground employee spray the passengers' leis with a special pheromone which makes the snakes highly aggressive. The crate opens midway through the flight and the snakes make their way through the cabin. A couple having sex in the bathroom, and a man using the bathroom are the first killed. The plane's captain, Sam McKeon, investigates and fixes an electrical short, but is killed by the viper that caused it. Co-pilot Rick, unaware of the snake, believes Sam has suffered a heart attack and continues toward LAX. Some of the snakes attack Rick, and while fending them off he accidentally releases the oxygen masks throughout the plane, causing several snakes to drop into the cabin with them. Numerous passengers, including Agent Sanders, are killed when the snakes invade the cabin. The surviving passengers, who have made their way to the front of the plane, put up blockades of luggage in a desperate attempt to stop the snakes.

As snow sits on the ground it compacts and becomes wet, making it heavier. It can also then turn into ice and become very difficult to remove. Wait until the snowplow has come by before finishing the driveway. A snowplow will usually \\"plow in\\" the driveway at least a bit, pushing more snow onto the edge of your driveway. It can be easier to deal with just clearing the driveway once. Use extra care when shoveling snow pushed onto your driveway by the plow. Plows pack the snow, making it much heavier than undisturbed, freshly fallen snow. One shovelful of snow can weigh 20 pounds (9kg) or more! You will need to consider what is the most efficient snow removal plan. You will also have to avoid piling snow where you'll have to just remove it again, so do not block access to snow that still needs to be cleared. If you are clearing a rectangle, it is better to work from the center out. First clear a strip of snow around the perimeter of the rectangle. Then, starting in the center, push snow towards the cleared area. From there, lift the snow out of the area. Use a brush to get snow off cars before clearing around the car to prevent extra work. Pushing snow is much easier than lifting and can reduce the risk of injury. If you begin early and if the snow is not too deep, then it is better to simply push it off driveways and sidewalks. This is a good way to clear away snow while it is still falling, to reduce accumulation. Spread your hands far apart on the handle, with one hand close to the blade. This will provide more leverage while lifting snow. If you need to dig (to get to your car, for instance), dig using a steady, easy motion. If you are \\"pushing\\" (as you might when clearing a driveway), hold your shovel at a slight angle and begin making passes back and forth width-wise along your driveway. You should rarely need to move your shovel above waist height. Make sure you clear around your mailbox every time it snows. If your mail carrier cannot easily reach your mailbox, then they cannot deliver your mail! Be careful with salt, as it can hurt your lawn, landscaping, and your watershed. It can also damage driveways and other paved areas. Use salt only if the temperature is warm enough (above 0 degrees F/-17 degrees C). Sand provides traction, but if more snow falls on top, it will become useless. Salting the ground before or during a storm can actually increase the amount of snow on your sidewalks and driveways because dry snow sticks to a salted paved area but does not stick to an unsalted paved area.

A disabled Iraqi war veteran is suing a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant in the Bronx for refusing him service when he brought in his service dog. 50-year-old Charles Hernandez says he entered the location on Fordham Road and Jerome Avenue on February 26 to buy a two-piece chicken meal with fries in order to take some prescribed medication. But he was refused service when the employees behind the counter saw that he was accompanied by his service dog, Valor. Turned away: Charles Hernandez (second left) and his dog Valor (black) meet Senator Chuck Schumer (center). Hernandez filed a lawsuit yesterday against a KFC in the Bronx for refusing him and Valor service. 'Papi, there are no dogs allowed,' Hernandez recalls an employee saying. Hernandez tried to explain that Valor is a service dog and according to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Valor is allowed to accompany him anywhere. 'OK, but you still cannot have the dog in the store,' the employee responded. Hernandez even says that the store's manager, Sade Clark, saw the 'discrimination' happening and did nothing about it. 'I was frustrated, angry and more, depressed,' Hernandez told the New York Post. 'No one was helping. Rather than understanding the needs of a person, they shut me out.' So Hernandez is now suing the employee, Clark, the restaurant's owner and the company's principal owner for 1million.

His best works in the first years of the workshop were his woodcut prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as The Men's Bath House (ca. 1496). These were larger and more finely cut than the great majority of German woodcuts hitherto, and far more complex and balanced in composition.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less rain reaches the surface water happens, how will it affect LESS damage by acid rain. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation (less rain reaching the surface water) can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of acid rain causing damage to the ecosystem. Direct effects: 1. Reduced water acidity: If less rain reaches the surface water, the concentration of acid present in the water bodies would be relatively lower. This could potentially result in reduced acidity levels, which in turn might reduce the damage caused to aquatic life, such as fish. 2. Reduced soil acidity: Similar to the effect on surface water, less rain landing on the ground means lower amounts of acid being introduced into the soil. The extent of soil acidification would be limited, protecting trees and other plant life from the harmful impacts of acid rain. Indirect effects: 1. Reduced leaching of nutrients from soils: Acid rain can cause essential nutrients to leach out of the soil, thereby affecting the growth and health of trees and other plants. With the perturbation in place, less rain reaching the surface would lead to diminished leaching of nutrients, which in turn could positively impact plant growth. 2. Lesser damage to tree leaves: If the amount of rain reaching the surface is reduced, tree leaves will be less exposed to acid rain. Consequently, the damage to the leaves would be less severe, allowing better photosynthesis and promoting healthier tree growth. 3. Ecosystem recovery: Over time, as the influence of acid rain declines due to the perturbation, affected systems may begin to recover. This may involve the restoration of aquatic life in water bodies, revitalization of soil fertility, and the general improvement of plant and animal habitats. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of less rain reaching the surface can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of acid rain. These effects could potentially lead to a reduction in the damage caused by acid rain to water bodies, soils, trees, and overall ecosystems. However, the exact outcomes would depend on the specific circumstances and magnitude of the reduced rainfall and its influence on the affected areas."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

I explained my situation to him, and I could tell by the look in his eyes, that he took pity. He hurried to the back to use the phone while I walked in the restaurant. I had less than 10 minutes to get back to my school at this point. The manager returned only to tell me that the taxi company had put him on hold and then the line got disconnected, and that he was now on hold again, but had not yet been able to ask for the taxi yet.

Translate to English","output":"Some others have clung to a miserable and doomed policy whereby the initiator of the conflict finances the costs resulting from the military forces. In this scenario, certain individuals or groups insist on maintaining a policy that has been proven to be ineffective and prone to failure. This policy dictates that the party responsible for instigating a conflict should cover the expenses arising from the deployment of military forces and the subsequent consequences of military action. This strategy is considered miserable due to its inherent flaws, as it may encourage instigators of conflict to take advantage of the fact that they can initiate a dispute with little to no financial repercussions, allowing them to exploit this policy for their gain. Additionally, it places the burden of financial responsibility on the perpetrators, which is an immense challenge and could eventually lead a nation towards economic decline. Moreover, the policy is doomed from the outset because it doesn't take into account the complex nature of international conflicts and the potential for a wide array of unforeseen consequences. It oversimplifies matters and ignores the many variables involved in political and military disputes which may, in turn, lead to further escalation and animosity between opposing parties. There are a few potential reasons why some people still cling to such a policy. First, they may be unaware of the historic failures and long-term effects of this strategy, and thus continue to advocate for the same flawed approach. Alternatively, they might believe that the approach is advantageous for their country or political stance. Another reason could be that they are unwilling to explore alternative, more humane, and fair ways of settling conflicts, such as diplomatic negotiations or international court proceedings. They may fear that these alternatives would not yield the desired outcomes or serve their interests entirely. Lastly, they could be influenced by a broader sense of nationalism or loyalty to their nation, which may cloud their judgment and lead them to support such policies. This could occur even in the face of evidence that demonstrates the inefficiency of the approach, as it often becomes tied to a sense of national pride and identity. In conclusion, the policy of having conflict initiators finance the costs resulting from military forces is a bleak and ill-fated strategy that has proven to be both detrimental and fruitless in the long run. While some individuals or groups may still cling to this approach due to various reasons such as ignorance, fear of alternative means, or even nationalistic loyalty, it is crucial for the international community to recognize the dangers and inefficiencies tied to this policy and strive to seek more constructive and effective ways of resolving conflicts."},{"instruction":"Choose how you want this story to end.

Answer: Humans cannot fly to the moon using normal means of flight like jumping, a helicopter, or a regular airplane because the moon is approximately 384,400 kilometers (238,855 miles) away from Earth. These methods are not capable of achieving the necessary speed, power, and altitude needed to escape Earth's atmosphere, which extends about 100 kilometers (62 miles) above the Earth's surface. Furthermore, they cannot sustain sufficient propulsion in the vacuum of space. Instead, to travel to the moon, humans require advanced technology such as a rocket or spacecraft. These vehicles need to produce enough thrust to break free from Earth's gravity and enter space. Once in orbit around Earth, they must perform a Trans-Lunar Injection (TLI) maneuver to set a trajectory that takes them to the moon. Upon arrival, additional maneuvers are required to enter lunar orbit, prepare for descent, and land safely on the lunar surface."},{"instruction":"Here is a question about this article: The Space Race was a 20th-century competition between two Cold War rivals, the Soviet Union (USSR) and the United States (US), for supremacy in spaceflight capability. It had its origins in the missile-based nuclear arms race between the two nations that occurred following World War II, enabled by captured German rocket technology and personnel. The technological superiority required for such supremacy was seen as necessary for national security, and symbolic of ideological superiority. The Space Race spawned pioneering efforts to launch artificial satellites, unmanned space probes of the Moon, Venus, and Mars, and human spaceflight in low Earth orbit and to the Moon. The competition began on August 2, 1955, when the Soviet Union responded to the US announcement four days earlier of intent to launch artificial satellites for the International Geophysical Year, by declaring they would also launch a satellite \\"in the near future\\". The Soviet Union beat the US to this, with the October 4, 1957 orbiting of Sputnik 1, and later beat the US to the first human in space, Yuri Gagarin, on April 12, 1961. The Space Race peaked with the July 20, 1969 US landing of the first humans on the Moon with Apollo 11. The USSR tried but failed manned lunar missions, and eventually cancelled them and concentrated on Earth orbital space stations. A period of détente followed with the April 1972 agreement on a co-operative Apollo–Soyuz Test Project, resulting in the July 1975 rendezvous in Earth orbit of a US astronaut crew with a Soviet cosmonaut crew. What is the answer to this question: Sputnik 1 started orbiting on what date?","output":"Sputnik 1 started orbiting on October 4, 1957.

The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter. - Dan Patterson is a British television producer and writer, responsible for the production of both the British and American incarnations of the improvisation show \\"Whose Line Is It Anyway?\\" and the British satirical panel show \\"Mock the Week\\" with writing partner Mark Leveson.

Stephen Fry was host of the show from its initial pilot, before departing after the final episode of the M series in 2015, with frequent \\"QI\\" panelist Sandi Toksvig replacing him prior to the beginning of the N series in 2016. The format of the show focuses on Alan and three other guest panelists answering questions that are extremely obscure, making it unlikely that the correct answer will be given. To compensate, the panelists are awarded points not only for the right answer, but also for interesting ones, regardless of whether they are right or even relate to the original question, while points are deducted for \\"answers which are not only wrong, but pathetically obvious\\" typically answers that are generally believed to be true but in fact are misconceptions which are known as forfeits that are usually indicated by a loud siren, flashing lights, and the incorrect answer being displayed on screen. Bonus points are sometimes awarded or deducted for challenges or incorrect references, varying from show to show. \\"QI\\" has a philosophy that \\"everything is interesting if looked at in the right way\\"; many factual errors in the show have been corrected in later episodes or on the show's blog. - Buzzcocks are an English punk rock band, formed in Bolton, England in 1976 by singer-songwriter-guitarist Pete Shelley and singer-songwriter Howard Devoto.

The genre can be traced to 1938, when \\"Information Please\\" debuted on U.S. radio. The earliest known television panel show is \\"Play the Game\\", a charades show in 1946. The modern trend of comedy panel shows can find early roots with \\"Stop Me If You've Heard This One\\" in 1939 and \\"Can You Top This?\\" in 1940.

The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? - Robert Brydon Jones, MBE (born 3 May 1965), known professionally as Rob Brydon, is a Welsh actor, comedian, radio and television presenter, singer and impressionist. He played Dr Paul Hamilton in the Australian/British comedy series \\"Supernova\\", Bryn West in the sitcom\\" Gavin & Stacey\\" and Keith Barret in the BBC comedy series \\"Marion and Geoff\\" and its spin-off \\"The Keith Barret Show\\". - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels. - Have I Got News for You is a British television panel show produced by Hat Trick Productions for the BBC.

She survives and makes her way back to her apartment, where she encounters a burglar and is raped a second time. Thana, her name an allusion to Greek god of death Thanatos,[2] hits this second assailant with a small sculpture then bludgeons him to death with an iron, and carries his body to the bathtub. She goes to work the next day, and after encountering working with an iron, watching her boss Albert rip a shirt off a mannequin, she goes into shock state, which worries her co-workers. However, when she looks at the trashbin at her office, she decides to dismember the burglar's corpse and throw the parts away in various locations of the city. After being sent home, she dismembers the burglar's body, then keeps his .45 caliber pistol, puts the pieces into plastic garbage bags, and then stores them in her fridge. After cleaning her bathtub, she decides to take a shower, but as she strips, she begins to hallucinate the first attacker in the mirror grabbing her breast. This puts her into shock, and notices that organs and body fluids from the burglar are overflowing in the drain. Her neighbor, an old, recently widowed woman named Mrs. Nasone who owns a small dog named Phil, also starts to notice her odd behavior.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process","output":"Smoking less cigarettes will have both direct and indirect impacts on the process of oxygen delivery to the body. Direct impact: Cigarette smoke contains various harmful constituents, including carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide, and other toxic gases. When you inhale cigarette smoke, the red blood cells in your blood absorb more carbon monoxide from the smoke. Carbon monoxide has a higher affinity for hemoglobin – the molecule within red blood cells that binds with oxygen – than oxygen itself. This means that carbon monoxide will \\"compete\\" with oxygen to bind with hemoglobin when both are present. As a result, oxygen transport to the body's tissues is reduced. With fewer cigarettes smoked, there will be a decrease in the amount of carbon monoxide inhaled, which will subsequently lead to better saturation of oxygen in the hemoglobin. This direct impact of less cigarette smoke will allow for better oxygen delivery to the body. Indirect impact: Smoking cigarettes harms the overall respiratory system, making it less efficient in oxygen delivery. For instance, smoking can damage the cilia (tiny hair-like structures lining the respiratory tract) responsible for capturing harmful substances and foreign particles that may have entered the lungs. With damaged cilia, the amount of pollutants trapped within the respiratory system is greater and may result in inflammation or chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders (COPD). Smoking can also disrupt the alveolar wall structure in the lungs, leading to emphysema, a condition characterized by the loss of elasticity within the alveoli. This can impede efficient gas exchange and reduce the lung's capacity to pass oxygen into the bloodstream. By smoking fewer cigarettes, the rate of lung damage will likely be reduced, and the integrity of the alveoli and other components of the respiratory system will be better preserved, indirectly leading to more effective oxygen delivery to the body. In conclusion, smoking less cigarettes impacts the oxygen delivery process in both direct and indirect ways. Directly, it reduces the amount of carbon monoxide competing with oxygen for hemoglobin binding; while indirectly, it better preserves the functions and integrity of the respiratory system that are essential for efficient oxygen uptake and delivery."},{"instruction":"Answer a question about this article: Impermanence (Pāli: anicca) expresses the Buddhist notion that all compounded or conditioned phenomena (all things and experiences) are inconstant, unsteady, and impermanent. Everything we can experience through our senses is made up of parts, and its existence is dependent on external conditions. Everything is in constant flux, and so conditions and the thing itself are constantly changing. Things are constantly coming into being, and ceasing to be. Since nothing lasts, there is no inherent or fixed nature to any object or experience. According to the doctrine of impermanence, life embodies this flux in the aging process, the cycle of rebirth (saṃsāra), and in any experience of loss. The doctrine asserts that because things are impermanent, attachment to them is futile and leads to suffering (dukkha). What is the meaning of impermanence in Buddhism?","output":"Impermanence, or \\"anicca\\" in Pāli, is a fundamental concept in Buddhism that emphasizes the transient, ever-changing nature of all things and experiences in existence. It is one of the Three Marks of Existence, along with suffering (dukkha) and non-self (anatta). According to the doctrine of impermanence, everything in the universe, from the smallest particles to the most complex forms of life, is subject to change, decay, and eventual cessation. In Buddhism, impermanence serves as a reminder that everything we can perceive through our senses, whether physical or mental, is made up of various components and dependent on external conditions for its existence. Consequently, all things are in a state of constant flux, and their nature, appearance, and characteristics are continually evolving. This concept has significant implications for our understanding of life, relationships, and the pursuit of happiness. The recognition of impermanence serves several purposes in Buddhist practice: 1. Developing non-attachment: Since everything is temporary and subject to decay, attachment to material possessions, relationships, and even our own self-concept can lead to suffering. By understanding the impermanent nature of things, Buddhists aim to cultivate a sense of non-attachment and reduce the tendency to cling to impermanent conditions or states. 2. Encouragement to be mindful and live in the present: By recognizing that all things are in constant flux, Buddhists are encouraged to cultivate mindfulness and focus on the present moment, rather than dwelling on past experiences or being overly anxious about the future. By doing so, individuals can learn to appreciate and savor life's fleeting moments more fully. 3. Cultivating compassion and understanding: Impermanence reminds us that everyone and everything around us is also undergoing the same continuous process of change. This realization can foster a sense of empathy and understanding for others as we recognize that everyone is subject to the same universal law of impermanence. 4. Preparation for inevitable change: By understanding the impermanent nature of existence, Buddhists are better prepared to face life's inevitable changes, losses, and challenges. This understanding helps cultivate resilience and equanimity when facing difficult situations and allows for a smoother transition through life's various stages. 5. A support for spiritual practice: Recognizing the pervasive nature of impermanence can motivate and deepen one's spiritual practice. By understanding that life is transient and unpredictable, Buddhists are encouraged to put greater effort into their practice, seek liberation from the cycle of birth and death (samsara), and ultimately achieve the ultimate goal of enlightenment. In summary, impermanence in Buddhism is a profound concept that serves as a cornerstone of Buddhist philosophy and practice. By understanding and embracing the ever-changing nature of existence, Buddhists seek to cultivate non-attachment, mindfulness, compassion, resilience, and spiritual growth while reducing suffering and finding a deeper sense of meaning and happiness in their lives."},{"instruction":"English cricket team arrives in Harare The English Cricket team has defended its decision to go ahead with its controversial tour of Zimbabwe.

This article will delve into the controversies surrounding the case, focusing on Facebook's involvement and the wider implications for internet privacy and surveillance. Facebook's Inaction and Michael Adebowale's Accounts Despite being presented with evidence linking Michael Adebowale to terrorist activities, Facebook failed to provide information on 5 out of his 11 accounts to the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ). Adebowale's posts, which were described as \\"graphic and emotive,\\" included a direct message to an Al Qaeda extremist calling for the killing of a soldier. According to Lee Rigby's family, blame for his death lies not only with the perpetrators, but also with government security services and internet companies. Lee's sister, Sara McClure, stated that \\"Facebook has my brother's blood on their hands\\" and that she holds the company \\"partly responsible for Lee's murder.\\" Civil Liberties and Privacy Concerns In the wake of the Rigby case, civil liberty groups argue that the \\"appalling murder\\" should not be used as a pretext for increased surveillance and monitoring of the entire UK population. Critics accuse MPs of spinning the story to deflect attention away from the failings of security agencies MI5 and MI6. A former MI6 director has also commented on the issue, saying that it would be \\"almost impossible\\" and \\"unfair\\" to expect companies like Facebook to relay terror-related material to authorities. This raises questions about the balance between private companies' responsibilities for user content and the right to privacy for individuals. Family Demands and Government Response Step-father Ian Rigby called for answers from former Prime Minister David Cameron, stating, \\"We have lost a son, but we have never been able to mourn Lee.\\" The prime minister's spokesperson confirmed that Mr. Cameron would be open to meeting with the family to discuss their concerns. Between Adebowale and his accomplice, Michael Adebolajo, the pair were subject to at least seven intelligence investigations. Adebolajo’s case revealed further inadequacies within the intelligence agencies, including a \\"deeply unsatisfactory\\" response from MI6 when he was caught in Kenya attempting to join Al-Shabaab terrorists. Despite this, Adebolajo was dismissed as a mere drug dealer weeks before Rigby's murder and subsequently dropped off the official radar. Conclusion The Lee Rigby case has highlighted the debate over the boundaries between privacy, civil liberties, and the role of internet companies in aiding security agencies' efforts to thwart potential threats. This ongoing discussion will undoubtedly shape the future of digital communication, both in the UK and globally, as governments and private companies seek to strike the necessary balance between safety and human rights."},{"instruction":"Q:Article: Colin walked slowly home from school.

Act / Episode 1: More Orphan Than Not[edit] In 1977, the children at the Sisters of Mercy Orphanage are playing soccer with an old soda can in the front yard. But then, Sister Mary-Mengele (Larry David), the meanest nun in the orphanage gets their attention by telling them to go inside and do their work. The kids sing \\"Everybody is Special\\", but she tells them to shut up and go to work. Later, Moe, Larry and Curly are dumped on the doorstep of the orphanage as babies. Ever since, the trio have wreaked havoc in the place, leaving the nuns who run it utterly terrified, especially Sister Mary-Mengele who has always hated the trio. Ten years later, in 1987, out of desperation, when a prospective couple comes to adopt, the exasperated nuns bring out the trio as being the only three available, eventually adding a fourth when another boy, Teddy, enters the picture. The couple, the Harters (Stephen Collins and Carly Craig), decides to pick Moe, but when he requests Larry and Curly to join him, he is dropped back off at the orphanage, and they choose Teddy instead. 25 years later in 2012, the trio (Chris Diamantopoulos, Sean Hayes and Will Sasso) are adults and are still living at the orphanage and working as janitors.

The speaker appears to not be a part of the Red Sox Nation, and they are expressing their happiness in seeing the Red Sox defeat the New York Yankees, their major rival. The New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox have had a long-standing rivalry in Major League Baseball (MLB), dating back to the early 20th century. This rivalry is considered one of the most intense and passionate in the sports world, generating strong emotions and reactions from both teams' fans and the baseball community. The text also suggests that the speaker would like the Red Sox to win the World Series so that they can shift their attention away from the Red Sox Nation. The World Series is the championship series held at the end of the MLB season, where the winner of the American League faces the winner of the National League to determine the overall champion. Winning the World Series is considered the pinnacle of achievement in professional baseball, and it serves as a significant source of pride and bragging rights for the fans of the winning team. In this statement, the speaker appears to have a somewhat dismissive attitude towards the Red Sox Nation, as they suggest that they would like to \\"be done with\\" the fanbase once the team wins the World Series. This could imply that the speaker may find the attention given to the Red Sox fanbase excessive or tiresome, and they would prefer for the spotlight to move to another topic or team in the future. It is also possible that the speaker is expressing a sense of fatigue with the rivalry and would like to see some form of resolution or achievement that would lessen its intensity.

The reason behind this was that the twigs were dry and easier to ignite, while the branches were not as dry and required more effort. Step 1: Assess the situation Mark realized that having a fire fueled only by twigs would not produce enough heat for cooking or providing warmth. Therefore, he needed to figure out a way to get the branches to burn as well. Step 2: Determine the cause Upon closer examination, Mark found that the branches were damp due to earlier rainfall. This explained why they were not catching fire easily. Step 3: Problem-solving To overcome this issue, Mark decided to look for some dry branches nearby. He knew that dry branches would catch fire more easily and help sustain the fire longer. Step 4: Gather materials Mark searched the area and collected several dry branches, making sure they were a suitable size for the fire. In addition, he also gathered some dry leaves and pine needles, which he planned to use as kindling. Step 5: Prepare the fire Before adding the dry branches to the fire, Mark decided to create a better base using the dry leaves and pine needles. This new base would help in generating more heat and make it easier for the dry branches to ignite. Step 6: Light the fire Mark carefully placed the dry branches on top of the kindling and gradually added more twigs to the fire. He continued to blow on the fire, helping it spread and catch onto the larger branches. Step 7: Sustain and monitor the fire Finally, the dry branches caught fire, providing a more substantial and longer-lasting fire. Mark continued to monitor the fire, adding more branches and twigs as needed to maintain the desired heat output. In conclusion, by identifying the root cause of the problem and taking appropriate steps, Mark was able to create a sustainable fire using both twigs and dry branches, ensuring a warm and comfortable campsite."},{"instruction":"Can we conclude from \\"Woman standing in the rain with an umbrella and a stuffed animal.\\" that \\"Woman is waiting for someone.\\"?

Watch for a head that's not centered. Assess the symmetry of your hips / pelvis. Consider your history of skin changes. Be alert to constant (chronic) spinal pain.\\" Article:","output":"Title: How to Spot Signs of Spinal Problems: A Simple Guide for Kids Hello little friends! Today, we are going to learn about our spine and what we can do to make sure it stays strong and healthy. Our spine is a very important part of our body. It helps us stand up tall, bend, and twist. Sometimes, our spine doesn't work how it's supposed to, and we need to spot any signs of trouble early. Here are some simple tips to check if your spine is happy and healthy. 1. Look for Uneven Shoulders Have you ever noticed how your arms hang down from your shoulders? Sometimes, when there is a spine problem, one shoulder might look a little higher than the other. This is called uneven shoulders. It's easy to check this! Stand in front of a mirror or ask a grown-up to check if your shoulders are level with each other. 2. Watch for a Head That's Not Centered Imagine a straight line going down the middle of your body, from the top of your head all the way to your toes. Now, make sure that your head is right in the center of that line. If it's a little bit to the left or right, your spine might be having some trouble.

Here is a detailed description of the locations mentioned, where you are most likely to find a marker: 1. Office Supply Store: One of the most straightforward ways to get a marker is to visit your local office supply store. These stores often carry a wide range of markers, including permanent markers, whiteboard markers, and more specialized types for various purposes. You can choose a marker based on your specific needs, and you might discover other useful supplies while browsing the aisles. Some popular office supply stores include Staples, Office Depot, and OfficeMax. 2. Desk: If you're in an office or home setting, it's very possible that you might find a marker lying around on the desk. Look around the desk area, especially in the pen and pencil holders if one is available. People often keep markers for various purposes such as labeling files or highlighting important notes. If you don't find one on your own desk, you might ask a roommate, family member, or coworker if they have a marker you can borrow. 3. Pocket: While not as common, some people might keep a marker in their pocket or bag. If you happen to be wearing a shirt, jacket, or pants with several pockets, you might have accidentally placed a marker in one of your pockets without realizing it. Alternatively, you can ask someone in your vicinity if they happen to have a marker on them. 4. Drawer: Similar to searching for a marker on a desk, many people store their writing utensils in desk drawers or filing cabinets. Check the drawers near your working area or any drawers you might have used recently. Sometimes markers are stored in miscellaneous drawers with other stationery items, such as paper clips, erasers, and sticky notes. In work environments, there could also be supply cabinets or stationery cupboards where markers are kept for employees to use, so it might be worth checking there as well. 5. Briefcase: If you carry a briefcase or laptop bag, there is a chance that you might have a marker stored in one of its compartments. Many professionals keep writing utensils in their briefcases for taking notes or marking documents on-the-go. Look through your briefcase or bag and any smaller compartments, pockets, or penholders it might have to see if a marker is present. In summary, the best answer to where you can find a marker if you don't currently have one depends on your circumstances. It is worth checking nearby desks, drawers, briefcases, and pockets, or asking someone in your vicinity if they have one to borrow. If these searches fail, visiting a local office supply store would be the most reliable way to obtain a marker for your needs."},{"instruction":"I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

With an unresolved anger and disappointment simmering beneath her restrained exterior, she desperately searched for the right words to address the situation at hand. As the heated confrontation unfolded, the two women's voices gradually rose in volume, each accusing the other of faults and betrayals in their once unblemished relationship. Maria questioned Jennifer's loyalty and integrity while Jennifer defensively tried to justify her actions, claiming that her situation had left her with no other choice. Tears streamed down both women's cheeks as they realized that this argument had driven a seemingly insurmountable wedge between them. Jennifer finally admitted to her wrongdoing, revealing the desperate circumstances that had driven her to lie about her financial troubles. She explained how her mounting debt had become an unbearable weight upon her shoulders, making her feel helpless and isolated. Guilt-ridden, she had chosen to conceal the truth from Maria to protect their friendship, fearing that her problems would become a burden on her dear friend. However, her dishonesty had inevitably backfired, and instead of safeguarding their bond, it had threatened to destroy it altogether.

The heroic female warrior Britomart (representing both chastity and Elizabeth I) battles through obstacles to reach the chamber in which Amoret is being held, and slays Busirane moments before he is able to kill Amoret.Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret was intended by Etty to illustrate the virtues of chastity and honour. It shows the moment in which Busirane is interrupted by Britomart as he prepares to kill Amoret. Amoret is chained to a gilded Solomonic column, carved with depictions of Venus, and her clothes fall from her shoulders as she struggles. Britomart, clad in armour, enters Busirane's Moorish chamber, and tramples a blood-stained grimoire as she swings her sword. Busirane, naked from the waist up and with Chinese-style trousers and queue, falls to the floor, his blade still pointing at Amoret's heart. Unusually for Etty, Britomart is painted very thinly, with the canvas weave still visible through the paint. Art historian Alison Smith considers that this was likely inspired by Henry Fuseli, who painted a depiction of Britomart using the same style of painting.In the original poem, Busirane had tortured and cut out the heart of the still-living Amoret by the time of her rescue.

The bears were illegally harvested for their bile which is used in folk remedies. The painful process often leads to a slow and agonizing death for the bear. The rescue marks the first time a large number of bears was relinquished on conscience. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Brave Bears Rescued from Unkind Farm in Vietnam Once upon a time, in far-off Vietnam, there were 14 moon bears who needed help. Moon bears are big, lovely bears with shiny black fur and a white patch on their chest that looks like a crescent moon. They love to frolic around, climb trees and munch on tasty fruits. But they were not living the happy, playful life a bear should live - they were living in a very unkind place called a bear bile farm. This place wasn't really a farm with open fields and happy animals. Instead, it was a sad, scary place where naughty people were hurting the bears to get something called bile. Bile is a liquid in the bear's tummy that helps them digest their food. Some people believe bear bile has special magic to cure sickness, even though it's not really true. To get this bile, the bad people were doing something very painful to the bears. This wasn't fair or nice and often made the bears very sick. Some poor bears even died from this terrible treatment, which is very, very sad. But guess what, kiddos? Our story takes a happy turn! One beautiful day, some brave helpers came and rescued all 14 bears from this mean farm. These helpers stopped the bad people from hurting the bears, and took the bears to a safer, kinder place where they can now live happily, playfully, just as all bears should. What's so extra special about this rescue? Well, this is the first time lots of bears were saved just because people felt it was the right thing to do. Some of the bad people realized how wrong they were, how much they were hurting the innocent bears, and willingly let the bears go to be happy and safe. It's like they finally listened to their heart that knew being good is better than being bad. From now on, these 14 moon bears will be free to do all the fun things they love - like munching on fruits, climbing trees, and of course, taking long naps under the big, shiny moon. Their rescue is a big reminder to all people to be kind to animals, to love them, and not hurt them in any way. After all, like us, animals too want to live happily and peacefully. So next time, when you see an animal, remember to be gentle and kind. Because, sweetie, that's what real heroes do!"},{"instruction":"Given the background: So much rain falling so fast causes some of the damage from a hurricane. But a lot of the damage is caused by storm surge. Storm surge is very high water located in the low pressure eye of the hurricane. The very low pressure of the eye allows the water level to rise above normal sea level. Storm surge can cause flooding when it reaches land ( Figure below ). High winds do a great deal of damage in hurricanes. High winds can also create very big waves. If the large waves are atop a storm surge, the high water can flood the shore. If the storm happens to occur at high tide, the water will rise even higher. and the situation: Beach town was hit hard by the hurricane.

I would often go to this store to use the post office and browse around after. Often purchasing something. On this occassion I bought two things I wanted first, and my 2 year old started playing with some wooden animals on a low shelf. I asked her to stop, but then my attention for a few seconds got distracted because I had to pay. The person behind the counter immediately said 'your child is playing with those animals.' as in 'Stop.' I asked my child to stop and come by me, of which she immediately did. Then I went to stand in line at the post office and my child woundered over to look at and yes, touch, the stuffed animals which I believe would be harmless. A second and much ruder sales person by the name of Candy K. said to me something along the lines of 'Would get control over your child and stop making a mess of the store.' i was shocked and horrified by this women. I spend all day with my child, and take pride that she is a good listener for the majority of the time, and is generallly conscientious and careful in her ways. I know that by working in the store, they must encounter truly rambutous kids, but I did not appreciate being treated as if my child was wild or out of control.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options： A. container B. internet cafe C. starbucks D. cup E. supermarket Answer:","output":"D. cup For someone who is thirsty and looking to consume coffee, the most suitable option among the given choices is to put the coffee in a cup (Option D). A cup is a small, round container often with a handle, designed specifically for drinking liquids such as coffee. It enables you to conveniently hold, transport, and consume your coffee comfortably, without spillage or causing any inconvenience. To further explain the reasons for choosing a cup over the other options: A. container - A container is a vague and general term that can include various types of receptacles. While one could store coffee in a container, it may not be the ideal choice for immediate consumption, especially without specifying the type of container. A cup, however, is specifically designed for drinking. B. internet cafe - An internet cafe is a location that provides access to the internet and usually sells coffee and snacks. Although an internet cafe can serve coffee, the question implies that you already have the coffee and are looking for a place to put it for consumption. Therefore, an internet cafe is not the suitable option for this purpose. C. Starbucks - Starbucks is a well-known coffeehouse chain that sells various coffee beverages. Similar to the case with an internet cafe, while one can purchase coffee at Starbucks, the question is about where to put the coffee for consumption, not where to buy it. Thus, Starbucks is not the appropriate choice. E. supermarket - A supermarket is a large store that offers a wide assortment of food and household items. While coffee beans or ready-to-drink coffee can be purchased at a supermarket, it is not a place to put coffee when you are thirsty. It is a place of purchase and not the best choice for holding or consuming your coffee. In conclusion, based on the requirement to find the most suitable option for putting coffee when thirsty, the best choice among the given options is D. cup because of its functionality, convenience, and specific design for safely holding and consuming coffee drinks."},{"instruction":"Here's a question: Joe and Jane have begun reaching a tentative agreement about the merger of their two companies. Their negotiations have become less than professional, and have begun doing something that is very unprofessional and compromises their objectivity. What might they be doing? Here are possible answers to this question: - compromises - eloping - calmness - fucking - handshake I believe the correct choice is \\"fucking\\", here's why:","output":"First, let us examine each of the given options and analyze their relevance to the context of Joe and Jane's unprofessional behavior during the merger negotiations: 1. Compromises: While reaching compromises is an essential aspect of negotiation, it is not an unprofessional or compromising act. In fact, finding a middle ground and making compromises is crucial in business dealings to ensure that both parties are satisfied with the outcome. Therefore, this option is not relevant to the question. 2. Eloping: Eloping refers to running away with a lover, usually to marry secretly. While the act of eloping could potentially affect their personal lives, it is not directly linked to the merger negotiations. Running away might be unprofessional, but the primary concern here is the disruption of the negotiation process and any potential subjective decisions resulting from their unprofessional behavior. 3. Calmness: Exhibiting calmness during negotiations is not unprofessional. On the contrary, maintaining a calm demeanor is essential for productive discussion. Being level-headed allows the parties involved to focus on the business matter rather than getting carried away with emotions. Calmness, therefore, is not an appropriate answer to the question. 4. Fucking: This option refers to an inappropriate and highly unprofessional behavior – becoming sexually involved with each other. In the context of business negotiation, sexual relationships between two key players could seriously compromise their objectivity. Their personal relationship might hinder their ability to make unbiased decisions in the best interest of their companies. Furthermore, it could lead to potential legal issues, considering the power dynamics and the professional nature of their association. This option is most likely to be the correct answer. 5. Handshake: A handshake is a common and professional gesture during business dealings. It symbolizes trust, commitment, and goodwill between the parties involved. A handshake does not compromise objectivity or any aspect of negotiation. Hence, this option is not relevant to the question. Based on the evaluation of the potential scenarios, it can be concluded that the correct choice is \\"fucking\\". Becoming sexually involved during a crucial merger negotiation between their companies is highly unprofessional and poses a serious risk to their objectivity. Joe and Jane's behavior could compromise the outcome of the deal and may even lead to ethical issues and legal implications. Their ability to exercise good judgment and make sound decisions in the best interest of both companies is crucial for the success of the merger, and their unprofessionalism can be detrimental to the entire process."},{"instruction":"Select the correct answer: Which is an appropriate title for this article?

Bowling Alley: In the game of bowling, the primary objective is to use a large, heavy ball to knock down a set of pins arranged in a triangular formation at the end of a lane. This directly aligns with the given description. 2. Pool Table: Although a game played with balls, pool (or billiards) involves using a cue stick to direct the balls into pockets on a table. The objective is not to knock things down but to strategically pocket the balls. 3. Gymnasium: A gymnasium is a general term that can refer to different sports. Many sports played in a gymnasium, like basketball or volleyball, do involve balls. However, the primary objective in these sports is usually not to knock things down, but to score points by directing the ball to a specific area or target. 4. Playground: Playgrounds typically contain various recreational equipment for children, such as slides, swings, and climbing structures. Although balls may be used for various games in a playground, the main purpose is not to knock things down. 5. Golf: Golf is a sport where a small ball is struck with a club towards a hole. The objective is to get the ball into the hole with the fewest strokes possible, not to knock things down. Based on this reasoning, it can be concluded that the correct answer is the bowling alley, where a ball is specifically used to knock things down (i.e., the pins)."},{"instruction":"Next question: when did sonny with a chance first air?","output":"To find out when the TV show \\"Sonny with a Chance\\" first aired, I will perform a search on the internet: 1.

You know how you have a birthday every year on the same day? Well, a 'leap second' is a bit like a surprise extra second that only happens once in a while. It's not like a birthday, but it is a way to make sure all the clocks and time everywhere stay on the same schedule. The Earth, which is our big round home, spins around in space. Sometimes, this spinning can be a little faster or slower. The scientists who study the Earth and time want to make sure everything works just right, so they add this 'leap second' to all the clocks. So, on Tuesday, instead of the clock going straight from 23:59:59 (or 11:59:59 pm) to 00:00:00 (or midnight), it will first go to 23:59:60 (or 11:59:60 pm) before starting a new day. It's just one extra second, but it helps make sure all the clocks in the world stay accurate. Now, you might wonder what we can do with this extra second. Well, you won't even notice it, so you can continue doing whatever you are doing. The most important thing is that the world's clocks will stay in sync, which helps everyone know the right time. So, remember kids, on Tuesday, there will be a 'leap second' added to the world's clocks. It's a tiny change, but an important one to help the Earth and clocks stay on the same schedule.

Mildred is sure her boyfriend will know who victimized Sylvia--with the town deserted, the only other people in the area are the construction crew working on a dam near the town. Mildred drives to the dam and informs her boyfriend, who works at the site. He tells her he will look into it.Meanwhile, Horace and his group have discovered that their van is now broken down and useless. They abandon it in the woods and walk to the town on foot. The first thing they see is the bakery, and Mildred sells them meat pies, throwing in a few extra things as a kindness for them. Horace tells them that he and his friends are rock musicians stranded there, and he asks where they can seek shelter. Mildred explains that Valley Hills only has a few residents, most of them long gone. Only she and a few others remain, awaiting the demolition of the town in the near future. Upon hearing this, Horace and the others move into one of the abandoned houses, smashing things...

What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process, where plant roots begin to grow and eventually lead to the breakdown and erosion of rocks, is known as mechanical and chemical weathering. In this process, plants play a crucial role in the disintegration and decomposition of rocks, which further contributes to soil formation and the shaping of landscapes. Before diving into the explicit details of the first step, let's take a brief look at how the entire process unfolds. 1. Plant root growth: The initial step involves the germination and growth of plant seeds in tiny cracks or fissures present within rocks. As the seedlings sprout, their roots begin to penetrate deeper into the rock crevices for anchorage and essential nutrients. These roots exert pressure on the rocks, causing them to fracture mechanically over time. 2. Break apart the rock: As the plant roots continue to grow, they exert increasing amounts of force on the rock, leading to the expansion of existing cracks and the creation of new ones. Over time, this accumulating pressure causes larger portions of the rock to break apart, making it more vulnerable to further weathering processes. 3. Plant acids dissolve parts of the rock: Plant roots release organic acids and other chemicals that can dissolve minerals within rocks. This process is known as chemical weathering and occurs alongside mechanical weathering. The chemical reactions between the plant-secreted substances and the rock minerals gradually weaken the rock's structural integrity, aiding in its disintegration. 4. The rocks are broken into more and more pieces: As a result of the combined forces of mechanical and chemical weathering, the rock is fragmented into smaller and smaller pieces. These fragmented pieces are more easily weathered than the original rock, as they have a larger overall surface area exposed to both physical and chemical processes. 5. Erosion starts to occur: Once the rocks have been significantly broken down into smaller pieces, they become more susceptible to erosion. Erosion involves the removal and transportation of these fragmented rock materials by various agents, such as water, wind, and ice. Over an extended period, the transportation and deposition of the broken rock pieces lead to reshaping landscapes and creating new geological formations. In summary, the first step of this process is that plant roots begin to grow, specifically in small cracks within rocks. The roots then exert pressure on the rock, initiating mechanical weathering and eventually leading to chemical weathering. This combined action ultimately results in the fragmentation and erosion of rocks. The entire process showcases how the growth and activity of living organisms interact dynamically with their environment, participating in cycles of destruction and renewal that shape and reshape Earth's landscapes."},{"instruction":"Teacher:This task involves creating questions from a given passage that involve some kind of complex reasoning (including numerical reasoning).

Article: The Norwegian Government is doing its best to keep the oil industry under control. A new law limits exploration to an area south of the southern end of the long coastline; production limits have been laid down (though these have already been raised); and oil companies have not been allowed to employ more than a limited number of foreign workers. But the oil industry has a way of getting over such problems, and few people believe that the Government will be able to hold things back for long. As one Norwegian politician said last week: \\" We will soon be changed beyond all recognition.\\" Ever since the war, the Government has been carrying out a program of development in the area north of the Arctic Circle. During the past few years this program has had a great deal of success. Tromso has been built up into a local capital with a university, a large hospital and a healthy industry. But the oil industry has already started to draw people south, and within a few years the whole northern policy could be in ruins. The effects of the oil industry would not be limited to the north, however. With nearly 100 percent employment, everyone can see a situation developing in which the service industries and the tourist industry will lose more of their workers to the oil industry. Some smaller industries might even disappear altogether when it becomes cheaper to buy goods from abroad. The real argument over oil is its threat to the Norwegian way of life. Farmers and fishermen do not make up most of the population, but they are an important part of it, because Norwegians see in them many of the qualities that they regard with pride as essentially Norwegian.

Lululemon, the upmarket “athleisure” brand favoured by celebrities including Kim Kardashian, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Cameron Diaz, on Wednesday reported annual sales of more than 2bn (£1.4bn). The surge in sales, up from 1.8bn the previous year, and the company’s prediction that sales could double to 4bn by 2020 sent Lululemon’s shares soaring on Wall Street. Lululemon shares, which had already increased by 16% so far this year, rose by 10.4% on Wednesday to 67.70 by lunchtime, valuing the 18-year-old Canadian company at 9.5bn. The financial success comes just two years after the company was plunged into crisis by an “unacceptable level of sheerness” in some of its up-to-98 black Luon pants, which led some yogis to display a little more than they intended while working out in their ashrams. In the wake of the see-through debacle, Lululemon withdrew 17% of its stock and its chief product officer, Sheree Waterson, resigned. However, Chip Wilson, Lululemon founder and Canada’s 17th richest person with a 2.3bn fortune, went on to blame women’s bodies for causing the problem. “Quite frankly, some women’s bodies just actually don’t work for [the pants],” Wilson told Bloomberg. “It’s really about the rubbing through the thighs, how much pressure is there.” Now that women are once again happy doing a downward dogs in its pants, Lululemon is going after men with a target of 1bn in menswear sales by 2020. “The unification of men’s and women’s under one vision is really strengthening the brand, so when you think about selling global stories of functional materials and construction, we now have a platform that really is much larger than it was before,” Laurent Potdevin, Lululemon’s chief executive, said.

Dana Milbank of The Washington Post recorded the unusually frank conversation for posterity. Far from towing the party line, the candidate blasted the Bush White House for its failures in Iraq and in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. When asked if he'd want President Bush to campaign with him, the mystery man said, \\"To be honest with you, probably not.\\" As for the Congressional GOP, the candidate was harsher still. The party's most profound failure was, in his view, a failure to recognize where it had gone wrong. The candidate, we later learned, was Michael Steele, the then lieutenant governor of Maryland who eventually lost to veteran Congressman Ben Cardin in an overwhelmingly Democratic year. Milbank highlighted Steele's most striking remark from that lunch: The candidate called his Republican \\"R\\" a \\"scarlet letter.\\" Now, as the new chairman of the Republican National Committee, Steele has taken responsibility for rebuilding the Republican brand, which now stands in opposition to a popular president who is rolling up his shirtsleeves to fight the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Hailing from the heavily black middle-class suburbs of Washington, D.C., Steele is used to winning over hostile audiences. Though he lost to Cardin by a significant margin, Steele ran a shrewd campaign that was tailor-made to his state. On issues like public transportation and education, he reached out to voters who'd normally never give Republicans a hearing. On Iraq, the central issue in the campaign, he opposed withdrawal while calling for a serious rethink of U.S. strategy in the region. He came across as a results-oriented pragmatist without compromising his social conservatism, an approach that has also worked for much-lauded Republican governors like Mitch Daniels of Indiana and Bobby Jindal of Louisiana. And as an African-American from a solidly Democratic state, he presented a marked contrast to the other candidates for RNC chair. Two of his most formidable opponents, Chip Saltsman and Katon Dawson, were southern conservatives who came across as racially tone-deaf if not worse. Saltsman, who helped lead Mike Huckabee's innovative campaign for the Republican presidential nomination and who served as Bill Frist's right-hand man, will forever be remembered for having included a song titled \\"Barack the Magic Negro\\" on a CD for members of the RNC. Dawson hastily resigned from an all-white South Carolina country club before entering the race for RNC chair. Whatever the intentions of either candidate, a victory for Saltsman or Dawson would have been a black eye for the party--an indication that the GOP's Big Tent was now a Pup Tent. Of course, Michael Steele can't transform the Republican party single-handedly. Fortunately, there are early indications that Republicans--even Congressional Republicans--are learning from their mistakes, and far sooner than beleaguered conservatives had any right to expect. House Minority Leader John Boehner, a man with all the charisma of a washed-up lounge singer, has emerged overnight as a conservative folk hero for uniting his party against President Obama's stimulus package. As David Brooks has ably described, the stimulus package represents an awkward marriage of long-term Democratic objectives, like pouring more money into higher education and green energy and big-ticket infrastructure projects, and short-term measures that governments at all levels will have an extremely difficult time absorbing. Many of these long-term objectives are very worthy ones that Republicans should embrace as well, particularly efforts to upgrade our physical infrastructure. Yet the speed with which this measure has been pursued means that spending discipline has gone out the window. State governments that receive billions of dollars will have no way to evaluate the efficacy of spending, and so we will find, two or three years hence, that vast sums were wasted, and indeed that vast sums fell into the wrong hands. Not only have Republicans opposed this ill-conceived free-for-all--they've actually floated a number of more attractive alternatives, including a steep payroll tax cut, a sharp increase in the child tax credit, and offering state governments loans instead of grants. The first would represent an immediate economic boon to all American workers and businesses, the second would benefit hard-hit families, and the third would force state governments to spend responsibly rather than shovel money out the door. If Republicans keep moving in this direction, by backing similarly smart policies on fighting climate change and rising health care costs, President Obama and Congressional Democrats will have a real fight on their hands. Reihan Salam is an associate editor at The Atlantic and a fellow at the New America Foundation. The co-author of Grand New Party: How Republicans Can Win the Working Class and Save the American Dream, he writes a weekly column for Forbes.com. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"In 2006, Michael Steele was a Republican candidate who talked about the problems with his own party. He was honest and said he didn't want President Bush to campaign with him. Years later, Steele became the head of the Republican National Committee (RNC) and worked to fix the problems he saw. Some people in his party did things that looked mean toward African-Americans, but Steele is African-American and tries to include everyone. Meanwhile, the Republicans are starting to learn from their mistakes and are suggesting better ways to help the country, like cutting taxes and helping families. If they keep doing this, they will give President Obama and other Democrats a challenge."},{"instruction":"The boy continued to whip the pony , and eventually the pony threw him over.

Read the sentence and identify pronouns: The sentence says, \\"The boy continued to whip the pony, and eventually the pony threw him over. John laughed out quite loud. 'Served him right,' he said.\\" In this sentence, we have the pronouns \\"him\\" and \\"he.\\" 2. Identify the subjects that pronouns possibly refer to: The possible subjects for these pronouns in the sentence are \\"the boy,\\" \\"the pony,\\" and \\"John.\\" 3. Determine which subject is being referred to by \\"him\\" in \\"Served him right\\": The phrase \\"served him right\\" usually refers to something that the speaker perceives as deserved or fair consequence for someone's actions. As the boy was whipping the pony and was thrown over, it would make sense that \\"him\\" refers to the person who suffered the consequence, i.e., the boy. 4. Determine what \\"he\\" refers to in \\"he said\\": The phrase \\"he said\\" comes right after \\"John laughed out quite loud.\\" This suggests that \\"he\\" refers to the person who has just laughed — John.

Stalin's death in 1953 was the biggest step toward Shostakovich's rehabilitation as a creative artist, which was marked by his Tenth Symphony. It features a number of musical quotations and codes (notably the DSCH and Elmira motifs, Elmira Nazirova being a pianist and composer who had studied under Shostakovich in the year before his dismissal from the Moscow Conservatory), the meaning of which is still debated, while the savage second movement, according to Testimony, is intended as a musical portrait of Stalin. The Tenth ranks alongside the Fifth and Seventh as one of Shostakovich's most popular works. 1953 also saw a stream of premieres of the \\"desk drawer\\" works. During the forties and fifties, Shostakovich had close relationships with two of his pupils, Galina Ustvolskaya and Elmira Nazirova. In the background to all this remained Shostakovich's first, open marriage to Nina Varzar until her death in 1954. He taught Ustvolskaya from 1937 to 1947. The nature of their relationship is far from clear: Mstislav Rostropovich described it as \\"tender\\". Ustvolskaya rejected a proposal of marriage from him after Nina's death. Shostakovich's daughter, Galina, recalled her father consulting her and Maxim about the possibility of Ustvolskaya becoming their stepmother. Ustvolskaya's friend Viktor Suslin said that she had been \\"deeply disappointed\\" in Shostakovich by the time of her graduation in 1947. The relationship with Nazirova seems to have been one-sided, expressed largely through his letters to her, and can be dated to around 1953 to 1956. He married his second wife, Komsomol activist Margarita Kainova, in 1956; the couple proved ill-matched, and divorced three years later. In 1954, Shostakovich wrote the Festive Overture, opus 96; it was used as the theme music for the 1980 Summer Olympics. (His '\\"Theme from the film Pirogov, Opus 76a: Finale\\" was played as the cauldron was lit at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece.) In 1959, Shostakovich appeared on stage in Moscow at the end of a concert performance...

Translate to English English:","output":"Therefore, this is a very sensitive matter, and that is why I believe we should discuss it as soon as possible. In light of the sensitivity of this particular issue, expediting the discussion and addressing the concerns associated with the topic is crucial. Given that the subject may involve emotional, personal, or even confidential aspects, it is essential to approach it with tact, empathy, and discretion. Engaging in an open and constructive dialogue will allow all parties involved to express their thoughts, feelings, and viewpoints, ultimately fostering better understanding and resolution. Timing plays a critical role when addressing sensitive issues. It is vital to choose the right moment to initiate the conversation, preferably when all individuals concerned are calm, relaxed, and receptive. Avoiding distractions and providing a safe, comfortable environment would greatly benefit the discussion and ensure fruitful outcomes. Moreover, adopting active listening techniques during the conversation and demonstrating genuinely concern for others' feelings and opinions will contribute to a more positive atmosphere. This approach will enable everyone to voice their perspectives without feeling judged or dismissed and will significantly improve the chances of reaching a harmonious conclusion. In this context, it is also crucial to be mindful of non-verbal communication, such as eye contact, facial expressions, and gestures. These cues may convey messages and emotions that are not explicitly stated but can greatly influence the overall ambiance and outcome of the dialogue. Practicing empathy and putting oneself in another's shoes is another critical aspect of addressing sensitive matters. Understanding and validating someone else's feelings or experiences can help build trust and pave the way for a more open and honest exchange of ideas. Lastly, when it comes to highly sensitive topics, it might be beneficial to involve a neutral third party, such as a mediator, counselor, or therapist, in the conversation. These professionals possess the skills and experience to ensure a balanced and productive discussion, guiding all participants through potential difficulties and fostering mutual respect and understanding. In summary, discussing sensitive matters requires careful planning, attentive listening, and empathy. By creating an environment conducive to open and honest communication, one can ensure a fruitful dialogue that leads to better mutual understanding and resolution of the issue at hand."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms.

Today, they seem to have tired of their plaything. Johnston's first mistake was personally snubbing Richard Johnson at the Fleshbot awards on Wednesday at the Box. Today's Page Six item has a distinct whiff of revenge about it. The Post reports that Johnston and Tank Jones tried to get nightclub M2 to pay them 3000 to show up that night. When that didn't work they asked for 1800. And were finally offered a round of soft drinks. The Daily News has a very sarcastic tone today too. A Gatecrasher piece takes a line Johnston told them at the Box - that he'd like to see the memoir he's working on made into a movie - and responds thusly: Johnston, it seems, is undeterred by the fact that he has yet to finish writing the tell-all tome, decide on a title or even find a publisher. The rest of the item is no less passive-aggresive. At least he can always go back to the Palin household, according to Sarah in this clip from her interview with Oprah: Watch CBS News Videos Online ||||| At this very moment, Levi Johnston is undressing for a Playgirl photo shoot. But last night he was at The Box accepting an award from Fleshbot while a scrum of reporters poked and probed the Wasilla boy for a story. He did a remarkable job of not saying much. At 8:15 the party had barely begun at the downtown hotspot, known for its strict velvet rope and the racy performances on its main stage, the gregarious Tank Jones and his brother Marvin (in the role as Levi's trainer) were some of the first people to arrive. They installed the one-time human campaign prop at a table in the corner of the balcony so that several PR people could start the parade of press. The rest of the venue was practically empty, but everyone was clustered around Levi. As the Observer's John Koblin interviewed Playgirl's spokesman Daniel Nardicio about the future of the magazine, the Levi interviews started. Everyone made way for a camera crew from Entertainment Tonight, which has exclusive access to Levi for all the behind-the-scenes action for the photo shoot that is taking place right now (if everything goes according to schedule). We didn't get close enough to hear what they asked during their ten minutes with Levi. As they clear out, there were more print interviews to do. Michael Musto came by to say hi, but he interviewed Levi at his hotel earlier. I asked Musto if he was a good interview. He said yes, but agrees that it's hard to get him to say much. Jo Piazza from CNN came in and taped a few second with the Johnston crew. Before she started her interveiew, Tank said he's not answering questions about Sarah Palin or about suing for custody of Tripp, Levi's son with Palin's daughter Bristol. Then he flirted with her a little bit as she squeezed in next to Levi to ask her questions. Most of the questions were the same all night: How is this different from Alaska? What is he going to show? Is he ready for the shoot? Does he know that he's a gay icon? Will he do more porn? What does the future hold? Levi always answers with the fewest words possible. This may make him appear a bit dim, but it seems a smart move for a guy who's standing around a bunch of people paid to turn any utterance he makes into \\"news.\\" With the reporters gone, he quietly joked with Tank and Marvin. When Piazza was done, he joked a bit with Nardicio, teaching him how to tuck a dollop of chew under his lip. \\"Don't you throw up on this table!\\" Tank chided. A PR person came by and said there were more interviews to be done. \\"I know. This isn't my first rodeo,\\" Levi said. Another reporter sat down, this one from People. They knew to send a pretty girl. When she left, the PR man told Tank that Page Six boss Richard Johnson wanted an introduction. Tank responded, \\"We're not talking to them. No pictures, nothing.\\" The PR man conveyed the message to Johnson. \\"He just wants to say hi,\\" Mr. PR pleaded with Tank. But Tank had made up his mind: No Levi for Johnson. \\"That's fine,\\" said the Page Six editor before heading back downstairs. After he left, Tank complained about a Page Six item accusing Levi having a small dick and thus afraid to do any full-frontal shots: \\"That's not true!\\" There was a break in the action and a PR girl brought by the trophy Levi will receive later in the evening: an 11-inch dildo made of silver. Everyone at the table laughed nervously and made jokes about how Levi isn't going to accept a dildo. Levi returned his trophy to the nice lady and said, \\"I can't believe I just won a giant silver dildo.\\" He and Tank conferred and decide there can't be any pictures taken of him holding it, so they plan to have Nardicio take the stage with him and hold the award. Then the photographers arrived. In groups of two, they came by the corner, their flashbulbs blinding in the dark club. Levi knew to look directly into the camera and then occasionally look away to blink. He didn't look like he was having any fun. When all that was over, he passed some time ogling the scantily-clad go-go dancers down below. Tank said, \\"Those are all real women right? I don't want to look if they're not real women.\\" Another laugh. Nardicio tells them that they're all real women. I pointed out that there were definitely some drag queens in the mix. \\"That's OK, I didn't want those ones anyway,\\" Levi responded. He told me that he hadn't had any time to go out and party while in New York City. \\"It's been all work. I'm all about business,\\" he says. \\"But I like New York more each time I come here.\\" What does he think about this event? \\"It's different,\\" is all he'll say. As the show starts, Gawker alum Joshua David Stein showed up asking questions for New York magazine. It was getting loud, the house was full. Tank informed him they'd do an interview later. Levi leaned over the balcony to watching the award ceremony on stage and performances by the likes of boy/boy/girl aerialist trio Mantryx. When the intermission came, the crew decided to go outside for some air. Out on the sidewalk, it is a whole different scene. Dressed in identical tuxedos like they all went shopping at the same men's store earlier that evening, they moved as a unit. Flanked by two enormous black men, Levi wasn't easy to approach. That didn't stop the reporters. Kelefa Sanneh from the New Yorker came up received a stern lecture from Tank about not asking about Palin or custody. Sanneh started his round of questioning but was cut off by the arrival of two 20-something guys who made up TMZ's camera crew. They'd been tailing Levi and his crew ever since they arrived in New York and seemed almost like old friends. Sanneh backed off, to avoid getting captured by their camera. TMZ doesn't care about restrictions and they began asking about custody and Palin. Tank demurred. \\"Come on, you know better than that.\\" While Tank was distracted by dealing with the TMZ mess, Jacob Bernstein from The Daily Beast snuck up and peppered Levi with questions and scribbled furiously in his notebook. A male-female duo from Hollywood Life sidled up and began asking their own questions and with a Flip camera. After the questions, the Hollywood Life crew each took their picture with Levi. With Levi alone again, Sanneh came back for a second attempt at an interview. This time, though, he talked more to Tank that Levi. It's easy to go that direction, since Tank is a gregarious quote machine while Levi answers everything with about three words. Levi was scheduled to accept his award as soon as the ceremony restarted after the intermission. The PR girl shadowing him told him and Nardicio to go hang out at Nick Denton's table so they'd be right next to the stage. but there isn't any room at the Gawker Media overlord's table. Levi headed instead for socialite Tinsley Mortimer's table where photographers eagerly snapped the unlikely pairing. Joshua David Stein returned for his promised interview, but Levi said he needs clear it with Tank. Stein rebutted that Tank had already cleared it, but Levi — who either didn't remember, didn't care, or simply wanted to protect himself — turned him down again, this time a little more firmly. Marvin stepped in and said they'd talk to Tank and do the interview later. Levi asked who he needs to thank in his speech which he obviously hasn't thought about until then. Nardicio told him to thank Fleshbot and The Box. Levi added that he should also say something about the upcoming issue of Playgirl and to tell people to buy it. He is all business. When his award was announced he and Nardicio went on stage where Levi successfully avoided being photographed with a big silver dildo. His speech was exactly what he planned: He thanked Fleshbot and The Box and then told everyone to buy his issue of Playgirl. After leaving the stage, he meets up with Tank and Marvin and they head out the door. He has to get up early to work out before his big shoot. Our colleague Irin over at Jezebel got her questions answered about the type of ladies Levi likes and JDS eventually got his interview, making poor Richard Johnson the only person denied the chance to exchange banalities with the man of the hour. Levi, like he said, was all about business, and last night his business was spectacle. Top three photos by Hee Jin Kang, bottom by GuestofaGuest ||||| Levi Johnston could use smarter management. The 19-year-old impregnator of Bristol Palin is being handled by Tank Jones, a refrigerator-size fellow who doubles as his bodyguard. But Tank has made some dubious decisions. Not only is Levi posing for Playgirl, but he also was honored Wednesday night at The Box along with some porn stars and fashion designer Patricia Field. As least he was smart enough not to be photographed handling his Fleshbot Award, a chrome phallus presented to the other honorees of Nick Denton‘s porn-loving Web site. Sources also say that Tank offered to bring Levi to the club M2 for a fee of 3,000. “When M2 turned it down, they came back with a fire-sale price of 1,800,” said an insider. “They again declined and offered him a table with a round of soft drinks.” We’d ask Johnston, but Jones wouldn’t let the Alaskan talk to Page Six at The Box. PHOTOS: LEVI JOHNSTON Incognito Post reporter Justin Rocket Silverman, however, managed to score an on-camera interview with Johnston. Check it out below. ||||| Levi Johnston: The Movie? Bristol Palin baby daddy has big screen hopes Watts/News, Sussman/Getty Levi Johnston has hopes that a big screen adaptation of his upcoming memoir would have him starring as himself. Who would you have play Bristol Palin? What could be more skeevy than looking at Levi Johnston naked in Playgirl? How about watching him romp around naked on the big screen. Bristol Palin’s baby daddy says he sees his upcoming memoir becoming a movie. “I would play myself,” the chatty Alaskan told us, without skipping a beat, on Wednesday night. Johnston, it seems, is undeterred by the fact that he has yet to finish writing the tell-all tome, decide on a title or even find a publisher. “Levi: The Movie” (the title is ours) is just one of the “really big projects” (pun most certainly intended) the 19-year-old boasts he has coming up during the next few weeks. Also on his agenda? Levi says “more photo shoots,” which we can only hope are not in the buff, and, as usual, getting under Sarah Palin’s skin. But that’s not all: Johnston believes he’ll also have his hands full fending off his (miraculously) growing Rolodex of female admirers. “Right now I’m really not looking for a girlfriend,” he insists, acknowledging that his popularity has skyrocketed in the last few months. But when “Play”-boy Johnston does settle down, the lady in question is going to have to measure up to his pretty rigid set of standards. “When the time comes, obviously I want someone smart.” Obviously. “I don’t want no ditsy girl.” Of course not. “I don’t need a high-class woman.” No, Levi, you certainly don’t.

Sheriff. Answer:","output":"Title: “A Town Too Busy” Genre: Comedy-Drama Plot Summary: In the bustling town of Everbusy, people live their lives at an unbelievably fast pace. They're so engrossed in their careers, ambitions, and personal goals that no one has the time or inclination to take up the critical role of a sheriff. As a result, chaos, crime, and confusion is on the rise – but the townspeople are too preoccupied to notice. That is until an unsuspecting newcomer rolls into town and realizes that something has got to change. Act 1: We start with stunning panoramic shots of Everbusy - high-speed traffic, busy sidewalks, and people juggling multiple electronic devices while running from one task to the next. A voice-over narrator explains how life has come to be this way in Everbusy – the town became a tech and business hub, attracting ambitious and career-driven people from far and wide. Enter Jake Rockwell, a newcomer who has just moved to Everbusy, seeking a change in life after losing his job as a cop in another city. He is excited but slowly realizes that life in Everbusy has a pace that he's not used to. As Jake tries to acclimate to his new home, he can't help but notice the lack of law enforcement in the area. Troubled teens, petty thefts, and disputes between neighbors become more and more common. Due to their busy lives, the townspeople simply don't have the time to acknowledge these issues, let alone address them. Act 2: Jake spends time investigating the reason behind the absence of a sheriff in Everbusy. He discovers that the town once had a sheriff, but he was overworked and eventually gave up the position because no one in the town had time to support him or step up as a deputy. Jake becomes increasingly troubled by the town's crime and disorder, realizing that things may only get worse if left unchecked. He decides to take matters into his own hands and searches for the former sheriff, hoping to learn more about the position. Meanwhile, the local crime boss, Cliff Banks, sees an opportunity to expand his illicit activities in the absence of a sheriff. He establishes a network of petty crooks to steal and smuggle valuable electronics and information from Everbusy's thriving tech scene. Jake meets the former sheriff, Jane Reynolds, who shares her experience and the challenges of being a sheriff in Everbusy. She warns Jake that he'll need to have an iron will to make a change in the town, as everyone is too wrapped up in their own lives to care about law enforcement. Act 3: Undeterred, Jake takes up the mantle of sheriff and attempts to recruit deputies, but unsurprisingly, no one has the time or interest to join him. Feeling increasingly alone but determined, Jake starts a one-man vigilante campaign to counteract the criminal activities of Banks and his gang. Meanwhile, the town becomes more chaotic, with Banks and his gang going uncontested in their quest for more power and wealth. Jake starts to acknowledge that he can't put things right on his own. Desperate, Jake enlists the help of Jane Reynolds and a group of ragtag retirees in the town who have time on their hands. Together, they plan an elaborate sting operation to expose Banks and his criminal activities to the people of Everbusy, forcing them to face the consequences of their negligence towards law enforcement. The climax of the movie is the showdown between Jake, his team, and Banks. As Everbusy's residents gradually realize the importance of community involvement in law enforcement, they stop amidst their constant hustle and start joining forces with Jake. In the end, the townspeople defeat and arrest Banks and his gang. Realizing that life in Everbusy needs balance, people step up and volunteer to become deputies, supporting Jake as the sheriff. Conclusion: \\"A Town Too Busy\\" is a comedic-drama that illustrates the importance of community involvement, balance in life, and the value of teamwork. In the face of chaos, Jake manages not only to take hold of the responsibility of sheriff in a relentlessly active town but also teaches Everbusy's citizens that striking a balance and active participation are key to curbing crime and disorder."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, answer 'Yes' if the frequency of the given word in the two sentences is equal, else answer 'No'.

The region occupied by the abdomen is termed the abdominal cavity. In arthropods it is the posterior tagma of the body; it follows the thorax or cephalothorax. The abdomen stretches from the thorax at the thoracic diaphragm to the pelvis at the pelvic brim. The pelvic brim stretches from the lumbosacral joint (the intervertebral disc between L5 and S1) to the pubic symphysis and is the edge of the pelvic inlet. The space above this inlet and under the thoracic diaphragm is termed the abdominal cavity. The boundary of the abdominal cavity is the abdominal wall in the front and the peritoneal surface at the rear. - Japyx is a genus of diplurans belonging to the family Japygidae . These eyeless , predatory hexapods largely shun direct sunlight , remaining under stones and among detritus , where they use pincer - like cerci to catch their tiny prey . - Earwigs make up the insect order Dermaptera and are found on all continents except Antarctica. With about 2,000 species in 12 families, they are one of the smaller insect orders. Earwigs have characteristic cerci, a pair of forceps-like pincers on their abdomen, and membranous wings folded underneath short forewings, hence the scientific order name, \\"skin wings\\". Some groups are tiny parasites on mammals and lack the typical pincers. Earwigs rarely use their flying ability. - The japygids (family Japygidae) are a taxon of hexapods, of the order Diplura. In this family, the paired cerci at the end of their abdomens are pincer-like (superficially similar to the unrelated earwigs) and are used to catch their tiny prey. Seventy genera are recognised, divided among seven subfamilies. - The order Diplura is one of the four groups of hexapods, alongside insects, springtails and Protura. They are sometimes called \\"two-pronged bristletails\\". Around 800 species have been described, of which around 70 occur in North America, 12 in Great Britain and two in Australia.

On August 25, Voroshilov told them \\"[i]n view of the changed political situation, no useful purpose can be served in continuing the conversation.\\" That day, Hitler told the British ambassador to Berlin that the pact with the Soviets prevented Germany from facing a two front war, changing the strategic situation from that in World War I, and that Britain should accept his demands regarding Poland. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What was the response of Kliment Voroshilov in regards to further conversations without Britain and France?","output":"There are no historical records available that specifically document Kliment Voroshilov's response regarding further conversations without Britain and France after the signing of the Nazi-Soviet Pact (also known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact). However, one could infer Voroshilov’s stance by examining the broader context of the situation and analyzing the geopolitical implications of the Nazi-Soviet Pact. As the Soviet military negotiator in the talks with the French and British military negotiation delegation, Voroshilov represented the interests of the Soviet Union. After the signing of the Nazi-Soviet Pact on August 23, 1939, the strategic landscape in Europe shifted drastically. The Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, previously sworn enemies, now found themselves in a non-aggression pact that divided Eastern European territories into respective spheres of interest. On August 25, 1939, Voroshilov's statement to the French and British military negotiation delegation, as you mentioned in the context provided, indicated that the Soviet Union saw little benefit in continuing the conversation with them \\"[i]n view of the changed political situation.\\" This suggests that the Soviet Union's priorities were now aligned with the terms of the Nazi-Soviet Pact, and engaging in further strategic conversations with Britain and France would hold no benefits for the Soviets. Although we do not have direct quotes or records of Voroshilov's specific response to the idea of further conversations without Britain and France, it can be inferred from the historical context and his role as a Soviet military representative that Voroshilov, and by extension the Soviet Union, saw no value in pursuing any additional negotiations or alliances with Britain and France. The Soviets were now focused on securing their own interests in Eastern Europe and maintaining a non-aggression stance with Nazi Germany, as outlined in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact."},{"instruction":"AP - Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle hugged President Bush from one end of South Dakota to the other this summer.

Erin's grandfather had served in the army during World War II, and Elena's father was a retired Marine. They both understood the importance of honoring and remembering those who had sacrificed their lives for the freedom and safety of their country. As they walked through the vast, hallowed grounds of Arlington National Cemetery, they were struck by the sheer magnitude of the number of small white tombstones that stretched for miles, each intricately adorned with the symbols, names, and details of the fallen soldiers. It was a sight that evoked a strong feeling of reverence and respect, combined with a somber reminder of the great cost of war. Continuing further into the cemetery, they stumbled upon the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, a monument dedicated to the unidentified and unaccounted-for service members throughout the years. They watched in awe as the precisely coordinated Changing of the Guard ceremony took place, led by the stoic members of the elite 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment, known as The Old Guard. Erin and Elena couldn't help but feel emotionally stirred by the grace and solemnity of the ritual, which was a powerful symbol of the undying commitment to honor those who had given their lives in service. As they ventured deeper into the memorial park, they came across the Arlington House, the former home of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. The historic mansion now stood as a museum and a testament to the complexities of American war history, housing artifacts, and exhibits detailing the lives of the people who once occupied its rooms. Erin and Elena spent hours exploring the house, soaking in the wealth of information, and contemplating the many layers of history and sacrifice that surrounded them. After leaving Arlington House, they wandered towards the Women in Military Service for America Memorial. This extraordinary exhibit honored the role of women in the armed forces, dating back to the American Revolution. As they browsed the countless displays and tributes to groundbreaking female military leaders, they were reminded of the strength and courage that women have displayed throughout the years, often in the face of extraordinary adversity. As the sun began to set over the Arlington National Cemetery, Erin and Elena decided to pay their respects to the victims of the 9/11 attack on the Pentagon. At the memorial site, they were greeted by 184 illuminated benches, each bearing the name of a person lost, suspended gracefully over tranquil pools of water. In the stillness of the evening air, they shared a moment of silence, letting the reality of the tragedy and the sacrifices made on that day wash over them. With heavy hearts and an immense sense of gratitude, Erin and Elena left the Arlington Veterans Memorial that day, their lives forever touched by the stories and spirit of the brave men and women they had come to honor. They resolved to make their trip to the memorial an annual tradition, not only to pay their respects to those who had fallen but to remind themselves of the power and resilience of the human spirit, and the sacrifices made by countless individuals in their pursuit of a better world."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"('We're going to steal the Internet's thunder!\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"We're going to steal the show from the Internet!\\" true?","output":"To answer this question, let's break down the task step-by-step to understand the given premise and evaluate the truth of the hypothesis.

Via Steve Benen, PolitiFact is hopping mad at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee for its new ad calling out Republicans for voting to end Medicare, giving it the \\"dreaded\\" pants-on-fire designation. Specifically, PolitiFact says it's unfair to accuse Republicans of ending Medicare because their vote was merely an expression of a policy preference: The Republicans voted on a budget resolution that states policy preferences, but the vote did not actually change Medicare, much less end it. Uh, okay. Except the ad didn't accuse Republicans of actually accomplishing their goal of ending Medicare. It accused them of \\"voting to end Medicare.\\" In other words, it accused them of stating a policy preference. In addition, PolitiFact is ticked off that the ad claims the Republican plan would require seniors to pay 12,500 for health care coverage. That number is based on statistics compiled by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The ad doesn’t mention, though, that the number includes money that would go to Medicare in any case. The CBO estimates beneficiaries would contribute about 6,150 in premiums in 2022 if the program isn’t changed at all. So the extra money seniors need to pay under the Republican proposal is more like 6,350. So...PolitiFact agrees that the CBO estimated seniors would pay 12,500 under the GOP plan, as the ad asserted. They just think the ad should have gone the extra mile and explained that the report estimates seniors would only be paying 6,350 more than they would have otherwise. But the ad didn't say seniors would have to pay 12,500 more. It said they would have to pay 12,500 total, which is completely accurate. And finally, PolitiFact thinks it's unfair to describe the GOP proposal as being designed to \\"end Medicare.\\" But quoting from their own analysis: The Republican proposal will end the aspect of Medicare that directly covers specific services, such as hospital coverage. ... Democrats, including Obama, have said the plan would end Medicare \\"as we know it,\\" a critical qualifier. But the 30-second ad from the DCCC makes a sweeping claim without that important qualifier . I'm tempted to just leave it there, with no further explanation, but I can't resist. PolitiFact appears to be resting its entire case on a severe case of parsing and the fact that the GOP proposal wouldn't change Medicare's name. Still, even PolitiFact acknowledges that the GOP plan would fundamentally change what Medicare does, replacing it with subsidized private insurance administered by the Office of Personnel Management, a completely different agency than currently runs Medicare. According to their logic, if the FBI were replaced with a voucher program wherein citizens would receive subsidies for hiring private investigators to look into criminal activity, but the agency running the voucher program were still called the FBI, it would be unfair to say that the FBI had been ended. I guess it's their right to make that argument, but it's transparently absurd. To recap PolitiFact's case: Ending the essential services of Medicare and replacing them with subsidies administered by an entirely different agency is not the same as ending Medicare. Yes, it's true that CBO said the GOP plan would mean seniors would pay 12,500 in health care costs, but only 6,350 of that was incremental, and even though Democrats correctly stated the CBO's estimate, and even though seniors would have to pay the full amount of that estimate, they should have only focused on the incremental cost. It would be unfair to say the GOP actually ended Medicare because they merely voted to end it. Of course, that's what the ad says. All I can say to that is, I hope the GOP defends itself using PolitiFact's line of argument. It would be an electoral bonanza for Democrats. ||||| By Steve Benen The fact-checking website PolitiFact has announced its “Lie of the Year” for 2011. It made a poor, credibility-killing choice. Republicans muscled a budget through the House of Representatives in April that they said would take an important step toward reducing the federal deficit. Introduced by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the plan kept Medicare intact for people 55 or older, but dramatically changed the program for everyone else by privatizing it and providing government subsidies. Democrats pounced. Just four days after the party-line vote, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee released a Web ad that said seniors will have to pay 12,500 more for health care “because Republicans voted to end Medicare.” […] PolitiFact debunked the Medicare charge in nine separate fact-checks rated False or Pants on Fire, most often in attacks leveled against Republican House members. Now, PolitiFact has chosen the Democrats’ claim as the 2011 Lie of the Year. This is simply indefensible. Claims that are factually true shouldn’t be eligible for a Lie of the Year designation. It’s unnerving that we have to explain this again, but since PolitiFact appears to be struggling with the relevant details, let’s set the record straight. Medicare is a single-payer health care system offering guaranteed benefits to seniors. The House Republican budget plan intended to privatize the existing system and replace it with something very different — a voucher scheme. It would still be called “Medicare,” but it wouldn’t be Medicare. It seems foolish to have to parse the meaning of the word “end,” but if there’s a program, and it’s replaced with a different program, proponents brought an end to the original program. That’s what the verb means. I’ve been trying to think of the best analogy for this. How about this one: imagine someone owns a Ferrari. It’s expensive and drives beautifully, and the owner desperately wants to keep his car intact. Now imagine I took the car away, removed the metallic badge off the trunk that says “Ferrari,” I stuck it on a golf cart, and I handed the owner the keys. “Where’s my Ferrari?” the owner would ask. “It’s right here,” I’d respond. “This has four wheels, a steering wheel, and pedals, and it says ‘Ferrari’ right there on the back.” By PolitiFact’s reasoning, I haven’t actually replaced the car — and if you disagree, you’re a pants-on-fire liar. Indeed, reading through PolitiFact’s defense of its dubious honor, the explanation is effectively a semantics argument — its Lie of the Year, the editors argue, didn’t include the caveats and context that would make it more accurate. But let’s not forget, there were actual, demonstrable, unambiguous lies among the finalists for Lie of the Year. PolitiFact overlooked all of them. When an outlet puts “fact” in its name, the standards for accuracy are especially high. When it’s selecting a Lie of the Year, standards dictate that the falsehood should be overwhelmingly obvious and offensive. Today, PolitiFact, which relies exclusively on its credibility to affect the political discourse, ought to be ashamed of itself. Update: I’ve seen some suggestions that Paul Ryan influenced the process by stuffing the ballot box. Here’s some additional analysis on this point. Second Update: I didn’t realize this until later, but my friend John Cole used a similar car analogy two weeks ago. I guess great minds do think alike. ||||| Here’s a long, sad story about how Democrats’ basically true claim that House Republicans voted to end Medicare ended up “winning” PolitiFact’s Lie of the Year award — a development that will help the right and the GOP create their own reality as the future of the social safety net becomes a defining issue of the 2012 campaign. Back in April, House Republicans passed a budget that included a plan to phase out Medicare over several years and build in its place a subsidized, private insurance marketplace for seniors. Democrats called this a vote to “end Medicare.” You can quibble. It wasn’t a vote to end Medicare — BLAM! — all at once. But under the GOP plan, within a couple decades, the current health retirement program for old people would be gone and in its place would be an entirely different one. It would just, by political design, have the same name: Medicare. Ignoring policy in favor of process, and with an eye toward political balance, PolitiFact rated this basically true Democratic claim “Pants on Fire.” Liberals, economists, health policy experts, and yours truly objected strongly to PolitiFact’s conclusion. But instead of rethinking their conclusion, the PolitiFact turned the opprobrium into a badge of honor: The claim itself became a candidate for PolitiFact’s “Lie of the Year” contest; Paul Ryan — the House GOP budget chairman who authored the plan — engaged in a modest ballot stuffing campaign; and the Democrats’ true “lie” came in third place, just behind the GOP claim that the stimulus created zero jobs, and Sen. Jon Kyl’s claim that abortion services are “well over 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does.” But you can’t be a fact checking organization and leave epistemic questions up to voters. So PolitiFact made a choice. And of those three frontrunners, they selected the only one with any truth behind it. The reaction from Republicans has been muted so far — a sign, perhaps, that they don’t want to reopen this old wound. But back in their districts, when constituents grill them, Republicans will now have a compelling citation. It just happens to be a sham. ||||| Republicans muscled a budget through the House of Representatives in April that they said would take an important step toward reducing the federal deficit. Introduced by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the plan kept Medicare intact for people 55 or older, but dramatically changed the program for everyone else by privatizing it and providing government subsidies. Democrats pounced. Just four days after the party-line vote, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee released a Web ad that said seniors will have to pay 12,500 more for health care \\"because Republicans voted to end Medicare.\\" Rep. Steve Israel of New York, head of the DCCC, appeared on cable news shows and declared that Republicans voted to \\"terminate Medicare.\\" A Web video from the Agenda Project, a liberal group, said the plan would leave the country \\"without Medicare\\" and showed a Ryan look-alike pushing an old woman in a wheelchair off a cliff. And just last month, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi sent a fundraising appeal that said: \\"House Republicans’ vote to end Medicare is a shameful act of betrayal.\\" After two years of being pounded by Republicans with often false charges about the 2010 health care law, the Democrats were turning the tables. PolitiFact debunked the Medicare charge in nine separate fact-checks rated False or Pants on Fire, most often in attacks leveled against Republican House members. Now, PolitiFact has chosen the Democrats’ claim as the 2011 Lie of the Year. It’s the third year in a row that a health care claim has won the dubious honor. In 2009, the winner was the Republicans’ charge that the Democrats’ health care plan included \\"death panels.\\" In 2010, it was that the plan was a \\"government takeover of health care.\\" A complicated and wonky subject with life-or-death consequences, health care is fertile ground for falsehoods. The Democratic attack about \\"ending Medicare\\" was a pervasive line in 2011 that preyed on seniors' worries about whether they could afford health care. Even when explained accurately, the Republicans’ Medicare plan was not particularly popular with the public, nor with some independent health policy analysts. But the plan was distorted and attacked again and again. \\"In terms of creating a national conversation about fiscal reform, the last thing we need is demagoguing attacks against people who have put forward serious policy proposals,\\" said Jason Peuquet, a policy analyst with the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. \\"It’s very worrying.\\" A persistent falsehood With a few small tweaks to their attack lines, Democrats could have been factually correct, said Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. \\"I actually think there is no need to cut out the qualifiers and exaggerate,\\" he said. At times, Democrats and liberal groups were careful to characterize the Republican plan more accurately. Another claim in the ad from the Agenda Project said the plan would \\"privatize\\" Medicare, which received a Mostly True rating from PolitiFact. President Barack Obama was also more precise with his words, saying the Medicare proposal \\"would voucherize the program and you potentially have senior citizens paying 6,000 more.\\" But more often, Democrats and liberals overreached: • They ignored the fact that the Ryan plan would not affect people currently in Medicare -- or even the people 55 to 65 who would join the program in the next 10 years. • They used harsh terms such as \\"end\\" and \\"kill\\" when the program would still exist, although in a privatized system. • They used pictures and video of elderly people who clearly were too old to be affected by the Ryan plan. The DCCC video that aired four days after the vote featured an elderly man who had to take a job as a stripper to pay his medical bills. \\"Both parties use entitlements as political weapons,\\" Ryan said in an interview with PolitiFact. \\"Republicans do it to Democrats; Democrats do it to Republicans. So I knew that this would be a political weapon that the other side would use against us.\\" Liberal bloggers and columnists contend it's accurate to say Republicans voted to end Medicare. Left-leaning websites such as Talking Points Memo, Daily Kos, and The New Republic said PolitiFact's analysis was wrong, as did New York Times columnist Paul Krugman. \\"According to (PolitiFact's) logic, if the FBI were replaced with a voucher program wherein citizens would receive subsidies for hiring private investigators to look into criminal activity, but the agency running the voucher program were still called the FBI, it would be unfair to say that the FBI had been ended,\\" wrote Jed Lewison for Daily Kos. \\"I guess it's their right to make that argument, but it's transparently absurd.\\" In a blog post, the DCCC stood by its claim, saying the ad accurately stated Ryan's plan would \\"abolish\\" Medicare. But PolitiFact was not alone. Other independent fact-checkers also said the claim was false. \\"Medicare would remain an entitlement program, but it would also be more costly to future beneficiaries. It would not end,\\" noted FactCheck.org, a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania. The Washington Post’s Fact Checker concluded that while there’s \\"a worthwhile debate\\" about whether Ryan’s proposal should be adopted, \\"it is not true to claim Republicans are trying to ‘kill’ Medicare.\\" The Democratic attacks struck a chord. Polls showed voters were skeptical of the Ryan plan and want Medicare to remain largely the way it is now. That may be why the plan has virtually no prospects of passing the Senate, which voted to shelve the plan. President Obama has indicated he would veto any changes to Medicare that would privatize the program and substantially shift costs to beneficiaries. How the Ryan plan would work Under the current Medicare system, the government pays the health care bills for Americans over age 65. Under the Ryan plan, future beneficiaries would be given a credit and invited to shop for an approved plan on a Medicare health insurance exchange. It received overwhelming support from Republicans in a House vote on a budget blueprint. Starting in 2022, beneficiaries would receive \\"premium support payments\\" from the government to help pay for the private insurance. People who need more health care would get a little more money, and high earners would get a little less. The plan has some guarantees for coverage, although seniors would have to pay more to get the benefits they receive today, according to an analysis completed earlier this year by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The guarantees: Ryan's plan requires private insurers to accept all applicants and to charge the same rate for people who are the same age. The plans would comply with standards set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which administers the health plans of federal employees. The Medicare eligibility age would rise from 65 to 67, an idea that has received some bipartisan support in the past. The CBO found that it would save the government money. But it does so by asking future Medicare beneficiaries to pay more for the same benefits. Ryan says the plan would offer more choice for Medicare participants and increase competition among private insurers to drive down cost. \\"I’m a big believer in patient-centered choice, where the beneficiary is the prime decision-maker, which drives competition and innovation, and that’s missing from the status quo, to a large degree,\\" he said. It’s not the first time it’s been suggested that Medicare be changed from its current fee-for-service, where the government pays all the bills, to one that uses private insurers. In the past, some Democrats have even favored such proposals, especially if -- unlike the Ryan plan -- the support was linked to medical inflation, or there were an option for traditional Medicare, or there were more explicit protections for consumers. Just last week, Ryan agreed to a new framework with Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. Their proposal uses Ryan’s idea for private insurers and exchanges, but it leaves traditional Medicare as an option. Private insurers already offer Medicare plans under the program Medicare Advantage, though those plans have proven more expensive than traditional Medicare, not less. The partisan split on health care reveals the contradictions of congressional debate. Republicans were staunchly against the insurance exchanges in the federal health care law. But they endorsed them in the Ryan proposal, even as Democrats switched to oppose the plan. \\"Ryan basically proposed the Affordable Care Act for future seniors,\\" said Jonathan Gruber, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who advised both President Obama and Republican Mitt Romney on health care. \\"I don't understand how you can like it for future seniors but not like it for today's needy uninsured. That doesn't make any sense.\\" 'Scaring 85-year-olds' Kathleen Hall Jamieson, an expert on campaign advertising who directs the Annenberg center at the University of Pennsylvania, says Democrats have been using falsehoods and exaggerations about Medicare and Social Security since at least 1952. She calls it the longest-running \\"Democratic deception.\\" It fits with a core theme from Democrats that they will use government to protect seniors and needy people, while Republicans supposedly want to cut those programs, she says. It is a scare tactic that works. \\"If you're reliant on Medicare, a suggestion your benefits are going to be cut in any way is a direct, visceral threat,\\" said Jamieson. Republicans actually used a version of the attack in 2010, claiming Democrats cut 500 billion from Medicare to pay for Obama's health care law; the law actually sought to reduce the growth of future spending with a series of efficiency measures. But historically, attacks about Medicare have come from Democrats. In the 1950s and 1960s, Democrats used images of Social Security cards being torn in half to suggest that Republicans wanted to cut the program. In 1995, Democrats said House Speaker Newt Gingrich's plan to restructure Medicare would force seniors to pay more and would \\"wreck\\" Medicare. President Bill Clinton vetoed the Republicans' Medicare bill, and used the issue to pummel GOP nominee Bob Dole in the 1996 campaign. Gingrich complained at the time that \\"Medicare is the one issue the left believes they can lie about and demagogue.\\" He described the Democrats as \\"totally morally bankrupt\\" and said, \\"They are reduced to scaring 85-year-olds.\\" The scare tactics are effective because seniors worry about being able to pay their medical bills and Medicare is a vital program for them. Also, seniors represent a large, up-for-grabs voting bloc. Jonathan Oberlander, a health policy professor at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, said, \\"If you can scare seniors that something is going to happen to those programs, there is potentially a huge payoff in votes.\\" |||||Summary:","output":"PolitiFact, a fact-checking website, has accused the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) of lying in their recent ad that claims Republicans voted to end Medicare. However, the ad accuses Republicans of \\"voting to end Medicare\\", which PolitiFact itself acknowledges as a policy preference, leading many to argue that there is no lie. Furthermore, PolitiFact also agrees with the ad's assertion that seniors would have to pay 12,500 for health care under the GOP plan but is unhappy that the ad does not mention that the amount includes funds that would go to Medicare regardless. In conclusion, PolitiFact's case seems to rest on semantics rather than substantial inaccuracies, and its claims that the ad is a \\"lie\\" may actually benefit the Democrats since it could lead to an electoral advantage if Republicans attempt to use PolitiFact's argument as their defense."},{"instruction":"Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Can you smell two things at once? This experiment comes from the research of two scientists from Rice University. Denise Chen and Wen Zhou have been experimenting with the science of smell, and have made some very interesting discoveries. To explore that, you will need two things with strong, characteristic smells and, of course, your nose. The idea is to smell a different smell with each nostril . Hold one smell very close to your right nostril, and the other smell very close to your left nostril. Then breathe in and pay close attention to what you smell. What you should find is that one smell will be very strong. After another sniff or two, the first smell will go away, and you will smell the other smell. Keep sniffing, and the first smell will come back. Instead of smelling the two smells evenly mixed, they will work in turns, one after the other. Why? Chen and Zhou found that your sense of smell acts much like your sense of sight. Hold a book in front of your nose, so that your left eye sees things on the left side of the book, and your right eye sees things on the right side of the book. You will find that your sight works in turns, first on the left side of the book and then on the right side. Notice that you can't focus your left eye on one object while focusing your right eye on another object. Your brain jumps back and forth , paying attention to one and then the other. The same thing happens with your nostrils. If they are smelling different smells, your brain pays attention to one and then the other.

EW reported that Dave had to be removed by security following the altercation. Before the cameras even started rolling, a female contestant was caught with a cellphone, which she had reportedly smuggled in order to look up the fellow players online. It is not known whether the woman will be edited out of the show. The 'secret' pregnancy appears to be one of many surprising casting manouvres, which also includes are intensely relgiious pastor who has offered to give baptisms in the lake. At least two couples have already formed as well, according to EW. The pregnant contestant has not yet been named but is due in December. Opening night: The show premieres on Sunday September 7, 2014 at 8pm. Fox is gambling large on the series, investing millions of dollars in the show that challenges the 15 participants to create their own mini societies on the secluded piece of land. 'Utopia' is what the network called its 'boldest' and 'most groundbreaking social experiment.' People from all walks of life were selected from 5,000 applicants to be dropped into the secluded plot of land in California, where they will build their ideal civilization for one year. The 'Utopians' start with no more than 10,000 and have to decide how to use it to develop their new economy and develop more of the land. Fifteen participants will remain in isolation for a year while they build a new civilization for Fox's new reality behemoth, 'Utopia' Aside from a barn with a couple of cows and some chickens, participants have to build new structures and find their own food. The show will air on Tuesday and some Fridays, and is expected to be Fox's big programming bet this fall. The roster also includes a bellydancer, a naturalist, a Manhattan lawyer, a Libertarian and a veterinarian technician. 'This is the most pure form of reality that I have ever produced in my career,' boasts executive producer John de Mol, the man behind 'Big Brother. 'Utopia,' which debuts on Sept. 7 with a three-night premiere, comes with 200 crew members, hundreds of cameras and round-the-clock video streaming. Fox has scheduled the show for Tuesdays and some Fridays, counting on it to replace 'X Factor' and 'American Idol.' The network will also stream the show online 24/7. The 15 participants on 'Utopia' come from all walks of life, from a belly dancer to a veterinarian technician, a chili farmer and a pregnant woman. But so far, the series has seen plenty of snags. Insiders say the network stands to spend 50 million on just 20 episodes — and is also struggling internally with a group of new producers involved in the show, TheWrap reported. 'The bill has arrived and it is on the very high end of staggering,' one network executive told the news outlet. Executive producer Conrad Green told Variety the cost for the set was 'not insignificant,' though he wouldn't give any more details. And this is a time of internal changes at Fox. The man behind the project, ex-chairman Kevin Reilly, moved on in June — leaving a group of incoming executives to inherit the schedule he created, Variety reported. It is also the first big project for Simon Andreae, in charge of alternative, who joined the network in October. The dutch version of the show premiered in January and has thus far been a success, industry insiders say.

His competition comes from Taylor Swift, whose pop smash 1989 is finally nominated, a year after its release. It came out too late to be eligible for last year's awards, a fate which has befallen Adele's 25 this time around. Swift ties with R&B star The Weeknd for second place, with seven nominations apiece, while Ed Sheeran and James Bay represent the UK. Sheeran is up for two of the major prizes - song of the year and record of the year - for his emotive ballad Thinking Out Loud. The former award goes to the writers (in this case Sheeran and Amy Wadge), while the record of the year category takes into account the performance and production of a hit song. Other nominees for song of the year include The Weeknd's breakthrough hit Can't Feel My Face and Mark Ronson's global smash Uptown Funk.

He is also shortlisted twice for best rap song, including Kanye West's All Day, which he co-wrote - along with 18 other credited performers, which could make an interesting moment on stage if West wins.

Brian Blackman, 73, was suffering from Parkinson’s disease and died in January 2011. A friend said it had a huge impact on his son, who tragically had been caught in traffic and unable make it to his father’s bedside to be with him as he died. It was against this emotional backdrop of regret and grief that the commando deployed to Afghanistan. Those close to him believe this played a part in the ‘moment of madness’ that ended in the execution of a Taliban fighter – and murder conviction more than two years later. Scroll down for video. Emotional: Alexander Blackman with his wheelchair-bound father Brian who died shortly before his tour of duty. Footage: The incident in which Blackman killed a Taliban militant was caught on camera by another Marine. Ironically, Blackman was a model soldier, a war hero with an exceptional record who had served in a number of conflicts. He proved his courage on six gruelling tours of duty in Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan. And in 2001 he was part of the hunt for Bin Laden. He was among Marines flown in to help Special Forces as they fought Al Qaeda gunmen in Bora Bora. Blackman’s closest brush with death came on his tour to Iraq, when he miraculously survived being hit by a grenade during the assault on Basra. Identified: Sergeant Alexander Blackman has been revealed as the Royal Marine who was last month convicted a murdering an Afghan insurgent. Fighting had been intense, with an. officer describing the area as a scene from Dante’s Inferno. While. leading the assault on Basra, Iraq’s second city in a military vehicle,. his rucksack containing ammunition, water and rations was hit by the. warhead of a rocket propelled grenade in an ambush on his vehicle. Marines dived for cover as bullets and RPGs raining down on them, and one rocket smashed into his kit bag diverting it just past his head while bullets burst around them. After the attack, his fellow commandos could not believe that Blackman had not been killed. Despite the difficult campaign – which saw Marines locked in some of the fiercest fighting experienced by British forces – his combat report is said to have been ‘exemplary’ and he was recommended for promotion. His family in Brighton – his father, a former porter and lorry driver, his mother Frances, 74, a former hairdresser, brother and two sisters knew his love of the Marines and the lifestyle they offered. Blackman, a keen cyclist, runner and golfer, excelled while studying sports and physical education at Lewes Tertiary College in East Sussex. He had ambitions of representing Great Britain at canoeing until, aged 17, he was knocked down by a car while cycling. Desperate to challenge himself, he enlisted in the Royal Marines in 1998, passing the arduous tests with flying colours. Tours of Northern Ireland were followed by training in the US and Oman, and in November 2007 he deployed to southern Afghanistan. After returning from that tour he married Claire Warner, 38, an assistant director of operations with the National Trust in Somerset and Gloucestershire, and they settled in Taunton. Incident: The footage filmed by Marine B's helmet camera formed part of the court martial hearing. Revealed: Footage of the incident with Blackman's face uncensored has just been released for the first time. Highly regarded by senior officers,. Blackman had joined 42 Commando and J [Juliet] Company, known for its. discipline, fortitude and bravery – and members were tested to the full. during their six-month spring tour in spring 2011. He had previously seen some action in Afghanistan during the quieter winter months. But this deployment – later named the ‘Tour from hell’ by his colleagues – them attacked almost daily. Despite this hostility, the imposing 6ft 3in Blackman was credited with fostering ‘hearts and minds’ of the local population and helping oversee projects such as the building of a school. But the gruelling impact of losing friends and colleagues was to take its toll. During the proceedings leading up to his conviction for murder, Blackman said around 20 of his friends had been killed or maimed during the tour, including a popular young officer and a marine who had previously won a Military Cross for courage under fire. Film: The Marine could be heard quoting Shakespeare as he shot the Taliban prisoner. Trauma: Friends of Blackman have blamed the incident on the horrors he experienced while on duty. He said other comrades had suffered ‘life-changing’ injuries and described the effect the deaths had on commandos after the body parts of friends were hung in trees by insurgents. ‘It’s not a nice thing for the lads,’ he said. ‘Close friends they have lived with have been killed and parts of their bodies are displayed as a kind of trophy for the world to see.’ The Marines returned home as heroes, with Blackman earmarked for promotion to Colour Sergeant. It would have remained that way had a commando not been arrested by civilian police more than a year later and chilling head camera footage of the Helmand execution discovered on his laptop.

Congress should address this problem. We have considered various alternatives: A joint committee on the old model of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy is one. A single committee in each house of Congress, combining authorizing and appropriating authorities, is another. The new committee or committees should conduct continuing studies of the activities of the intelligence agencies and report problems relating to the development and use of intelligence to all members of the House and Senate. We have already recommended that the total level of funding for intelligence be made public, and that the national intelligence program be appropriated to the National Intelligence Director, not to the secretary of defense. We also recommend that the intelligence committee should have a subcommittee specifically dedicated to oversight, freed from the consuming responsibility of working on the budget. The resolution creating the new intelligence committee structure should grant subpoena authority to the committee or committees. The majority party's representation on this committee should never exceed the minority's representation by more than one. Four of the members appointed to this committee or committees should be a member who also serves on each of the following additional committees: Armed Services, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, and the Defense Appropriations subcommittee. In this way the other major congressional interests can be brought together in the new committee's work. Members should serve indefinitely on the intelligence committees, without set terms, thereby letting them accumulate expertise. The committees should be smaller-perhaps seven or nine members in each house-so that each member feels a greater sense of responsibility, and accountability, for the quality of the committee's work. The leaders of the Department of Homeland Security now appear before 88 committees and subcommittees of Congress. One expert witness (not a member of the administration) told us that this is perhaps the single largest obstacle impeding the department's successful development. The one attempt to consolidate such committee authority, the House Select Committee on Homeland Security, may be eliminated. The Senate does not have even this.

As we hobble toward economic recovery, the work environment remains anxious and uncertain. Employees may be grateful for their paychecks, but numerous studies reveal what most leaders already know anecdotally: that a great many workers are disengaged and even hate their jobs. I call them the walking dead, those employees who show up for work with their bodies but leave their brains, and their souls, at home. In the old days leaders typically rallied the troops by painting a picture of a glorious, prosperous future, garlanded with bonuses, perks and advancement. How do you get people excited about their jobs today when you're utterly uncertain about tomorrow? It can be done, and it's actually not that complicated. We all have three basic human needs: We need to be connected to other people, we need to know that our work matters, and we need leaders who respond to those first two needs when times are tough. Fortunately, meeting these three intrinsic needs needn't cost your organization a dime. And it's something you can do every single day, no matter how uncertain the environment. Here's how anyone can tap into the big three human needs to help their organization stay productive, engaged and, dare I say it, happy during times of angst and uncertainty: 1. Connection: Get emotional. Whenever I start to talk about emotions in the workplace, executives get uneasy. But have you ever noticed that you never hear managers saying, \\"Please don't get so excited\\" or \\"Please quit being so happy\\"? The reality is that emotions are at the center of everything we do. The leadership challenge isn't to avoid them. It's to ignite the positive ones. The secret of getting people more engaged in their work is for their leaders to become more engaged with them. That means being willing to show up emotionally as well as intellectually. What would happen if you walked in one day, looked one of your employees in the eye and told him or her, \\"I'm so grateful you're on our team, and it's not just about the work; it's also about how much you as a person add to this place. I love having you here\\"? It sounds hokey, but every time I suggest this in a workshop or presentation, people's eyes fill with tears. Human connection isn't a nice thing to have; it's a must-have. Meaningful connections provide people with the internal fortitude they need to stay productive during tough times. You want to be connected to your people, and you also want them to be connected to one another. The way you do that is by talking, with real spoken words, not e-mail edicts, asking people how they're doing and actually listening to their answers, and by providing them with opportunities to interact with one another. 2. Meaning: Provide Context. We all want to know that we make a difference in the world. When you put someone's work into a meaningful context, you tap into the deepest yearning of his or her soul. The challenge is that most people's days are so hectic and their jobs so compartmentalized that they often miss the larger story of how their work touches the lives of others. Leaders who reframe daily tasks by providing personal context quell the angst of uncertainty by giving their employees something more meaningful to think about. What was this article about?","output":"This article is about keeping employees focused, engaged, and functioning during times of uncertainty and anxiety in the workplace. It suggests that addressing three basic human needs - connection, meaning, and leadership - can improve employee morale and productivity. The article provides advice on how leaders can tap into these needs by fostering emotional connections, providing context for the work employees do, and being responsive in difficult times."},{"instruction":"Premise: \\"A gentleman laughs in his car while driving on the countryside.\\" Based on this premise, can we conclude that the hypothesis \\"A man driving on his vacation.\\" is true?

The hypothesis in question is: \\"A man driving on his vacation.\\" To assess whether the hypothesis is true based on the given premise, we need to examine if the premise provides enough information to support the hypothesis.

Cells in each germ layer differentiate into tissues and embryonic organs. The ectoderm gives rise to the nervous system and the epidermis, among other tissues. The mesoderm gives rise to the muscle cells and connective tissue in the body. The endoderm gives rise to the gut and many internal organs. Organogenesis Gastrulation leads to the formation of the three germ layers that give rise during further development to the different organs in the animal body. This process is called organogenesis. Organs develop from the germ layers through the process of differentiation. During differentiation, the embryonic stem cells express specific sets of genes that will determine their ultimate cell type. For example, some cells in the ectoderm will express the genes specific to skin cells. As a result, these cells will take on the shape and characteristics of epidermal cells. The process of differentiation is regulated by location-specific chemical signals from the cell’s embryonic environment that sets in play a cascade of events that regulates gene expression. Q: Which germ layers are essential for animal embryos to grow and develop into a body? Choices: - histone and melatonin - keratinocytes , ectoderm , mesoderm - cytoplasm and chloroplasm - endoderm, ectoderm, mesoderm A: Answer:","output":"endoderm, ectoderm, mesoderm The three germ layers that are essential for animal embryos to grow and develop into a body are the endoderm, ectoderm, and mesoderm. These germ layers are formed during gastrulation, a stage in embryonic development that sets up the body plan and directs the growth and differentiation of cells that will ultimately become the different organs and tissues in the animal body. The endoderm is the innermost germ layer that gives rise to the lining of the gut and many internal organs, such as the liver, pancreas, lungs, and thyroid gland. Cells within the endoderm differentiate and specialize to perform specific functions in these organs, contributing to the digestive, respiratory, and endocrine systems. The ectoderm is the outermost germ layer that gives rise to the nervous system and the epidermis, among other tissues like the lens and cornea of the eye, tooth enamel, and the lining of the mouth and nasal cavities. Ectoderm cells differentiate into various cell types, such as neurons, and cells within the epidermis, including melanocytes, which produce pigment, and keratinocytes, which form a protective barrier for the body. The mesoderm is the middle germ layer and gives rise to the muscle cells and connective tissue in the body, as well as a variety of other structures like the kidneys, heart, blood vessels, and bones. Cells in the mesoderm differentiate into various cell types that make up the skeletal, muscular, cardiovascular, and urogenital systems, ensuring the proper structure and function of the body's organs and tissues. Organogenesis is the process by which these germ layers develop into the different organs in the animal body, and it is regulated by location-specific chemical signals from the cell's embryonic environment that control gene expression. These signals trigger a cascade of events that direct cells to express specific sets of genes, determining their ultimate cell type and function. Differentiation ensures that the cells within each germ layer take on specialized shapes and characteristics, working together to form the complex and interconnected systems within an animal's body. In summary, the endoderm, ectoderm, and mesoderm germ layers are essential for animal embryos to grow and develop into a functional body. Each germ layer gives rise to specific tissues and organs, and their cells undergo differentiation guided by location-specific chemical signals and gene expression, ultimately forming the diverse structures and systems that support the life of the organism."},{"instruction":"Sentence 1: uh i it was important demilitarize demilitarize that area because of all the build up armaments Sentence 2: It was important to demilitarize that area.

To create a paper holding jig,","output":"To create a paper holding jig, follow these step-by-step instructions: Step 1: Determine the purpose and size of the jig First, consider why you need the jig and the size of the paper that it needs to hold. Determining the purpose will give you insights into the design and features you need to include in your paper holding jig. For example, if it is for holding paper while painting or sketching, a vertical or angled design would be preferable. Step 2: Gather materials and tools To create your paper holding jig, you will need: - A sturdy material for the base and backing, such as plywood or MDF (medium-density fiberboard) - L-shaped brackets or corner braces - Adjustable clamps or paper holders - A ruler or measuring tape - A saw or a cutting tool (to cut the base and backing materials to size) - Sandpaper or a sanding block - A pencil or marker - Screws and a screwdriver - A drill (optional, for pre-drilling holes) Step 3: Cut the base and backing pieces Using the saw or cutting tool, cut the base and backing materials to the size needed for your paper holding jig. This will depend on the size of the paper you want to hold. Be sure to sand the edges of the cut materials to remove any rough edges. Step 4: Attach the backing piece to the base Using the L-shaped brackets or corner braces, attach the backing piece to the base. Position the brackets at each corner of the base, then use the screws and a screwdriver to secure them in place. If necessary, pre-drill holes to make it easier to screw the brackets to the base and backing. Step 5: Attach the adjustable clamps or paper holders Decide on how many clamps or paper holders you want to use to hold the paper in place. Usually, two to four holders are sufficient, depending on the size of the paper. Attach these to the backing piece using screws, ensuring that they are secure and that they can properly grip the paper. Step 6: Test the paper holding jig Place a sheet of paper between the adjustable clamps or paper holders and ensure that it is properly held in place. Adjust the positioning of the clamps or holders if necessary. Step 7: Apply finishing touches Optionally, you can paint or stain the paper holding jig to give it a more polished appearance, or add rubber grips or padding to the base to prevent it from slipping during use. By following these steps, you should have a functional and sturdy paper holding jig to help you with various creative or professional activities."},{"instruction":"Use stream of consciousness to answer the following. \\"Big Yellow Taxi\\" is a song written, composed, and originally recorded by Canadian singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell in 1970, and originally released on her album Ladies of the Canyon.

Hypothesis: The Environmental Protection Agency can be shortened to EPA. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"Step 1: Identify the key elements of the premise and hypothesis Premise: The Environmental Protection Agency was established in 1970 and is concerned with pollution and waste disposal issues. Hypothesis: The Environmental Protection Agency can be shortened to EPA. Step 2: Establish a connection between the premise and the hypothesis The key connection between the premise and the hypothesis is the name of the organization - the Environmental Protection Agency. Step 3: Determine if the premise supports the hypothesis The hypothesis states that the Environmental Protection Agency can be shortened to EPA. The premise outlines the purpose and establishment date of the Environmental Protection Agency, an organization that shares the same name as the one mentioned in the hypothesis. The phrase \\"the Environmental Protection Agency\\" is found in both the premise and the hypothesis. Considering common English language conventions, it is reasonable to assume that the acronym EPA refers to the Environmental Protection Agency.

Article: In-line skating is a fun sport that everyone can enjoy. Follow these safety tips to keep skating safe and fun. Step 1: Gear up! Even before you put on your skates, put on all your safety gear . Step 2: Buckle up! Strap on your skates. Make sure they fit well and are snugly around your ankles. This helps your ankles stay strong and straight. Step 3: Fall down! You probably do not usually try to fall. But it is good to practice falling on skates. Fall forward onto your knee pads. Put out your hands and let your wrist guards hit the ground. See? Are you surprised that it doesn't hurt? Practice falling until it is easy to fall forward and get up again. If you are not afraid to fall, you will try new things. Knowing how to fall will help you be a better skater and find your balance. When you can stay balanced, you won't fall as much. Step 4: Stop! Make sure you can stop on your skates. The quickest and safest is probably the brake stop. The brake is usually on the back of the right skate. The brake stop: Roll forward with your skates pointing the same way. Let your right skate roll a little forward. Bend your knees as if you are sitting down. Then press your right heel down hard. This will make your brake pad drag on the ground until you stop. The T stop: Roll forward with your skates pointing the same way. Then turn your right foot out so the toes are pointing to your right. Drag your right skate. Let the wheels drag on the ground until you come to a stop. Another way to stop is to run or jump onto the grass. Step 5: Roll around! Find a flat, smooth place to practice. Do not skate in streets. Parks and playgrounds are good places to practice. Look for \\"No skating\\" signs to make sure you can skate there. Question: How is the passage organized? Answer: A:","output":"The passage is organized step-by-step, providing a sequence of tips and instructions on how to safely enjoy in-line skating.

Sentence 1: \\"Houyan is a station on Dalian Metro line 3 in the province of Liaoning , China , in the Ganjingzi district of Dalian.\\" - Houyan as a station mentioned - Dalian Metro line 3 specified - In the province of Liaoning, China mentioned - In the Ganjingzi district of Dalian specified 2. Sentence 2: \\"Houyan is a station on line 3 of the Dalian Metro Dalian City and is located in the Ganjingzi District of the Province of Liaoning , China.\\" - Houyan as a station mentioned - Line 3 of the Dalian Metro specified - Dalian City might refer to the location of the Metro - Located in the Ganjingzi District mentioned - In the Province of Liaoning, China specified Both sentences convey the same general meaning, with slight differences in their structures. Both sentences state that Houyan is a station on line 3 of the Dalian Metro, and it is located in the Ganjingzi district in the province of Liaoning, China.

His mother , born in Kingston , was the tenth child of parents who had migrated from Devonshire to Canada . His mother , born in Kingston , was the tenth child of parents who emigrated to Canada from Devonshire .","output":"The two sentences have nearly the same meaning, with a minor difference in sentence structure. Here are the steps I take to evaluate this: 1. Identify the main subject: 'His mother' In both sentences, 'His mother' is the main subject. This part of the sentence refers to the same person in both examples, so this part of the sentence is identical. 2. Compare the descriptions about the mother: 'born in Kingston' In both sentences, the mother is described as being 'born in Kingston'. This detail is the same in both sentences, so this part of the sentence is also identical. 3. Compare the position in the family: 'tenth child' The mother is described as being the 'tenth child' in both sentences, so this part is also identical. 4. Compare the origin of the parents: 'parents who had migrated from Devonshire to Canada' vs 'parents who emigrated to Canada from Devonshire' In the first sentence, the parents 'migrated from Devonshire to Canada'. In the second sentence, the parents 'emigrated to Canada from Devonshire'. Although the choice of words (migrated vs emigrated) and the order of locations (Devonshire to Canada vs Canada from Devonshire) are different, the intended meaning is the same: the parents moved from Devonshire to Canada. So, based on these comparisons, the sentences have the same meaning. The minor differences in choice of words and order of locations do not change the overall meaning of the two sentences."},{"instruction":"Agricultural diversity can also be divided by whether it is ‘planned’ diversity or ‘associated’ diversity. This is a functional classification that we impose and not an intrinsic feature of life or diversity. Planned diversity includes the crops which a farmer has encouraged, planted or raised (e.g.: crops, covers, symbionts and livestock, among others), which can be contrasted with the associated diversity that arrives among the crops, uninvited (e.g.: herbivores, weed species and pathogens, among others). What type of diversity includes herbivores and pathogens?","output":"The type of diversity that includes herbivores and pathogens is known as 'associated' diversity. This classification of agricultural diversity refers to the various organisms that coexist within the agricultural ecosystem without being directly encouraged or planted by the farmer. The presence of these organisms is often unplanned and can have both positive and negative effects on the agricultural system. Associated diversity comprises a wide range of organisms, such as herbivores, pathogens, weed species, predators, parasites, decomposers, and pollinators, among many others. These species can arrive in the agricultural environment from natural ecosystems, adjacent fields, or be brought in through the movement of animals, the wind, or water. This diversity can impact the crop production and ecosystem health in various ways. Herbivores, for instance, are a part of associated diversity that plays an essential role in the nutrient cycling and ecological balance. However, they can also become pests when their population surpasses the ecological threshold and starts to cause significant damage to crops. Pathogens, like fungi, bacteria, and viruses, are other constituents of associated diversity. They may infect crops and livestock in the agricultural ecosystem, leading to diseases that can have detrimental effects on productivity and food security. On the other hand, some elements of associated diversity can benefit the agricultural system. Examples include predators, parasitoids, and parasites that help regulate the population of pest species by feeding on them or using them as hosts. Pollinators, like bees and butterflies, are also crucial components of associated diversity, as they facilitate the process of pollination, leading to improved crop yields. Overall, the interplay of various organisms within associated diversity can significantly influence the dynamics and resilience of an agricultural ecosystem. While some components may be detrimental to crop production, such as herbivores and pathogens, other elements may deliver valuable services, such as pest control, pollination, and nutrient cycling. Acknowledging and understanding this complexity is critical for the implementation of sustainable agriculture practices that maintain the balance between agricultural productivity and ecosystem health."},{"instruction":"OPTIONS: *Click on \\" create a microsoft office account \\" next to the \\" www.microsoft.com \\" button.

People from Salt village used regular salt, while people from Sand village people used iodized salt in their diets, after talking to specialists. But I can use this background: Before iodized salt was developed, some people experienced a number of developmental difficulties, including problems with thyroid gland function and mental retardation. In the 1920s, we learned that these conditions could usually be treated easily with the addition of iodide anion to the diet. One easy way to increase iodide intake was to add the anion to table salt. This simple step greatly enhanced health and development. Large amounts of iodide ion are also found in seaweed such as kelp (see picture above) and saltwater fish. What is an answer for this question: Which village had more people with enhanced health? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Identify the key information given. - People from two villages ate lots of salt. - Salt village: regular salt - Sand village: iodized salt (after talking to specialists) - Before iodized salt, people experienced developmental difficulties, including thyroid gland issues and mental retardation. - These conditions could be treated with the addition of iodide anion to the diet. Step 2: Relate the information to the question. - We are trying to determine which village had more people with enhanced health. - Enhanced health, in this context, refers to less developmental difficulties, thyroid gland issues, and mental retardation. Step 3: Evaluate the information. - People from Salt village used regular salt, which does not contain iodide anion. - People from Sand village used iodized salt (containing iodide anion) in their diets. Step 4: Draw conclusions based on the information. - Regular salt doesn't contain iodide anion, so it wouldn't help with treating problems related to low iodide intake. - Iodized salt, containing the iodide anion, does contribute to health improvement by reducing the risks of developmental difficulties, thyroid gland issues, and mental retardation.

Goldstein Historic Devices for Hearing Collection Speculation about a supposed time traveller talking on her cell phone at a 1928 Hollywood film premiere has sped across the Internet faster than a DeLorean time machine. But a less mind-bending possibility is that she was just hard of hearing, experts say. The story first surfaced in a YouTube video that includes film footage showing the 1928 premiere of the Charlie Chaplin film \\"The Circus\\" at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, Cali. Irish filmmaker George Clarke points out a woman in the old footage holding what he describes as a cell phone against her ear. The shape implies the woman is a time traveler using a modern mobile device rather than an ear trumpet, Clarke said. What Clarke didn't consider was that a simple ear trumpet could still explain it all, said hearing device historians, who provided LiveScience with images of sample ear trumpets for comparison. [See the ear trumpets] \\"As you can tell from these, old-fashioned mechanical or resonating hearing aids were not necessarily long and rounded,\\" said Philip Skroska, an archivist at the Bernard Becker Medical Library of Washington University in St. Louis. \\"Short, compact rectangular forms were not unusual.\\" In other words, they could look something like a cell phone to imaginative YouTube viewers in the 21st century. [Time Travel Machine Outlined] Listen to this 19th-century resonator hearing aids such as ear trumpets were still made in large numbers well into the first decades of the 20th century, Skroska explained, and the basic designs didn't change much aside from incorporating newer, plastic-like materials. \\"Besides, I would expect this woman to be over 50 years old, so using a late 19th century design in 1928 would not be a stretch I think,\\" Skroska said. Electronic hearing aids also existed before World War II, but in fewer numbers. \\"Now, I can't really explain why the woman appears to be talking (other than yelling at the man who quickened his pace ahead of her),\\" Skroska said in an e-mail. \\"But I think it's fair to say it would be a hasty judgment to dismiss the possibility that it was a hearing aid she was holding up to her ear.\\" This explanation might be less exciting than the time travel theory, but it avoids a huge number of theoretical and practical problems associated with sending someone into the past. Time travel issues Theorists have kicked around a few scenarios for how people might travel to the past, said Brian Greene, author of the bestseller, \\"The Elegant Universe\\" (Vintage Books, 2000) and a physicist at Columbia University, during a past LiveScience interview. \\"And almost all of them, if you look at them closely, brush up right at the edge of physics as we understand it. Most of us think that almost all of them can be ruled out.\\" One theory focuses on wormholes – hypothetical tunnels that connect two regions of space-time that could represent two parts of the same universe, or even completely different universes. But creating a wormhole that punches through space-time looks far beyond anything humans can accomplish with today's technology, said Michio Kaku, author of \\"Hyperspace\\" (Anchor, 1995) and \\"Parallel Worlds\\" (Anchor, 2006), and a physicist at the City University of New York, in a past interview. Humans would need to somehow harness the energy of a star or possibly matter with negative energy density – an exotic and hypothetical form of matter with the energy of less than nothing. Even if such matter exists, there would likely not be enough of it for a time machine to harness. Another time travel theory relies upon cosmic strings – narrow tubes of energy that span the entire length of the expanding universe. Predictions suggest that such regions could contain huge amounts of mass and warp space-time in a way that allows for time travel. The cosmic strings either run on infinitely or form loops \\"like spaghetti or SpaghettiO's,\\" said Richard Gott, author of \\"Time Travel in Einstein's Universe\\" (Mariner Books, 2002) and an astrophysicist at Princeton University. Two such strings parallel to one another could perhaps bend space-time enough to make time travel possible – but it's a challenge that only a \\"super civilization\\" might try, Gott explained in a past interview. Not what it seems Any pathways that could theoretically allow for time travel between points in space-time have never been seen, according to Charles Liu, an astrophysicist at the City University of New York, College of Staten Island, and co-author on the book \\"One Universe: At Home in the Cosmos\\" (Joseph Henry Press, 1999). Besides being \\"very unlikely to exist at all,\\" such pathways are \\"even less likely to be able to transport anything larger than a subatomic particle intact,\\" Liu said. People of the present also have a track record of trying to fit what they see to known patterns, Liu pointed out. He added that it was no surprise for 21st-century people to see what they think is a cell phone in 1928, just as people claimed to see faces on Mars or the Virgin Mary in toast. \\"So I'm going to bed tonight confident that the person was not a time traveler from the future,\\" Liu said in an e-mail yesterday. ||||| Search Famecrawler: writes a humor blog, called The Mommyologist , all about the changes in life that go along with being a parent.

As the body count rises, the police and the townsfolk are left wondering who the killer could be, with suspicion falling on everyone from the creepy loner next door to Alex's own girlfriend. As the remaining friends and family members struggle to come to terms with their loss, a mysterious figure starts leaving cryptic messages for Alex to find. Each message is signed \\"Three Finger,\\" a local legend that dates back to the 1800s about a wild, carnivorous man with only three fingers on each hand. Determined to find the murderer and clear his family name, Alex starts following the trail left by Three Finger. His search leads him deep into the heart of the Darkwood forest, where he makes a chilling discovery - an old cabin filled with gruesome evidence of the murders that took place there. As the police and the townsfolk scramble to catch up to Alex, they begin to put the pieces together of Three Finger's story. It is revealed that he was once a peaceful man named Tom, who was bitten by a strange creature more than 100 years ago, after which he transformed into Three Finger. Three Finger's insatiable hunger for human flesh led him to target his victims, brutally mutilating them and eating their innards. His curse seemed to pass on to his descendants, as his son and grandson both exhibited the same monstrous traits and insatiable craving for human flesh. It is during this investigation that Alex makes a startling connection. As he digs deeper into his own family's history, he realizes that he himself is a direct descendant of Tom - the original Three Finger. Now imbued with the same murderous instincts, Alex must choose between giving in to his family's curse or finding a way to end Three Finger’s legacy for good. As the police and the townsfolk close in on Alex, he manages to confront and defeat the monster within him, ultimately saving not only his own soul but those of his remaining friends as well.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","output":"The process of dieting refers to the management or alteration of food intake in order to control body weight. During dieting, you may consume less food, adopt a specific type of nutrition plan, or even intermittently fast. Different types of diets can have varying effects on digestion. Now let's see how dieting may influence digestion, and especially the second effect you mentioned - the role of the tongue in pushing the food around while you chew with your teeth: 1. Less Food Consumption: When you eat less food while dieting, there will naturally be less material for the digestive system to process. Thus, overall digestion would likely be less intense as there is less food to break down. Regarding the specific role of the tongue, its job of moving food around during chewing would be 'less' affected. The tongue would still push food around while chewing, but there may be less food to move around and, therefore, the action may be less frequent or less intensive. 2. Specific Nutritional Plans: Some diets emphasize specific types of food (e.g., high-fiber, low-carb, etc.). These might influence digestion depending on which nutrients are emphasized or minimized. For instance, a high-fiber diet could actually stimulate digestion by promoting the movement of food through the digestive tract. On the other hand, a low-carb diet might slow it. In these instances, the tongue's role in moving food around when chewing could be 'more' or 'less' affected depending on the type of diet and consistency of the eaten food. 3. Fasting: In the case of intermittent fasting (not eating for a certain number of hours each day), digestion could be affected in various ways. On fasting periods, less food would be processed, decreasing the activities of digestion, including the tongue's action. While on eating periods, the tongue could work 'more' intensively as one might tend to eat larger meals within the limited eating time frame. Therefore, it is evident that dieting could result in both 'more,' 'less,' or 'no change' to the tongue's activity due to the complex influence of different diet types on the process of digestion. It’s difficult to identify a universal effect of dieting on this aspect of digestion, as this depends on the specific dieting strategy and the individual’s response to it."},{"instruction":"Process: - The pancreas detects chemical changes in the stomach - The pancreas creates juices that help digest food - The pancreas releases the juices into the stomach - Trypsin and chymotrypsin digest protein - Insulin is produced to move glucose from the blood - The enzymes begin producing again. suppose less chemical changes in stomach happens, how will it affect the pancreas working SOFTER.

The king's skeleton was found under a car park in Leicester during an archaeological dig. The reconstructed face has a slightly arched nose and prominent chin, similar to features shown in portraits of Richard III painted after his death. Historian and author John Ashdown-Hill said seeing it was \\"almost like being face to face with a real person\\". The development comes after archaeologists from the University of Leicester confirmed the skeleton found last year was the 15th Century king's, with DNA from the bones having matched that of descendants of the monarch's family. 'Very handsome' Richard was killed in the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, at the age of 32 and after just two years on the throne, having been challenged by the forces of Henry Tudor, the future Henry VII. Dr Ashdown-Hill, who wrote The Last Days of Richard III, said: \\"The most obvious features in portraits are the shape of the nose and the chin and both of those are visible in the facial reconstruction.\\" Richard III Society member Philippa Langley, originator of the search, said on a Channel 4 documentary earlier: \\"It doesn't look like the face of a tyrant. I'm sorry but it doesn't. \\"He's very handsome. It's like you could just talk to him, have a conversation with him right now.\\" Layers of muscle and skin were added by computer to a scan of the skull and the result was made into a three-dimensional plastic model. Dr Ashdown-Hill said: \\"I had said previously that when I stood by the grave in Leicester that I felt closer to Richard III than I had ever been, but when I saw the facial reconstruction I realised I had been close to a dead Richard III. \\"It was just bones, just a body, whereas confronting a facial reconstruction, I felt almost in the presence of a living Richard III.\\" 'Humped backs' The reconstruction is particularly important because there are no surviving contemporary portraits of Richard III. Dr Ashdown-Hill said: \\"All the surviving portraits of him - even the very later ones with humped backs and things which were obviously later additions - facially are quite similar [to each other] so it has always been assumed that they were based on a contemporary portrait painted in his lifetime or possibly several portraits painted in his lifetime.\\" The Richard III Society officially unveiled the reconstruction on Tuesday morning, at the Society of Antiquaries in London. It is expected the reconstruction will be put on public display in future. Image caption Richard III died aged 32 in the Battle of Bosworth Experts from the University of Leicester said DNA from the skeleton matches that of a descendant of Richard III's family. Dr Ashdown-Hill said: \\"We weren't certain whether the body was Richard III so the facial reconstruction - particularly if it hadn't been possible to get DNA from the bones - might have been an additional piece of evidence, and still is.\\" Caroline Wilkinson, professor of craniofacial identification at the University of Dundee, said: \\"It was a great privilege to be able to analyse a skull thought to be Richard III. \\"The facial reconstruction was produced on the assumption that the remains were unknown and portraits of Richard III were not used as reference. \\"When the 3D digital bust was complete it was replicated in plastic using a rapid prototyping system and this was painted, prosthetic eyes added and dressed with a wig, hat and clothing.\\" Prof Wilkinson said the Dundee team artist, Janice Aitken, only used the portraits of Richard III at this stage as reference for hair style and colour, eye colour, skin colour and clothing. The team estimated the end result was as accurate as possible. \\"Our facial reconstruction methods have been blind tested many times using living subjects and we know that we can expect that approximately 70% of the facial surface should have less than 2mm of error,\\" said Prof Wilkinson. ||||| The DNA evidence was, apparently, the killer piece of evidence in the puzzle of the twisted skeleton under the car park in Leicester. A team of scientists led by Turi King at the University of Leicester's eminent genetics department had conclusively proved these were the remains of King Richard III. Given that the DNA analysis seems to corroborate other genealogical evidence, the conclusion seems clear-cut. But no genetic analysis is perfect and, because the results have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, it might be worth throwing in a little scepticism, for now at least. King's team looked at the DNA from the mitochondria of the cells in the skeleton – these tiny structures are a cell's batteries, turning glucose into power for all of its functions. Crucially for genealogists, this DNA sequence is separate from a person's main sequence and is passed down the maternal line almost unchanged across many generations. Comparing the so-called \\"mtDNA\\" from the skeleton with that from a living descendant, Michael Ibsen, showed a match, meaning Ibsen's mother and the skeleton's mother (thought to be Richard III's mother, Cecily Neville) are likely to have shared a lineage. So far, so good. \\"Mitochondria is not brilliant for detecting relatedness but, given you've got so far back in time, so many generations back, it's as good as it can get. If the only thing you can compare that ancient DNA with is somebody living today, then you'd want it to be mitochondria,\\" said Mark Thomas, a professor of evolutionary genetics at University College London. But it is not ideal. Two people could have the same mitochondrial type just by chance and it would not necessarily mean they shared a common ancestor at the time of Richard III. \\"If Richard III had a very common type of mitochondrial DNA, then there will be plenty of people in the country that have got the same,\\" said Thomas. Even if there is good circumstantial evidence to suggest two people are related, they might still share the same mtDNA by chance. One thing to look out for in any forthcoming research paper is just how rare the mtDNA type is that King's team measured – the rarer it is, the less likely it is to be a chance result and the more likely it is to be a robust family connection. Ross Barnett of the Centre for GeoGenetics at the Natural History Museum in Copenhagen also questioned the depth of the mtDNA match between the skeleton and Ibsen. \\"The [diagrams] they showed were only about 30 base pairs or so … you need to have quite a lot more than 30 base pairs to get a deep match.\\" The more common a mtDNA type is in the population, the more base pairs of DNA are required to get a reliable match. Thomas said in this instance the DNA is of less importance in determining the identity of the skeleton than the other evidence gathered by archaeologists. \\"People tend to privilege DNA because they see it as firm science [but only when] you put it together with the spine deformation, the wounds and so on, it makes for a more persuasive case.\\" ||||| Doubts remain that the Leicester body is Richard III Douglas Heaven, reporter (Image: Leicester University) Editorial: \\"Open Richard III DNA evidence for peer review\\" Hacked, sliced, stripped, slung over a horse and stabbed in the bottom. Tradition tells us that Richard III - the last Plantagenet king of England - met an especially bloody end in the battle of Bosworth Field on 22 August 1485. Now we may have a body to go with the legend. Anticipation started building last year when an interesting skeleton was unearthed from beneath a car park in Leicester, UK. Today a team of researchers from the University of Leicester announced that, \\"beyond reasonable doubt\\", the body is that of Richard III. They draw on multiple strands of evidence to back their claim: as well as the expected wounds, the skeleton shows signs of scoliosis, a disease that curves the spine, which fits with accounts of the king being \\"hunchbacked\\". But the clincher - for the researchers, at least - is newly revealed DNA evidence from two of Richard's living maternal descendants. (Image: Leicester University/Rex Features) Michael Ibsen, a furniture-maker originally from London, and his distant cousin, who wishes to remain anonymous, were tracked down using genealogical records. Geneticist Turi King of the University of Leicester then matched traces of mitochondrial DNA extracted from the skeleton with samples taken from the purported relatives. She was only able to sequence the mitochondrial DNA control region before the announcement was made. But this region mutates easily, so finding a match despite the high chance of mutation is a strong indicator that individuals are related. \\"As a scientist I would have preferred to finish the analysis,\\" says King. \\"But I know the answer isn't going to change.\\" Because Ibsen and his cousin are both the last of their lines, this could have been the last chance for such evidence to be obtained. Mitochondrial DNA is passed down the maternal line and has 16,000 base pairs in total. Typically, you might expect to get 50 to 150 fragments from a 500-year-old skeleton, says Ian Barnes at Royal Holloway, University of London, who was not involved in the research. \\"You'd want to get sequences from lots of those fragments,\\" he says. \\"There's a possibility of mitochondrial mutations arising in the line from Richard III.\\" \\"It's intriguing to be sure,\\" says Mark Thomas at University College London. It is right that they used mitochondrial DNA based on the maternal line, he says, since genealogical evidence for the paternal lineage cannot be trusted. But mitochondrial DNA is not especially good for pinpointing identity. \\"I could have the same mitochondrial DNA as Richard III and not be related to him,\\" says Thomas. The researchers used the two living descendents to \\"triangulate\\" the DNA results. The evidence will rest on whether Ibsen and his cousin have sufficiently rare mtDNA to make it unlikely that they both match the dead king by chance. They must also not be too closely related. If Richard III's living descendants shared a common female ancestor even 150 years ago, their DNA could still be too close for the pair to count as distinct samples, says Thomas. We'll have to wait for the results to be published to know for sure, says Barnes. Update: This story was updated to include a statement from Turi King and more detail about the DNA that she sequenced. ||||| Behold the face of Richard III. A model of the visage of the last of England's Plantagenet rulers has been unveiled in London, just 24 hours after mitochondrial DNA testing revealed that human remains discovered beneath a car park in Leicester used by social services, were those of the king. This reconstruction, by a team at the University of Dundee using CT scans and then building up layers of muscle and skin by computer, is seen as important, as all existing portraits of Richard III date from after the monarch's death in 1485, aged just 32. Extraneous details on the model, such as hair and eye color, are based on these portraits. The physical result caused quite a stir amongst some of the experts. Philippa Langley, a member of the Richard III Society, and who was one of the driving forces behind the search for the lost king's body, said on last night's Channel 4 documentary, \\"It doesn't look like the face of a tyrant. I'm sorry, but it doesn't. He's very handsome.\\" Richard III met a gory end at the Battle of Bosworth, after which his lifeless body was displayed before being buried without ceremony in a church in Leicester. [Image via Channel 4 and Leicester University] ||||| The announcement that the bones of English King Richard III have been identified \\"beyond reasonable doubt\\" has spurred excitement — and some skepticism — among the archaeological community. \\"I'm really excited by it,\\" said Lemont Dobson, a historian and archaeologist at the School of Public Service and Global Citizenship at Central Michigan University. \\"This is one of those things where people are talking about archaeology and real science, not pseudoscience on television.\\" On Twitter, \\"Richard III\\" was trending Monday morning, a fact that generated some amusement among users. \\"Man, when's the last time 'Richard III' was trending? Tewkesbury?\\" wrote GristList editor Jess Zimmerman, referring to a 1471 battle in the War of the Roses in which a young Richard played a role. That ongoing civil war would take Richard III's life 14 years later, two years after his ascent to the throne. But some scientists struck a more sober note, warning that ancient DNA analysis is subject to contamination, and grumbling that the results were revealed via press conference prior to peer-review by fellow researchers. [Gallery: The Search for Richard III] \\"The DNA results presented today are too weak, as they stand, to support the claim that DNA is actually from Richard III,\\" said Maria Avila, a computational biologist at the Center for GeoGenetics at the Natural History Museum of Denmark. \\"Perhaps more in-depth DNA analysis summed to the archaeological and osteological [bone analysis] results would make a round story.\\" The remains of King Richard III, showing a curved spine and signs of battle trauma. Credit: University of Leicester DNA of a king University of Leicester archaeologists announced today (Feb. 4) that a skeleton found months before under a city council parking lot does indeed belong to the medieval king. The researchers suspected the bones might belong to Richard III, because they sported wounds consistent with the king's death in the 1485 Battle of Bosworth Field. Several wounds to the skull, in particular, were consistent with almost immediate death by either brain injury or blood loss. The skeleton also exhibits a twisting of the spine known as scoliosis, which meshes with historical reports of Richard III as a \\"hunchback.\\" (He wasn't actually a hunchback, the researchers point out — scoliosis may have made him look slightly lopsided, however.) The date of the bones and burial location also fit the Richard III identification. For the University of Leicester team, however, the nail in the coffin of the identification was a DNA analysis that matched that of Michael Ibsen, a modern-day descendent of Richard III through the maternal line, along with DNA from another descendent on the maternal line who asked to be kept anonymous. The DNA used is mitochondrial DNA, which is contained in the part of the cell that transforms nutrients to energy; this type of DNA is passed down only through the maternal line. Ancient DNA, however, is very susceptible to contamination, sparking some skepticism. \\"Before being convinced of ANY aDNA study, it should be explicit that all possible cautions were taken to avoid potential contamination,\\" Avila wrote in an email to LiveScience. \\"It is just part of the protocol.\\" (aDNA refers to ancient DNA.) Avila also warned that people could share mitochondrial DNA even if they didn't share a family tree. To be confident that Ibsen is related to the owner of the disinterred skeleton, the researchers must present statistics showing how common the DNA profile is in the United Kingdom, she said. Otherwise, the similarities between Ibsen's mitochondrial DNA and the skeleton's could be coincidental. Avila noted that she doesn't necessarily disbelieve the team's conclusion that the skeleton is Richard III's, just that the DNA evidence isn't the strongest piece of the puzzle. \\"It seems to me that osteological as well as archaeological evidence is stronger, however 'DNA evidence' sounds fancier so it looks like they used it as the hook to capture the attention of media,\\" she said. Announcing a discovery Those caveats had some scientists wishing the Richard III team had published a peer-reviewed scientific paper (a process that can take months or more) before announcing their identification to the public. The Richard III team said today that they would submit their findings for peer-review and publication, though not before more media exposure. The BBC's Channel 4 will run a documentary on the archaeological hunt for Richard III and the discovery tonight.

Credit: University of Leicester \\"I love the fact that there is so much excitement over Richard III discovery, but I'm also not keen on press-conferences for science,\\" paleobiologist Victoria Herridge of the Natural History Museum London wrote on Twitter. Without detailed methods and statistics, Herridge and other scientists complained, it's difficult to judge the veracity of the findings. Not everyone criticized the University of Leicester's immediate announcement. The team avoided sensationalism, said Central Michigan University's Dobson. \\"I think they went about it in probably the most rigorous way,\\" Dobson told LiveScience. Criticisms of the press conference are \\"missing the point of this kind of discovery,\\" he said, because public interest is huge. \\"Whether there's a press conference or not, it's going to be covered by the media, because that character occupies a place in our cultural psyche,\\" Dobson said. \\"In one sense, they are giving the public what the public demands, which is access to knowledge that would typically be restricted.\\" The responsibility of archaeologists, Dobson said, is to present that knowledge without cutting corners on scientific rigor. Nor did the DNA results trigger universal skepticism, given the multiple clues consistent with the body being Richard III. \\"It's an impressive undertaking that the University of Leicester has pulled off: Not only did they find the cemetery and the body, they confirmed through numerous lines of evidence that the body was likely that of Richard III,\\" anthropologist Kristina Killgrove, a professor at the University of West Florida who was not involved in the study, told LiveScience. Based on the research done in this case, Killgrove said, \\"I trust that they know what they're talking about and that it will stand up to peer review.\\" Follow Stephanie Pappas on Twitter @sipappas or LiveScience @livescience.

The film follows the lives of four childhood friends: Joon-seok, the leader of the group and whose father is a powerful mob boss; Dong-su, whose father is an undertaker; class clown Jung-ho; and Sang-taek, who was an exemplary student. As children they play together, sell sexually explicit pictures cut from a magazine, and wonder if a South Korean Olympic swimmer could outrace a sea turtle. Jung-ho also showed the rest of them a VCR that his mother had, and this film he found on it. It turns out to be a pornographic movie, and the boys are entranced while arguing over what a \\"menstruation\\" was, with them believing that it was the word that adults used to describe the \\"vagina\\".Fast forward to high school, where they are reunited after separating during middle school. They become smitten with the lead singer of a band of girls their age. Joon-seok invites the band to a party at his house, where each boy pairs off with one girl (though not after some tension over how to do so). Sang-taek receives his first kiss from the lead singer, Jin-sook.Back in school, Joon-seok and Dong-su get in trouble after a confrontation with a teacher; After their friends convince them to go apologize, they are only off with a light suspension. During an outing to the movies, where Sang-taek catches the eye of another school kid whom he had picked a fight with earlier, Joon-seok and Dong-su fend off a whole rival school while Jung-ho protects Sang-taek. Dong-su, after the fight, returns with a steel rod and smashes the school's glass cases with its awards and trophies, dropping out of school and warning anyone who bumps into him on the street will \\"pay\\". Sang-taek is suspended from the affair. After graduation, Sang-taek and Jung-ho go to college but the others do not.A few years later Sang-taek and Jung-ho return to find Joon-seok married to Jin-sook, the singer from the band. He is seriously ill and abusive towards his wife as a result of being addicted to philopon; he also appears depressed that his father is dying. Later he recovers from his illness, divorces his wife, and mourns his father. He assumes his father's role as a crime lord. Dong-su also becomes a mobster with a rival organization, and becomes similarly powerful.Joon-seok, Sang-taek, and Jung-ho remain close, drinking, singing karaoke, and eating galbi together during reunions. After Dong-su causes Joon-seok's boss to be imprisoned, an assassination attempt is led on Dong-su, souring relations and leading to a mob war between the two friends' opposing ganges. After an attack on his men, Joon-seok visits Dong-su at his headquarters. Joon-seok talks to Dong-su as if nothing has happened, and asks if he would like to accompany him to see Sang-taek off, since he was heading to the United States. Dong-su, however, does not want to, and Joon-seok becomes serious. Joon-seok asks Dong-su as a friend to leave for Hawaii for a few years until things cooled down, Dong-su, however, refuses and tells Joon-seok to leave. Joon-seok leaves to say farewell to Sang-taek.What Dong-su did not realize was that Joon-seok asked him to leave as a friend. After mulling over the conversation Dong-su decides to see Sang-taek off at the airport. However, as he is about to leave, Dong-su is betrayed by his gang and stabbed to death.A few years later, Sung-taek returns to South Korea upon finishing his study abroad. Jung-ho explains how during Sung-taek's absence Joon-seok's gang sent him into hiding abroad. After a two years, he was unable to stand the hiding any longer and had a mental breakdown. He was caught after attempting to kill himself in a foreign bar. Joon-seok goes to trial for Dong-su's murder and, even after Jung-ho bribes the jurors, Joon-seok pleads guilty to ordering Dong-su's death, despite his actual innocence.After the trial, Sang-taek visits Joon-seok in prison, and the two talk like old friends who haven't seen each other. When the time comes for Joon-seok to leave to go back to his jail cell, Sung-taek asks why he pleaded guilty in court. Joon-seok simply replies, \\"Humiliation. Me and Dong-su are mobsters. Mobsters shouldn't be humiliated.\\" Sang-taek and Joon-seok then part ways, with Sang-taek promising to visit every month. The film ends with Joon-seok walking back to his cell, in a hallway with a white bright light in the end, with Joon-seok reflecting on the past when they were all children, wondering who would win in a race, the South Korean Olympic swimmer or a sea turtle, when they were all still friends.","output":"Question: Who are the four childhood friends in the movie?

This statement suggests that there are many aspects of human behavior, cognition, emotion, and social organization that are currently in the early stages of development or understanding. While some tendencies and phenomena are well-established and thoroughly understood, there is still an immense amount of uncharted territory waiting to be discovered and studied. In particular, human cognition and the brain – our most complex and intricate organ – continue to elicit fascination and inquiry from researchers around the world. As advancements in neuroimaging and other techniques unfold, we are beginning to uncover new information about how the brain functions, processes information, and adapts to change. Despite these advances, there is still much to learn about the intricacies of the brain and the true scope of our mental capacities. Moreover, the rapid pace of technological progress in recent years has led to new paradigms in the realm of human communication, interaction, and learning. We now have access to a wealth of knowledge and resources at our fingertips through the internet, which has proven to be both empowering and overwhelming. Our ability to navigate this digital landscape and adapt to changes in technology is, in many ways, still at an early stage of development. Similarly, our understanding of human emotions and their influence on our decision-making and behavior is continually evolving. While we have identified basic emotions and some of their impacts on our lives, neuroscientists and psychologists are still exploring more nuanced emotions, their interrelationships, and effects on the human psyche. Recent advances in emotional intelligence research have provided insights into managing emotions effectively to improve relationships, decision-making processes, and overall well-being. However, many facets of our emotional landscape remain underexplored. Furthermore, as our world becomes increasingly interconnected, we are continually exposed to different cultures, languages, beliefs, and social norms. Understanding and embracing this diversity can contribute to global harmony and prosperity. This, too, is a process that is in its infancy, with significant obstacles and misconceptions still hindering our progress in fostering cross-cultural understanding and collaboration. Lastly, the looming threat of climate change and environmental issues provide another area where human behavior, mentality, and awareness need significant growth and development. We are beginning to understand the implications of our actions on the environment, but the pace of change in our behaviors, policies, and technologies has yet to catch up with the urgency of the situation. In conclusion, the statement that \\"all these human tendencies and phenomena are, as yet, still embryonic\\" highlights the immense potential for growth and development in various aspects of our lives. As we continue to expand our knowledge and understanding of ourselves and the world around us, we must seize the opportunity to evolve and adapt. By doing so, we can overcome the myriad challenges facing humanity and strive to create a better world for future generations."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Information: - Samuel Lazzaro (August 6, 1903 March 31, 1982), better known by his boxing alias Joe Dundee, was an American boxer.

Let's break this down step by step: Step 1: Characteristics of organisms with rapid evolution - Short generation times: Faster reproduction rates lead to quicker genetic changes across generations, allowing for rapid adaptation. - Large population sizes: Organisms with larger populations have greater genetic diversity, which can increase the chances of beneficial mutations. - High mutation rates: Organisms with higher mutation rates experience a higher frequency of genetic variation, which helps drive evolution. - Strong selective pressures: Environments with strong selective pressures can induce faster evolutionary adaptation to survive challenging conditions. Step 2: Identifying organisms with these characteristics - Bacteria: Bacteria have short generation times, large population sizes, relatively high mutation rates, and often face strong selective pressures (e.g., antibiotics). They can evolve quickly, developing resistance to drugs and adapting to various environments. - Viruses: Viruses, including RNA viruses like influenza and HIV, have high mutation rates and evolve rapidly to escape immune responses or adapt to new hosts. - Some insects: Insects, such as fruit flies (Drosophila), have fast reproduction rates and large population sizes, which contribute to their ability to evolve quickly. - Small plants and fungi: Some small plants, like the common waterweed, can reproduce quickly and adapt to new environments. Fungi, such as yeast, have relatively short generation times and thus can undergo rapid evolution as well. Step 3: Conclusion Based on the factors that contribute to rapid evolution, it can be concluded that organisms such as bacteria, viruses, certain insects, small plants, and fungi are the ones in which evolution could occur most rapidly. Their short generation times, large population sizes, high mutation rates, and frequent exposure to strong selective pressures collectively accelerate the process of evolution in these organisms."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Combine facts and answer this: Alan Alda won one of his seven Emmy Awards in 2006 for playing Arnold Vinick in which political TV drama?

Mr Brown said he did not believe Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond’s assertions that pensions would continue to be paid, pointing to questions over the value of North Sea oil revenues in the coming years. must keep the common OPTIONS: - Alan Simpson National Insurance fund that we have - Alex Salmond National Insurance fund that we have - British National Insurance fund that we have - Brown National Insurance fund that we have - Daniel Martin National Insurance fund that we have - Gordon Brown National Insurance fund that we have - Matt Chorley National Insurance fund that we have - North Sea National Insurance fund that we have - Pensions National Insurance fund that we have - Scots National Insurance fund that we have - Scottish National Insurance fund that we have - UK National Insurance fund that we have - Yes National Insurance fund that we have","output":"- British National Insurance fund that we have"},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're given a pair of sentences, sentence 1 and sentence 2.

As a cereal grain, it is the most widely consumed staple food for a large part of the world's human population, especially in Asia. It is the agricultural commodity with the third-highest worldwide production, after sugarcane and maize, according to 2012 FAOSTAT data. Since a large portion of maize crops are grown for purposes other than human consumption, rice is the most important grain with regard to human nutrition and caloric intake, providing more than one-fifth of the calories consumed worldwide by humans. Wild rice, from which the crop was developed, may have its native range in Australia. Chinese legends attribute the domestication of rice to Shennong, the legendary emperor of China and inventor of Chinese agriculture. Genetic evidence has shown that rice originates from a single domestication 8,20013,500 years ago in the Pearl River valley region of Ancient China. Previously, archaeological evidence had suggested that rice was domesticated in the Yangtze River valley region in China. - North Gyeongsang Province (RR: Gyeongsangbuk-do), also known as Gyeongbuk, is a province in eastern South Korea.

Matthew Staton Bomer was born on October 11, 1977 in Webster Groves, Missouri, to Elizabeth Macy (nee Staton) and John O'Neill Bomer IV, a Dallas Cowboys draft pick. His father, John Bomer, played for the Dallas Cowboys from 1972 to 1974. He has a sister Megan Bomer and a brother Neill Bomer, who is an engineer. Bomer credits his own parents for being understanding when they sensed their young child was a little different from other kids. \\"I've always had an active imagination,\\" says Bomer. He is a distant cousin to American singer Justin Timberlake, with whom he starred in the movie In Time in 2011. Timberlake and Bomer share common descent from Edward Bomer, who was born in 1690. Bomer's ancestry includes English, as well as Welsh, Scots-Irish, Scottish, Irish, Swiss-German, and German. In 1995, at age 17, Bomer made his professional stage debut as Young Collector in a production of Tennessee Williams A Streetcar Named Desire (1947) staged by Alley Theatre, a company in the Downtown, Houston, at the Texas.

Where he graduated in 2001, with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree, along with his friend and also actor Joe Manganiello. Who were his parents?","output":"Matthew Bomer's parents are Elizabeth Macy, also called by Staton, and John O'Neill Bomer IV.

Como resolver problemas How do you say this sentence in English?","output":"The sentence \\"7. Los tres cerebros. Como resolver problemas\\" can be translated to English as, \\"7. The Three Brains. How to Solve Problems.\\" This sentence appears to be a title or heading that introduces a section or chapter discussing the concept of the three brains and how they can be utilized to approach problem-solving. To further elaborate on this concept, the idea of having three brains is based on the Triune Brain model proposed by Dr. Paul MacLean, a neuroscientist from the United States. According to his theory, the human brain consists of three distinct but interconnected sections, each with its own specialized functions: 1. The Reptilian Brain (brainstem and cerebellum) - This is the oldest and most primitive part of the brain, responsible for basic survival instincts, such as self-preservation, territorial defense, and reproduction. It is also in charge of autonomic functions, including heart rate, breathing, and body temperature regulation. 2. The Mammalian Brain (limbic system) - Also known as the emotional brain, it is responsible for processing and regulating emotions, forming memories, and managing basic social behaviors. Key structures within the mammalian brain include the amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and thalamus. 3. The Neocortex (cerebral cortex) - The neocortex is the most evolved and largest part of the human brain. It is responsible for complex cognitive functions, such as perception, awareness, decision-making, reasoning, language, creativity, and problem-solving. The neocortex is further divided into four distinct lobes (frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital), each responsible for specific functions. In the context of \\"The Three Brains. How to Solve Problems,\\" the idea is to understand the functions of each part of the triune brain and learn how to harness their capabilities effectively to approach and solve problems. This involves recognizing the roles that instinct, emotions, and higher cognitive processes play in decision-making and problem-solving, and learning strategies to integrate these different aspects of the brain to achieve optimal outcomes. Some approaches may include mindfulness practices, emotional intelligence training, or cognitive reframing techniques, among others."},{"instruction":"Translate to Finnish: What I should like to ask the Commission is this: first, who are the third interested parties?

Car: Since the person is in traffic, it is most likely that they are using a vehicle. Keeping the eyeglasses case in the car provides easy access whenever they need it without having to fumble around or take their eyes off the road, which is important for safety. There are various compartments and spaces inside a car, such as the glove box or center console, that can securely store an eyeglasses case. 2. Shirt pocket: Though a shirt pocket could technically store an eyeglasses case, it may not be the most practical option. Not all shirts have pockets, and if the case is bulky or heavy, it could be uncomfortable for the wearer. Additionally, if the user needs to access their eyeglasses while driving, it would be difficult to reach their shirt pocket and keep their attention on the road. 3. Bag: While a bag could potentially hold an eyeglasses case, it may not be the most convenient method, especially while in traffic. Accessing the eyeglasses case would require rummaging through the bag, which could be distracting and unsafe in a driving situation. 4. Drawer: A drawer is not practical for storing an eyeglasses case while in traffic, as drawers are typically found within static locations like home or office. It cannot be accessed easily or quickly in a vehicle setting. 5. Street: The street is an unsuitable option for storing an eyeglasses case, as it could be lost, stolen, or damaged outside of the car, and it would not be accessible to the person who needs it.

Jackson), a top Chicago Police Department hostage negotiator, is approached by his partner Nate Roenick (Paul Guilfoyle) who warns him that according to an informant (whom he refuses to name), members of their own unit are embezzling large sums of money from the department's disability fund, for which Roman is a board member. When Roman goes to meet with him again he finds Roenick murdered seconds before other police arrive, pinning him as the prime suspect. Things only get worse for Roman when Internal Affairs investigator Terence Niebaum (J. T. Walsh), whom Roenick's informant suspected of involvement in the embezzlement, is assigned to investigate the murder. After the gun that killed Roenick is linked to a case Roman had worked on, Niebaum and other investigators search Roman's house and discover papers for an offshore bank account with a deposit equal to one of the amounts of money embezzled. Roman is made to surrender his gun and badge and his colleagues are doubtful of his protests of innocence. With murder and embezzlement charges pending, Roman storms into Niebaum's office and demands answers about who set him up. When Niebaum stonewalls, Roman takes Niebaum, his administrative assistant Maggie (Siobhan Fallon), police commander Grant Frost (Ron Rifkin), and two-bit con man Rudy Timmons (Paul Giamatti) as hostages. With the building evacuated and placed under siege by his own CPD unit and the FBI, Roman issues his conditions: finding Roenick's informant and summoning police Lt. Chris Sabian (Kevin Spacey), another top negotiator.

Safety: Jordan may have been concerned about the safety of both dogs. Dogs can become territorial or aggressive when encountering unknown dogs, and a conflict or fight may have ensued if he hadn't intervened. 2. Protecting the stray dog: The stray dog might have been frightened, sick, or injured, and Jordan could have controlled his dog to prevent further harm to the stray dog and give it a chance to retreat or seek help. 3. Preventing diseases or parasites: Stray dogs can carry diseases or parasites that could be transmitted to Jordan's dog if they got too close or had physical contact. Controlling his dog would minimize this risk. 4. Legal liability: If Jordan's dog were to injure the stray dog, he could be held legally responsible for damages or medical expenses, even if it took place on his property. By controlling his dog, Jordan mitigated this risk. 5. Preventing unwanted behaviors: Jordan may have wanted to prevent his dog from learning or exhibiting unwanted behaviors, such as chasing or aggression towards other dogs, which can be encouraged by interacting with stray dogs that might display these behaviors themselves.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","output":"Yes, the answer you found on Google is correct, and I can provide a more detailed explanation to help ensure a comprehensive understanding of the origin and evolution of the Latin alphabet. The Latin alphabet, also known as the Roman alphabet, evolved over time through a series of adaptations and modifications of pre-existing writing systems. Its origins can be traced back to the Cumaean alphabet, which is an early variant of the Greek alphabet. The Cumaean alphabet was introduced to the Italian Peninsula by Greek colonists in the 8th century BCE. Cumae, a city located near modern-day Naples, served as the focal point for the spread of the Greek script in the region. The Cumaean alphabet contained 24 letters, which is two more than the standard Greek alphabet of the time. The Etruscans, an advanced civilization in ancient Italy, adopted the Cumaean alphabet and adapted it to suit their language. The Etruscans were influential in the early development of Rome, having ruled over the city for a significant period of time. Consequently, their adapted Cumaean alphabet (the Etruscan alphabet) eventually found its way to the Romans, who further modified the alphabet to suit the Latin language. As the Roman Empire expanded, the Latin alphabet became the dominant script throughout the realm. Over time, it also served as the basis for the modern writing systems of numerous European languages. Today, the Latin alphabet is the most widely used alphabet, comprising the foundation for many global languages, including English, French, German, and Spanish. In summary, the Latin alphabet, or the Roman alphabet, ultimately originated from the Cumaean alphabet, which was a western variant of the Greek alphabet. The Etruscans played a significant role in the evolution of the alphabet, modifying the Cumaean alphabet to suit their needs before passing it on to the Romans. These adaptations led to the development of the Latin alphabet used across the Roman Empire and continued to evolve to form the basis of the alphabets used in many modern languages."},{"instruction":"Translate to German: on behalf of the EFD Group. - Madam President, the problem with this report on the diminishing bee population is that there is a real tragedy here.

Getty \\"Mankind inhabits this Earth subject to geological consent,\\" says Simon Winchester in Newsweek. And, as demonstrated by the earthquake and resulting tsunami that brought Japan to its knees, this consent \\"can be withdrawn at any time.\\" Japan sits \\"at the junction of a web of tectonic-plate boundaries that make it more peculiarly vulnerable to ground-shaking episodes than almost anywhere else.\\" But the disaster there can't be viewed in isolation. When one side of a tectonic plate shifts, \\"the Earth becomes like a great brass bell, which when struck by an enormous hammer blow on one side sets to vibrating and ringing from all over.\\" This can trigger catastrophe on faraway edges of the same great plate, which could be bad news for California. Here, an excerpt: There was a horrifically destructive Pacific earthquake in New Zealand on Feb. 22, and an even more violent magnitude-8.8 event in Chile almost exactly a year before. All three phenomena involved more or less the same family of circum-Pacific fault lines and plate boundaries.... Now there have been catastrophic events at three corners of the Pacific Plate — one in the Northwest, on Friday; one in the Southwest, last month; one in the Southeast, last year. That leaves just one corner unaffected — the Northeast. And the fault line in the northeast of the Pacific Plate is the San Andreas Fault, underpinning the city of San Francisco. ... All know that the San Andreas Fault is due to rupture one day — it last did so in 1906, and strains have built beneath it to a barely tolerable level. To rupture again, with unimaginable consequences for the millions who live above it, some triggering event has to occur. Now three events have occurred that might all be regarded as triggering events. There are in consequence a lot of thoughtful people in the American West who are very nervous indeed — wondering, as they often must do, whether the consent that permits them to inhabit so pleasant a place might be about to be withdrawn, sooner than they have supposed. Read the full article at Newsweek. ||||| Simon Winchester, an author and expert on earthquakes, made a disturbing connection between the epic earthquake and tsunami in Japan and recent devastating quakes in New Zealand and Chile, saying the three events were in three corners of a square in the Pacific some call the “Ring of Fire.” The fourth corner is California and the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Winchester told TODAY‘s Meredith Vieira a massive event along the San Andreas Fault in California is “inevitable.” “It’s becoming abundantly clear that these major earthquakes…tend to occur in clusters,” Winchester said. “A cluster seems to have happened in the last year in the Pacific plate.” Winchester said the even more concerning than a quake along the San Andreas Fault would be an earthquake along the Cascadia Fault, which is underwater along Northern California, Oregon and Washington. A quake there could trigger a tsunami.

In typography, Durer depicts the geometric construction of the Latin alphabet, relying on Italian precedent. However, his construction of the Gothic alphabet is based upon an entirely different modular system. The fourth book completes the progression of the first and second by moving to three-dimensional forms and the construction of polyhedra. Here Durer discusses the five Platonic solids, as well as seven Archimedean semi-regular solids, as well as several of his own invention. In all these, Durer shows the objects as nets. Finally, Durer discusses the Delian Problem and moves on to the 'construzione legittima', a method of depicting a cube in two dimensions through linear perspective. It was in Bologna that Durer was taught (possibly by Luca Pacioli or Bramante) the principles of linear perspective, and evidently became familiar with the 'costruzione legittima' in a written description of these principles found only, at this time, in the unpublished treatise of Piero della Francesca. He was also familiar with the 'abbreviated construction' as described by Alberti and the geometrical construction of shadows, a technique of Leonardo da Vinci. Although Durer made no innovations in these areas, he is notable as the first Northern European to treat matters of visual representation in a scientific way, and with understanding of Euclidean principles. In addition to these geometrical constructions, Durer discusses in this last book of Underweysung der Messung an assortment of mechanisms for drawing in perspective from models and provides woodcut illustrations of these methods that are often reproduced in discussions of perspective.

It does have its perks and offers some convenient features that make downloading torrents and playing media easier. However, there are areas where the app could improve as well. One of the major positive aspects of the FrostWire Android app is its user-friendly interface. Navigating through the app is easy enough, and the search function is quite helpful! I appreciate the ability to search for torrents and access a selection of quality downloads in just a few clicks. Additionally, the app has a built-in media player, which is a great feature for playing videos and music effortlessly. I find this particularly useful, as it saves me from switching between multiple apps. Despite these advantages, the app comes with a few drawbacks. Firstly, I experience occasional crashes, which can be frustrating, especially when I'm in the midst of torrent downloading. It would be great if the developers could iron out these stability issues. Another area that could use some improvement is the inclusion of intrusive ads. I understand that in-app ads are necessary for generating revenue, but sometimes they go overboard and hamper my user experience. It would be great if they could reduce the amount of ads displayed without limiting the app's features. Lastly, one of my concerns is the speed of downloads. Sometimes, it can get incredibly slow, even with a steady internet connection. I don't know if it's because of the app or the torrent sources, but an enhancement in this aspect would be helpful. In conclusion, the FrostWire Android app serves its purpose relatively well and offers some useful features. However, if the developers could address the stability, ad intrusion, and download speed issues, it has the potential to climb up to a more impressive rating. As it stands, I give the app three stars."},{"instruction":"Translate the following sentence to German: Avoid hitting the energy barriers and other nasties as you try to eat all the food.","output":"Vermeide das Berühren der Energieschranken und anderer Übel, während du versuchst, das gesamte Essen zu essen.

Hypothesis: Gattaca is an award winning movie about cloning. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"The premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis outright but provides context to the concept of the film Gattaca and its emphasis on topics pertaining to genetic engineering and the related ethical and moral questions. To further elaborate and understand this, let's break down the premise and the hypothesis. Premise: \\"But if God has taken flight, in Gattaca and elsewhere, at least a few of his imitators are trying to save their souls.\\" This premise suggests that in the world of Gattaca, God's role in natural creation has been taken over by humans who have the capability to manipulate genetics, thus altering the natural order of life. \\"God's imitators\\" may refer to scientists or those involved in the genetic engineering process. The mention of these imitators trying to \\"save their souls\\" hints at the possible moral dilemmas and struggles faced by those who are part of this world, where the line between science and playing God becomes blurred. Hypothesis: \\"Gattaca is an award-winning movie about cloning.\\" The hypothesis refers to Gattaca as an award-winning movie and focuses on the topic of cloning. While the premise does not directly mention cloning, the film does revolve around genetic engineering, and cloning falls under that umbrella. To establish a connection between the premise and hypothesis, it's essential to understand Gattaca's plot and themes. The movie is set in a future society where genetic engineering is the norm, and parents can select their children's traits by manipulating their genes. This leads to a stratified society where those with \\"superior\\" genes enjoy preferential treatment, while those conceived naturally are deemed inferior. The central storyline follows Vincent, a \\"naturally\\" conceived individual, or \\"in-valid,\\" who fights against this system by assuming the identity of a genetically modified individual. The film challenges the idea of determinism imposed by genetic engineering and questions the morality of meddling with human genes for the sake of perfection. Thus, while the hypothesis directly addresses the topic of cloning, both the premise and hypothesis are connected to the broader theme of genetic engineering. The premise highlights the moral and ethical struggles faced by characters in the world of Gattaca, while the hypothesis underscores the film's theme of genetic manipulation, including cloning. Therefore, although the premise does not explicitly entail the hypothesis, the two are related through the overarching context of Gattaca and its focus on genetic engineering and the implications it has on society, individuals, and morality."},{"instruction":"Write an article based on this \\"Germany's Bayer has raised its offer for Monsanto to 65bn (£49bn), or 127.50 a share, in a bid to create a global seeds and pesticides giant.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Bayer Increases Offer for Monsanto to 65 Billion, Aiming to Create Global Agricultural Powerhouse Following a series of negotiations, German pharmaceutical and chemical juggernaut Bayer has upped its bid for American seed and pesticide corporation Monsanto to an astounding 65 billion (£49 billion), equivalent to 127.50 a share. This strategic move serves to establish a worldwide agrochemical empire that could significantly transform agriculture on a global scale. Step 1: Begin with an introduction that outlines the news and its significance The world of agribusiness and crop biotechnology is on the verge of a tectonic shift, as Germany's Bayer announced its higher offer for US-based Monsanto, valuing the company at 65 billion. This announcement comes amidst an increasing wave of consolidation in the agricultural industry, with major players seeking to join forces and capture a greater market share. Bayer's acquisition of Monsanto, if successful, will propel the combined group firmly to the forefront of the global seeds and pesticide business. Step 2: Detail the history of the deal between Bayer and Monsanto In their quest to dominate the international agricultural market, Bayer has upped the ante by increasing its previous offer of 125 per share to 127.50 a share, which represents a total value of 65 billion. This latest development follows months of negotiations, during which time both companies explored the possibility of an all-cash transaction. With this new proposal on the table, Bayer has shown its determination to successfully secure the deal and establish a thriving partnership with Monsanto. Step 3: Explain the implications of the deal for the global agriculture industry The potential merger between Bayer and Monsanto is projected to create an unparalleled seeds and pesticides giant, with an estimated annual revenue exceeding 25 billion. This new enterprise could dramatically transform agricultural practices worldwide, as the combined entity would possess a significant market share and an extensive portfolio of products that include herbicides, insecticides, and genetically modified seeds. This strong position would enable the merged company to exercise considerable influence over agricultural policy and practices, fostering the adoption of new technologies and the implementation of vertically integrated approaches to farming. Step 4: Address potential concerns regarding the merger While the prospect of a unified Bayer-Monsanto powerhouse may seem appealing to investors, there are concerns that such a colossal agribusiness combination could lead to monopolistic practices, reduced competition, and increased prices for farmers. Industry critics argue that the consolidation of the agrochemical market may limit farmers' choice of suppliers and hinder innovation in the sector. It is crucial that regulatory authorities closely examine the implications of this merger, ensuring that it is in line with antitrust regulations and promoting an environment that fosters fairness, transparency, and growth. Step 5: Conclude with a summary and outlook for the future In conclusion, as Bayer raises its offer for Monsanto to an impressive 65 billion, the agricultural landscape is set for a significant metamorphosis. Should the deal come to fruition, the combined entity could reign supreme as a global seeds and pesticides colossus, wielding consequential influence over the future direction of agriculture. The road ahead, however, is laden with uncertainty, as regulatory and public scrutiny will play a vital role in determining the implications of this merger, and ultimately, its success or failure."},{"instruction":"Q:I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal. Can you help me answer a few questions? If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\". Question: Who kidnaps Elizabeth? Movie title: Young Sherlock Holmes Movie plot: The film opens in late 19th century London one evening. A hooded figure raises a blowpipe and shoots a dart into an older businessman named Bentley Bobster (Patrick Newell) outside a restaurant. He shakes the sting off thinking it an insect. After ordering dinner, however, he suffers a terrifying hallucination in which his dinner, a roasted bird, attacks him. He shakes this off, and returns to his third-floor flat. Another hallucination appears, however, leading him to believe that his apartment is on fire. He throws himself out the window and is killed when he hits the ground in an apparent suicide. The credits roll.The scene switches to a boy's school in London were the teenage John Watson (Alan Cox) is a new student at the Brompton Academy. As he moves into the dorm he finds the next bunk over is occupied by the teenage Sherlock Holmes (Nicholas Rowe). The two become friends and Holmes introduces Watson to Professor Waxflatter (Nigel Stock), a retired teacher with rooms and a laboratory in the school's attic. Waxflatter is bit of a mad inventor who is constantly testing a human-powered flying machine. Holmes also introduces Watson to Elizabeth (Sophie Ward), Waxflatter's teenage niece who shares his rooms and has a budding romantic relationship with Holmes.As we follow Holmes and Watson we see them attend a fencing class. The teacher, Professor Rathe (Anthony Higgins), chooses Holmes as his opponent in a demonstration match. Though Holmes does well, Rathe eventually defeats him. Rathe complements Holmes on the match, but warns him that he lets his emotions get the best of him and it leads him to make rash moves and ultimately lose.We see a second attack take place: The hooded figure enters a church and shoots a dart into the sole occupant, the Reverend Duncan Nesbitt (Donald Eccles). The reverend hallucinates that the stained glass figure of a knight jumps from its window and chases him down the aisle. He runs through the front doors and out into the street where he is run over by a horse-drawn carriage... A:","output":"In the movie \\"Young Sherlock Holmes,\\" the person responsible for kidnapping Elizabeth is not explicitly mentioned in the provided plot summary. However, it's reasonable to assume that the main antagonist or one of his henchmen might be behind the kidnapping, as this would create a conflict for the main characters and further drive the plot. From the given plot, it appears that the main antagonist is the hooded figure who has been causing people to hallucinate and ultimately meet their demise. This person utilizes a blowpipe and darts to induce terrifying hallucinations in their victims, which has led to the deaths of Bentley Bobster and the Reverend Duncan Nesbitt. As the movie focuses on the teenage Sherlock Holmes and his new-found friendship with John Watson, it is highly likely that the duo will work together to solve the mystery surrounding these hallucination-induced deaths. The kidnapping of Elizabeth, who has a budding romantic relationship with Holmes and is the niece of Professor Waxflatter, would serve as a strong motivation for both Holmes and Watson to find the kidnapper and uncover his motives. Considering Elizabeth's close relationship with Sherlock Holmes and given that the main antagonist appears to be targeting prominent individuals in society, it is probable that the hooded figure or one of his associates is responsible for her abduction. Holmes and Watson's investigation will likely lead them to unveil the true identity of this hooded figure and their connection to the victims. They will also need to race against time to save Elizabeth and prevent further harm from befalling London. As they delve deeper into the case, the duo may uncover a much wider conspiracy at play, potentially involving some of the other characters like Professor Rathe, who have been introduced in the plot. In conclusion, although the kidnapper of Elizabeth is not explicitly mentioned in the provided plot, the hooded figure or one of his henchmen is the most likely suspect given the overall storyline. The adventures of Young Sherlock Holmes and John Watson as they try to save Elizabeth and uncover the mystery behind the hallucination-inducing darts will propel the film's plot forward, making for an exciting and engaging movie experience."},{"instruction":"Process: - An animal eats a lot of food to fatten up - The animal finds or builds a suitable place to hibernate where they can stay warm and protected - The animal moves into their den - Their heart rate and breathing slow down to conserve energy - They emerge from the den when the weather is warming up again. suppose animal being wakened during hibernation happens, how will it affect HURTING the animal to hibernate properly.

Because Ryan had a lower metabolism than Joel","output":"You see, our bodies are like little engines that help us do things, like running, jumping, and playing. This engine inside our bodies needs something called energy to work and do all these activities. We get this energy from the food we eat. Now, the body engine uses this energy at different speeds for different people. This speed is called metabolism. For Ryan, his metabolism is slower than Joel's. That means that Ryan's body uses up the energy from food more slowly. Imagine Ryan's body as a car that uses up the fuel slowly while driving, while Joel's body as a car that uses the fuel faster. So one day, both Ryan and Joel wanted to have a fun race in the park. They both put on their favorite running shoes and lined up at the starting line. Since Joel's body uses up the energy from food faster, he could run at a slightly quicker pace, giving him a little bit of an advantage in the race. On the other hand, Ryan, with his slower metabolism, might not have as much quick energy and could get tired sooner. As the race started, Joel sprinted ahead, just like a little rabbit! However, Ryan wasn't too far behind. They both ran as fast as they could towards the finish line, surrounded by their friends and family cheering them on. Even though Ryan's body used energy a bit slower, he still gave it his best effort and had a lot of fun racing with his friend Joel. In the end, the important thing was that Ryan and Joel both had a great time during their little race in the park. Both of them felt accomplished and enjoyed themselves, even though they had different body engines, or metabolisms. And the best part was, they both had a yummy snack waiting for them at the finish line to help refuel their engines and get ready for more fun and adventures!"},{"instruction":"Premise: She asked- and just like that, her voice changed.

Her eyes light up with excitement as she talks about the refreshing taste of lemonade on a hot summer day, and how her grandmother used to make it for her when she was a little girl. She peels the lemons carefully, their zesty aroma filling the room as she drops the peels into the compost bin. With a gentle smile, she picks up a citrus juicer and demonstrates the proper technique for extracting every drop of juice from the lemons, ensuring not to press too hard and release the bitter pith. She then pours the freshly squeezed lemon juice into a large glass pitcher, commenting on how the vibrant color always brings life to her kitchen. Next, she picks up a jar of organic stevia leaves, explaining how she prefers this natural alternative to sugar. The scent of mint wafts through the air as she crushes the leaves gently with a mortar and pestle, not only refining their consistency but also releasing their natural sweetness. She carefully scrapes the powdered stevia into the pitcher, keeping an eye on the measurements to create the perfect balance of sweet and sour flavors. She proceeds to share a few fascinating facts about stevia, its origins in South America and how it has been used by indigenous cultures for centuries for its sweetness and medicinal properties. She stresses the importance of sourcing high-quality stevia products, free from additives and artificial ingredients, ensuring the end product is healthy and delicious. The woman turns to the sink and fills the pitcher with cold filtered water, stirring diligently to combine the ingredients. She then adds a handful of ice cubes, clinking as they settle into the golden liquid, and a few sprigs of fresh mint to add an extra layer of depth and freshness to the lemonade. When she is satisfied with the taste and consistency, she holds up the pitcher, turning towards her eager listeners to offer a toast. “To the simple joys of summer, and to the memories we create with the ones we love,” she says with a soft, warm smile. Those who are present raise their glasses, echoing her sentiment, knowing that they have not only learned how to make a delicious and healthy drink but have also been transported back to the carefree days of sunshine and laughter that the woman's story brought to life. As they each take a sip of the sugarless lemonade, the perfect balance of sweet and tangy flavors whisk them away to that very same sun-drenched porch, where the stories of generations blend together like the golden liquid in their hands. And as the taste lingers on their lips, the woman's words become a melody that accompanies that invigorating moment, leaving an indelible mark on each of their hearts and making them grateful for the magic of love and shared memories that simple recipes like this one can preserve forevermore."},{"instruction":"News article: Congressional leaders will head to the White House on Friday to meet with President Barack Obama in what may be the final chance to restart negotiations just a few days before the nation plunges over the fiscal cliff. Neither side is hopeful that there will be a breakthrough on taxes and spending before the new year, and top Republicans considered the Friday meeting to be more about optics than last-ditch horse-trading. (Also on POLITICO: Treasury: U.S. will hit debt ceiling on New Year's Eve) There were several signs Thursday that indicate the president and Congress were eager to escape the backlash from failing to cut a deal. Speaker John Boehner called the House into session for Sunday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said he got a rare call from Obama on Wednesday, and the top leaders from both parties will sit down at the White House on Friday. Whether the Friday meeting will change the solidifying consensus in Washington that no deal will be reached remains to be seen. “Why does this have to happen today?

But Republicans accused Reid and the White House of callously taking the country to the brink without serious bipartisan negotiating, as GOP leaders announced they’d bring the House back to session Sunday evening, perhaps to convince voters they were open to deal making.

For much of his career, Ra led \\"The Arkestra\\", an ensemble with an ever-changing name and flexible line-up. Born and raised in Alabama, Blount eventually became involved in the Chicago jazz scene during the 1940s. He soon abandoned his birth name, taking the name Sun Ra (after Ra, the Egyptian God of the Sun) and developing a complex persona and mythology that would make him a pioneer of Afrofuturism: he claimed he was an alien from Saturn on a mission to preach peace, and throughout his life he consistently denied any ties to his prior identity. Context: In 1934 Blount was offered his first full-time musical job by Ethel Harper--his biology teacher from the high school, who had organized a band to pursue a career as a singer. Blount joined a musicians' trade union and toured with Harper's group through the US Southeast and Midwest. When Harper left the group mid-tour to move to New York (she later was a member of the modestly successful singing group the Ginger Snaps), Blount took over leadership of the group, renaming it the Sonny Blount Orchestra. They continued touring for several months before dissolving as unprofitable. Though the first edition of the Sonny Blount Orchestra was not financially successful, they earned positive notice from fans and other musicians. Blount afterward found steady employment as a musician in Birmingham. Birmingham clubs often featured exotic trappings, such as vivid lighting and murals with tropical or oasis scenes. Some believe these influenced the elements Sun Ra incorporated in his later stage shows. Playing for the big bands gave black musicians a sense of pride and togetherness, and they were highly regarded in the black community. They were expected to be disciplined and presentable, and in the segregated South, black musicians had wide acceptance in white society. They often played for elite white society audiences (though they were typically forbidden from associating with the audience). In 1936, Whatley's intercession led to Blount's being awarded a scholarship at Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University. He was a music education major, studying composition, orchestration, and music theory. He dropped out after a year. Sun Ra soon left college because, he claimed, he had a visionary experience as a college student that had a major, long-term influence on him. In 1936 or 1937, in the midst of deep religious concentration, Sun Ra claimed that a bright light appeared around him, and, as he later said: My whole body changed into something else. I could see through myself. And I went up... I wasn't in human form... I landed on a planet that I identified as Saturn... they teleported me and I was down on [a] stage with them. They wanted to talk with me. They had one little antenna on each ear. A little antenna over each eye. They talked to me. They told me to stop [attending college] because there was going to be great trouble in schools... the world was going into complete chaos... I would speak [through music], and the world would listen. That's what they told me. Sun Ra said that this experience occurred in 1936 or 1937. According to Szwed, the musician's closest associates cannot date the story any earlier than 1952. (Sun Ra also said that the incident happened when he was living in Chicago, where he did not settle until the late 1940s). Sun Ra discussed the vision, with no substantive variation, to the end of his life. His trip to Saturn allegedly occurred a full decade before flying saucers entered public consciousness with the 1947 encounter of Kenneth Arnold. It was earlier than other public accounts: about 15 years before George Adamski wrote about contact with benevolent beings; and almost 20 years before the 1961 case of Barney and Betty Hill, who recounted sinister UFO abductions. Szwed says that, \\"even if this story is revisionist autobiography... Sonny was pulling together several strains of his life. He was both prophesizing his future and explaining his past with a single act of personal mythology.\\" In October 1942 Blount received a selective service notification that he had been drafted into the Military of the United States. He quickly declared himself a conscientious objector, citing religious objections to war and killing, his financial support of his great-aunt Ida, and his chronic hernia. The local draft board rejected his claim. In an appeal to the national draft board, Blount wrote that the lack of black men on the draft appeal board \\"smacks of Hitlerism.\\" Sonny's refusal to join the military deeply embarrassed his family, and many relatives ostracized him. He was eventually approved for alternate service at Civilian Public Service camp in Pennsylvania--but he did not appear at the camp as required on December 8, 1942. Shortly after, he was arrested in Alabama. In court, Blount said that alternate service was unacceptable; he debated the judge on points of law and Biblical interpretation. Though sympathetic, the judge ruled that Blount was violating the law and was at risk for being drafted into the U.S. military. Blount responded that if inducted, he would use military weapons and training to kill the first high-ranking military officer possible. The judge sentenced Blount to jail (pending draft board and CPS rulings), and then said, \\"I've never seen a nigger like you before.\\" Blount replied, \\"No, and you never will again.\\" In January 1943 Blount wrote to the United States Marshals Service from the Walker County, Alabama jail in Jasper. He said he was facing a nervous breakdown from the stress of imprisonment, that he was suicidal, and that he was in constant fear of sexual assault. When his conscientious objector status was reaffirmed in February 1943, he was escorted to Pennsylvania. He did forestry work as assigned during the day and was allowed to play piano at night. Psychiatrists there described him as \\"a psychopathic personality [and] sexually perverted,\\" but also as \\"a well-educated colored intellectual.\\" In March 1943, the draft board reclassified Blount as 4-F because of his hernia, and he returned to Birmingham, embittered and angered. He formed a new band and soon was playing professionally. After his beloved great-aunt Ida died in 1945, Blount felt no reason to stay in Birmingham. He dissolved the band, and moved to Chicago--part of the Second Great Migration, southern African Americans who moved north during and after World War II. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, there are several other interesting aspects about this article. Some of these include: 1. Sun Ra's early life and work in the Chicago jazz scene, where he developed his unique persona and mythology that made him a pioneer of Afrofuturism. 2. The influence of Birmingham clubs' exotic trappings, which possibly shaped Sun Ra's stage shows later in his career. 3. Sun Ra's visionary experience of visiting Saturn and being told by the beings there that he would speak through music, and the world would listen. 4. The discussion about how Sun Ra's Saturn vision might be a form of revisionist autobiography, with Sun Ra connecting various aspects of his life through a single piece of personal mythology. 5. Sun Ra's struggle to declare himself as a conscientious objector during World War II and his experiences in prison and Civilian Public Service camp before being reclassified as 4-F due to his hernia. These aspects showcase Sun Ra's ardent commitment to his beliefs, the evolution of his persona, and the unique experiences that contributed to his life and artistic legacy."},{"instruction":"But this argument no longer seems convincing.

This comprehensive feeling of satisfaction stemmed from various aspects related to the completion of housework. By having a clean and organized house, her living environment was transformed into a space that exuded positive energy, which ultimately led to a boosted mood and increased productivity. One of the essential factors contributing to her feeling of satisfaction was the fact that she could clearly see the results of her hard work and dedication. The tidiest quarters essentially showcased the tangible outcomes of the time and energy invested in cleaning and organizing, which generated a significant sense of accomplishment. This, in turn, made her smile as she could fully appreciate the fruits of her labor. Moreover, her clean house made her day-to-day life less stressful, as living in a well-maintained space reduces anxiety. A tidy living environment allows for easier navigation, efficient completion of daily tasks, and an overall better quality of life. Simply knowing that her living space was clean made her life feel more manageable and productive. Additionally, her satisfaction was heightened by the potential impact of a clean home on other parts of her life, such as academic performance. A clean and organized environment is proven to have positive effects on an individual's mental well-being, which can indirectly lead to improved focus and concentration. Consequently, this may result in a student achieving better grades and experiencing an overall sense of achievement in their academic pursuits. However, it is important to note that housework, if not balanced with other duties and activities, can sometimes lead to a feeling of boredom. The repetitive nature of cleaning and organizing tasks can hinder an individual's motivation to continue working. Nevertheless, in this particular situation, the satisfaction derived from the completion of housework far outweighed any potential boredom. In conclusion, the best answer to describe the positive emotions experienced by the individual who had completed their housework is a sense of satisfaction. This emotion encapsulates various aspects, such as the tangible results of the house being clean, the positive impacts on one's mental health and academic performance, the overall sense of accomplishment, and the mitigated feelings of boredom that might have arisen. Ultimately, seeing the desired results of doing housework left her with a sincere feeling of satisfaction, both in terms of her home's cleanliness and the impact it had on her overall state of well-being."},{"instruction":"Instructions: In this task, based on the given context word, you are asked to create a pair of sentences each containing a blank (_) and their corresponding answer.

Identifying patterns: By evaluating your cash balance at the beginning of each month, you will be able to observe trends in your cash flow, such as peak sales periods or times when expenses are higher. 2. Allocating resources: Regular check-ins on your cash balance will allow you to make more informed decisions about where to allocate resources. If your balance is frequently low, you might cut non-essential expenses, negotiate better payment terms with suppliers, or improve your customer payment collection process to maintain a healthier cash flow. 3. Planning for the future: A consistent understanding of your business's cash flow can help inform your decisions on hiring, marketing, and investing in new equipment or inventory. Knowing when your cash reserves are typically at their highest and lowest will enable you to time these expenses effectively. 4. Maintaining solvency: Gaining a solid grasp of your business's cash flow is vital for ensuring that you always have enough money to meet your financial obligations, such as payroll, rent, and supplier payments. Regularly assessing your cash situation will help you avoid unexpected shortfalls and potential financial crises. 5. Cash flow forecasting: By regularly checking your bank account, you can gather historical data and use it to create forecasts for future cash flow. This can help you anticipate potential issues and make adjustments to your business strategy accordingly. In conclusion, checking your bank account is a key step in managing your business's cash flow, and it helps you make more informed decisions about how to allocate resources and plan for your company's financial future."},{"instruction":"Q:April 1, 2006 Walter died today. Found out this morning over breakfast. Suicide. Walter. I'm still trying to wrap my mind around it. Suicide. Walter wasn't suicidal. I know that, know it for a fact. But he is dead. Why? I am not foolish enough to suspect \\"foul play\\" as they say in the mystery stories. No one cares enough about a community college art teacher to murder him. But suicide? Something is wrong here. Very wrong. April 2, 2006 I didn't realize until this morning that yesterday was April Fools day. Some kind of sick joke? But that's not like Walter either.

I'm afraid of what I might find. April 3, 2006 Went to the funeral today. Walter's wife, Martha, was in hysterics. Can't say I blame her. It was awkward being there seeing someone in the most vulnerable possible condition. I didn't know her that well. Walter and I rarely interacted outside of work, so I have very little knowledge of his personal life. Sylvia went up to her and hugged her even though she'd never met her before in her life. It must be something with women to be able to make that kind of spontaneous connection. I just shook her hand, and told her I was sorry. I don't make a habit of crying in public, but seeing her so shaken up brought tears to the edges of my eyes, and I did nothing to wipe them away.

Horrified (in a bad way), I looked at the shell of the books I once loved as an elementary school child. The original pictures made this collection so unique!

Hypothesis: Hikers are walking up the hill through the brush. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","output":"To evaluate if the hypothesis is true given the premise, we can break the matter into a few elements: 1. Location - According to the premise, the hikers are on a \\"sloping hillside\\". The hypothesis also mentions them being on a hill, which matches the premise. 2. Activity - Both the premise and hypothesis mention the hikers' activity as walking or trekking, which are synonymous in this context. 3.

However, the direction of movement - up the hill - isn't specified in the premise. The premise only mentions a \\"sloping hillside,\\" which doesn't necessarily mean they are going upwards. So, we cannot conclusively say that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true because the premise doesn't specify the direction of the hikers' movement.

Would \\"They have featured prominently in ancient mythology and folklore , and continue to be depicted in modern films and literature.\\" be a reasonable answer? Select from the following. (a). No; (b). Yes; The answer is:","output":"(a). No; The statement \\"They have featured prominently in ancient mythology and folklore, and continue to be depicted in modern films and literature\\" refers to the cultural significance of tigers rather than describing the animals found in their environment. A more appropriate answer would be: In a tiger's environment, various animals can be found. These animals can be potential prey or competitors, and they significantly influence the ecosystem. Some animals typically found in a tiger's environment include: 1. Deer: Deer, such as Sambar and Chital, are a primary food source for tigers. Tigers rely on their keen senses and stalking techniques to ambush these herbivores. 2. Wild boar: This ungulate is another common prey for tigers. Tigers may target wild boars when deer populations are low or scarce. 3. Monkeys: Monkeys, like langurs and macaques, often live in the same forests as tigers. While they typically reside in trees and are not a primary food source for tigers, they may occasionally fall victim to these predators. 4. Elephants and rhinos: Large herbivores like elephants and rhinos share the habitat with tigers. They usually have a neutral relationship; however, tigers have been known to prey on the young or weaker members of these species occasionally. 5. Small mammals and rodents: Tigers may consume smaller mammals like hares, rodents, and porcupines if the opportunity arises or when other prey is scarce. 6. Birds: Some birds, such as peafowls and Junglefowls, can also be found in a tiger's habitat. They play an essential role in maintaining a balanced ecosystem. 7. Reptiles: Reptiles like snakes and lizards are present in tiger habitats, and some even share overlapping territories. However, they usually don't interact with tigers unless threatened or accidentally encountered. 8. Other predators: Competing predators, such as leopards, dholes (Asiatic wild dogs), and sloth bears, share the same environment and prey with tigers. These species may compete for limited resources, and tigers are at the top of the food chain. In conclusion, the animals found in a tiger's environment interact with the apex predator in various ways and are essential to maintaining a balanced ecosystem."},{"instruction":"Question: What is the overwhelming ethnic majority in Nanjing? Is \\"In 1999, 77,394 residents belonged to minority nationalities, among which the vast majority (64,832) were Hui nationalities, contributing 83.76 percent to the minority population.\\" the correct answer?","output":"The quote provided discusses the minority population in Nanjing in 1999; however, it does not address the overarching ethnic majority in the city. The overwhelming ethnic majority in Nanjing is Han Chinese. Han Chinese make up more than 90% of the population in China and are the world's largest ethnic group. Nanjing, being one of the prominent cities in China, reflects this demographic pattern. In the context of the quote provided, it is important to note that the Hui nationality mentioned is one of China's recognized minority ethnic groups, rather than the city's largest ethnic majority. The Hui people are distinct from the Han Chinese, with their own unique culture, language, and religious practices, predominantly adhering to Islam. The quote specifies that in 1999, 83.76% of the minority population in Nanjing were Hui nationalities, highlighting their significance within the city's broader minority communities. In summary, the overwhelming ethnic majority in Nanjing is Han Chinese, not the Hui nationality as the quote might suggest. The 1999 statistics provided refer to the Hui people's role as the dominant minority ethnicity in Nanjing rather than the dominant overall ethnicity."},{"instruction":"В прошлом году от СПИДа умерло сравнительно небольшое число людей – 31 000 [16 000–67 000].

The main character in My Left Foot, based on the real story of cerebral palsy sufferer Christy Brown, can barely move his mouth to speak, but by controlling his left foot, he's able to express himself as an artist and poet. For his moving performance of Brown, Daniel Lewis won his first Academy Award for best actor. Shine (1996) Do you have a talent you're afraid to share with the world? David Helfgott seemed meant from childhood to be \\"one of the truly great pianists,\\" but the pressures of performing (and pleasing his father) resulted in a complete breakdown. Ten years in a mental institution didn't weaken Helfgott's musical gift: When he was rediscovered, he was playing concertos in a bar. Shine received s even Oscar nominations , and Geoffrey Rush won best actor for his performance of Helfgott. Life Is Beautiful (1997) Nothing's more powerful than the love between a parent and a child. In this heartbreaking Italian film, a father (Roberto Benigni) makes an unbelievable sacrifice for his 4-year-old son: trapped in a Nazi concentration camp in 1945, the Jewish man convinces his boy that they are playing a complicated game. He manages to spare him the horror of the terrible war, and even in his final moments of life, keeps his son smiling and hopeful. Benigni won the best actor Oscar.

Option B: The main characters of My Left Foot, Shine, and Life Is Beautiful won Academy Award for Best Actor, but in Stand and Deliver, Edward James Olmos got an Oscar nomination for best actor but did not win. Hence, this option is incorrect. Option C: All the movies indeed tell inspiring stories that make a difference. So, this could be another possible answer. Option D: In My Left Foot, the main character has cerebral palsy. David Helfgott in Shine has a mental breakdown. In Life Is Beautiful, the main character isn't physically sick, but he faces a horrific situation and in Stand and Deliver, Jaime Escalante is not shown as sick. Therefore, this option is incorrect. So, based on the elimination method, the two possible correct answers could be either option A: They are all based on real stories or option C: They are all inspiring stories that make a difference.

Today, more and more travelers in the United States are spending nights at small houses or inns instead of hotels. They get a room for the night and the breakfast the next morning. Rooms for the night in private homes with breakfast have been popular with travelers in Europe for many years. In the past five to ten years, these bedandbreakfast places have become popular in the United States. Many of these America's bedandbreakfast inns are old historic buildings. Some bedandbreakfast inns have only a few rooms. Others are much larger. Some inns do not provide telephones or televisions in the rooms, others do. Staying at a bedandbreakfast inn is much different from staying at a hotel. Usually the cost is much less. Staying at an inn is almost like visiting someone's home.

It was empty apart from the manager. We were told to find ourselves a table, so we sat in an attractive area sort of like a small stage. No waitress came by for 10 minutes, so we decided to visit the restroom; there was just one, with one toilet. But a woman rushed in ahead of us, carrying a bundle of clothes. Several minutes later, when she reappeared, we realized this was our waitress—arriving late and pushing us customers out of the way so she could change. OK… We each used the restroom and returned to our table. But it was not our table anymore. Along came the manager to explain she needed to set aside the stage-like area for a very special group. My daughter and I had already been debating whether to stay or leave. We stayed only because we were very hungry and worried that we’d have to start waiting all over again if we tried a different place. We were led to our new table: a lonely little table in the hall leading to the toilet. I was ready to get out of there, pronto, but my daughter spotted her favorite meal on the menu. But after another 15 minutes, with the lone waitress not appearing, we both shook our heads and got up… Oh, here’s the waitress! We ordered. Fifteen minutes later, no food. We got up again and exited past the stage-like area, which was just as empty as it had been when we were ejected. The very special people had not arrived—so (had we been served) we could have enjoyed our meal right there. We did find food elsewhere. The first place closed in less than a month. Good riddance! Question: What is probably true about the restaraunt manager? === The answer to the above question is","output":"that the restaurant manager was likely inexperienced, disorganized, and unable to manage the restaurant effectively. There are several factors that point towards this conclusion: 1. Lack of staff: The restaurant was empty except for the manager, and the lone waitress arrived late and had to change clothes in the restroom. This indicates poor management, as there should have been enough staff to take care of customers efficiently. 2. Poor customer service: The manager told you to find your own table, and it took 10 minutes for any staff member to even check on you. A well-managed restaurant would have had someone to greet and seat you promptly. 3. Misuse of space: The manager reserved the attractive stage-like area, then asked you to move from your table even though the special group did not show up during your visit. This shows a lack of foresight and poor decision-making, as the table could have accommodated your party. 4. Inability to handle problems: The manager did not offer any apology or solution when it was clear that your experience was less than satisfactory. A competent manager would have acknowledged the issues and tried to rectify the situation in some way. 5. Slow service: It took too long to receive your order even after your late waitress eventually took it. This further indicates poor management and disorganization on the part of the restaurant. 6. Ultimately, the restaurant's closure within a month indicates that these problems were not isolated incidents, but rather symptomatic of larger issues within the establishment. The poor customer experience and management evidently led to its financial failure, pointing towards an overall lack of effective oversight and management by the restaurant manager. In summary, the restaurant manager was probably inexperienced, disorganized, and unable to provide customers with a satisfactory dining experience. The combination of long wait times, inadequate staffing, and poor decision-making contributed to the restaurant's rapid closure."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Here's an example to show how honorable actions create happiness. Say a store clerk fails to charge us for an item.If we keep silent,and profit from the clerk's mistake,we would drive home with a sense of sneaky excitement.Later we might tell our family or friends about our good fortune.On the other hand,if we tell the clerk about the uncharged item,the clerk would be grateful and thank us for our honesty.We would leave the store with a quiet sense of honor that we might never share with another soul.

Make this lower case","output":"Wire shower baskets, corner soap holders, or shower shelves can significantly help maximize small bathroom storage space. These clever storage solutions not only utilize the typically wasted space within the bathroom environment but also provide an efficient and organized approach to maintain a clutter-free area. The primary benefit of wire shower baskets is their relatively low cost and ease of installation. These baskets, usually made of chrome, stainless steel, or brass, can be fitted to the shower wall using suction cups, mounting brackets, or hooks. With a variety of styles and finishes available, they complement most bathroom designs. Corner soap holders, on the other hand, are specifically designed to fit the unused spaces underneath or in the corners of a shower area. As these are made to accommodate bar soaps, they can prevent residue buildup on the shower floor and reduce slippery surfaces. They also come in various materials like ceramic, glass, or stainless steel. Some might prefer to have them permanently fixed onto the wall, while others prefer removable options for easy cleaning. Shower shelves provide the most versatile storage solution among the three mentioned options. These can appear in the form of single shelves or multi-tiered installations that can hold not only soaps but also shampoo and conditioner bottles, razors, and other shower essentials. Many shower shelves are adjustable, which makes them suitable for any bathroom layout. Additionally, they can be mounted using adhesive, suction, or screws, allowing for a seamless and secure fit. Regardless of the chosen storage solution, remember the importance of proper maintenance. Cleaning these units regularly will not only prolong their lifespan but also create a more pleasant shower experience. In conclusion, the use of wire shower baskets, corner soap holders, and shower shelves can greatly maximize small bathroom storage space and prevent clutter in the immediate surroundings. Choosing the right storage solutions will ultimately offer a more organized, tidier, and safer shower experience."},{"instruction":"What is the Sahara, and how do the average temperatures there compare to the ones in the Sonoran Desert?

A maid is typically hired for cleaning a house as their primary responsibility. Maids are professional domestic workers who are employed to manage household tasks, with a focus on keeping the living space clean, organized, and well-maintained. They are skilled in performing various cleaning tasks, such as dusting, sweeping, vacuuming, mopping, and sanitizing surfaces, as well as organizing, decluttering, and tidying up rooms. Although cleaning a house is the primary function of a maid, they can also be responsible for other tasks, such as ironing shirts and trousers (option B). Depending on the agreement with their employer, many maids may undertake laundry tasks, which include washing, drying, folding, and ironing clothes to ensure they are neat and wrinkle-free. Other options also indicate the different aspects of a maid's job, but they can be considered as subtasks of the main responsibility, cleaning the house. Option C, for example, mentions cleaning the house as well, but it's similar to option A. Option E, cleaning the room, falls under general house cleaning duties but is more specific. Option D, maid uniform, is not a responsibility of a maid, but rather an aspect of their professional attire. Many maids wear uniforms to present a tidy, clean, and professional appearance in their workplace. Generally, employers or agencies provide the maid uniform. However, it is not a task or duty a maid is hired for. In summary, the main reason for hiring a maid is to maintain the cleanliness and orderliness of a household.

To find the sum of all the numbers, we can multiply the average by the count of numbers. Sum = Average × Count Sum = 22 × 7 Sum = 154 Step 2: Calculate the sum of the first three numbers The average of the first three numbers is 14. To find the sum of these numbers, we can multiply the average by the count of numbers. Sum_first_three = Average_first_three × Count_first_three Sum_first_three = 14 × 3 Sum_first_three = 42 Step 3: Calculate the sum of the last three numbers The average of the last three numbers is 19.

Significant musical breakthroughs were achieved by the Edge in August 1982 during a two-week period of independent songwriting, while the other band members vacationed and Bono honeymooned with his wife Ali. From September to November, the group recorded War at Windmill Lane Studios. Lillywhite, who had a policy of not working with an artist more than twice, was convinced by the group to return as their producer for a third time. The recording sessions featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham and the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts. For the first time, Mullen agreed to play drums to a click track to keep time. After completing the album, U2 undertook a short tour of Western Europe in December. War's lead single, \\"New Year's Day\\", was released on 1 January 1983. It reached number 10 in the UK and became the group's first hit outside of Europe; in the US, it received extensive radio coverage and peaked at number 53. Resolving their doubts of the October period, U2 released War in February. Critically, the album received favourable reviews, although a few UK reviewers were critical of it. Nonetheless, it was the band's first commercial success, debuting at number one in the UK, while reaching number 12 in the US. War's sincerity and \\"rugged\\" guitar were intentionally at odds with the trendier synthpop of the time. A record on which the band \\"turned pacifism itself into a crusade\\", War was lyrically more political than their first two records, focusing on the physical and emotional effects of warfare. The album included the protest song \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", in which Bono lyrically tried to contrast the events of the 1972 Bloody Sunday shooting with Easter Sunday. Other songs from the record addressed topics such as nuclear proliferation (\\"Seconds\\") and the Polish Solidarity movement (\\"New Year's Day\\"). War was U2's first record to feature...

Article: Once upon a time,the animals decided that they must do something heroic to meet the problems of\\" a new world\\".So they organized a training school. They adopted an activity curriculum consisting of running,climbing,swimming and flying.To make it easier to manage the curriculum,all the animals took all the subjects. The duck was excellent in swimming,in fact,better than his instructor,but he made only passing grades in flying and was very poor in running.Since he was slow in running,he had to stay after school and also drop swimming in order to practice running.This was kept up until his webbed feet were badly worn and he was only average in swimming.But average was acceptable in school,so nobody worried about that except the duck. The rabbit started at the top of the class in running,but had a nervous breakdown because of so much make-up work in swimming. The squirrel was excellent in climbing until he developed frustration in the flying class where his teacher made him start from the ground up instead of from the treetop down.He also developed a \\"Charlie horse\\" and then got a C in climbing and a D in running. The eagle was a problem child and was disciplined severely.In the climbing class he beat all the others to the top of the tree,but insisted on using his own way to get there. At the end of the year,an abnormal eel that could swim very well,and also run,climb and fly a little,had the highest average and was the one who gave a good-bye speech. The prairie dogs stayed out of the school because the administration would not add digging to the curriculum. Question: We can learn from the passage that _ .

This type of ecosystem contains poisonous anemones and many species of shellfish. The sea star's advantage in this ecosystem is that it can Answer:","output":"Step 1: Analyze the question The question asks for the advantage sea stars have in a tide pool ecosystem, considering the presence of poisonous anemones and shellfish species. Step 2: Understand the nature of a tide pool ecosystem A tide pool ecosystem is an environment subjected to both submerged and exposed states due to tidal changes. This alternating condition creates unique challenges and opportunities for the species living within it. Step 3: Consider sea stars' relationship with other species Sea stars are predators that feed on various species, such as mussels, clams, and oysters. Their consumption of these inhabitants makes them involved in the ecosystem as consumers. Step 4: Recognize sea stars' mechanism for dealing with poisonous anemones Sea stars are known to be able to avoid or tolerate contact with poisonous anemones. This adaptation can be considered an advantage in an ecosystem where these creatures coexist. Step 5: Reflect on sea stars' ability to feed on shellfish Sea stars have a unique method of feeding on shellfish. They can open their prey's shells, release digestive enzymes, and consume the flesh inside. This ability to feed on a broad range of shellfish species provides a significant advantage in the tide pool ecosystem. Step 6: Formulate the answer The sea star's advantage in this ecosystem is that it can tolerate or avoid contact with poisonous anemones and effectively feed on a diverse range of shellfish species thanks to its unique method of opening shells and releasing digestive enzymes."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: FINAL EXAM Question 1.

How to smoke in your house without people knowing Open a window or fireplace duct. Before you start smoking, it's very important you give the smoke an exit to escape. Without an open window or duct, the smoke will linger in the room and your health will be at risk.","output":"In addition to opening a window or fireplace duct, there are other precautions you can take to minimize the smell of smoke and reduce the chances of others discovering that you've been smoking inside your house. When smoking near an open window, try to direct the smoke outside by blowing it as close to the window as possible. Using a fan can help with this by creating an airflow that will push the smoke out. Moreover, it's a good idea to close any doors connecting the room you're smoking in to other areas of your home in order to prevent the smell from spreading. You can also light a candle or use odor-neutralizing sprays, such as air fresheners, after smoking to mask the smell. Another helpful tip is to keep a small, sealable container for disposing of cigarette butts and ash, which will prevent these items from contributing to the lingering smell of smoke. To further prevent any odors from lingering, be sure to regularly clean and air out the room you're smoking in by utilizing vacuum cleaners, fabric fresheners, and allowing adequate ventilation through open windows and doors when possible. Finally, always practice caution when smoking in your home to avoid starting a fire. Keep a fire extinguisher close by and ensure that your smoke alarm is functioning properly. It's essential to remember that while these tips can help to minimize the detection of smoking indoors, smoking carries inherent risks to your own health as well as to the health of those around you. The best solution to avoid any negative consequences is to quit smoking altogether or, at the very least, practice responsible smoking habits and respect the boundaries of those who choose not to be exposed to second-hand smoke."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context.

On his trip to Sudan, he attempted to meet with Osama Bin Laden, who was at the time living there, aided by Sudanese political leader Hassan al-Turabi. After the US asked the Qatari government to arrest Mohammed in January 1996, he fled to Afghanistan, where he renewed his alliance with Abdul Rasul Sayyaf. Later that year, he formed a working relationship with Bin Laden, who had settled there. Bin Laden and his colleagues relocated their operations to Afghanistan at this time. Abu Hafs al-Masri/Mohammed Atef, bin Laden's chief of operations, arranged a meeting between bin Laden and Mohammed in Tora Bora sometime in mid-1996, in which Mohammed outlined a plan that would eventually become the quadruple hijackings of 2001. Bin Laden urged Mohammed to become a full-fledged member of Al Qaeda, but he continued to refuse such a commitment until around early 1999, after the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.

Mr. Murdoch said he would be in Australia. But that incident might seem tame once this year’s meeting ends Friday afternoon in Los Angeles. The gathering is expected to be the company’s most contentious in years, with frustrated shareholders taking the microphone to demand accountability after a phone-hacking scandal in Britain that has embarrassed the company. Investors will also have the chance to vote on the company’s board members, including Mr. Murdoch and his sons, James and Lachlan. While the family’s 40 percent stake virtually guarantees they will be re-elected, the chorus of discontent has put the company in an uncustomary defensive position. The most forceful, and potentially most ominous protest is likely to come from Tom Watson, the British Labour Party legislator who has led the investigation into phone-hacking at News Corporation’s British newspaper unit. Mr. Watson, who acquired nonvoting proxy shareholder status to attend the meeting, said he planned to accuse the company of engaging in further criminal wrongdoing involving surveillance techniques that extend beyond the phone hacking. He did not discuss potential evidence. “A lot of institutional investors do not know the scope nor the implications of what’s happening in the U.K.,” Mr. Watson said in a phone interview. “You can delegate power but not responsibility, and Rupert Murdoch for whatever reason has failed to put in corporate governance arrangements that prohibit crimes from being committed.” A News Corporation spokeswoman, Teri Everett, declined to comment. The company has done its part to carefully orchestrate the gathering. For the first time, News Corporation, citing security concerns, has made attendees register and R.S.V.P. before the event. Rather than holding the meeting at its usual venue, the Hudson Theater in New York, it will take place at the 476-seat Darryl F. Zanuck Theater on the gilded Art Deco-style Fox Studios lot near Beverly Hills, Calif. News Corporation said attendance would be similar to previous years and that it was not uncommon for companies to change locations for annual meetings. The Los Angeles venue was chosen because the company’s entertainment division, which makes shows like “Modern Family” and movies like “Avatar,” is a major contributor to its financial growth, News Corporation said. Some shareholders will get up to 15 minutes to speak directly to Mr. Murdoch, according to people who have attended previous meetings. “That can be a pretty long 15 minutes,” said Digby Gilmour, head of telecommunications and media research at C.L.S.A. Australia. Stephen Mayne, a director at the Australian Shareholders’ Association, and the person who presented Mr. Murdoch with the book last year, said he planned to travel from Sydney to attend. A former News Corporation employee and longtime shareholder, Mr. Mayne has attended 12 annual meetings. Mr. Murdoch has in recent years grown increasingly impatient with shareholder speeches, Mr. Mayne said. “I got 40 minutes of back and forth in 1999,” he said, adding: “But he’s gotten a lot tougher as he’s gotten older.” Mr. Mayne’s advice for shareholders standing up to confront Mr. Murdoch? “He’ll shut you down. You’ve got to be quick and polite but firm at the same time.” Any dissent will largely be symbolic. Mr. Murdoch owns nearly 40 percent of voting shares, and 7 percent belong to Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia, who has expressed his support for the board. As many as 30 percent of shareholders are expected to cast votes against Murdoch family members, several analysts estimated. Shareholder activists will dominate the meeting, since large institutional investors do not typically air grievances in such a public forum, analysts said. “There will be a lot of noise, but at the end, not a lot of change,” Mr. Gilmour said. The meetings typically begin with Mr. Murdoch opening the floor to questions, Mr. Mayne said. At the end of the exchanges, he gives a state-of-the-company address. That talk could become a more prominent part of the presentation as Mr. Murdoch lays out the shareholder-friendly actions News Corporation has recently taken, said a Deutsche Bank Securities analyst, Doug Mitchelson. One of them is a 5 billion stock buyback program currently under way, which has countered some investors’ concerns about News Corporation’s decision in July to withdraw its 12 billion bid for the British Sky Broadcasting Group. Chase Carey, chief operating officer, has said he would pursue additional stock buybacks on top of the 5 billion program. “As much as we thought Sky was a good deal, buying back stock is a better deal,” said Michael Nathanson, an analyst at Nomura Securities. Company executives are sure to point out on Friday that even as most media companies struggle, News Corporation shares are up about 14 percent with a 52-week high of 18.35. The stock closed at 17.05 on Thursday. Last year, before the revelations of widespread phone-hacking, Mr. Mayne questioned Mr. Murdoch about allegations of hacking in 2006 involving two News of the World journalists, Clive Goodman and Andy Coulson. “There has been two parliamentary inquiries, which have found no further evidence or any other thing at all,” Mr. Murdoch responded, according to a transcript. “If anything was to come to light, we challenge people to give us evidence, and no one has been able to do so.” In the end, the meeting will most likely give a platform to critics of the company’s corporate governance and not be a referendum on its financial performance. ||||| Tom Watson, the Labour MP who has been a leading figure in parliament's investigation into the News of the World phone-hacking scandal, plans to make dramatic allegations about News Corporation's use of surveillance at the company's annual shareholder meeting. Watson, who sits on the Commons culture, media and sport committee which has investigated the scandal, said he would be giving News Corp's shareholders details of previously undisclosed surveillance methods used by the firm that were technologically quite distinct from the phone hacking carried out by NoW staff. He refused to go into details about the allegations he would be making or to offer any evidence to corroborate them. He said: \\"I want to leave investors in no doubt that News Corporation is not through the worst of this yet and there are more questions for the Murdochs to answer.\\" Watson has flown to Los Angeles to attend the shareholders meeting, which he will gain access to having been given a proxy vote by the US trade union umbrella group, the AFL-CIO. News Corporation is bracing itself for independent shareholders to vote in considerable numbers at the meeting against the reappointment of Rupert Murdoch and his sons, James and Lachlan, in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal. The scale of the protest outside the Murdoch family is expected to be substantially over 20% of independent shareholders, with several expected to raise questions at the meeting at Fox studios. But their protest will not be enough to topple the family, because Rupert Murdoch controls 40% of the voting shares. Nevertheless, before the meeting there were clear signs of tension at the upper levels of News Corp, with particular emphasis on security at the event and worries about what sort of tone the 80-year-old media mogul will strike in front of those who, alongside him, have a stake in the empire he built. Murdoch's opening address is expected to show less of the contrition than in London in July, when he told MPs: \\"This the most humble day of my life.\\" Instead he is expected to strike a more combative tone, although there are worries that this will alienate some investors and outsiders. The language is understood to reflect the sentiments expressed 10 days ago in a stock exchange filing in which News Corp, in response to the growing army of concerned shareholders, accused its critics of having a \\"disproportionate focus on the News of the World matter\\" which was in turn \\"misguided\\". That approach has unsettled some in the company who believe there is a risk that Murdoch's rhetorical defiance will play badly. Murdoch is frustrated that for all the considerable political and legal problems News Corp faces, the company continues to perform well, with operating profits up by 12% by almost 5bn (£3.2bn), after legal costs, helped by the box office success of the film Rio and the continued growth of US TV channels such as Fox News. Set against that is the £20m settlement fund promised to phone-hacking victims. There was an unwelcome reminder of the difficulties in the print sector with a separate announcement that News Corp would cut 150 editorial posts at the loss-making Times and Sunday Times, through compulsory and voluntary redundancies and cuts to casual staff. A critical indicator in LA will be whether more than half of the non-family shareholders will vote against the reappointment of the Murdochs. The family is likely to receive support from the Saudi investor Prince Alwaleed – whose Kingdom Holdings has a further 7% of the voting shares and who is close to James Murdoch. News Corp expects something of a circus at the event, with shareholders and press being bused into the venue - which the company says is aimed to \\"ease the security issues of getting onto a studio lot\\". Watson joins some of the most critical investors, such as Calpers, which manages money for California's public employees. News Corp chose to hold the meeting in LA, rather than New York where the business has its headquarters, in the hope that it would reduce the attendance of critical fund managers. Calpers is particularly unhappy with the two-tier voting structure, – which it calls a \\"corruption of the governance system\\" which means that about a third of News Corp shares have voting rights. The Murdochs control 40% of the votes by owning about 12% of all shares.. In the runup to the meeting, News Corp has had to endure growing speculation about rifts at the top of the company. with the New York Times reporting several disputes between Rupert and his heir apparent James, and even talk that James, the deputy chief operating officer, had briefly considered stepping down. But despite Rupert's advancing years, and the pressure mounting on James as the phone-hacking crisis continues, neither is prepared, nor will they be forced, to step aside as a result of tomorrow's meeting. |||||","output":"News Corporation's annual shareholder meeting is expected to be highly contentious as frustrated shareholders demand accountability after the phone-hacking scandal in Britain.

Besides winning that money for himself, Chester also won 100,000 for a new science lab at his school in the Cleveland suburbs, North Royalton High, and 50,000 for his physics teacher, Richard Nestoff. “This is awesome,” Chester, 18, said in an interview Monday, the day after he accepted the award. The scholarship means he can apply to a bunch of colleges he hadn’t considered before because of their cost, he said: “A ton of possibilities are open. Before, I was worried about graduating with debt, and I don’t have to worry about that now,” he said. The scholarship is the newest award in the family of Breakthrough Prizes, which are meant to celebrate the importance of science and recognize brilliance in the fields of math, biology and physics. Founded three years ago by Silicon Valley giants, including Google’s Sergey Brin and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, the Breakthrough Prize offers awards ranging from 100,000 for promising early-career achievements to 3 million for scientists who have made fundamental discoveries about the world. The Breakthrough Junior Challenge asked young people between ages 13 and 18 to create short videos that communicated a big idea in science. More than 2,000 students from dozens of countries applied. Zuckerberg’s wife and partner in education philanthropy, Priscilla Chan, presented the award to Chester in an Oscar-style presentation that was broadcast live Sunday night on the National Geographic Channel. “With the Breakthrough Prize and Junior Challenge, we want to inspire more young people to study science and math, and pursue careers that change all our lives,” Chan said in a statement. Chester’s film takes on one of the biggest ideas in science, Einstein’s theory of relativity. With cartoonish graphics drawn by hand and props from everyday life, like a bowl of popcorn and a moving minivan, Chester explains what Einstein’s famous theory is all about — and why it means that people traveling close to the speed of light age slowly compared to people on Earth. “This is the kind of thing that we’re exposed to all the time in pop culture and films and science shows on TV, but in the video I use physical demonstrations that anyone can think through to have it make sense,” Chester said in an interview posted online. In an interview with The Washington Post on Monday, Chester said the challenge was a chance for him to marry science and film-making, two of his passions. He plans to major in film in college, and perhaps minor in engineering. “I’ve been making movies for over 10 years now. You wouldn’t believe how much film-making equipment I have in my basement,” he said. “You can make movies about anything. It never gets old, you’re always learning something new, you’re always making something unique.” Chester could have chosen any teacher to benefit from his prize. He chose Nestoff, his A.P. Physics teacher, because he is inspiring. “He’s a great teacher. He’s different than any teacher I’ve had — he’s not really afraid to say anything or do anything as long as it makes class more entertaining and helps teach what he’s teaching,” Chester said. “Every day in physics class, you never know what to expect, and that’s an exciting way to learn science.” Nestoff said Chester is an outstanding student, not just because of his ability to understand complex physics concepts or his impressive ACT scores, but because of the easy way he gets along with — and often helps — his classmates. “Ryan is the perfect person to be involved in something like,” Nestoff said in an interview. “He’s such a well-rounded kid. He’s so pleasant.” Nestoff said Monday morning that he was “still on cloud nine” after the awards ceremony, made surreal by the number of Silicon Valley celebrities and great scientific minds in attendance. He said he isn’t sure what he’ll do with the 50,000 prize. He doesn’t want to just throw it into his retirement fund or buy a car, he said. He wants to do something special — maybe start taking some interesting vacations after spending many summers teaching at various camps. But while the money turns heads, he said, what means more to him is the fact that his student appreciates him. “The fact that he thinks a lot of me, that’s the part that’s very gratifying,” Nestoff said. “Do I deserve it? “I don’t think so. But I’m glad he thinks so.” Emma Brown writes about national education and about people with a stake in schools, including teachers, parents and kids.

Asci usually contain eight ascospores, produced by meiosis followed, in most species, by a mitotic cell division. However, asci in some genera or species can occur in numbers of one (e.g. \\"Monosporascus cannonballus\\"), two, four, or multiples of four. In a few cases, the ascospores can bud off conidia that may fill the asci (e.g. \\"Tympanis\\") with hundreds of conidia, or the ascospores may fragment, e.g. some \\"Cordyceps\\", also filling the asci with smaller cells. Ascospores are nonmotile, usually single celled, but not infrequently may be coenocytic (lacking a septum), and in some cases coenocytic in multiple planes. Mitotic divisions within the developing spores populate each resulting cell in septate ascospores with nuclei. The term ocular chamber, or oculus, refers to the epiplasm (the portion of cytoplasm not used in ascospore formation) that is surrounded by the \\"bourrelet\\" (the thickened tissue near the top of the ascus). - The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) is the set of rules and recommendations dealing with the formal botanical names that are given to plants, fungi and a few other groups of organisms, all those \\"traditionally treated as algae, fungi, or plants\\". It was formerly called the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN); the name was changed at the International Botanical Congress in Melbourne in July 2011 as part of the \\"Melbourne Code\\" which replaces the \\"Vienna Code\\" of 2005. As with previous codes, it took effect as soon as it was ratified by the congress (on Saturday 23 July 2011), but the documentation of the code in its final form was not finished until some time after the congressional meeting. Preliminary wording of some of the articles with the most significant changes has been published in September 2011. - In formal nomenclature. When formally naming a taxon, uncertainty about its taxonomic classification can be problematic. The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, stipulates that \\"species and subdivisions of genera must be assigned to genera, and infraspecific taxa must be assigned to species, because their names are combinations\\", but ranks higher than the genus may be assigned \\"incertae sedis\\". - Dikarya is a subkingdom of Fungi that includes the phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, both of which in general produce dikaryons, may be filamentous or unicellular, but are always without flagella. The Dikarya are most of the so-called \\"higher fungi\\", but also include many anamorphic species that would have been classified as molds in historical literature. Phylogenetically the two phyla regularly group together. In a 1998 publication, Thomas Cavalier-Smith referred to this group as the Neomycota. - Ascomycota is a division or phylum of the kingdom Fungi that, together with the Basidiomycota, form the subkingdom Dikarya. Its members are commonly known as the sac fungi or ascomycetes. They are the largest phylum of Fungi, with over 64,000 species. The defining feature of this fungal group is the \\"ascus\\" (from Greek: (\\"askos\\"), meaning \\"sac\\" or \\"wineskin\\"), a microscopic sexual structure in which nonmotile spores, called ascospores, are formed. However, some species of the Ascomycota are asexual, meaning that they do not have a sexual cycle and thus do not form asci or ascospores. Previously placed in the Deuteromycota along with asexual species from other fungal taxa, asexual (or anamorphic) ascomycetes are now identified and classified based on morphological or physiological similarities to ascus-bearing taxa, and by phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - Basidiomycota is one of two large divisions that, together with the Ascomycota, constitute the subkingdom Dikarya (often referred to as the \\"higher fungi\\") within the kingdom Fungi. - Wine (from Latin \\"vinum\\") is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grapes. These grapes are generally \\"Vitis vinifera,\\" or a hybrid with \\"Vitis labrusca\\" or \\"Vitis rupestris\\". Grapes are fermented without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production. - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Coryneliella is a genus of fungi in the Ascomycota phylum . The relationship of this taxon to other taxa within the class is unknown ( incertae sedis ) , and it has not yet been placed with certainty into any class , order , or family . This is a monotypic genus , containing the single species Coryneliella consimilis . - An ascospore is a spore contained in an ascus or that was produced inside an ascus. This kind of spore is specific to fungi classified as ascomycetes (Ascomycota). What object entity has the relation of 'parent taxon' with the subject 'coryneliella'?

Ms. Gang, a 2001 graduate of New York University, was suddenly faced with a rent increase to 2,900 a month from 1,400, as well as construction noise as the new owners undertook renovations. The need to move, she said, constituted “my own New York sob story, but it was good because it motivated me.” Ms. Gang, 33, is a jazz singer with a standing Wednesday-night gig at the Plaza. She had received an inheritance from her grandparents, and knew it was prudent to spend the money on a home. “My grandparents saved for the express purpose of creating a better quality of life for their children,” she said. “I am remarkably lucky.” Her budget for an apartment, preferably in a prewar walk-up co-op building, topped out at 500,000. Having spent several years in drizzly London, she also wanted a high floor, for the light. “I thought I was the only person crazy enough to enjoy walking up” so many flights, she said. She was in the habit, however, of limiting grocery purchases so she wouldn’t have to carry too much at once. She knew she could get more space for the money in Morningside Heights than in the East Village. The neighborhood felt more adult, too. “The musicians that I know who live on the Upper West Side are much more mature,” she said. “They have families, they have kids, they have strollers, they go shopping at Fairway.” Ms. Gang e-mailed an inquiry to an agent who had a listing for a large studio on the top floor of a co-op on West 109th Street. The price was 425,000; maintenance was in the mid-700s. She was delighted when the agent turned out to be Nina Hennessey of Halstead Property, the wife of a drummer she knew. That studio was already in contract, so Ms. Hennessey showed Ms. Gang another top-floor place — not a walk-up — on the 20th floor of a 1988 condominium tower at the northwest corner of Central Park. The asking price was 469,000; monthly charges were around 800. “The views meant a lot to her,” Ms. Hennessey said. True. But the building was the wrong kind. The neighborhood — with Central Park in one direction and a gas station in another — felt isolated and dull. Ms. Gang realized she did not want to leave the East Village after all: “I walk down the street and see people I know, which is awesome and it made me feel I was part of a community, and I didn’t want to leave that.” Or as Ms. Hennessey put it, “She wasn’t going to feel at home anywhere else.” Now the hunt focused on the slice between 14th and Houston Streets. Many places Ms. Gang saw were in disrepair, but she loved a small studio on East 12th. It was on the top floor of a sixth-floor walk-up, with a pretty brick wall and a beamed ceiling. The listing price was 297,000, with monthly maintenance in the mid 300s. But with inventory low, Ms. Hennessey said, “the little postage stamp of an apartment went to multiple bids.” Ms. Gang’s offer of 306,000 was rejected. The apartment sold for 336,000. Ms. Gang also loved a one-bedroom on the fifth floor of a walk-up on East 11th. The place was listed for 550,000, with monthly maintenance in the high 600s. But if she spent so much money, Ms. Hennessey pointed out, “she wouldn’t have the assets-after-closing picture that is attractive to co-op boards.” In any event, Ms. Gang’s offer of 515,000 was declined. She was disappointed. “That’s what you get when you start looking outside of your price range,” she said. “Don’t do it.” She ignored her own advice when it came to another fifth- and top-floor co-op on East Fourth Street. Two apartments had been beautifully combined into a three-bedroom. “It was an embarrassment of riches,” Ms. Gang said. “I’d never seen anything like it.” She thought the price — 550,000, with maintenance of 700 — was low for the apartment’s size. But the block made the decision for her: she found it unprepossessing, and moved on. Finally, she visited a spacious four-room apartment in a six-story walk-up co-op building on East Second Street. It was on a low floor but had a roof deck, “so I could still walk up if I chose to,” she said. The asking price was 432,000, with monthly maintenance in the low 200s. Ms. Gang decided to go for it, and bought the place for 420,000 in cash. She and her cat, Jezebel, arrived this winter. She is aware of being surrounded by neighbors now that she no longer lives on the top floor. She rents rehearsal space elsewhere, so she doesn’t make noise. Lacking as much light she might like, she treks to the roof every day, even in the cold, for at least some time in the sun. Though her apartment is spacious, it has no closets, and Ms. Gang’s work wardrobe includes floor-length gowns. “When I was looking at apartments with closets,” she said, “that was something I would consider. Could I fit all my dresses?” Now the question is moot. She bought a portable hanging rack. The difference between renting and owning? As an owner, “you will be stopped in the hallway by your neighbors,” she said. “They will say, ‘You want to see how I did mine?’ and invite you into their apartment, which I love.” What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The article tells the story of a jazz singer, Ms. Gang, who faces a rent increase and decides to use her inheritance to buy an apartment in New York City. Despite initially considering Morningside Heights, she realizes she wants to stay in the East Village and focuses her search there. After viewing several apartments and losing out on a couple due to higher bids, she ultimately purchases a spacious four-room apartment in a co-op building on East Second Street for 420,000 in cash. She adjusts to the differences between renting and owning, such as getting to know her neighbors and finding solutions for her lack of closet space."},{"instruction":"Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? exists ,","output":"To determine whether the phrase \\"exists,\\" can be considered as positive or negative, it is crucial to understand the context in which it is being used. Without the necessary context, it is challenging to offer a definitive answer. 1. Positive interpretations: a) Affirmation of existence: If someone is discussing an idea, concept, or object's presence, \\"exists\\" can be seen as a positive statement. For example, if a person is excited about discovering a new species of animal, they might say, \\"It exists!\\" In this context, the phrase confirms the existence of something, which can be highly positive, especially if it previously was unknown or hinted at. b) Validation: This word can have positive connotations when it supports someone's argument or belief. For example, if someone is arguing the existence of a specific support group meeting their needs, saying, \\"it exists,\\" could provide validation and relief. 2. Negative Interpretations: a) Disappointment or regret: If someone notices that an unwanted situation or unfavorable outcome exists, then the phrase can have negative implications. For example, if a person is discussing pollution or any other concerning issue, they might say, \\"Unfortunately, this problem still exists.\\" In this context, the affirmation of existence denotes dissatisfaction or regret towards the current situation. b) Threat or looming danger: \\"Exists\\" could be viewed as negative when it refers to a potential or real danger. For instance, if someone is discussing the presence of a harmful virus or an enemy, saying, \\"It exists,\\" may indicate a sense of danger or foreboding. In conclusion, the phrase \\"exists,\\" on its own cannot be definitively classified as positive or negative. Context is the key to understanding how the statement should be interpreted. When used in a positive situation, it can affirm existence or support an argument. However, when used in a negative scenario, it may highlight disappointment, dissatisfaction, or danger."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

The reviewer expresses disappointment with the lack of Strong's Hebrew and Greek dictionaries in the NIV Bible and shares their intention to return it in favor of the NAS version, which includes the desired features. The review begins by acknowledging a positive aspect of the product, stating that the NIV is a \\"wonderful Bible for better understanding.\\" However, the central issue raised by the reviewer is that they want their children to access the original words in Hebrew and Greek for a comprehensive understanding and truth in the scripture. Unfortunately, the NIV Bible lacks the Strong's dictionaries, having instead Kohlenberger's version, which is not as detailed, according to the reviewer. The dissatisfaction about the lack of detail in the included dictionaries overshadows any positive points made earlier in the review, leading the reviewer to decide to send the Bible back and purchase a different edition: the NAS (most literal translation) with Strong's Hebrew and Greek Keyword dictionaries. Overall, while there is some praise for the NIV's better understanding, the primary focus of the review is on the disappointment experienced due to the absence of Strong's dictionaries. The fact that the reviewer plans to return the product and purchase a different version demonstrates that their dissatisfaction is significant, ultimately creating an unflattering portrayal of the product."},{"instruction":"Which is an appropriate title for this article?

Choices: - 0 - 4 - 6 - 2 A: A:","output":"Arachnids are a class of joint-legged invertebrate animals, known as Arthropods, which also include other well-known groups such as insects and crustaceans. Some of the most common arachnids include spiders, scorpions, ticks, and mites. Arachnids are characterized by having two main body parts: the cephalothorax (front part) and the abdomen (back part). In total, arachnids have four pairs of legs, which equals to eight legs in total. These legs are attached to their cephalothorax. However, apart from these four pairs of legs, arachnids also possess additional pairs of appendages, which are designed to serve different functions. The two additional pairs of appendages in arachnids are the pedipalps and the chelicerae: 1. Pedipalps: The pedipalps are the first pair of appendages and are located near the head of the arachnid. They function as sensory organs and can also be used to manipulate food or, in some cases, as an additional pair of legs. In male spiders, the pedipalps are modified to transfer sperm to the female during reproduction. 2. Chelicerae: The chelicerae are the second pair of appendages and are usually in the form of pincers or fangs. They are primarily used for feeding purposes. In spiders, the chelicerae contain venom glands, which deliver venom to their prey through their fangs. Given these characteristics of arachnids, we can conclude that they have two additional pairs of appendages, apart from their four pairs of legs.

Though he lay there helpless, still she found him an awesome figure, like a fallen cathedral tower. Only two other men are as tall, she thought. Amalric and Orlando. She felt a pang of guilt. How could she be thinking about the troubadour here where her royal master lay slowly dying? She fixed her eyes on Louis, and on the ivory and wood crucifix that rose and fell on his chest with his labored breathing. Nicolette felt as if she, too, could hardly breathe. Across the crowded room a fire roared in a huge stone-lined fireplace. The air was stifling. She resented all that made it so, down to the woolen draperies and wall hangings and the thick carpets that sealed in the heat. But she knew that this northern chateau, Pontoise-les-Noyons, a day's ride from Paris, had had to be built to withstand cold, its walls thick and its windows tiny ? so totally unlike the bright, airy Languedoc manor she had grown up in. Sweat trickled down her brow and stung her eyes. Her breath was coming in little gasps. She felt as if she would faint if she couldn't go outside soon. Dozens of people, the King's family and courtiers, had packed themselves uselessly into the room, making it even more suffocating. Their whispers, like the buzzing of mosquitoes, irritated Nicolette. Almost all of them, she was sure, worried more about their own welfare than about the King's. And even Louis's wife and mother, though they grieved for him, were too distracted to do much to alleviate his suffering. She saw the King's lips quiver, and quickly she bent close to him. Any last words could be terribly important. \\"Jerusalem,\\" he mumbled. \\"Towers - golden. Gates of pearl. Crystal waters.\\" Then he panted heavily. \\"Hush, sire,\\" she whispered. \\"Rest easy.\\" Question: Nicolette bent close to the King: Options: A. not enough information B.

When he plays with the children, he sometimes uses his paws to attack them, but he doesn't try to hurt them with his claws. Dillon is a great cat but he has one problem: he likes to eat bread. The family only feeds him cat food, never human food like steak or potatoes. But the cat likes the smell of bread so much that he tries to find it everywhere he can. Dillon jumps up on the kitchen table when a sandwich is there, and tries to carry it away. He finds loaves of bread from the store on the floor and claws through the wrappers. The cat climbs into the bread cupboard looking for hot dog and hamburger buns. The family tries to make Dillon stop getting into the bread by spraying him with water when he goes after bread. They yell at him when he walks on the table. But Dillon does not listen. The kitty keeps trying to find bread to eat. The family thinks that the man who took care of Dillon when he was a very young kitten must have been a baker or cook, and that's why Dillon likes the smell and taste of bread so much!

The use of the phrase \\"I don't understand\\" indicates that the user is expressing confusion or a lack of comprehension regarding the phenomenon of paparazzi and the frenzy that can accompany celebrity appearances. They may find it difficult to relate to the excitement or the measures people take to get a glimpse or photograph of famous individuals like Peter Facinelli, an actor known for his roles in the Twilight saga and other projects. The negative sentiment may be derived from the underlying tone, where the user appears to critique or question the societal value placed on the paparazzi culture. It showcases the user's disapproval or dissatisfaction with the behavior of both paparazzi and the people who contribute to the \\"crazy crowds\\" around celebrities. This could also reflect the user's concern for the privacy and personal space of the celebrities who must endure such attention, which may be implied by using the hashtag \\"#peterfacinelli,\\" a specific example in this context. Moreover, the use of the adjective \\"crazy\\" to describe the crowds may convey the user's disapproval or shock at the way people behave in such situations. The term could be interpreted as a mild criticism, emphasizing the insanity or irrationality involved in chasing after celebrities, regardless of whether the user is a fan of Peter Facinelli or not. In summary, the sentiment of this tweet can be described as a mixture of confusion, perplexity, and mild negativity towards the paparazzi culture and the overenthusiastic behavior of crowds when it comes to celebrities, exemplified by the reference to actor Peter Facinelli."},{"instruction":"Write a dialog about anything you want","output":"In order to write a dialogue, I will first choose a topic that is relevant and interesting for the reader. For this dialogue, I will focus on the subject of technology and how it has impacted our lives. The main characters in the conversation will be two friends, Anna and Ben, who are discussing their opinions on the increasing use of smartphones and social media. This topic has the potential for differing opinions, which will make the dialogue engaging for the reader. Step 1: Establish setting and introduce characters I will set the scene in a cozy café, during their weekend catch-up session. This creates a casual and relatable environment for the conversation to take place. Anna and Ben are old friends who do not see each other in person too often due to their busy schedules. However, they keep in touch through social media and messaging apps. Step 2: Initiate conversation I will begin the conversation with Anna expressing her concern about people's dependence on technology, particularly smartphones and social media, and how it is affecting their ability to have genuine human connections. Anna: You know, Ben, lately I've been noticing how much everyone is glued to their phones. I sometimes worry that we are losing our ability to truly connect with each other on a deeper level. Step 3: Present an opposing view Ben will respond by acknowledging Anna's concern but offering his perspective on the positive aspects of technology and how it allows people to stay connected even when they are physically apart. Ben: I understand your concern, Anna, but I also think there are many ways in which technology has actually brought us closer together. For instance, without smartphones and social media, I wouldn't be able to keep in touch with you or our other friends who live far away. Step 4: Continue the conversation with additional points The dialogue will continue with Anna and Ben discussing their views in more detail, providing examples from their personal lives and popular culture. Their conversation will be easygoing, yet informative. Anna: Yeah, that's true. It definitely has its advantages. But what about when we're together like this, in person? I feel like when people constantly check their phones, they miss out on the present moment. Remember last week when that woman walked into the lamppost while texting? Ben: *laughs* Yeah, that was pretty funny, but I get your point. It's all about finding the right balance between using technology as a tool and not letting it consume our lives. I think the key is to be conscious of how much time we spend on our phones and make an effort to engage with others in person when we have the opportunity. Step 5: Wrapping up the dialogue Lastly, I will have Anna and Ben come to a mutual understanding that technology, while it has its drawbacks, can be a useful tool when used in moderation. They both appreciate the convenience and connection it provides while agreeing to be mindful of maintaining individual boundaries and cultivating genuine connections with others. Anna: Absolutely, Ben. It's important for us to be aware of our habits and prioritize in-person interactions. Technology is amazing, but it should never replace the real connections we have with each other. Ben: Agreed. So, let's put our phones away and enjoy our coffee and conversation! Overall, this dialogue discusses the impact of technology on our lives in a lighthearted yet thought-provoking manner, showcasing both the pros and cons of our reliance on technology and promoting a balanced approach to its use."},{"instruction":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Memory is the ability to keep track of things that have happened in the past. Memory really is learning. One needs memory to ride a bicycle. A dog needs to remember if it is to come when called. Memory is said to be stored in the brain as a \\"memory trace .\\" What makes up this trace is not known. Some scientists believe that certain chemical substances may carry certain memories. For example, one substance, when given to rats, causes them to fear the dark. Other research into memory has to do with how the brain works. Psychologists use three means to find out how a person remembers. For example, give a person a grocery list. Let the person memorize the list, then put it away. The most natural way to find out how much a person remembers of the grocery list is to ask what he or she remembers. This is called the method of recall. Another method is called recognition. Give the person another grocery list. Ask him or her to choose items on the first list from the items that are on only the second list. Often a person will be able to recognize things that he or she cannot recall. A third method of finding how much a person remembers is called relearning. Here the person is asked to read over the first list. The person will probably learn the list the second time faster than he did the first time. The difference in the time it takes to relearn the list is thought of as a measure of how much a person has remembered. One way of remembering something is to repeat it many times. Interest is very important. Boring lists of facts are much more difficult to remember than something that we understand and are interested in. Motivation, or wanting to do something, is also important. Motivation is linked with reward. For example, a hungry animal quickly learns how to do something if that action gets the animal food. In humans, wanting to learn is often motivation. The praise of a teacher or the knowledge that an answer is correct is rewarding. A:","output":"What is the primary focus of the article?

Context: Greg Tenorly drove the familiar route from the church to his music studio, studying the homes along the way. He wondered about the families who lived in each one. Like that two-story brick on the corner. What secrets were they hiding? Was the husband abusive? Did a teenager use drugs? Was the family nearly bankrupt? How could anyone know? It was better not to know. The mind can only handle so many problems at one time. He wondered where Troy and Cynthia Blockerman lived. Greg had appeared at the courthouse that morning as part of a jury pool, only to be released. He and the rest of his group would have to return the next morning. He hoped they would not need him. The church would pay his regular part-time salary while he was serving on a jury, but any private lessons he missed would be money lost. Greg's red 1965 Pontiac Bonneville convertible always turned heads as he drove through the small town. He had purchased it two months earlier from a career Navy man down in Longview who had babied the thing for years. It spent most of its life in the man's garage, coming out only when he was on leave. Most trips were to the car wash or the Pontiac dealer for scheduled maintenance. Greg gladly paid 4,000 for it. The sailor called him the very next day and tried to buy it back. He said it was like losing a member of the family. Greg felt bad, but not bad enough to give up the car. How could a 40-year-old car have only 93,000 miles on it? It was dazzling. His little studio was near the town square, nestled between Coreyville Hardware and Susie's Sewing Box. Occasionally he and a student could hear a pipe wrench or hammer hitting the floor on the hardware side. But things were always quiet from Susie's side. At least the soundproofing he had installed kept his neighbors from hearing his students. You can't teach music without hearing both beautiful sounds and sour notes. Question: Why Greg's car turned heads? Options: - It made a lot of noise - It was new - not enough information - It was a convertible Answer:","output":"Greg's car turned heads because it was a distinctive 1965 Pontiac Bonneville convertible. Not only was it a classic model, but it also had a unique history and had been meticulously maintained, resulting in dazzling appearance. Moreover, it's not common to see such a well-preserved and older model vehicle on the road, making it stand out from more common, contemporary cars. Additionally, convertibles themselves are often seen as unique or luxurious, which could also attract attention. So, while the fact that it was a convertible might contribute to people noticing it, the main reasons people turned their heads were its unique vintage nature and excellent condition."},{"instruction":"What's the most logical way to complete this passage?

As someone who had been eagerly looking forward to her preferred meal, this was a big disappointment for her. Additionally, Angela has some food sensitivities which caused her to scrutinize the menu very carefully, trying to find a dish that would both suit her taste buds and not cause any digestive discomfort. Her search proved to be quite challenging, and she eventually settled on a meal that, while being suitable for her dietary restrictions, was not something she truly enjoyed. The delicious aroma of Monica's meal only exacerbated Angela's dissatisfaction with her own choice. As the evening progressed, Angela also had some bad luck with the service. Her food arrived later than everyone else's, making her wait while the rest of the group had already started enjoying their meals. Furthermore, her beverage order was forgotten and had to be placed again, causing further delays.

In the midst of all of this, Angela found herself seated next to a rather boisterous and loud group of patrons who seemed to be having a great time. Their excessive laughter and chatter made it difficult for her to engage in conversation with her friends, and as the evening wore on, she began to experience a headache. This only served to further detract from her enjoyment of the night.

Caesar follows him to Egypt, under the pretext of being named the executor of the will of their father, Ptolemy XII. Much to his dismay, Caesar is given Pompey's head as a gift, as the highly manipulated pharaoh was convinced by his chief eunuch Pothinus (Gregoire Aslan) that this act would endear him to Caesar. As Caesar stays in one of the palaces, a slave named Apollodorus (Cesare Danova) brings him a gift. When the suspicious Caesar unrolls the rug, he finds Cleopatra herself concealed within. He is intrigued with the her beauty and warm personality, and she convinces him to restore her throne from her younger brother. Soon after, Cleopatra warns Caesar that her brother has surrounded the palace with his soldiers and that he is vastly outnumbered. Counterattacking, he orders the Egyptian fleet burned so he can gain control of the harbor. The fire spreads to the city, destroying the famous Library of Alexandria. Cleopatra angrily confronts Caesar, but he refuses to pull troops away from the fight with Ptolemy's forces to quell the fire. In the middle of their spat, Caesar forcefully kisses her. The Romans hold, and the armies of Mithridates arrive on Egyptian soil, causing Ptolemy's offensive to collapse. The following day, Caesar is in effective control of the kingdom.

The eastern region was exposed to a wet climate and had thriving vegetation, while the western region was exposed to drought. Which region had fewer plants with an ability to come up with a sort of strategy to minimize water loss? Hint: One interesting thing that has been found in plants that are consistently exposed to drought, is their ability to form a sort of \\"memory\\". In a study by Tombesi et al., they found plants who had previously been exposed to drought were able to come up with a sort of strategy to minimize water loss and decrease water use. They found that plants who were exposed to drought conditions actually changed they way the regulated their stomates and what they called \\"hydraulic safety margin\\" so as to decrease the venerability of the plant. By changing the regulation of stomata and subsequently the transpiration, plants were able to function better in situations where the availability of water decreased. Answer:","output":"The western region of Austria was exposed to drought and therefore had fewer plants that needed to develop strategies to minimize water loss. The reason for this is that in areas consistently exposed to drought conditions, plants must adapt to survive the harsh environment, or else they would not be able to thrive and reproduce. As a result, plants in the western region have evolved various mechanisms to cope with the lack of water, allowing them to preserve water and use it more efficiently. As mentioned in the study by Tombesi et al., one interesting adaptation found in plants exposed to drought is their ability to form a sort of \\"memory\\". This study showed that plants that had previously been exposed to drought were better equipped to handle water scarcity, as they developed strategies to minimize water loss and decrease water use. These plants were able to change the way they regulated their stomata (the tiny pores on the surface of leaves, which control the exchange of gases and water vapor between the plant and the environment) and adjusted their \\"hydraulic safety margin\\" to decrease the vulnerability of the plant. By altering the regulation of stomata, these plants from the western region of Austria were able to control the rate of transpiration (the process by which plants lose water through their stomata as water vapor). This adaptation allowed them to conserve water when it was scarce, reducing the amount of water lost through transpiration and thus functioning better in drought conditions. Additionally, plants in the western region may have developed other drought-resistant adaptations, such as: 1. Developing deep or extensive root systems, allowing them to access water stored deeper in the soil. 2. Producing fewer leaves or smaller leaves, which reduces the amount of water lost through transpiration. 3. Storing water in their tissues, allowing them to endure periods of drought without wilting. 4. Adopting a slower rate of growth, which conserves energy and resources in the face of water scarcity. In contrast, the eastern region of Austria, which was exposed to a wet climate, had thriving vegetation that did not need to develop such strategies to minimize water loss. The plants in the eastern region would have had access to ample water resources, making the need for drought-resistant adaptations unnecessary. In conclusion, the western region of Austria, which was exposed to drought, had fewer plants that needed to develop strategies to minimize water loss. These plants adapted to their harsh environment by regulating their stomata more effectively and adjusting their hydraulic safety margins, as well as potentially developing other drought-resistant traits. This allowed them to function better in situations where water availability was limited, ensuring their survival in a challenging climate."},{"instruction":"I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

They called themselves the Exiles. Those original Richmond Exiles were Jimmy Stokley, Ronnie 'Mack' Davenport, Paul Smith, Mike Howard, Billy Luxon, J.P. Pennington, and Buzz Cornelison. Richmond native Danny Williams was also a member in the 1960s. Their chosen name may have resulted from the influx of Cubans into the United States after the Fidel Castro takeover in 1959. According to original Exile Pennington, \\"There were a lot of Cuban exiles coming across...the word was in the news and we felt we were also somewhat ostracized from the local society. We had long hair back then...\\" Most of the Exiles were students at Madison Central and Madison High School in Richmond when the band formed and played together from 1963 to 1965. They were an offshoot of Ronnie (Hall) and the Fascinations. They were briefly known in those early years as Jimmy Stokley and the Exiles. Stokley (18 October 1943 - 13 August 1985) was the lead singer of the group and continued in that capacity until 1979.

Article: Have you seen a historical film recently? Do you think it was accurate? Some say that there is no such thing as a historical film. In many cases, Hollywood film-makers simply change the facts. Just look at these supposedly \\"historical\\" films. 1. The Patriot The film was released in 2000 and was directed by Ronald Emmerish and starred Mel Gibson. It is set near Charleston, South Carolina, during the American Revolutionary War(1775--1783) and follows the story of Benjamin Martin and his fight for American freedom against the British. The film was criticized for inventing and exaggerating British cruelty. The most criticized scene was one showing the burning of a church containing people of the town, of which there is no historical record. Another historical inaccuracy was the description of American-owned slaves being freed to serve with the American forces. In reality, many slaves ran away from their American owners and fought with the British against the Americans. 2. Brave Heart The film(1995) starred Mel Gibson was directed by Toby Reisz. It is based on the life of Scottish national hero William Wallace and his fight against English rule in Scotland during the 13th century. The film includes an affair between William Wallace and Princess Isabella (based on Isabella of France). The film implies she is a mother-to-be when William Wallace will be killed. However, historically, the real Isabella was a child of nine still living in France at this time, never having met Wallace. The film also caused controversy because of its anti-English nature. Apparently, when the film was shown in Glasgow, there was a loud noise made by happy American audience. 3. U-571 This 2000 film was directed by Jonathan Mostow and starred Mathew MacConaughey, Havey Keitel and Jon Bon Jovi. It took place during the Second World War(1939--1945).

James Watt (30 January 1736 (19 January 1736 OS) - 25 August 1819) was a Scottish inventor, mechanical engineer, and chemist who improved on Thomas Newcomen's 1712 Newcomen steam engine with his Watt steam engine in 1781, which was fundamental to the changes brought by the Industrial Revolution in both his native Great Britain and the rest of the world. While working as an instrument maker at the University of Glasgow, Watt became interested in the technology of steam engines. He realised that contemporary engine designs wasted a great deal of energy by repeatedly cooling and reheating the cylinder. Watt introduced a design enhancement, the separate condenser, which avoided this waste of energy and radically improved the power, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of steam engines. From an early age Watt was very interested in chemistry. In late 1786, while in Paris, he witnessed an experiment by Berthollet in which he reacted hydrochloric acid with manganese dioxide to produce chlorine. He had already found that an aqueous solution of chlorine could bleach textiles, and had published his findings, which aroused great interest among many potential rivals. When Watt returned to Britain, he began experiments along these lines with hopes of finding a commercially viable process. He discovered that a mixture of salt, manganese dioxide and sulphuric acid could produce chlorine, which Watt believed might be a cheaper method. He passed the chlorine into a weak solution of alkali, and obtained a turbid solution that appeared to have good bleaching properties. He soon communicated these results to James McGrigor, his father-in-law, who was a bleacher in Glasgow. Otherwise he tried to keep his method a secret. With McGrigor and his wife Annie, he started to scale up the process, and in March 1788, McGrigor was able to bleach 1500 yards of cloth to his satisfaction. About this time Berthollet discovered the salt and sulphuric acid process, and published it so it became public knowledge. Many others began to experiment with improving the process, which still had many shortcomings, not the least of which was the problem of transporting the liquid product. Watt's rivals soon overtook him in developing the process, and he dropped out of the race. It was not until 1799, when Charles Tennant patented a process for producing solid bleaching powder (calcium hypochlorite) that it became a commercial success. By 1794 Watt had been chosen by Thomas Beddoes to manufacture apparatus to produce, clean and store gases for use in the new Pneumatic Institution at Hotwells in Bristol.

Abdullah M. Alsaidi Translate to English","output":"The name \\"M. Abdullah M. Alsaidi\\" is already written in English, as it uses the English alphabet. However, I understand that you may want to know more about the meaning of this name. In this context, this name belongs to a person of Arabic origin and can be broken down into the following parts: 1. M. - It is an abbreviation for a first name, most likely Muhammad or any other name starting with the letter M. In Arabic culture, it is common for people to abbreviate their first name by using only its first letter, especially if their name is a common one. 2. Abdullah - This is a popular Arabic name that means \\"servant of God.\\" It is derived from the words \\"Abd\\" (servant) and \\"Allah\\" (God). It signifies that the person is devoted to God and follows His will. This name has significant religious connotations, as Abdullah was also the name of Prophet Muhammad's father. 3. M. - Similar to the first M, this is also an abbreviation for a middle name, potentially another name starting with the letter M. Middle names in Arabic culture are often patronymic, meaning they're inherited from the person's father or grandfather. In this case, it is possible that the middle name continues with the naming tradition and is also a religious or popular Arabic name. 4. Alsaidi - This is the person's family name or surname, which indicates their ancestry or lineage. \\"Alsaidi\\" is a common surname in the Arab world, particularly in countries such as Yemen and Saudi Arabia. The name \\"Alsaidi\\" implies that the person belongs to the Saidi tribe or has ancestors from the Saidi region. So, when translated into its constituent parts and their meanings, the name \\"M. Abdullah M. Alsaidi\\" refers to a person named Muhammad (or another name starting with M) who is a servant of God, with a middle name that could be another religious or popular Arabic name, and belongs to the Alsaidi family or tribe.

A senior administration official told CNN that no decision has been made yet as to whether to release the photo. \\"I just think it's important, they know we have it, to release it,\\" Panetta said. He did not know when the photograph might be made public. Two Democratic senators, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Tuesday night they expected a photograph to be released shortly, but they did not have an exact time frame either. An image of bin Laden's body could help to convince doubters about his death, but it could also inflame passions against the United States. U.S. officials have said they are weighing the appropriateness of such a release. According to a senior U.S. official, the White House has received three sets of photographs. The first batch, which clearly show bin Laden's body, was taken at a hangar in Afghanistan, the official said. The official described one of the images as a clear, but gruesome, picture of his face. Bin Laden is shown with a massive open head wound across both eyes, the official said, adding that the image would not be appropriate for the front pages of newspapers. The other photos include the raid on the compound and bin Laden's burial at sea, according to the official. Tuesday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said she saw no need to release an image since there is other evidence to prove bin Laden is dead. \\"I just don't see a need to do it,\\" she said. \\"The DNA has been dispositive.\\" But Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Joe Lieberman said it may be necessary to release an image to erase any doubts. \\"I've said unless al Qaeda acknowledged that bin Laden was dead, it was important for the United States to release pictures of his body to confirm he is dead,\\" he said Tuesday. CNN's Jessica Yellin, Ted Barrett and Ed Hornick contributed to this report. ||||| The White House says it has photos of the dead Osama bin Laden and they’re “gruesome.” That raises a question in America’s newsrooms: To publish or not to publish when the pictures are released? Short answer: It all depends on your definition of “gruesome.” The potential release of photographs documenting the U.S. raid on bin Laden’s Pakistani hideout presents the news media — at least the so-called mainstream media — with a historic dilemma. The images are the very definition of news, but they’re also likely to be horrifyingly graphic, the sort of thing that American newspapers and television networks avoid showing their readers and viewers. White House press secretary Jay Carney said Tuesday that administration officials are still debating whether to make public any of the photos and video taken by U.S. military forces during and after the raid early Sunday. The image cache includes grisly shots of bin Laden, who reportedly suffered massive facial and skull wounds above his left eye from gunshots fired by American commandos. Carney said officials are concerned about the “sensitivity” of releasing such photos because of their disturbing nature and because they could inflame anti-American sentiment around the world. But officials are also eager to rebut skepticism among bin Laden’s supporters and sympathizers that reports of his death are part of an American disinformation campaign and that he is still alive. People in the news media are faced with a related, if somewhat different, issue: Would such obviously newsworthy pictures be so revolting that they’d create a wave of complaints? “Obviously, I can’t say whether or how we will run a photo we haven’t even seen,” said Bill Keller, editor of the New York Times. He added: “We generally avoid pictures that are gra­tui­tous­ly ghastly. But the key word is ‘gratuitously,’ meaning the images, besides being disturbing, don’t have significant journalistic value. Pictures of Osama bin Laden dead certainly have significant journalistic value.” Associated Press director of photography Santiago Lyon said his organization would screen the material before distributing it to news outlets and would alert them to any “particularly graphic images” beforehand so they can make their own calls. Most news organizations that subscribe to AP do their own screening, he said, but some have feeds that automatically publish online AP-distributed work. CNN evaluates each image it broadcasts or publishes online but has no general policy about the use of grisly content, Washington producer Sam Feist said. In 2006, for example, the network showed the battered faces of Saddam Hussein’s dead sons, Uday and Qusay. The rationale parallels the argument in favor of running pictures of bin Laden’s body: The photos provided direct evidence that the Husseins had actually been killed, he said. In any event: “We’d prepare the audience [before showing them something graphic]. . . . We know that some of these images do make people uncomfortable.” “It sounds old-fashioned, but we are a family newspaper,” said Liz Spayd, The Washington Post’s managing editor. “We are mindful that people’s children see the paper, and we don’t want to publish anything gratuitously. At the same time, we don’t want to hide what’s happening.” Short of airing a close-up picture, ABC News might elect to show one that indicated the dead man was bin Laden, such as a photo taken from a distance, spokesman Jeffrey Schneider said. As a general rule, American media organizations shy away from presenting images of death, especially the violent kind. Even in war zones or after natural disasters where thousands may have died, news pictures tend to emphasize destruction and the suffering of the living rather than corpses. The violent deaths of newsworthy individuals, however, sometimes create exceptions. The New York Times, The Post and other newspapers ran photos of Saddam Hussein’s body after he was executed in Iraq in late 2006. The bloodied face of Iraqi terrorist Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi was broadcast around the world after he was killed by a U.S. airstrike in the same year. And pictures of people leaping from the burning World Trade Center towers on Sept. 11, 2001, were widespread. But the deaths of Americans are usually a different story, says Fred Ritchin, a professor of photography and imaging at New York University. It’s exceptionally rare to see the body of a U.S. soldier, he said. And gruesome footage of the beheading of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl by terrorists in Pakistan wasn’t broadcast by mainstream news outlets. In the absence of photographic confirmation of bin Laden’s death, mainstream media outlets resorted Monday and Tuesday to relatively tame file images of a very live bin Laden: shooting a gun, haranguing Westerners in his infamous video communiques or gazing into the middle distance. In the end, however, Ritchin says it doesn’t really matter how the traditional news media try to handle government-issued photos of bin Laden — they’ll appear someplace, and probably many places, online. “The gatekeepers,” he says, “aren’t keeping the gates anymore.” ||||| Gates, Clinton Advising President to Not Release OBL Photograph; Obama Increasingly Concerned No Good Would Come from It President Obama is increasingly doubtful that there's a compelling reason to release a photograph of Osama bin Laden's corpse, ABC News has learned. There don't seem to be many skeptics of bin Laden's death in the Muslim world, with bin Laden's wife having survived the attack to identify bin Laden's death both to the Navy SEALs and Pakistani authorities. Meanwhile, sources say, Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton are advising the president about concerns at the Pentagon and State Department that releasing a photograph could prompt a backlash against the US for killing bin Laden where one does not seem to currently exist. The internal debate at the White House is then informed by this question: why are we releasing this photograph if no one seems to really doubt his death and releasing it could cause more harm than good? -Jake Tapper |||||Summary:","output":"CIA Director Leon Panetta said he believes a photo of Osama bin Laden's body will be shared, but it's up to the White House to decide.

The second question explicitly mentions attaching the car without having a driver. Here are details on how to attach your car to Ola for both situations: 1. Attaching your car with Ola with a Driver: a. Documentation: Make sure you have the necessary documents ready, such as your driver's license, car registration certificate, car insurance, and any other required documents depending on your region. b. Visit Ola's Partner Website: Visit Ola's official website for partners (https://partners.olacabs.com/) and sign up as an Ola Operator. You will need to provide personal details, as well as the driver's information, if you plan on employing a driver. c. Background Check: Ola will perform a background check on the car owner and the driver (if any) to ensure safety and security for its customers. This may involve checking your driving record, criminal history, and character references. d. Car Inspection: Before onboarding your car, Ola may require a thorough inspection of the vehicle to ensure it meets their quality standards. It is important to ensure that your car is in good condition, clean, and well-maintained. e. Training: Ola may require the driver to attend a training session or pass an assessment to ensure they understand and follow the company's policies. This step may not be necessary if you are using a professional driver who has already gone through the Ola driver training program. f.

After signing the agreement, your account will be activated, and you can start accepting rides. 2. Attaching your car to Ola without having a Driver: Attaching your car to Ola without a driver is not a common practice, as Ola mainly operates as a ridesharing service with drivers provided for the customers. However, it might be possible under certain conditions if you are willing to become the driver yourself, complying with the regulations in your region. In this case, you need to follow similar steps as mentioned above, but you will be both the car owner and the driver. Register as an Operator on the Ola Partner website, provide all the necessary documentation, pass the background check, and fulfill any training requirements for drivers. Please note that the legal regulations for ridesharing services may vary across countries and states. Be sure to look for specific rules and requirements in your location before proceeding.

These results are from Gallup's April 3-6 Economy and Personal Finances poll that asked Americans to choose the best option for long-term investments: real estate, stocks and mutual funds, gold, savings accounts and CDs, or bonds. Prior to 2011, Gallup asked the same question, but did not include gold as an option. Gold was the most popular long-term investment among Americans in 2011 -- a time when gold was at its highest market price and real estate and stock values were lower than they are today. Gold prices dropped significantly after that and it lost favor with Americans. The 24% of Americans who currently name gold as the best long-term investment ties with the 24% who choose stocks. Bonds have been Americans' least favored investment option for as long as Gallup has been asking the question. Savings accounts and CDs, on the other hand, have been more popular in the past. In September 2008, before gold was an option and at a time when the real estate and stock markets were tanking, savings accounts were the most popular long-term investment among Americans. This year, the housing market has been improving across the U.S., and home prices have recently been rising after a steep drop in 2007 during the subprime mortgage crisis. This current improvement in prices may be why more Americans now consider real estate the best option for long-term investments. In 2002, during the real estate boom that preceded the mortgage crisis and before gold was offered as an option in the question, half of Americans said real estate was the best investment choice. Stock values have also been improving in recent years, aided particularly by the bull market in 2013. The 24% of Americans who regard stocks as the best long-term investment is also higher now, up from 19% in 2012. Still, Americans are modestly more likely to say real estate is the better investment today, perhaps because of the recent volatility in the stock market. Lower-Income Americans the Only Subgroup to Favor Gold Lower-income Americans, those living in households with less than 30,000 in annual income, are the most likely of all income groups to say gold is the best long-term investment choice, at 31%. Upper-income Americans are the least likely to name gold, at 18%. Upper-income Americans are much more likely to say real estate and stocks are the best investment, possibly because of their experience with these types of investments. Upper-income Americans are most likely to say they own their home, at 87%, followed by middle (66%) and lower-income Americans (36%). Gallup found that homeowners (33%) are slightly more likely than renters (24%) to say real estate is the best choice for long-term investments. Stock investors are also more likely to favor stocks as the best long-term investment; 34% of them say that stocks are the best option compared with 13% of Americans who don't own stocks. Upper-income Americans are again the most likely to own stocks (82%), followed by middle-(57%) and lower-income Americans (16%). Young Americans Place More Faith in Savings Accounts and CDs Americans between 18 and 29 years old are almost evenly split, with about one-quarter each saying real estate, stocks, gold, and savings accounts are the best choices for long-term investments. However, the 23% who said savings accounts is much higher than the percentage who gave this same answer in older age groups. These differences again could reflect actual home ownership and familiarity with the real estate purchasing process. Less than 30% of Americans between 18 and 29 years own their home, compared with 68% of 30- to 49-year-olds, 73% of 50- to 64-year-olds, and 83% of those aged 65 and older. Younger Americans could favor savings accounts because they've largely become financially independent adults during a time of volatile housing and stock markets. This age group's relative preference to savings accounts is in line with findings from 2013. Implications With housing prices improving across the country, Americans are regaining faith that real estate is the best choice for long-term investments. But home ownership is also associated with views of real estate as an attractive investment opportunity. This leaves groups with lower home ownership rates, like lower-income and younger Americans, still looking elsewhere for investment options. Likewise, stock values have been improving and Americans are more likely now than in recent years to say stocks are the best investment, though more still choose real estate. That could be partly attributable to more Americans owning a home than owning stocks, but could also be related to recent volatility in stocks this year, especially during the time the survey was conducted. Different investment options historically offer different levels of risk and different rewards. Savings accounts and bonds are historically safe, but do not offer as high of returns, and Americans typically don't regard those as the best investments. While stocks can be more volatile, they also can offer huge returns. What Americans view as the best choice for investing reflects myriad factors and is influenced by how the investment is currently performing and respondents' biases toward where they are invested. Survey Methods Results for this Gallup poll are based on telephone interviews conducted April 3-6, 2014, with a random sample of 1,026 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. For results based on the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is ±4 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. Interviews are conducted with respondents on landline telephones and cellular phones, with interviews conducted in Spanish for respondents who are primarily Spanish-speaking. Each sample of national adults includes a minimum quota of 50% cellphone respondents and 50% landline respondents, with additional minimum quotas by time zone within region. Landline and cellular telephone numbers are selected using random-digit-dial methods. Landline respondents are chosen at random within each household on the basis of which member had the most recent birthday. Samples are weighted to correct for unequal selection probability, nonresponse, and double coverage of landline and cell users in the two sampling frames. They are also weighted to match the national demographics of gender, age, race, Hispanic ethnicity, education, region, population density, and phone status (cellphone only/landline only/both, and cellphone mostly). Demographic weighting targets are based on the most recent Current Population Survey figures for the aged 18 and older U.S. population. Phone status targets are based on the most recent National Health Interview Survey. Population density targets are based on the most recent U.S. census. All reported margins of sampling error include the computed design effects for weighting. In addition to sampling error, question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls.

Gallup asked Americans this month to choose the best “long-term investment.” Real estate was the most common pick, ahead of mutual funds, bonds and other options. Similarly, Fannie Mae’s National Housing Survey asked Americans to assess whether various kinds of assets amounted to a “safe investment with a lot of potential.” As has been the case since before the financial crisis, “buying a home” beat out all the alternatives. The fact that Americans still financially fetishize homeownership baffles me. Never mind that so many people lost their shirts (among other possessions) in the recent housing bust. Over an even longer horizon, owning a home has not proved to be a terribly lucrative investment either. Don’t take my word for it; ask Robert Shiller, winner of the 2013 Nobel Prize in economics who previously became a household name for identifying the housing bubble. “People forget that housing deteriorates over time. It goes out of style. There are new innovations that people want, different layouts of rooms,” he told me. “And technological progress keeps bringing the cost of construction down.” Meaning your worn, old-fashioned home is competing with new, relatively inexpensive ones. Over the past century, housing prices have grown at a compound annual rate of just 0.3 percent once one adjusts for inflation, according to my calculations using Shiller’s historical housing data. Over the same period, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index has had comparable annual returns of about 6.5 percent. Yet Americans still think it’s financially savvy to dump all their savings into a single, large, highly illiquid asset. Perhaps Americans just want to invest in something tangible. Real estate is, after all, real: bricks, mortar, wood, tile. Other kinds of assets seem more abstract, almost imaginary, by comparison. You just have to trust your financial adviser, bank or never-ending, entire-rainforest-killing Vanguard mailings that your other investments actually exist. Shiller suspects that selective memory may also play a role. “People remember home prices from long ago better than they remember other prices,” he says. “Ask anybody, ‘What did you pay for your home?,’ and they’ll remember even if it was 50 years ago. It will be some ridiculous number like 30,000. They then compare it to today’s prices, and it makes a big impression, and they forget there has been so much inflation since then.” The tax code, alongside other public policy, forcefully nudges Americans toward investing in housing, too. The biggest bogeyman is the home-mortgage interest deduction. But the government effectively subsidizes home-buying in other ways, including through the Federal Housing Administration, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the fact that we don’t tax imputed rents — the estimated amount homeowners would have to spend to rent an identical property. There are also large psychic benefits to owning a house, which Americans might conflate with financial ones. Survey after survey finds that the vast majority of Americans see homeownership as a preferred lifestyle choice, a crucial part of obtaining the “American Dream ” and a requirement for membership in the middle class. Many families view homeownership as the best way to get their children into the right schools or most stable neighborhoods. Our national cultural reverence for homeownership is decades, if not centuries, old; as Pa Bailey declared in “It’s a Wonderful Life,” there is “a fundamental urge,” something “deep in the race for a man to want his own roof, walls and fireplace.” At least here in the United States, where only a minority of Americans prefers having a landlord and superintendent legally obligated to maintain their buildings and bear the risk if, say, Hurricane Sandy floods the basement. Americans romanticize the idea of owning their own roof, walls and fireplace, and they think they’ll make money off ’em, too. The problem is that, perhaps because of tax incentives and ignorance about the financial returns from real estate investments, Americans are buying more house than they need or, in some cases, derive pleasure from. That incurs maintenance costs for the homeowner, not to mention other kinds of negative externalities for the rest of society (sprawl, traffic and greater carbon emissions) that likely outweigh the individual “psychic benefits” of buying oversize houses. If nothing else, the recent financial crisis should have taught us that it’s not in the country’s best interest to enable every aspiring homeowner to buy. As senators mark up legislation next week that would wind down Fannie and Freddie, expect great hue and cry about whether an overhaul of the mortgage system would make homeownership less affordable. But given the many other subsidies that exist, and Americans’ persistent misperceptions about the financial benefits of buying a house, maybe we can afford to make homeownership slightly less affordable. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Americans are more likely to consider real estate as the best option for long-term investments, according to a Gallup poll. Real estate ranked ahead of gold, stocks, and bonds in the survey conducted in April 2014. Lower-income Americans, those who live in households with an annual income of less than 30,000, mostly favored gold as the best long-term investment. Upper-income Americans prefer real estate and stocks, while younger Americans aged 18-29 are split between real estate, stocks, gold, and savings accounts. Housing prices improvements and homeownership rates influenced these investment preferences."},{"instruction":"D.C. strives to become a tech hub; Capital Bikeshare arrives in Ballston Capital Bikeshare is planning to open a new station in Ballston.

I did open the first envelope. Then I saw the application, all those blank spaces I was supposed to fill with my own writing, spaces for my name and birth date and grade average and ... statement of purpose. I looked at them for a long time. I could write for hours and not fill all those spaces. So I put the application back in the envelope. I would fill it out the next day, when I had time. But another envelope arrived. And then the pile began. The pile scares me -- it is really like a monster. All the while, I feel the weight of a million envelopes raining down on my head until my grandmother calls me and wants to know how I am. \\"I am overcome by too many tasks,\\" I say. \\"Honey, you just take it bit by bit,\\" she says, and she reminds me about the green beans. When I was a little kid I hated green beans. But my mom said I couldn't leave the table until I ate ten green beans. All alone at the table, I stared at the green beans for what seemed like hours. It was a mountain of green beans. I couldn't do it. My grandma came to me and asked if I could eat one green bean. \\"But Grandma, I have to eat ten!\\" She said all I had to do was to eat one green bean. One tiny little green bean. So I ate one. It was bad, but not as bad as I'd thought it would be. Then she asked me again if I could eat one. So I ate one green bean nine more times. My grandma doesn't know about the envelopes, but she tells me anyone can do one thing every day. Back in my room, I lay down on the bed.

The original sentence, \\"Two yellow dogs run together in green grass\\", offers more context and information about the scene than the simplified version, \\"Two dogs run through grass\\". The original statement allows the reader or listener to visualize the scenario more vividly by providing the following information: 1. The color of the dogs: The dogs are specifically described as being yellow in color, which could refer to a variety of breeds, like Labrador Retrievers or Golden Retrievers. Knowing the color of the dogs adds another layer to the imagery and helps the reader or listener create a mental picture. 2. The dogs are running together: This implies that the dogs may be playing, chasing each other, or have synchronized movements. It could also suggest that the dogs are companions or belong to the same owner. This added detail enhances the scene's imagery and adds more context to their actions. 3. The color of the grass: Stating that the grass is green provides information about the setting and the time of year. Green grass typically signifies a well-maintained, healthy lawn or field, and it might be indicative of spring or summer when grass is lush and at its peak. This additional detail helps the reader or listener get a better sense of the environment where the scene takes place. In comparison, the simplified statement \\"Two dogs run through grass\\" still conveys the core idea that there are two dogs running in grass, but it lacks the more specific details about the color of the dogs, their companionship, and the color of the grass. While both sentences communicate the fundamental concept of two dogs running through grass, the original statement offers a richer and more descriptive visual narrative for the reader or listener to experience."},{"instruction":"This is the content of an email: Rick, Attached for your information and input is a copy of a presentation I am putting together for EGM.

Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\\"\\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source...

He didn't look like any doctor I'd ever known. He never yelled at us for playing in his yard. I remember him as someone who was a lot nicer than most of the adults in our community. When Dr. Gibbs wasn't saving lives, he was planting trees. His house sat on ten acres, and his life's goal was to make it a forest. The good doctor had some interesting theories concerning plant care and growth. He never watered his new trees, which flew in the face of conventional wisdom. Once I asked why. He said that watering plants spoiled them so that each successive tree generation would grow weaker and weaker. So you have to make things rough for them and weed out the weaker trees early on. He talked about how watering trees made for shallow roots, and how trees that weren't watered had to grow deep roots in search of moisture. I took him to mean that deep roots were to be treasured. So he never watered his trees. He planted an oak and, instead of watering it every morning, he beat it with a rolled-up newspaper. Smack! Slap! Pow! I asked him why he did that, and he said it was to get the tree's attention. Dr. Gibbs passed away a couple of years after I left home. Every now and again, I walked by his house and looked at the trees that I'd watched him plant some twenty-five years ago. They're extremely tall, big and robust since they have deep roots now. However, the trees in my garden trembled in a cold wind although I had watered them for several years. It seems that adversity and suffering benefit these trees in ways comfort and ease never could. I stood there deep in thought. Every night before I go to bed, I check on my two sons. I stand over them and watch their little bodies, the rising and falling of life within. I often pray for them. Mostly I pray that their lives will be easy. But I think that it's time to change my prayer because now I know my children are going to encounter hardship. Which of the following may be the author's best prayer for his two sons now? A) I wish them strong wings, with which they can fly higher and touch the sky. B) I wish them nice fortune so that they can meet people like Dr. Gibbs in the future. C) I wish them deep roots into the earth since the rains fall and the winds blow often. D) I wish them great shades under the tree since the sunlight is always sharp and bitter. Answer:","output":"Based on the context of the message and the lessons learnt from Dr. Gibbs, the author's best prayer for his two son's would be \\"I wish them deep roots into the earth since the rains fall and the winds blow often.\\" This choice directly resonates with the tale of Dr. Gibbs and his unconventional method of nurturing trees. Dr. Gibbs believed that new trees had to develop deep roots in search of moisture, symbolizing the resolve and inner strength required to face hardships without being cosseted. The author's previous prayers for his children to have easy lives contradicts this ideology, as Dr. Gibbs' theory illustrates forming deep roots (building resilience and tenacity) through overcoming adverse situations, not from comfort and ease. The author recognizes the flaws and consequences of an easy lifestyle as portrayed by his trembling trees that were regularly watered. Hence, drawing a parallel with Dr. Gibb's philosophy, the author wants his children to develop deep roots - resilience, tenacity, and inner strength in adversity. The other options do not bear the symbolism or depth of message contained in Dr. Gibbs' strategy. Wings facilitate flight (option A), representing freedom or evasion but does not reflect the overcoming of hardship. Meeting people like Dr. Gibbs (option B) could indeed be beneficial but the main lesson was from the trees. Shade (option D) implies shelter or protection but does not adequately reflect the concept of growth through adversity. Ultimately, the author's modified prayer for his sons to develop \\"deep roots\\" is central to the transformative narrative of life taught by Dr. Gibbs. Such roots would equip them with the endurance necessary to meet life's challenges head-on and rise above them, becoming their own robust, resilient trees who can brave any storm."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - The passenger arrives early at the airport - The luggage is checked - The passenger waits in line - The passenger shows their identification and gets a boarding pass - The passenger goes to their gate - The passenger gets in line when it's time to board - The person boards the plane - The plane arrives at the destination - The passenger gets off the plane at their destination.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Scarlet and Chad are a young married couple. Financial troubles and the death of their infant son convince them to move to Seattle, in the hopes of starting a new life. During the drive, Chad falls asleep at the wheel and runs off the road, crashing their vehicle. Although the car itself is destroyed the couple is unharmed. They go to a nearby farmhouse and meet the owner, \\"Sam\\" (short for Samael), his wife Lilith, and their deaf handyman helper, Alal. Sam and Lilith let Chad and Scarlet sleep at their house, but during the night Chad and Scarlet are savagely knocked unconscious by Lilith and Sam. Upon waking, Chad and Scarlet discover that Sam and Lilith intend to torture and kill them. They nearly drown Scarlet in a barrel, but after they leave the room Chad resuscitates her, and the couple tries to flee the farmhouse. Chad is caught by Lilith, but wrestles away a shotgun from her and knocks her unconscious. Scarlet, aided by Alal, runs away into a vineyard field, but is eventually caught by Sam, who kills Alal and takes Scarlet back into the house. While Sam goes to look for Chad, Lilith tortures Scarlet by scraping the flesh off her knees with a grater. Chad interrupts the torture session and kills Lilith by stabbing her in the head with a meat thermometer. Chad tries to set Scarlet free, but is unable to do so before Sam gets back. Chad and Sam fight, and Scarlet stabs Sam in the back with a chef's knife, seriously injuring him. The couple flees in Sam's pickup truck, but Sam revives and pursues them; Chad runs Sam over with the truck several times before they drive off. The answer is:","output":"Chad and Scarlet both play significant roles in killing the owner of the house, Sam. The couple finds themselves in a desperate situation when Sam and his wife, Lilith, torture and attempt to kill them. In a climactic confrontation, Chad and Sam engage in a physical fight as Scarlet, severely injured by Lilith, watches from the sidelines. In a moment of bravery and determination, Scarlet takes the chance and stabs Sam in the back with a chef's knife, causing him serious injuries. While it is primarily Scarlet's action that inflicts the critical injury upon Sam, it is important to note that Chad's ongoing efforts to protect his wife and fight against Sam contribute to the eventual outcome. The two of them work together as a team, both taking part in overcoming their captors and surviving the dangerous situation. Afterwards, as the couple flees the scene in Sam's pickup truck, Sam, in a last-ditch attempt at vengeance, somehow revives and pursues them in his injured state. It is at this point that Chad takes decisive action once more, running Sam over with the truck several times to ensure that he does not pose a further threat to them. In conclusion, the owner of the house, Sam, is ultimately killed by the combined efforts of the young married couple, Scarlet and Chad. Although Scarlet delivers the initial serious injury by stabbing Sam in the back with a chef's knife, it is Chad who ensures his demise by repeatedly running him over with their escape vehicle.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"If there is less human interference in the environment, the second effect mentioned - which is the bird collecting bits of sticks and grasses - might be positively influenced. Let's delve deeper into this matter. In a less disturbed environment, it is likely that there would be an increase in the availability of building materials for nests compared to areas with high human activity. Human interference often leads to habitat destruction and loss of trees, which are the primary sources of nesting materials for birds. If there's less human interference, the amount of suitable nesting materials such as sticks and grasses could potentially increase. In this way, the birds will have more options to choose from and will be able to collect higher quality and a greater quantity of sticks and grass for their nest building. This implies that the nests could be more robust and more effectively support the eggs due to the enhanced structural integrity provided by the abundance of these materials. Therefore, there would be a 'more effect' on the solidity of the nest and subsequently the support for the eggs. Moreover, the absence of human disturbance could lead to a decrease in the stress levels in birds. When birds are stressed, they may rush the nest building process and cut corners, leading to nests that are less capable of supporting the eggs. Thus, less human interaction could improve the birds' mental health, leading to more diligently built and therefore sturdier nests. Lastly, by less human interference, more trees would be left standing, providing a wider range of suitable nesting locations. This could enable birds to select the most strategic and secure spots, such as those that are high up and hidden from potential predators. A well-placed nest will protect itself and the eggs from falling and various environmental hazards better, which would also be counted as a 'more effect'. However, it's crucial to note that less human interference doesn't always mean an improved environment or better conditions for wildlife. Other factors could still negatively impact the environment and potentially reduce the support for the eggs, such as natural disasters, disease outbreaks, and shifts in predator-prey dynamics. In conclusion, while many potential benefits can come from less human interference in bird habitats, those benefits are contingent on a range of natural factors remaining favorable. Any significant changes in these parameters may negatively impact bird populations and nesting habits, including how well nests can support eggs."},{"instruction":"Context:I ' m going to be lead girl on one of the new numbers we are working on ( which means I 'll be practicing walking sideways gracefully with one of our new girls . ) Also we got to play with one of our new puppets and we were horribly confused by the drunken look he has . * sniggers * And again refer to icon , because we get to play with new material .

Write down the polynomial equation using the list of weights. Here, with the given weights, the polynomial equation is: 7x^2 + 6x + 5. 3. Substitute the given value of x (in this case, x = 6) into the polynomial equation and calculate the result. Here's how to use these guidelines step-by-step to find the answer: 1. We have x = 6 and equation weights = [7, 6, 5]. 2. The polynomial equation is: 7x^2 + 6x + 5. 3. Now, substitute x = 6 into the equation: 7(6)^2 + 6(6) + 5 = 7(36) + 36 + 5 = 252 + 36 + 5 = 293 So, the result of the polynomial expression with x = 6 and equation weights = [7, 6, 5] is 293."},{"instruction":"Out of boredom, two scientists from the New Contagious Diseases Research Centre devised themselves a new game. One day, as a result of the suspension of a research project dealing with a dynamically mutating vaccine following the pattern of the eyesocket flu bacillus, they had absolutely nothing to do until the end of the day, because the boss didn't order them to wash test-tubes. They decided to play a game of hockey under the microscope. For a puck they used one of the millions of experimental bacillus, and one-arm pincettes, which as it happened also resembled hockey sticks, served as sticks. The bacillus was not happy with it at all. It wanted to rest after an exhausting task involving vaccine discouragement, and these whitecoats here planned to put it to work yet again. And this time the work was much more labor-intensive and even more exhausting than before, but the condition and health of the tired bacillus not as good as in the times of youth, about two hours ago. The scientists got excited. On a microscope slide they etched a hockey rink with laser, agreed on the rules, connected the microscope's camera to the big screen display and played until the morning. They had to change pucks several times, but that was fine, they had millions of them in stock. The next day they didn't have anything to do either and they continued to play. They even invited other colleagues and the popularity of the game was so huge they could afford to play it in a championship system. Soon, the games were joined by the guys from the car-repair garage next door. They were tough opponents and even tougher fans - they took from the lab and carried away with them several flasks and some equipment, as it turned out - to set up their own game station in pit number 5.

During his stage life, he combined the traditions of the past with his own creations, shaping a style of his own and giving birth to \\"The Mei Lanfang School\\". He was also the first artist to introduce Peking Opera to an overseas audience, making it popular to the world. Mei Lanfang began his stage life at the age of 8. His teacher said he showed little hope because of his boring eyes. To improve this, he exercised them day after day. Thanks to his efforts, he managed to change his dull eyes into a pair of bright and expressive eyes and win national fame before the age of 20. In over 50 years on the stage, Mei Lanfang played no less than 100 different characters in the performance. He also wrote many new plays, designing the dances himself. The many dances he created form part of the great treasure that he left to Peking Opera. In 1930, Mei Lanfang started on a successful US tour.

Turenne's 50,000 men set off on 11 May. Arrived at Visé, Louis decided not to lay siege to Maastricht but only to occupy the surrounding forts of Tongeren, Maaseik and Valkenburg so its garrison stayed bottled up. Moving along the Rhine, Rheinberg, Wesel, Burick and Orsoy were taken. Turenne then took Nijmegen , with 4,000 infantry and 400 cavalry, and from there Fort Crèvecœur near 's-Hertogenbosch, which fell after only two days. In view of these defeats, the Dutch public panicked and rioted. Leading politicians Johan and Cornelis de Witt were lynched by an angry Orangist mob, following rumours that they were planning the assassination of William of Nassau . On 4 July, William was acclaimed stadtholder. As the French had promised the major cities of Holland to the English, they were in no hurry to capture them. The French tried to gain sixteen million guilders from the Dutch in exchange for a separate peace. This demand and other conditions posed by the French stiffened Dutch resistance. Negotiations gave the Republic time to finish the inundations along the Dutch Water Line, started on 22 June 1672. Luxembourg laid siege to Groningen but failed to take it.

The sentence has a negative connotation due to the terms used within it. Here is a breakdown of the sentence and its components which contribute to its negative sentiment. 1. \\"has nothing going for it\\" - This phrase implies that the subject being discussed is lacking positive or beneficial qualities. The word \\"nothing\\" is an explicitly negative term, suggesting that there are no redeeming factors about the subject. This contributes significantly to the overall negative sentiment of the sentence. 2. \\"other than\\" - This is a conjunction that connects the preceding negative statement with another point, which is meant to stand in contrast. In this sentence, however, the following point further supports the negativity of the overall sentiment. 3. \\"exploitive\\" - This adjective has a strong negative connotation as it often refers to taking unfair advantage of a situation or people. It suggests that whatever is being discussed is using an unscrupulous approach to achieve its goals or desired outcome. 4. \\"array of obligatory cheap\\" - This phrase implies that the subject being discussed is of poor quality or relies on cheap tactics to attract attention. The word \\"obligatory\\" also adds a sense of the forced nature of these cheap elements. The combination of \\"cheap\\" and \\"obligatory\\" further enhances the negative sentiment in the sentence. In conclusion, due to the combination of these negative terms and their implications, the sentiment of the given sentence can be identified as 'negative'."},{"instruction":"Write a title for this article: Among these is a handful of ladies (and no, copy editors, you may not change “ladies” to “women”) who strive daily to keep Washington’s name and legacy in the dimming lights of history. Unheralded and largely unknown, they deserve recognition for their valiant and extravagant efforts to preserve one of America’s most valuable assets, including the original ruminations of its greatest thinkers. These would be the members of the Mount Vernon Ladies’ Association, who volunteer their time and talents — and open their wallets — to maintain Washington’s home on the Potomac. These efforts have been shepherded the past 30 years by one brave and hearty James Rees (think of having a couple dozen powerful women as your boss), who, like Washington, is also reserved and humble of spirit. To everyone’s dismay, Rees, 60, recently retired as CEO, owing to a debilitating illness that has taken him too soon from his venerable toils. During his 30 years at Mount Vernon, Rees helped lead its transformation from a historic house to a major national attraction, increasing its endowment from just 4 million in 1984 to more than 125 million today, and recently oversaw the groundbreaking for the estate’s newest project — a presidential library that will offer fellowships to scholars in residence as well as safeguard Washington’s books and papers. Latest to the collection is Washington’s original copy of the “Acts of Congress,” a 106-page volume that contains his personal copy of the Constitution, a draft of the Bill of Rights, and other documents pertaining to early acts of the new Congress. Washington’s own handwritten scribbles are penciled in the margins. The Mount Vernon ladies captured the book in a Christie’s bidding war using private funds. Unbeknown to most visitors to Mount Vernon — and certainly the millions who don’t know it exists — Washington’s home was saved and is maintained without a penny of public funds. (Disclosure: I serve on the Mount Vernon advisory board, a collection of private citizens who meet twice a year to offer advice, which the ladies are utterly free to ignore.) The ladies’ association is a lesson in volunteerism worthy of its own chapter. The association was formed in 1853 by South Carolina native Ann Pamela Cunningham, whose mother had noticed a large, dilapidated house perched on a hill along the Potomac River and was outraged to learn it was Washington’s home. Inspired by her mother, Cunningham reached out to Southern women to raise funds to buy the estate and, in 1860, open it to the public, thus beginning a 152-year-old tradition. Since then, more than 80 million have visited the house and grounds, which include an underground museum (so as not to mar the landscape), gardens, a slave burial ground, and the final resting place of George and Martha Washington. Even the opposite shore of the Potomac has been preserved so that visitors can enjoy the same view that Washington did. The Fred W. Smith National Library for the Study of George Washington, named for its most generous donor, is an overdue addition to Washington’s home. In a time of self-reverential politicians and presidential libraries erected as monuments to ego, it is odd, if also characteristic, that the first president had none. Just as he resisted becoming the nation’s first president, feeling himself unworthy, he would have found a library in his honor, indulging today’s vernacular, “over the top.” Washington no doubt would be disappointed by the boastful tenor and dishonest content of today’s political debate, though he was surely familiar with the rowdy passions that drive it. Thanks to the ladies of Mount Vernon — and to the lovely James Rees — Americans can revisit those passions on the very grounds Washington paced, and perhaps find inspiration there to engage in a more civil discourse, surely not the least among Washington’s legacies.

Australia begins to question the value of continuing as an outpost to the British Empire. Since his sister's death years ago, Jack Dickens has raised his niece Sally, aided by his sharp-tongued maid Hannah. Sally's father, Alexander Voysey, abandoned her after her mother's death and took off for the bright lights of the city, ostensibly making a name for himself as a literary critic and writer in London. Jack and Sally have sacrificed their own hopes and dreams to run the farm while Voysey disports himself in the city. Despite the claims of success, Voysey is a self-centered, self-aggrandizing, pompous windbag with no visible means of support beyond leeching off his brother-in-law's labor on the farm.

While in his first year studying at Harvard Medical School, Krauthammer became permanently paralyzed from the neck down after a diving accident, severing the spinal cord at C5. After spending 14 months recovering in a hospital, he returned to medical school, graduating to become a psychiatrist involved in the creation of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders III, and later developing a career as a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer. He was a weekly panelist on PBS news program Inside Washington from 1990 until it ceased production in December 2013. Krauthammer criticized President George W. Bush's nomination of Harriet Miers to succeed Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. He called the nomination of Miers a \\"mistake\\" on several occasions. He noted her lack of constitutional experience as the main obstacle to her nomination. On October 21, 2005, Krauthammer published \\"Miers: The Only Exit Strategy\\", in which he explained that all of Miers's relevant constitutional writings are protected by both attorney-client privilege and executive privilege, which presented a unique face-saving solution to the mistake: \\"Miers withdraws out of respect for both the Senate and the executive's prerogatives.\\" Six days later, Miers withdrew, employing that argument: \\"As I stated in my acceptance remarks in the Oval Office, the strength and independence of our three branches of government are critical to the continued success of this great Nation.

Detectives in Sardinia said they had stumbled across the plot while investigating a group of 30 or so crooks who were involved in drug and arms trafficking on the Italian island but were exploring other cash-making ideas. One was a plan to steal the mortal remains of the racing driver -- who founded the Ferrari Grand Prix motor racing team and prancing horse brand before dying -- and demand money from his family for the body's safe return.

Three florida programs offer assistance in buying food for residents. Figure out which one best suits your needs.","output":"To begin the application process for food stamps in Florida, it is crucial to understand the three primary programs that provide food assistance to residents: The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program, and the Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP). Each program is designed to cater to specific demographics and situations, ensuring that you receive the aid you require based on your unique circumstances. SNAP is the largest food assistance program in Florida and is designed for people with low income, irrespective of their age, to ensure they have access to healthy food options. To find out if you are eligible, you can visit MyFlorida's ACCESS website, where you can find detailed information about income limits, eligibility criteria, and the application process. By using the pre-screening tool available on the website, you can quickly determine your potential eligibility for the program. The WIC program, on the other hand, specifically targets pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, infants, and children up to the age of five who are at nutritional risk. This program provides nutritious foods, education on healthy eating, and referrals to healthcare and other social services. To apply, you should contact your local WIC office, which can be found on the Florida Department of Health's website. There, you will find the necessary eligibility criteria, application forms, and office locations. Lastly, TEFAP is a program that provides food assistance to low-income individuals and households during emergency situations. This program mainly operates through local food banks, pantries, and other non-profit organizations, distributing USDA commodities to those in need. To access TEFAP assistance, you must meet the program's income guidelines and provide identification documents. It is recommended to contact your nearest food bank or pantry for more information on the application process and the resources provided. Once you have determined the best-suited program for your situation, gather the required documents such as identification, proof of residency, income statements, and information about other government benefits you may be receiving. Having these documents on hand will streamline the application process and ensure that you have all the necessary resources to support your claim. In conclusion, applying for food stamps in Florida involves researching and selecting the food assistance program best suited to your needs, determining your eligibility, gathering necessary documentation, and submitting an application. Being aware of your options, adhering to the specific program guidelines, and seeking assistance from local resources will ensure a smooth and successful application process."},{"instruction":"What are the factors that affect prices of gold and silver in the commodity market? What does it have to do with the depreciation or appreciation of the rupee? Commodities: What factors affect the price of copper? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"These two questions are related but explore different aspects of the commodity market. The first question focuses on the factors that affect the prices of gold and silver and how these fluctuations relate to the depreciation or appreciation of the rupee. The second question is concerned with the factors affecting the price of copper. Although both questions examine factors influencing the prices of different commodities, they're asking for information on distinct elements within the market. Here, I'll provide a detailed explanation to answer both questions. 1. Factors affecting the prices of gold and silver: a) Supply and demand: As with any commodity, the dynamics of supply and demand play a crucial role in determining the price of gold and silver. When demand for these metals is high and supply is low, prices generally rise. Conversely, when demand is low, and supply is high, prices typically fall. b) Inflation: Gold and silver are often considered hedges against inflation. As inflation increases, the value of money declines, leading people to invest in gold and silver to preserve their wealth. This, in turn, increases demand and drives up the prices of these metals. c) Interest rates: Changes in interest rates affect the price of gold and silver because these metals often compete with interest-bearing assets for investor attention. When interest rates rise, investors tend to prefer interest-bearing assets, causing a decrease in demand for gold and silver, which ultimately lowers their prices. d) Global economic conditions: Events that impact the global economy, such as political instability, trade wars, and financial crises, can cause investors to seek safe-haven assets like gold and silver. These events often lead to increased demand for gold and silver, pushing their prices higher. e) Currency strength: The strength of a currency, particularly the US dollar, can influence gold and silver prices. When the US dollar is weak, gold and silver prices usually rise, since it takes more dollars to purchase these metals. Conversely, when the dollar is strong, gold and silver prices generally decline. 2. Relationship between gold/silver prices and the depreciation or appreciation of the rupee: When the Indian rupee depreciates (falls in value) against the US dollar, it increases the cost of importing gold and silver since it takes more rupees to purchase the same amount of these metals in dollars. This raises the domestic prices of gold and silver in India. Conversely, when the rupee appreciates (gains value) against the dollar, it takes fewer rupees to purchase gold and silver, resulting in lower domestic prices. 3. Factors affecting the price of copper: a) Industrial demand: Copper is widely used in industries like construction, electronics, and power generation, making demand for copper highly dependent on overall economic activity. An increase in manufacturing and construction typically drives up copper prices, while an economic slowdown reduces demand and causes prices to decline. b) Global economic conditions: As with gold and silver, the global economy plays a significant role in determining the price of copper. Trade policies, geopolitical tensions, and economic crises can impact both the supply and demand for copper, influencing its price. c) Mining and production: Changes in copper production, driven by factors like labor disputes, environmental regulations, and technological advancements, can significantly impact the supply of copper. A decrease in production generally leads to higher prices, while an increase can cause prices to fall. d) Inventory levels: The levels of copper inventories held by major exchanges, such as the London Metal Exchange (LME), provide an indication of the current balance between supply and demand. Low inventory levels typically signal strong demand and push copper prices higher, while high inventory levels suggest weak demand and contribute to lower prices. e) Currency strength: As with gold and silver, the strength of the US dollar affects copper prices as well. A stronger dollar makes it more expensive for holders of other currencies to buy copper, putting downward pressure on prices, while a weaker dollar can stimulate demand and lead to higher prices. In conclusion, while both questions inquire about factors influencing the prices of commodities, they are not inquiring about the same information. The first question delves into gold and silver prices and their relation to the rupee's value, while the second question focuses on factors affecting the price of copper. The information is related but corresponds to different aspects of the commodity market."},{"instruction":"What is the solution?

J. Paul Getty originally acquired this particular sculpture in 1973, but it has been off view for many years. The recent reinstallation of the Getty Museum’s antiquities collection at the Villa provided the opportunity to resurrect many such objects from storage and put them on display. Bringing this strange object back to the public eye enabled us to ask—and answer—several questions about it. Who—if anyone—does it represent? When was it carved? Where was it made, and how did it end up in Los Angeles? In preparation for its display, we researched and reinterpreted the object, exploring both its ancient function and modern history. In its new display, this object is fittingly surrounded by other examples of late Roman sculpture from the third and fourth centuries. Its inclusion in this gallery was not always a given, however, as the figure was long misidentified as a portrait of young Caracalla, who at ten years old became joint emperor with his father in A.D. 198.(1) But recent scholarship questioned the Caracalla identification and the object’s date, suggesting it was carved at least a hundred years later.(2) In light of this research, curator Jens Daehner pushed to reexamine the sculpture and consider including it in the reinstallation. In early 2015, the Antiquities Department brought this tondo and many other potential objects for the new galleries out of storage for viewing, providing curators, conservators, mount makers, preps, and registrars a chance to approve and prepare artworks for possible display. After the storage viewing and subsequent research, we updated the object record to conform with what scholars had suggested: this is not a second-century portrait of Caracalla but a fourth-century bust of a youth or divinity. To answer our next question of who the tondo represents, we then had to take a... Where was the marble portrait first displayed? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - In second-century Rome - With second-century Roman artwork - In A.D. 198 - not enough information A:","output":"The correct answer is: not enough information.

Described as \\"the consummate DIY writer and producer\\", Kurstin has been associated with releases which have cumulatively sold more than 60 million albums worldwide. He has won five Grammy Awards, including Producer of the Year (Non-Classical) in 2017 and 2018. Kurstin co-wrote, produced and played most of the instruments on the record-breaking 2015 Adele single, \\"Hello\\". Context: In 2004, Kurstin was introduced to singer Inara George by a mutual friend, Mike Andrews. Then producing George's solo debut, Andrews hired Kurstin as a pianist for the album. Kurstin and George clicked musically in the studio and together they formed The Bird and the Bee (stylized as \\"the bird and the bee\\"). Shortly thereafter, they were signed by Blue Note Records chairman Bruce Lundvall. Described by Entertainment Weekly as \\"space-age pop that cunningly combines bossa nova languidity with Beach Boys-style lushness\\", they have since released four albums and an EP. Kurstin was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album for the Bird and the Bee's 2015 release, Recreational Love. After working on tracks with artists including Peaches, All Saints, Pink, the Flaming Lips, and Kylie Minogue, Kurstin was introduced to Lily Allen. Along with other musicians, co-writers, producers and engineers, he worked on her 2006 debut, Alright, Still, which went on to achieve platinum status. For her second album It's Not Me, It's You, Allen worked exclusively with Kurstin; he co-wrote every song and played all of the instruments on the record, which he also engineered and produced. The album's first single, \\"The Fear\\", spent four weeks at number 1 in the UK, and the album hit number 5 in the US and charted in the top 10 in eight other countries. With Allen, Kurstin won three Ivor Novello Awards for his work on the double-platinum It's Not Me, It's You. Based in part on the album's success, as well as his work on a bird and the bee record, Kurstin was nominated for his first Producer of the Year Grammy in 2010. Kurstin's first commercially available collaboration with Sia was \\"Death by Chocolate\\", released on her 2008 album Some People Have Real Problems. In 2010, he produced Sia's fifth album, We Are Born. It reached number 2 in Australia and number 37 in the US. It won ARIA Music Awards for Best Pop Album and Best Independent Release.

How to troubleshoot an amp To make sure the amp is really the problem, look to the side. All amps have a green power led light and a red protect led light. If both the green or red light are not on, then continue to the next steps. Answer:","output":"Troubleshooting an amp can be a daunting task, particularly for someone who is not familiar with audio equipment. However, the following step-by-step process should help you diagnose and fix most amp-related issues. Step 1: Ensure Proper Power Connection First and foremost, make sure that the power is connected securely to the battery and connected properly to the 12V terminal on the amp. The REM wire, which is usually blue, should be connected to the remote terminal on the amp. This wire tells the amp that the radio is on, and it is time to power up as well. Step 2: Verify the LED Lights Once the amp is properly connected to the power source, the LED lights will indicate whether your amp is functioning correctly. Ideally, the green power LED light should be on, indicating that the amp is receiving power. If the red protect LED light is on, it means your amp is in protect mode, which can be triggered by several issues such as overheating, short circuits, or internal component failure. Step 3: Identify the Source of the Problem If the red protect light is on, disconnect the speaker wires and RCA cables from the amp. Switch off the vehicle, wait for a few minutes, and then turn the vehicle back on. If the red light turns off and the green light comes back on, the issue might be with your speakers or RCA cables. On the other hand, if the red protect light stays on, there could be an internal problem with the amp itself. Step 4: Inspect the Speaker Wiring and RCA Cables Inspect the speaker wiring for any visible damage or exposed wires that can cause a short circuit. Similarly, check the RCA cables for any visible damage or loose connections. If you find any issues with the wiring or cables, replace them with new ones and check if the amp starts working correctly. Step 5: Test the Speakers Disconnect the speaker wires from the amp and connect them to another working amp. If the speakers work fine with a different amp, it is likely that the issue is with your original amp. If the speakers do not work with the other amp, there could be a problem with the speakers themselves, and you should consider replacing them. Step 6: Consult a Professional If all the above steps fail to resolve the issue and the red protect light remains on, it is time to consult a professional audio technician. They can test the internal components of the amp and determine the exact issue, possibly repairing or replacing parts as necessary. In conclusion, troubleshooting an amp requires a systematic approach involving examining the power connection, LED lights, speakers, and wiring. By following these steps, you are more likely to isolate and resolve any issues affecting your amp's performance. However, if you are unable to fix the problem yourself, seeking professional help can save time and ensure that your amp is functioning correctly, providing you with a high-quality audio experience."},{"instruction":"If This approach reduced the amount of risk in the development of each increment, facilitating greater success in meeting cost, schedule, and performance requirements., can we conclude that \\"This made it 40% more successful to stay on budget.\\"?","output":"Well kiddo, imagine you are building a big tower of blocks.

It looks, feels and weighs like your typical leather purse. That's where similarities end: This bag can wirelessly keep track of your belongings and remind you, just as you're about to leave the house, to take your wallet. It can review the weather report and suggest that you grab an umbrella. This purse can even upload your favorite songs onto your scarf. Sure, a computing purse and scarf set may seem like the stuff of science fiction. But these devices, part of next generation of wearable computers, could become commonplace within a few years. DuPont created new super strong fibers that can conduct electricity and can be woven into ordinary-looking clothes. And the chipmaker developed chip packaging allowing wearable computers to be washed, even in the heavy-duty cycle. As a result, these new wearable devices are different from the heavy and downright silly versions of the recent past, which often required users to be wrapped in wires and type on their stomachs. Unlike their predecessors, these new wearable computers also make economic sense. When her bag becomes commercially available in two to three years, Nanda expects it will cost around 150, which is the price of an average leather purse. Here's how the bag works: You place a special radio-signal-transmitting chip on to your wallet. A similar radio in your purse picks up the signal and notifies you that you've forgotten to take your wallet. In turn, sensors on your purse's handles will notify the computer that you've picked up the purse and are ready to go. _ Indeed, more people will want to cross that bridge in the coming years -- making for a booming market for wearable computers that don't like something out of science fiction.

Options: - capital city - new york - toronto - london - big city The answer is \\"new york\\" because A:","output":"New York City is often depicted in movies as the quintessential location for subway stations. There are several reasons behind this choice by filmmakers and storytellers, and these reasons contribute to the portrayal of New York's subway system as an iconic, bustling network of underground transportation that captures the imagination and drama of urban life. 1. Historical Context: The first successful subway system in the United States was established in New York City in 1904. The Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) constructed the initial subway line, which spanned from City Hall to Harlem. As the first and oldest in the U.S., New York's subway system holds historical significance and has played a massive role in shaping the city. 2. Iconic Infrastructure: New York City's subway system is one of the most extensive and complex public transportation systems in the world. With 472 stations, 27 subway lines, and over 665 miles of tracks, it creates a memorable visual representation in movies. The stations, signage, and subway cars maintain distinct, recognizable design elements, making them easily identifiable on-screen. 3. Cultural Impact: New York City is a melting pot of cultures, ethnicities, and communities, and the subway system is a microcosm of this diversity. Films often highlight the social interactions and emotional connections between people from vastly different backgrounds who, when brought together on the subway, reflect the broader experience of life in NYC. This cultural significance adds depth and dimension to a story that no other city can deliver in quite the same way. 4. Urban Legacy: New York City has a long-standing reputation as a global epicenter for art, fashion, finance, and media. Depicting a subway station in New York adds to the film's connection with this influential urban environment. 5. Filmmaking Hub: New York City is home to many movie production studios and offers a variety of financial incentives for filmmakers. This makes it an attractive location for filming, especially when the plot is centered around an urban setting. Given the proximity of resources, it's a cost-effective decision to shoot scenes in New York's subway stations. In summary, the answer \\"New York\\" is justified by the historical and cultural significance of the city's subway system, its iconic infrastructure, its importance in the global urban landscape, and the practical aspects of filming in the city. Altogether, these factors contribute to making New York City subway stations the most depicted and preferred choice for movies when capturing the essence of urban life and its challenges."},{"instruction":"In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank, four options (associated with \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\", \\"D\\") and the answer to that question.

The arrival of the Manchester Ship Canal in 1894, and the subsequent development of the Trafford Park industrial estate in the north of the town – the first planned industrial estate in the world – had a substantial effect on Stretford's growth. The population in 1891 was 21,751, but by 1901 it had increased by 40% to 30,436 as people were drawn to the town by the promise of work in the new industries at Trafford Park.During the Second World War Trafford Park was largely turned over to the production of matériel, including the Avro Manchester heavy bomber, and the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines used to power both the Spitfire and the Lancaster. That resulted in Stretford being the target for heavy bombing, particularly during the Manchester Blitz of 1940. On the nights of 22/23 and 23/24 December 1940 alone, 124 incendiaries and 120 high-explosive bombs fell on the town, killing 73 people and injuring many more. Among the buildings damaged or destroyed during the war were Manchester United's Old Trafford football ground, All Saints' Church, St Hilda's Church, and the children's library in King Street. Smoke generators were set up in the north of the town close to Trafford Park in an effort to hide it from enemy aircraft, and 11,900 children were evacuated to safer areas in Lancashire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, and Staffordshire, along with their teachers and supervisors. A memorial to those residents who lost their lives in the bombing was erected in Stretford Cemetery in 1948, over the communal grave of the 17 unidentified people who were killed in the blitz of December 1940.Between 1972 and 1975, what is now a closed B&Q store in Great Stone Road was the 3,000-capacity Hardrock Theatre and Village Discothèque, hosting some of that period's major artists in their prime. Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, Bob Marley, Elton John, Hawkwind, Yes, Chaka Khan, Curved Air and Lou Reed were amongst those who appeared.

Question 2: A circle is circumscribed around a square.The area of one of the four shaded portions is equal to 4/7. What is the radius of the circle? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Let's analyze each question separately and then determine whether the answers would be the same or not. Question 1: If the radius of a circle is increased by 50%, the circumference increased by what percent? For any circle, the circumference (C) is given by the formula: C = 2 * π * r where r is the radius of the circle. Now, let's consider that the initial radius of the circle is r1. When the radius is increased by 50%, the new radius (r2) becomes: r2 = r1 * (1 + 50/100) = 1.5 * r1 Now, we need to find the circumference of the circle with the new radius: C1 = 2 * π * r1 (Initial circumference) C2 = 2 * π * r2 (New circumference) Let's substitute r2 with its value (1.5 * r1): C2 = 2 * π * (1.5 * r1) = 3 * π * r1 Now, let's find the percentage increase in the circumference: Percentage increase = [(C2 - C1) / C1] * 100 Substitute the values of C1 and C2: Percentage increase = [((3 * π * r1) - (2 * π * r1)) / (2 * π * r1)] * 100 Percentage increase = [(π * r1) / (2 * π * r1)] * 100 Simplify: Percentage increase = (1/2) * 100 = 50% So, the circumference increases by 50% when the radius is increased by 50%. Question 2: A circle is circumscribed around a square. The area of one of the four shaded portions is equal to 4/7. What is the radius of the circle? First, let's draw a circle circumscribed around a square. The area of one of the four shaded portions is equal to 4/7 of the total area of the square. Let's denote the side length of the square as 's' and the radius of the circle as 'r'. Since the circle is circumscribed around the square, the diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle. By using the Pythagorean theorem for a right-angled triangle: (side of square)² + (side of square)² = (diagonal of square)² s² + s² = (2r)² Solve for 's': 2s² = 4r² s² = 2r² Now, let's find the area of the square: Area of square = s² = 2r² The area of one of the four shaded portions is 4/7 of the total area of the square. So, we can create the following equation: (4/7) * (Area of square) = Area of one shaded portion Substitute the area of the square with its value in terms of 'r': (4/7) * (2r²) = Area of one shaded portion Now, we are given that Area of one shaded portion = 4/7: (4/7) * (2r²) = 4/7 To solve for 'r', we can cross-multiply and then simplify the equation: (4/7) * (2r²) = 4/7 4 * 2r² = 4 * 7 8r² = 28 r² = 28/8 r² = 3.5 Now, take the square root of both sides: r = sqrt(3.5) r ≈ 1.87 So, the radius of the circle is approximately 1.87 units. Comparison of the answers: The answer to Question 1 is 50%, which represents the percentage increase in the circumference when the radius is increased by 50%. The answer to Question 2 is approximately 1.87 units, which represents the radius of the circle when it is circumscribed around a square with an area of one of the four shaded portions equal to 4/7. Therefore, the answers to these two questions are not the same, as they represent different quantities and concepts in the problems."},{"instruction":"How is \\"Retail and Consumer product goods (CPG) sectors concentrate on total delivered cost and in-store stock-outs ratios.\\" said in French?","output":"\\"Les secteurs du commerce de détail et des biens de consommation courante (CPG) se concentrent sur le coût total livré et les ratios de rupture de stock en magasin.\\" In this translated sentence, Retail and Consumer Product Goods (CPG) sector focuses on the total delivered cost and the ratios of in-store stock-outs.

(Associated Press) Activists say Syrian rebels have captured an oil pumping station in the north of the country after days of fighting. The Local Coordination Committees and the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights say the rebels captured the station in the province of Raqqa on Sunday. Rami Abdul-Rahman, who heads the Observatory, said the station receives crude oil from the nearby province of Hassakha then pumps it to the central region of Homs, home to one of Syria's two oil refineries. Rebels have captured in the past months several oil fields in the eastern province of Deir el-Zour that borders Iraq. The Observatory said the rebels also captured a military post that used to protect the station. Syria's conflict which began in March last year has killed more than 40,000 people. ||||| AFP - Syrian troops bombarded rebel bastions near the capital on Sunday a day after at least 32 civilians including 11 children were killed by air strikes and artillery fire in the Damascus area, a watchdog said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that the children and two women were among the victims of bombardments focused on southwest and northeast Damascus suburbs and outlying towns on Saturday. Overnight, regime forces battled rebels in the opposition stronghold of Harasta northeast of Damascus and bombarded the town of Moadamiyet al-Sham to the southwest and Bait Saham near the airport road to the southeast, it said. The Local Coordination Committees, a network of activists on the ground, also reported artillery fire on Sunday on residential neighbourhoods in Moadamiyet al-Sham coming from the direction of Mazzeh military airport. In the southern province of Daraa, considered the cradle of the rebellion, troops and rebels clashed in the town of Sheikh Maskeen and battled for control of several small border crossings on the regime-controlled border with Jordan. Syria and Jordan share a 370-kilometre-long (230-mile) border which hundreds of people cross on foot every day to escape the bloody civil war which the Britain-based Observatory says has killed at least 45,000 people. Two rebels were also reported killed in clashes with troops in the central province of Hama, where a series of blasts also rocked the provincial capital. In neighbouring Homs province, the army pounded the rebel-controlled area around the Crac des Chevaliers crusader castle, a UNESCO-listed world heritage site. Dozens of casualties were also reported in Homs city after a fierce regime assault ended in the army seizing the Deir Baalbeh district on Saturday, according to the Observatory. The watchdog, which gathers its information from a network of activists and medics in civilian and military hospitals, said the final death toll had not yet been documented because of communications difficulties in the area. One video released by the Syrian Revolution General Commission showed the bodies of nine male victims from Deir Baalbeh lying on the ground, their faces bloody and mutilated. Its authenticity could not be immediately verified. ||||| MOSCOW/AZAZ, Syria (Reuters) - The international mediator touting a peace plan for Syria warned on Saturday of \\"hell\\" if the warring sides shun talks, and Moscow accused enemies of President Bashar al-Assad of blocking negotiations. U.N.-Arab League envoy Lakhdar Brahimi said in Moscow that responsible people inside and outside Syria should \\"help the Syrians stop their descent into more and more bloodshed, into more and more chaos and perhaps a failed state\\". Efforts to find a negotiated solution to a 21-month-old war that has killed some 45,000 people have floundered, with the opposition, buoyed by rebel military advances, demanding that Assad be excluded from power before any talks can proceed. In a sign that the war may not quickly be won, government forces - in retreat for much of the past few months - scored a victory in the strategically important central city of Homs, where they pushed rebels from a district after days of fighting. But in the north, Syria's national airline had to cancel a flight from Cairo to Aleppo, according to Egyptian airline officials, due to insecurity at an airport that rebels have declared as a target and where explosions were heard overnight. Brahimi spent five days in Damascus this week as part of a push to promote a months-old peace plan that calls for a transitional government, without specifying Assad's role. \\"If the only alternative is really hell or a political process, then all of us must work ceaselessly for a political process,\\" Brahimi said in Moscow. \\"It is difficult, it is very complicated, but there is no other choice.\\" Western and some Arab states that back the revolt are hoping that Russia, Assad's main international protector and arms supplier, will drop its support. \\"WRONG, COUNTERPRODUCTIVE\\" They have been searching for signs that Moscow, an ally of Syria since Assad's father seized power 42 years ago, is changing its stance - so far mostly in vain. After meeting Brahimi, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov firmly repeated Moscow's position that Assad's removal cannot be a precondition for negotiations, calling the Syrian opposition's refusal to talk to Damascus a \\"dead end\\". \\"When the opposition says only Assad's exit will allow it to begin a dialogue about the future of its own country, we think this is wrong, we think this is rather counterproductive,\\" he said. \\"The costs of this precondition are more and more lives of Syrian citizens.\\" Having seized much of northern and eastern Syria over the last six months, Assad's opponents seem even less likely to accept talks with the government now than when the Geneva agreement first flopped in June. Rebels say they expect to win the war on the ground. But if both sides intend to fight to the bitter end, the longest and deadliest war to have emerged from last year's Arab revolts may have a long time left to run its course. Despite its setbacks, the government still has the bigger arsenal and a potent air force. It controls most of the densely populated southwest of Syria, the Mediterranean coast, most of the main north-south highway and military bases countrywide. In Azaz, a rebel-held town in the north, Abu Badri, 38, surveyed the damage of his home two hours after it was destroyed in an airstrike. He said four children and an elderly man were among the dead. Relatives trying to salvage what they could carried out drinking glasses, a fridge and an oven. \\"We'll have to find a tent to stay in near the border with Turkey. What else can we do?\\" he said. At least six houses were destroyed by two bombs on the town, which was just beginning to recover from earlier bombardment by Assad's forces. Eleven people were killed according to local activist Abu Zaid, who saw new graves dug in the cemetery nearby. Blood was spattered on the bricks that littered the area. A child's teddy bear lay in the wreckage. A bulldozer cleared the heavy rubble while young boys dug through the debris with their hands, hoping to find people still alive. In the central city of Homs, government forces pushed insurgents from the Deir Ba'alba district after several days of fierce fighting, opposition activists said. Homs controls the strategically vital highway linking Damascus to the Alawite heartland on the coast. There were unconfirmed reports dozens of rebel fighters had been killed, said Rami Abdelrahman, head of the British-based, pro-opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group. WEST SEEKS RUSSIAN CHANGE OF HEART The United States and its allies hope a change of heart in Moscow could prod Assad to yield power, much as Russia's withdrawal of support for Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic heralded his downfall a decade ago. Lavrov noted that Assad has repeatedly said he would not go, adding that Russia \\"does not have the ability to change this\\". Brahimi's peace plan has stalled on the demand by the opposition that Assad be excluded from any transitional government, a precondition also backed by the United States, European countries and most Arab states. Egypt's President Mohamed Mursi, repeating the most populous Arab country's public support for the rebellion, said there was \\"no place for the current regime in the future of Syria\\". \\"The revolution of the Syrian people, which we support, will go forward, God willing, to realize its goals of freedom.\\" Most Arab states are ruled by Sunni Muslims, who form the majority in Syria and are the foundation of the revolt against Assad, a member of the Shi'ite-linked Alawite minority sect. Brahimi's plan was formally agreed in Geneva in June by world powers, but Washington and Moscow argued from the outset over the core question of whether the plan meant Assad must go. In Damascus, Brahimi advocated a transitional government \\"with all the powers of the state\\", but his wording did not exclude a role for Assad. The envoy's credibility with the rebels appears to have withered. In the rebel-held town of Kafranbel, demonstrators held up banners ridiculing Brahimi with English obscenities. \\"We do not agree at all with Brahimi's initiative. We do not agree with anything Brahimi says,\\" the rebel chief in Aleppo province, Colonel Abdel-Jabbar Oqaidi, said on Friday. Moscow has invited the main opposition leader, Moaz Alkhatib, to visit for talks, but Alkhatib rejected the invitation outright on Friday, instead demanding Lavrov apologize for Russia's support of Assad. He did, however, say he could meet Russian officials in a third country. Brahimi said a political solution had to be based on the Geneva agreement negotiated by his predecessor, Kofi Annan, shortly before Annan quit in frustration at the divisions among veto-wielding powers on the U.N. Security Council. \\"There may be one or two little adjustments to make here and there, but it is a reasonable basis for a political process that will help the Syrian people,\\" Brahimi said of the Geneva plan. Brahimi is to meet senior U.S. and Russian diplomats together in the coming weeks. Two such meetings this month produced no signs of a breakthrough.

Syrian rebels have reportedly captured an oil pumping station in the northern part of the country after days of clashes. This station is vital as it receives crude oil from the nearby province of Hassakha and transports it to Homs, the location of one of Syria's two oil refineries. Previous months saw the rebels gaining control of several oil fields in the eastern province of Deir el-Zour, which borders Iraq. A military post which provided protection to the station was also seized by the rebels. Such conflicts have led to the death of over 40,000 people in Syria. Heavy bombardment in Damascus resulted in causalities including 11 children. Reports depict that it was an intense battle between the regime forces and the rebels. In the southern province of Daraa, where the rebellion initiated, troops and rebels clashed for control over several small border crossings at the Jordan border, used commonly by people trying to escape the war. The violence has also spread to the central province of Hama. In the neighboring Homs province, the army pounded the rebel-controlled area around the UNESCO listed world heritage site, Crac des Chevaliers crusader castle. Many casualties were reported in Homs city, after a severe regime assault led to the army capturing the Deir Baalbeh district. The UN-Arab League envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, warned of further chaos and bloodshed if no talks are initiated and the fighting continues. With 45,000 lives already lost, efforts to find a peaceful solution to the war have stalled. Rebels' advancement in military operation has led them to demand President Bashar al-Assad's exclusion from power before engaging in any conversations. Meanwhile, government forces have managed some victories such as in Homs, but have faced setbacks in Aleppo due to insecurity. Brahimi emphasized the necessity of a political process as the alternative is further descent into chaos and potentially turning Syria into a failed state. Russia has repeatedly maintained its stance that Assad's removal can't be a precondition for negotiations, identifying the stance as a \\"dead end\\". The dispute between world powers continues, as U.S and its allies hope for a change of heart in Russia while Russia maintains that it doesn't have the ability to change its position. The opposition has also rejected Brahimi's peace plan and Brahimi's credibility appears to have deteriorated with the rebels. In conclusion, the Syrian conflict has reached standstill with no signs of a breakthrough despite multiple diplomatic efforts. While the rebels continue to capture strategic assets and demand for President Assad's exclusion from power, the government forces are fighting to regain control, leading to a catastrophic humanitarian crisis."},{"instruction":"Here is a dialogue: Johnson: Sorry I couldn't pick up, I was driving.
